<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. J. LE ROUX (Hercules)</person>:</from>

<p>When the debate was adjourned last night, I was discussing the labour policy of the National Party. I said, amongst other things, that the National Party had not yet deviated one inch from its policy of controlled employment of non-Whites in consultation with the various trade unions. However, there is one last matter I should like to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister. It was with great joy that we took cognizance of the honourable agreement between the Post Office and the staff association concerned in regard to the permanent appointment of non-Whites as postmen. Sir, it is with the greatest measure of appreciation that we take cognizance of the faithful work done by the White postmen in the past. They were faithful and loyal and, what is more, patriotic. Even in inclement weather these White postmen justified themselves and served the purpose for which they were appointed. Now we should like to see these White postmen, and also the staff association representing these White postmen, feeling happy and content with this labour arrangement. Sir, since it is of so much public importance that people should know how this labour arrangement came into being and precisely what it envisages, we would appreciate it if the hon. the Minister would inform us as fully as possible on this matter. I trust that everybody&#x2014;and more in particular, the White workers who made major sacrifices for the Post Office, in whose service they were employed&#x2014;will be satisfied with this arrangement.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>I think I should reply at this stage to the representations and the contributions made during the Committee <span class="col_4055-4056" refersTo="page_0490"/>Stage up to now. I shall therefore start with the hon. member for Orange Grove, who asked, amongst other things, that the Post Office should get its own service Act and pleaded for this matter to be expedited. I can give the hon. member the assurance that I have done everything that had to be done in this regard. The Bill has already been drafted; it has already been checked by the law advisers and the Bill is therefore ready for introduction during this Session of Parliament. I hope to introduce it during this Session of Parliament, and with the co-operation of the Opposition it ought therefore to be passed during this Session of Parliament. Then the hon. member also referred to the question of switching apparatus.</p>

<p>&#x2020;As a matter of fact, Sir, quite a few hon. members on the other side referred to the question of switching systems. The hon. member for Orange Grove spoke of the grid system, and the hon. member for Benoni spoke about the cross-bar switch system. There are different systems, of course.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I referred to the latter system.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>In any case, the technical staff of the department are quite aware of the different systems, and I can give the hon. member the assurance that they will consider all the different systems. We have to take our own staff into consideration; we cannot expect them to concentrate on a variety of systems if the same service can be rendered by adopting one or two systems. In any case, we will take note of these suggestions and see what can be done about them.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Mossel Bay, with his interest in philately, once again made a contribution in that regard. I am most grateful to the hon. member for his interest in philately. I think that to any country this is not only an important source of revenue, but also a source of advertising which one can radiate to countries abroad. The hon. member&#x2019;s plea was that we should be conservative in regard to the issue of postage stamps, i.e. that we should not issue too many of them, as was being done by certain smaller states in Africa and elsewhere, otherwise nobody would after a while attach any importance to the issues of such a country. I want to give the assurance that we in South Africa shall rather be on the conservative side and see to it that we shall rather have fewer issues than is perhaps the case with certain other countries. The hon. member asked specific questions in regard to the issue of regional stamps, such as those for the Bantu homelands, and he asked for more information in that regard.</p>

<p>As far as that matter is concerned, the intention is that we shall issue stamps for the homelands at intervals of four years. Those stamps that will be issued for the homelands, will be valid in the rest of the Republic as well. They will bear the letters &#x201C;RSA&#x201D;, which stand for the Republic of South Africa, and then they will also bear the identity marks of the homeland concerned in order that attention may also be focussed properly on those homeland people in that way. Those stamps will therefore be valid in the homeland as well as in the rest of South Africa, but they will only be sold in that homeland. As I have said, they will be issued at intervals of four years, and inquiries have already been made with the respective homelands in this regard. I may just mention that we have already received back proposals in this connection from the Ciskei, from the Okavango and the Owambo, and we propose to make a start with this matter one of these days, when these proposals will be submitted to me and we shall be able to give further consideration to them. Therefore I want to give the assurance that we shall proceed with this matter, and that these homelands are most delighted with this development.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Constantia gave much thought and study to the aspect of finance and I would like to pay my tribute to him and to say that I really appreciate the contribution he has made to this debate. I think the hon. member would agree with me that a portion of the funds for capital development must of necessity come from our own sources. This is the practice all over the world, and, of course, also the practice in the private sector. The question is only what percentage must come from your own sources. That is a point which has been thoroughly thrashed out by the Franzsen Commission and the Franzsen Committee. As far as the latter is concerned, the hon. member is aware of the fact that one of our prominent industrialists served on that Franzsen Committee and they came forward with a recommendation <span class="col_4057-4058" refersTo="page_0491"/>that it should be 50 per cent. Of course it will vary from time to time. There may be years when it may be less than 50 per cent and sometimes in excess of 50 per cent, but 50 per cent will be our target which we have in mind as far as this self-financing is concerned. As I have said in the previous stages of the debate, as far as other countries are concerned, they follow this policy too. I may merely quote for record purposes that as far as the self-financing is concerned, the percentage in Britain is 57 per cent, in Australia it is 54 per cent, in Holland 54 per cent, in Japan 52 per cent and in Sweden 98 per cent. This sounds exceedingly high. What is significant about Sweden is that this country, which has the highest self-financing out of its own sources, is also the country with the lowest tariff structure in the world. As far as the private undertakings are concerned, I can quote the Bell system in America, which, as you will know, is a private company. This Bell system finances its capital requirements for telecommunication undertakings from generated funds to the extent of 46 per cent. Those are the latest figures we have of the Bell system. So I think that in following these guide-lines recommended by the Franzsen Committee we are really on very sound economic and financial grounds, and we will continue along those lines.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Kempton Park put a number of questions to me, but last night he apologized for the fact that he would not be able to be present here today as he had to meet a commitment somewhere else. I shall nevertheless reply to the matters he raised. The hon. member expressed his appreciation for the fact that, in spite of the curtailment in respect of the construction of post office buildings, we nevertheless proceeded with the erection of a post office of approximately R1 million in Kempton Park. That is, of course, one of the most intensively developed spots in our entire country, and for that reason we felt that that project had to be proceeded with. The hon. member also pleaded for more call office facilities. In this regard I now want to mention to this hon. member, and also to all of you, the following two aids on which we are working at the moment. The first of them I mentioned the other day in the course of the Additional Appropriation debate. This is the modern type of public telephone mounted on a table. It was shown to the two chairmen of the respective groups, and I think they will agree that this is a most handsome model of a public telephone, which may now be used at hotels and banks, and so forth. We have no fear that money can be embezzled. As you yourself saw, Sir, an arrangement was made for the insertion of the money, and the locked drawer is such that we entertain no fears in that respect. This system, in terms of which people will now have telephones on their counters and under their supervision, ought to result in vandalism being restricted to a minimum and in the possibility of the public actually being provided with a better service, and we shall therefore proceed with it.</p>

<p>The second aid which we now want to start implementing, and which I want to mention today, is to start testing the system of public telephones, which we can, for instance, mount on telephone or electric standards. This is really a small type of telephone booth, with a transparent casing, which people can use as they do an ordinary telephone. It is quite transparent and visible. At the moment experiments are being carried out with it in our workshops. We shall also carry out further experiments in this regard in the near future. The hon. member for Kempton Park, who will read this reply of mine in Hansard, will be able to react to my reply by telling me where in his town, Kempton Park, he thinks there is a need for this new kind of telephone, and this also goes for the other members who are present here. In the near future we shall reach the stage where we shall be able to use call offices of this kind, which we shall mount on telephone and electric standards.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked me a question in regard to the part-time after-hour telephone service, the so-called sundowner service. I may just say that there are approximately 5 000 such services at the moment and that we are proceeding with the provision of such services.</p>

<p>The hon. member for North Rand is not present at the moment, but I shall nevertheless reply to the two matters he raised. In the first place, he referred to the &#x201C;tremendous amount of unnecessary work done in post offices&#x201D;.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Of course, we are continually streamlining our procedures, and we all wish to eliminate unnecessary work. In this age of productivity we cannot waste our time and <span class="col_4059-4060" refersTo="page_0492"/>energy on unproductive work; so we are concentrating on the elimination of any unnecessary procedures in this regard. I can mention that our department has a fully equipped work study team, which perpetually concentrates on this type of thing&#x2014; the elimination of unnecessary and uneconomic methods. So, he can be assured that we are paying attention to this.</p>

<p>*The hon. member also made a very strange, yet very important plea. With further reference to my announcement during the Budget speech to the effect that we also wanted to use more non-Whites on counter duty in White areas where they could serve their own people, the hon. member simply rushed along and referred to the smaller post offices. That brings one to this precipitate manner in which the United Party wants to carry out a labour policy. Now I want to ask the following question very pointedly. At those smaller post offices where, for instance, two ladies are employed, do they want a White lady and a non-White lady or a White lady and a non-White man to work together, behind the same counter, in such small post offices&#x003F; Do they want that&#x003F; Is that what the hon member is advocating now&#x003F; That is the plea that was made to me last night. In order to save on labour&#x2014;for ostensibly we are in such a sorry plight now as far as labour is concerned&#x2014;we are now supposed to use non-Whites. It is this unrealistic approach, these mixed working conditions to which I referred last night while the hon. member did not have the courage &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>That Black peril again.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>He did not have the courage, and now he is running away with Black peril stories. If you want to talk about Black peril, you should speak to your bench-mate, for he is the one who is most articulate in shouting &#x201C;Kaffir&#x201D; while fighting an election campaign in Oudtshoorn. The hon. member should speak to him, for he is an authority in that field. But I doubt whether you yourself are quite a novice in that very same U.P. art. That just goes to show one what an ill-considered business the U.P. policy is. If we were to follow that line of conduct, the result would be a rather scrambled business in our labour world. I want to state very explicitly that this is definitely not the way in which this Government will use non-Whites in our economic life.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hercules raised two important matters. In the first instance, he referred to the development in the Wesmoot areas, which will now come into being as a result of the conversion of the Lady Selbome area into a new residential area. The hon. member wanted to know what we were planning in that regard. I take pleasure in furnishing the hon. member with certain data in this regard. We are planning a large-scale extension of the underground telephone cable network in this area. It is expected that the work will be commenced in February of next year. A new automatic telephone exchange is being established in the vicinity of Mahen, and it is expected to be ready towards the end of 1973. Furthermore, a new automatic telephone exchange is being planned at Hartebeespoort Dam to replace the existing manual exchange there towards the end of 1974. Another extension being planned, is that of the existing Daspoort exchange, which will serve the Hermanusstad, Pretoria Gardens, Claremont, Booysens, Daspoort, Daspoort Estate and Mountain View areas. This exchange will be extended by 1 810 lines, and the new lines are expected to be available during 1975. In the light of these extensions, it would appear that the constituency of the hon. member for Hercules is not being neglected.</p>

<p>The other important matter raised by the hon. member, was the question of the agreement, which has now been entered into with the Postal Association in regard to the permanent appointment of postmen. This is an important matter. The hon. member asked questions about this matter, and I should like to reply to them now. All of us are delighted about these satisfactory arrangements that have now been entered into between the department and the Postal Association, which represents the White postmen. Thanks to the fact that the department and the association understand each other&#x2019;s problems, there is really a very good understanding between the Postal Association and my department. Without exaggerating I may tell hon. members that there is real harmony between the Postal Association and my department. Now, what are the facts of this situation&#x003F; I shall state them briefly. There are more than 3 000 posts for White postmen in the Republic. Of this number 800 are at present being filled by non-Whites on a temporary <span class="col_4061-4062" refersTo="page_0493"/>basis. Some of these posts have been filled by non-Whites for many years. Apart from the 800 who are doing this work in a temporary capacity, there are, approximately, another 1 000 non-White posts, mainly in the Cape Province, which are being filled by Coloureds for the most part. In other words, those Coloureds delivering mail in the Cape Province, are doing this work in a permanent capacity. I do not want there to be any doubts in this regard. I have just seen in one of the press reports that these Coloureds who are now delivering mail here in the Cape Province, are also doing so in a temporary capacity. Back in the days when, along with them, I started working in the Maitland post office at 6 o&#x2019;clock in the morning, i.e. I as a clerk and they as postmen, they were permanent already. At that stage they were on the permanent staff already. In other words, back in those days they already enjoyed the benefits of permanent appointment. They are still enjoying them today, in the form of holiday bonuses, pensions and everything that is coupled with permanent appointment. Therefore, the point at issue here is not these 1 000 Coloureds who have been doing this permanent work in the Cape Province from the earliest times; the point at issue is the other 800.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>They are working in both White and non-White areas.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is correct; they have been delivering mail at White homes from the earliest times. Therefore, the point at issue here is the 800 who are serving in White posts in the rest of the Republic. The point at issue here is those who are still working on a temporary basis. They are the people on whom I had discussions with the Postal Association last year. I said that in my opinion it was morally correct that we should also grant these 800, who have now been serving in these posts for years, the benefits of permanent appointment. Now I am very grateful to be able to join the hon. member for Hercules in saying that a really satisfactory agreement between the department and the Postal Association has been effected. This arrangement will be implemented in such a way that the White postmen will, as far as it is practicable, take care of the more advanced facets of postal delivery&#x2014;such as those of driving vehicles, station supervisory duties, and so forth. Since this matter is of so much public importance, and since the hon. member asked me pointed questions in this regard, I should now like to quote from the letter of the chief secretary of the Postal Association a few of the provisions on the basis of which this agreement was entered into with them. In this letter, from which I am now going to quote, the chief secretary stated <i>inter alia</i> the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That, in as far as it is practicable and without causing any embarrassment whatever to the Whites who are in the service at the moment, there should be uniformity in regard to the provision of posts for postal delivery in the Western Cape and Northern Cape areas. In order to effect this from now on, the posts of White postman (for the delivery of post) may now be converted into posts of Coloured postman at the following offices &#x2026;</block>

<p>It may therefore be concluded from this that the point at issue here, is not merely the question of placing on a permanent basis the 800 who are employed in a temporary capacity at the moment. In terms of this agreement more than this is being done. What is also involved here, is their places of work, in order that there may be compliance with the basic principle advocated by this Government. Consequently they proposed that the posts at the following offices might be converted into posts of Coloured postman :</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) <i>Western Cape</i>: Beaufort West (4), Moorreesburg (2), and Swellendam (2).</li>

<li>(b) <i>Northern Cape</i> : De Aar (3), Kimberley (13), and Vryburg (3).</li>

</ol>

<p>They went on to say the following&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>1. The conversion of the 13 posts at Kimberley is done on the definite understanding that no promotion post for Whites shall be relinquished as a result.</li></ol>

<p>That we accept in full. Then I come to the second provision in this letter. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>2. After the conversion of the said posts, postal deliveries in the Western Cape and Northern Cape areas <span class="col_4063-4064" refersTo="page_0494"/>shall be done exclusively by Coloureds, with the exception of Cape Town Central, Oudtshoorn, George and Knysna. As there are Whites at the former three offices, the Association believes that the two temporary Coloureds at Knysna can also be replaced.</li></ol>

<p>The third provision reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>3. That in the Western Cape and Northern Cape areas, all the posts of postman for station, dock, driving and indoor duties, shall be posts of White postman, unless the Department and the Association mutually agree to other arrangements.</li>

</ol>

<p>This is the protection they ask for their own White postmen. Actually, this is merely the administrative manner in which job reservation is applied by a department. This is nothing but the principle of administrative job reservation which is being applied here. In the fourth place, it is said that the department has undertaken to proceed with the recruitment of Whites for the job of postman, and, as they also state in their letter, the postman today makes a very good living in the Department of Posts. As a result of all these fringe benefits, there is a very good means of livelihood for him today. The Association itself recommends this very highly to prospective postmen. At the moment there are certain offices which will be served exclusively by Coloured postmen, and in spite of these concessions which have been made by the Postal Association in regard to permanent appointments, the Postal Association laid down the following condition, which I also accepted, namely&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To ensure that the number of non-Whites appointed permanently shall not exceed 80 per cent of the number of vacancies for White postman (delivery).</block>

<p>I have complied with this. This is really a very serious attempt which is now being made, in the first place, to protect the White postmen in their sphere of employment, and, in the second place, to concentrate them in places where they will exclusively work together as Whites. Furthermore, this also brings to light once again the difference between this side of the House and that side of the House as far as mixed working conditions are concerned. Here the Government and the Postal Association are upholding the principle that we do not want any mixed working conditions in the same work situation. In this specific case the work situation is that of postal delivery. We do not want Whites and non-Whites to do postal deliveries shoulder to shoulder, at the same place. This is one of the questions to which the United Party is not prepared to answer. I put that question yesterday afternoon.</p>

<p>No, you are supposed to be the shadow Minister. Can you not reply&#x003F; Let me state this clearly now. Surely it is not necessary to be at a loss in regard to such a clear, elementary question&#x003F; This is our policy, and it is implemented in such a way that there will not be any mixed working conditions in the same work situation. Now I want to put a question to that side of the House. Does the United Party also support this principle, i.e. that there should not be any mixed working conditions in the same work situation&#x003F;</p>

<p>You will receive the full answer.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Oh, I shall receive the full answer. Mr. Chairman, it is this attitude of the United Party to try, i.e. to evade everything, to evade every thorny matter, which has led to our being firmly convinced that the United Party&#x2019;s policy merely implies that the flood-gates will be opened in this country to the uncontrolled influx of non-White labour.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, if I am correct, the hon. the Minister asked seven questions. I do not know whether time will allow me to reply to all seven questions, but I shall do my best. The hon. the Minister asked whether we advocate that a Coloured woman should be allowed to work with a White woman in the same post office. That was his question.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#le_roux_hercules">

<from><span class="col_4065-4066" refersTo="page_0495"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. J. LE ROUX (Hercules)</person>:</from>

<p>That was one of the questions.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it was one of the seven questions. Incidentally, I am glad the hon. member for Hercules is here, because he agrees with the hon. the Minister. He says that the questions were put to me and that I do not want to reply. I shall reply now.</p>

<p>But where does the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs live&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#le_roux_hercules">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. J. LE ROUX (Hercules)</person>:</from>

</speech>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I shall say in a moment what it has to do with it. The hon. the Minister described the situation where a White woman is in charge of a post office and has, for argument&#x2019;s sake, a Coloured woman as an assistant. Is this not in fact the typical situation found in every home in South Africa, in every kitchen in South Africa&#x003F; Is this not in fact the traditional way of life of every woman, every country woman in South Africa&#x003F; Where does the hon. the Minister live&#x003F; But what does he do&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#reyneke">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. P. A. REYNEKE</person>:</from>

<p>Are you running away again&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am testing the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s questions against the reality in South Africa. Every time we find that his question is nothing but setting up a skittle and then knocking it over himself. His question means absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>I now want to make my second point. Has the hon. the Minister considered the possibility of consulting his trade unions about the matter if, as a result of a labour shortage, he should be compelled to consider such a situation&#x003F; It is a fair question. Incidentally, this brings me to the second question the hon. the Minister asked. The hon. the Minister asked whether we want the White and non-White postmen to work on a mixed basis. This is what they call &#x201C;the same work situation&#x201D;. My counter-question to the hon. the Minister is this: I do not know whether the need for it exists, but if, for argument&#x2019;s sake, such a situation were forced on him as a result of a labour shortage, would the hon. the Minister be prepared to consult his trade unions about it&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>I do so continually.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Thank you, I am satisfied. The hon. the Minister therefore says that if he is forced &#x2026; [Interjections.] Wait, give me a chance. The hon. the Minister said that he continually consulted the unions. If the hon. the Minister were forced into a position where he found that non-Whites and Whites had to work together in the same work situation, he would also be prepared, so he says, to consult his trade unions about the matter. What is wrong with that&#x003F; Would the hon. the Minister act against the wishes of the trade unions&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, if it is in conflict with our declared principle of White protection.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Then what does such consultation mean&#x003F; The hon. the Minister consults the people, but tells them in advance: &#x201C;I am going to consult you, but you already know what the reply must be.&#x201D; [Interjections.] Wait a moment. I shall also come to the traditional policy of the National Party. This is precisely what he is going to hold up to the trade unions, and he will tell them : &#x201C;Look, boys, here is my policy. You may do what you like. I am consulting you, but remember, I am telling you in advance what my policy is and if you do not agree, hard luck boys. You have to do as I, the Minister, say.&#x201D; That is the second point.</p>

<p>But yesterday the hon. the Minister put five questions to me. Then the hon. the Minister was very vehement. It was the climax of his speech, it was the peroration. His hon. friends behind him considered it of such importance that they virtually applauded him. I just want to tell the hon. the Minister in passing that his own press thought so little of his questions that they did not even say a word about them. But I want to deal with them. The hon. the Minister asked whether we stand for controlled employment. The hon. the Minister knows that every piece of labour legislation in South Africa, and there are about 12 of them, partially or entirely, to a greater or a lesser extent, has to do with controlled employment. It is therefore a general principle which is accepted throughout South Africa for all workers, White and non-White. This is not the whole <span class="col_4067-4068" refersTo="page_0496"/>story. Then the hon. the Minister comes along as he did a while ago, and concludes his peroration by telling us on the one hand, &#x201C;I know you stand for controlled employment&#x201D;&#x2014;because we said, &#x201C;Yes, we stand for it&#x201D;&#x2014;and on the other hand saying, &#x201C;You want to throw open the floodgates.&#x201D; I want to ask a simple question: Must we really take the hon. the Minister seriously if they set up these skittles and knock them over themselves&#x003F;</p>

<p>He then asks whether we stand for consultation with trade unions. Yes, of course we stand for it. It has been the policy of this side for years. The point is that when one consults a trade union it is no use telling it in advance what the conditions are.</p>

<p>Question No. 3&#x2014;the hon. the Minister asked us whether we are going to allow mixed employment. Let us test this statement against the reality in South Africa. If a railway artisan is assisted by two non-White assistants &#x2026;</p>

Let us test this against reality. Since this is taking place under his administration and with his administration&#x2019;s approval, the hon. the Minister knows that in South Africa there are non-White teachers exercising control over White female teachers.</p>

<p>This is again a skittle set up by the hon. the Minister. He asked us whether we are going to allow mixed employment and whether we will allow Whites to work under the charge of non-Whites. I have already dealt with that. Is there perhaps another question that hon. members want to ask about the labour policy of the United Party&#x003F; The questions asked here by the hon. the Minister and those asked by my friends are all questions that are asked in the abstract. If one tests those questions against the reality in South Africa, one realizes that one cannot draw a line anywhere and say: &#x201C;So far and no further.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The question to which the hon. the Minister must give me a reply is whether it is the policy of the National Party that no non-White artisan may be trained in White South Africa and practise his trade in White South Africa. May he be trained <span class="col_4069-4070" refersTo="page_0497"/>only in the Bantu area in which he is to perform his work as well&#x003F; The hon. the Minister must tell us this. Before we interpret the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s policy as an enlightened one, I should like him to tell us today whether there has been a policy shift as far as the National Party is concerned, and whether the hon. the Minister has now relinquished his traditional policy and that there will now be vocational training for the Bantu in the White area and that those vocationally trained Bantu will then be able to work in the White area. That is my question. The hon. the Minister knows what I am talking about. The fundamental question I want to ask him is therefore whether there has been a policy shift in the National Party or not.</p>

<p>I want to tell that hon. member that it is probably wonderful to be able to speak of a &#x201C;traditional policy&#x201D;, because that side of the House has nothing of the kind. The hon. member spoke, <i>inter alia,</i> of traditional customs. If I may consequently also use the word &#x201C;traditionally&#x201D;, I want to tell that hon. member and the Opposition that the United Party&#x2019;s attack on the National Party in this Budget was again traditionally a poor one. We include the hon. shadow minister of the United Party in this.</p>

<p>In the Second Reading and in the Committee Stage we had a typical repetition of what we experienced in the Railway Budget, i.e. that that side of the House absolutely takes to their heels as far as that aspect of the administration and the interests of the Post Office in South Africa is concerned. They again deal with economic levelling off and the labour situation in South Africa. When one listens to the complaints of that side, in connection with economic levelling off as well, one realizes that that side of the House must really take note of the speech the Leader of the National Party made at Blood River on 16th December, in which he warned South Africa against discontentment. That is precisely what we get from that side of the House. In complete contrast with that discontentment, there is a brief report in the <i>Volksblad</i> of 9th March in which mention is made of a campaign specifically being launched by the Post Office in South Africa. They call it a &#x201C;courtesy campaign&#x201D;. We should like to congratulate the Post Office staff on this scheme dealing with appearance, the correct way of speaking and proper conduct towards the public. I think it is perhaps a good thing that in this House an appeal should also be made to our general public to also be courteous to the officials of the Post Office in South Africa.</p>

<p>In contemplating this discontentment, I think the time has come for us in South Africa to realize that it is high time for us to adapt ourselves and our needs to the available services that are furnished, with an effort to do everything in our power to extend and to improve those services. Negative and scornful criticism, such as we get from that side of the House, has never improved any department in the world. I said one must adapt one&#x2019;s needs to the available services, and I want to illustrate this with a practical example. I myself have never&#x2014;and I repeat never&#x2014;had any reason to complain about the South African Post Office system. In the past recess I never made a single telephone call that culminated in a wrong number.</p>

<p>Never did I have reason to complain about having to wait very long for a number that continually gave an engaged tone. I do want to say, though, that it was only yesterday morning that I felt that the South African telephone service is not adequate in itself. I want to say why I think this telephone service was, as far as I am concerned, inadequate yesterday morning. Yesterday morning I wanted to telephone the entire Free State <span class="col_4071-4072" refersTo="page_0498"/>in the space of a few minutes to tell the Freestaters that I had just become the father of a daughter. Very quickly I also made use of the other arm of the Post Office, i.e. I made use of the telex facilities, and I should like to mention that 20 minutes after I had sent telegrams from here, I obtained replies to them from the Free State, telegrams in which the Freestaters expressed their thanks for the National Party being extended in such a practical fashion.</p>

<p>Let us now look at whether the telephone situation in South Africa is really as bad as the United Party says it is. I want to tell you that this is not so; the figures will speak for themselves in this connection. Taking the number of telephones per 100 inhabitants of South Africa, one finds that in respect of the Whites there are at present 47,3 telephones per 100 inhabitants. If the United Party tells me that this is not a lot, let me tell them it is a little more than the number of members that side has in this House. When one includes the Coloureds and the Asiatics, there are 26 telephones for every 100 persons. When one takes everyone in South Africa, except the rural Bantu, the figure is about 16,8 telephones per 100 persons, and when one takes the total South African population there are about 12 telephones per 100 inhabitants.</p>

<p>I should like to make a request to the hon. the Minister with respect to the automatic farm line system we have at present. Unfortunately I neglected to inquire whether a change had taken place in this connection with respect to the newer schemes, but Bethlehem was the first place where automatic farm lines were introduced, and there one finds ten subscribers sharing an automatic farm line and one finds that this is too great a number. We know that at one stage the Minister considered reducing the number of subscribers of a farm line to five. We should like to ask the Minister, if possible, to continue with that idea, so that our farm lines will carry less of a load, because at present there is a maximum of 12 subscribers per farm line. There is a further thought in connection with automatic farm lines. Unfortunately some members of the public&#x2014; and perhaps it is more noticeable in one generation than in the other&#x2014;use these automatic farm lines for visiting purposes. These telephone lines do not have a signal to remind one of the length of time one has spoken. We should like to ask the Minister to consider, if possible, also introducing a metering signal on these automatic farm lines. If it would not be possible to control this from the exchange building or exchange centre, I really think it would not be a very great expense to install, in the telephone set, a smaller apparatus that will emit a tone every three minutes, working from the same power source as that from which the telephone itself works. Sir, I want to give you the assurance that this is needed on our farm lines. Perhaps one can also apply this idea of a built-in metering signal in the case of all long-distance automatic dialling, where the subscriber is not warned by a metering signal that three minutes or six minutes has passed.</p>

<p>Again I want to take this opportunity of appealing to the general public in South Africa to follow this example of courtesy we find amongst the Post Office staff in South Africa. In that way we shall be able to express our thanks for the very important work the Post Office does and for the services it furnishes.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I hope the hon. member for Bethlehem will excuse me if I do not follow his line of thought. I am sorry that the hon. the Minister has already reacted to what I had to say yesterday, because when my time expired yesterday, I had not quite completed developing the arguments in regard to his method of financing his capital expenditure that I wished to develop. More important, I had not reached the conclusion I wanted to reach. I hope I shall be able to do that this morning.</p>

<p>I should like to say to the hon. the Minister that there is some danger in making comparisons between the way overseas countries and even the Bell Telephone Company in America finance their capital expenditure and the Minister&#x2019;s proposed policy for South Africa. What is necessary is to take into consideration certain vital factors that have an effect on that policy. I would suggest that the most vital factor to take into account is the state of development of the telecommunication system and the need it has for further capital, as well as the proportion which the capital expenditure required for expansion bears to ordinary operating expenditure. It is on that proportion that depends the extent to which you have to raise your tariffs in order to produce the surplus that is required <span class="col_4073-4074" refersTo="page_0499"/>under the proposed policy to provide finance for capital expenditure.</p>

<p>When my time expired yesterday, I was busy commenting on the capital structure of the Post Office. I had pointed out that the loans owed by the Post Office organization do not represent a particularly heavy amount in comparison with the total of the assets belonging to and employed by the Post Office, nor does the interest on such loans represent a particularly heavy burden either in relation to the capital employed by the Post Office, in other words, the assets employed by the Post Office, or in relation to the revenue of the Post Office. What is more important is that this burden of interest over the past few years since the Post Office became an independent entity has not been an increasing burden either in relation to capital employed or in relation to revenue. In fact, rather the opposite has been the tendency; the tendency has been for the burden of interest in relation to capital and in relation to revenue gradually to reduce. The Franzsen Commission&#x2014;not the Franzsen Committee&#x2014; which recommended in respect of the capital expenditure of public corporations such as the Post Office that 40 per cent of capital requirements should be financed from internal resources, gave as its two main reasons for making that recommendation firstly that the burden of interest and redemption payments were getting high in the case of public corporations and secondly that interest and redemption payments were representing a rising proportion of revenue. The Franzsen Commission at no place, when it was discussing the matter, referred to the Post Office as one of the public corporations that it had in mind, and I would suggest that the figures I gave to the House yesterday clearly indicate that the reasons which the Franzsen Commission advanced for making its recommendations are not applicable as far as the financial structure of the Post Office is concerned.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, I think there is a third factor we should take into consideration when viewing the merits of the Minister&#x2019;s policy for financing capital expenditure, and that is that normally capital expenditure can be planned on a much better and more reliable basis if it is to be financed mainly from loan funds, than if it has to rely on a surplus of revenue over expenditure to provide that finance. This applies particularly if a measure of priority were to be given to the loans advanced by the Treasury to the Post Office, which is something I suggested yesterday should be done. The unreliability of having to rely on surpluses of revenue over expenditure to finance capital expenditure has been amply demonstrated by the sad example which we had in this past year. We on this side of the House do not want to have the undignified sight again of the hon. the Minister leaning over into the barrel and scraping the thirteenth portion out of the bottom.</p>

<p>To sum up, Mr. Chairman, if my conclusions as to what this means are correct, I would say first of all that the hon. the Minister should not be shy about borrowing for his capital expenditure when there is such a crying need to get on with the job of expanding our telecommunications service. My appeal is that that expansion should not be starved for want of finance. The second conclusion that I arrive at is that there is a need for the hon. the Minister to be flexible in his approach as to what proportion of his capital expenditure is to be financed out of revenue. I am not against a proportion being financed in this way, but I think that what is needed is a balance which takes into account the outside factors which apply in the economy. I believe that now is not the time to have a higher tariff structure than you need have, because by doing so you are only adding to an inflationary situation. I do not think there is any point in saying that our tariffs in this country are lower than they are overseas. What matters is the fact that the Minister is in a position not to increase his tariffs. He has a margin of revenue over expenditure, and if he is going to increase his tariffs, as he strongly indicated in his Budget speech that he would, it would be an inflationary step which he can avoid taking. That is the pertinent point. Finally, Sir, I would say that now is not the time to rely on making surpluses of revenue over expenditure large surpluses that can be used to finance capital expenditure. The state of the economy is not certain enough to ensure that those surpluses are going to be realized. We are seeing this not only in the Post Office finances, but in the case of virtually all companies; we are seeing what difficulties they have in keeping up their margins of revenue over expenditure. To sum up, I would say that I feel that in the present circumstances 50 per cent is too high a percentage to take from revenue to finance capital expenditure. [Time expired.]</p>

<from><span class="col_4075-4076" refersTo="page_0500"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. P. A. REYNEKE</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, in the debate about this Post Office Budget Bill, a variety of subjects were discussed that have proved quite interesting. The hon. member for Mossel Bay spoke about postage stamps; the hon. member for Maitland did an egg dance such as we have very seldom witnessed here; he did everything but reply to the direct questions put to him. The hon. member for North Rand even went so far as to refer to the activities of hon. members on this side of the House during the last war. We regret that the hon. member did not elaborate a little further on his heroic deeds because I understand that he was quite a brave man. Perhaps it would have been interesting if he had told us something about the activities of the brave Gen. Moolman, and it would have been interesting if he as an animal lover, had told us how they made use of Shetland ponies in the war, and how in the future they are going to use Shetland ponies for delivering mail.</p>

<p>But, Sir, I should like to come back to the problems in my constituency in respect of telephone services. If we look at the Postmaster-General&#x2019;s report, we notice immediately that the number of deferred applications in Boksburg for the year 1971 amounted to 2 559, which is the fourth-highest in the Republic. I understand the problems experienced by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, with the tremendous growth and development we are experiencing, in complying with all the applications for telephones. I also want to add that we are grateful for what is already being done there and for the planning in Boksburg. We are grateful for the new exchange that is coming to Witfield, an exchange which, it is hoped, will come into use with 2 600 lines in 1973. Together with that there is the 600-line extension to the Boksburg exchange. But our problem in Boksburg is this: Since Witfield lies to the north, Boksburg&#x2019;s greatest development is actually taking place in the south, and that is where the greatest bottlenecks exist. I am aware of the planning of a new exchange for that area in 1975, but I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether temporary steps cannot be taken to comply with the needs of new, developing residential areas that will perhaps have to wait for telephones for four or five years, as is the case there in Boksburg. We have a residential area there, Vandykpark&#x2014;an economic scheme&#x2014;where 825 houses have been completed within 1&#x00BD; years. It is a residential area without any blocks of flats. There are no hotels and at present no businesses yet; there are only houses. After I made representations we obtained two call offices. It is expected that in the next few months another 375 houses will be built; we shall therefore have 1 200 houses there, with two call offices. Can other temporary measures not possibly be adopted&#x003F; Since we shall perhaps have to wait four or five years for telephones, I am thinking here of a mobile exchange that could serve as a temporary aid. The hon. the Minister spoke here of telephones that could be attached to power and telephone poles, and I wonder whether temporary measures could not be adopted in such an area, where at present there are cable lead problems, to assist the people there.</p>

<p>Sir, another matter that probably concerns us all, is the granting of telephones by the existing telephone committee. I should like to know from the hon. the Minister what priorities apply in the granting of telephones, because I frequently receive complaints that there are people who wait perhaps three or four years longer for a telephone and then one has a person moving in there and already being in possession of a telephone after a month or two. I am aware that there are certain professional people who have preference, but sometimes things do not look quite right to me, and our people cannot always understand this either.</p>

<p>Another matter concerns parcel post rates. With reference to representations I have received, I should here like to ask the hon. the Minister to consider giving us a reduced parcel post rate for parcels sent to our young men who are fighting terrorists there on the borders. I can understand that there are many other deserving cases of persons who are in the Defence Force, perhaps serving elsewhere, but I do think that here we are dealing with people who are doing South Africa a great service under very difficult circumstances, being in areas where they cannot easily obtain all the necessities. Knowing mothers as we do, we know that they always like to send a parcel of delicacies to the young men there, but at the moment the rates are quite high. I understand that the rate on a 3 kg parcel, which is not a heavy one, amounts to a quite a few rand.</p>

<p>If one thinks of the Post Office one thinks only of services such as telephone <span class="col_4077-4078" refersTo="page_0501"/>services, postage stamp services, letter deliveries, etc., but I think we must also take note of the services the Post Office furnishes for other Government Departments. I made a calculation and it appears that R237,5 million is handled by the Post Office on behalf of other Government Departments. I see in the Revenue Account that certain commissions are received. I take it this is from the Department of Community Development for charges. But has the time not perhaps come for the Post Office to collect commission from other Government Departments as well to cover their own costs since they probably have to retain additional staff to be able to furnish all those services. For the sake of interest I may just mention that if I look at the transport division of the postal services. I notice that in this financial year, as indicated in the Report, almost 78 million km was travelled by postal service vehicles at a total transport cost of a little more than R4 million, depreciation included. I subsequently made a calculation and came to the amazing conclusion that the transport costs, including depreciation, amounted to a mere 5,4 cents per km. I enquired from the Automobile Association and they inform me that the cost per km of the smallest vehicles is 5,3 cents according to their calculations. If one takes into account that the postal services chiefly make use of heavy vehicles and that there is probably quite an interchange of drivers, I consider it a remarkable achievement for the transport division of the postal services to keep those vehicles in working order, depreciation included, at 5,4 cents per km. I thank the hon. the Minister very much in anticipation for all those telephones Boksburg is most certainly going to receive shortly.</p>

<p>I shall return later on to certain matters which have already been discussed, but I see that the hon. member for Bethlehem has returned. I want to con gratulate him on becoming the father of a daughter. I can assure him that at the rate at which young people are crossing over to our party today, his youngest daughter will have joined us when she has grown up, and we thank him for another member for the United Party youth.</p>

<p>&#x2020; want to deal firstly with a local matter of importance, and thereafter I will return to the question of the labour policy with which we were dealing. The local matter is the question of the Cinderella constituency of Durban Point in regard to Post Office services. We have at the moment along the beach front of Durban three post offices, where there were previously four. There used to be the Addington post office, but that was closed in 1964. There is a temporary Point post office in a prefabricated building right on the docks in an area quite unsuitable, particularly for older people to transact their business. There is a Marine Parade post office which is closing at the end of this month with the demolition of the building, and there is the Snell Parade post office where the whole building has been demolished and all that is left is a little pimple in which the post office is housed, and that also is due to come down within the next two years. That means that there will be no post offices at all on the whole of the beach front area of Durban by 1974, when the new Seaview post office may or may not be completed. [Interjections.] Sir, the hon. member need not worry about my constituency. They said at the last election that it was going to go Nat, but what happened&#x003F; I increased my majority by more than 150 per cent. So that hon. member need not worry. But what will happen is that if we get the sort of service to which I am referring, this situation where a Government department is unable to give service to the people of South Africa, it is the Government which will have to worry about the position and not me in my constituency.</p>

<p>I want to pay a tribute to the officials of the Post Office in Durban with whom I have been dealing for a long time on this issue. The present regional director, when he was still postmaster of Durban, was involved in negotiations in which I participated in exchanging various land until we got a piece of land for the building of the new Point post office&#x2014;not the hon. the Minister, but his local representative and I, negotiating with charitable organizations and the city council, got a piece of land. <span class="col_4079-4080" refersTo="page_0502"/>That land has been available for four or five years. Plans were drawn up for building a post office, and now the hon. the Minister is unable to say if or when that post office will ever be built. I do not want to say more; I have all the correspondence on the matter. The Minister says he does not know when, if ever, it will be built. He says he does not know when capital will be available for it. Sir, what sort of Minister is this who allows an area which is vital to the economy of Durban, the premier holiday resort of South Africa, one of the fastest developing areas anywhere, an area not only important to the local population but to holiday-makers, overseas tourists and to business, to run down to the state where there is not a single post office operating&#x003F; Let me give the example of Addington Hospital, which is in this area. Addington Hospital, with staff and patients, has 2 500 people concerned. Anyone of those people who wants to collect a parcel or a registered letter, has got to take time off, take a bus into the centre of town, and a bus back to go to collect that registered letter or parcel. I know the Post Office is looking for premises. The Marine Parade post office is being pulled down this month, within six days. They are now looking for premises. This is not the time to look for premises, six days before the post office is to be demolished. This is an example of short-sightedness which does not reflect to the credit of the hon. the Minister. It is short-sightedness which does not reflect to the credit of his planners.</p>

<p>I have been trying my best. I have this map of the constituency. I know the new main post office will be built there&#x2014;but when&#x003F; What I am worried about, is the short-term problem which does not only affect my constituency but an area where, within two or three years&#x2019; time, there will be 40 000 inhabitants. In this area flats are shooting up like mushrooms. This sort of failure to foresee development and necessary changes and to plan for them is something which should not happen.</p>

<p>Whilst I am speaking of that, I believe the hon. member for Bethlehem never dials a wrong number. I wish he could have been with me on Tuesday night in Durban. By the time I dialled the second digit the phone started ringing. I dialled 33 and it would start ringing; I then dialled 34 and it would start ringing. It was shortcircuiting into lines; children were answering and adults were answering. You could not even dial a wrong number. Before you could make a mistake it started ringing. When a phone starts ringing before you have misdialled it, then you are really getting into a serious situation. [Interjections.] Let us not have any of that.</p>

<p>Whilst I think of it, I should like to know whether the hon. the Minister can tell us when British postal orders will be available.</p>

<p>I want to return in the moment or two left to me, to the hon. the Minister who puts on the Ben Schoeman shirt in regard to labour policy. He adopts the United Party policy and then puts on his &#x201C;verkrampte&#x201D; overcoat in case anyone thinks he is a &#x201C;verligte&#x201D;. Then he puts on his Oudtshoorn hat and tries to play politics with a fundamental problem of South Africa. The hon. the Minister warned that he would negotiate with the association but that he would not listen to them if they acted against the interests of the White man. I want to ask the hon. the Minister a question : Has he so little faith in the Postal Association, the officials of the department and in the White trade union movement that he believes that they would act to the detriment of the White man in South Africa&#x003F; Has he so little faith in his own people that he must say: &#x201C;I will negotiate with you, but I don&#x2019;t trust you and I am not going to allow you to endanger the future of the White man&#x201D;&#x003F; I want to say to him in loud and clear terms : We on this side of the House, as we have said, will negotiate. We will persuade, and we will seek a pattern of labour in the interests of all people without endangering the White man in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Point, who is always called in by the United Party to bring some life into a dull debate on its side, tried to do his best once again. He said that I had tried to put on the Ben Schoeman shirt, that we had accepted the U.P. policy and had put on the Oudtshoorn hat. This made me wonder for a moment what, in fact, the United Party was putting on. The United Party need not do a single one of these things, of course, because basically it was born two-faced. It need not put on anything more. Basically it is a two-faced party&#x2014;it <span class="col_4081-4082" refersTo="page_0503"/>has one story for the one side and another story for the other side. We had an attempt from the hon. member for Maitland to save the hon. the shadow Minister. The hon. the shadow Minister could not comply with my request simply to give a clear and courageous reply to elementary questions. No, I was referred to the hon. member for Maitland. He had to utter the words which were to save them. That hon. member then started off by giving one of the most ridiculous examples I have heard in a very long time. Yesterday evening the hon. member for North Rand asked me whether we could not employ non-Whites at the smaller post offices. It was in pursuance of that question that I asked the United Party this morning: &#x201C;Do you want a non-White woman to work together with the White behind the same counter in that small post office&#x003F;&#x201D; They did not have the courage to reply &#x201C;no&#x201D; to that question either.</p>

<p>That is rather interesting.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>For your information we still have the Third Reading in which you may state these matters openly. As regards consultation with the trade unions, I have put my standpoint before. We do consult them, but we have a policy and that is to protect the White worker. Suppose a leftist trade union federation, such as TUCSA, we had to consult were to tell us that there should be mixed employment of the races. What would the United Party do in such a case&#x003F; Would you accept it&#x003F; I may say very frankly that this side would not do so. We would not do it. We would consult those trade unions but this Government would not accept anything if it were in conflict with our fundamental policy of protecting the White worker. I hope this is as clear as daylight.</p>

<p>There is the other fundamental matter, and that is that we shall not have a White working under a non-White. In this regard they again use the subterfuge of the hon. member for Maitland saying, &#x201C;Yes, but here in the Cape White teachers do work under Coloured principals&#x201D;. That, after all, <span class="col_4083-4084" refersTo="page_0504"/>is the favourite reply of that side when they want to run away from this matter. Now pay close attention : Let me say at once that it is not our policy to have a White working under a non-White. This situation is not in keeping with national policy. It is a temporary emergency measure which must be terminated. [Interjections.] However, those Coloured schools would come to a standstill if we were to withdraw the White teachers at the present time. They have been told to take steps so that the White women teaching at those schools may be withdrawn as soon as possible. That is our policy. But the question which is important at the moment, is whether the United Party, if it were to come into power, would have those women teachers permanently in those posts or whether it would withdraw them, as we intend doing. What is the attitude of the United Party in this Post Office debate as regards the question of mixed employment&#x003F; They do not want to reply to this question. In regard to this matter I now want to put a question very pointedly to that side of this House : Hon. members opposite will have an opportunity to reply to this question during the Third Reading debate. Now those hon. members must pay close attention so that they will be able to reply to the question. Is the United Party prepared to say here that it will not allow a White person to work together with a non-White person behind the same counter in the same employment situation&#x003F; This is the one question. The United Party can reply to this question during the Third Reading debate. The second Question I want to put to hon. members opposite, is whether the United Party will allow a situation in which a White postman can work under any senior non-White postman. Hon. members opposite do not want to reply to this question at the moment, but perhaps they will do so during the Third Reading debate. Furthermore, as regards the mixed employment of Whites and non-Whites behind the same counter advocated by the hon. member for North Rand, I want to ask the United Party whether it will allow a situation in which the White can work under the non-White if that non-White is the senior. Hon. members opposite can give us the replies to these questions during the Third Reading debate.</p>

<p>I have only three minutes left and I have to make haste. I should like to reply very briefly to the points which were raised. The hon. member for Bethlehem referred to the matter of developing towards the position of having only five subscribers per line. I want to tell the hon. member that the automatic system is such that it will, unfortunately, take a considerable time before we shall be able to apply it throughout the country on a five-basis. A regards the long conversations, I want to tell the hon. member that for economic reasons it is difficult to meter conversations according to the three minute metering system. Unfortunately it will still take a considerable time before we shall be able to introduce this into the rural systems.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Constantia referred to the factors mentioned in connection with financing. I should like to assure the hon. member that all the aspects which he raised were considered by the Franzsen Committee. I wish to give the hon. member the assurance that I have taken note of the arguments which he has advanced and I will certainly bear them in mind and I will see in what way they can be implemented in our system.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Boksburg complained about the back-log of 2 000 telephones in his constituency. However, the hon. member is not the only person who can complain. The other day the hon. member for Alberton, too, complained vigorously about the 2 000 people waiting for telephones in his constituency, and he is not a man without contact with the department! I want to tell the hon. member for Boksburg that I shall address a letter to him before long in which I shall set out the steps being taken in this connection. As regards the question of priority in making allocations, I want to say the position is that we give priority to sick people and to professional people. Sometimes, however, the cable position is such that certain peoole simply cannot be connected to the cables.</p>

<p>&#x2020;In regard to the points raised by the hon. member for Durban Point I should like to read the following because it is very important to him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Addington Post Office was closed on 1st July, 1964, but the area is adequately served by the Point Post Office which is accommodated in a prefabricated building. The latter will meet requirements for some time and will be replaced as soon as funds become available, by a departmental building to be erected in <span class="col_4085-4086" refersTo="page_0505"/>Point Road. The hired building accommodating the Marine Parade Post Office is to be demolished and must be vacated by 30th April, 1972. It is expected that the departmental building which is in the course of construction in Sea View Street will be completed by May, 1974. In the meantime the office will be housed in alternative hired premises near the existing office. The Snell Parade Post Office is in hired accommodation. Although surrounding buildings have been demolished, the department has security of tenure until the lease expires on 30th September, 1974. Efforts are nevertheless being made to obtain other more suitable hired premises before that date.</block>

<p>As far as the Marine Parade office is concerned, I should like to say the following.</p>

<p>*We have already obtained other accommodation and the Postmaster-General says he has approved of the lease. As it happened, we had to take a decision in this regard today. I hope this will help the hon. member to sleep more soundly, at least as far as this matter is concerned. The hon. member also asked a question concerning British postal orders and asked when we were going to start this service.</p>

<p>&#x2020;We hope to start in May of this year. This concludes the answers to the points that were raised.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am really sorry that this House was not fuller when we had the unsavoury incident in which the hon. the Minister again tried to exploit racial prejudice and racial hatred. In this country there are supposed to be laws which prohibit that kind of exploitation. It is also said that legislation will be introduced in this regard. Let us hope it will come soon, so that we shall not have a repetition of the unsavoury type of incident we have now had.

<p>The hon. the Minister received a reply to every one of those seven questions he asked. The hon. member for Maitland replied to every point. Let me repeat to the hon. the Minister that the United Party&#x2019;s policy is that there should be an adjustment of the labour pattern and that that adjustment will be made only in co-operation with the various staff associations. There are four different staff associations. Some of them will recommend adjustments in a certain direction, and others in another direction. We shall listen to them. We shall never try to force anything on any of those staff associations. Is that an adequate reply for the hon. the Minister&#x003F; Seeing that the Post Office is in such straitened circumstances, I do not know why the hon. the Minister comes forward with those nonsensical arguments we heard today. There is the biggest shortage of telephones the country has ever experienced, and the hon. the Minister comes here with petty little questions which he would not dare to ask if a Vote such as Foreign Affairs were under discussion, when people from abroad would be listening. But I leave him at that.</p>

<p><span class="col_4087-4088" refersTo="page_0506"/>&#x2020;I would now like to refer in passing to the hon. member for Sunnyside, the &#x201C;thundercloud-browed&#x201D; member for Sunnyside as Homer would no doubt have called him. He pointed out that there had been a big resurgence on the Stock Exchange immediately after the hon. the Minister had delivered his Budget speech. He pointed out on the front page of <i>Die Burger</i> : &#x201C;Beurs aan die loop soos in die ou dae.&#x201D; Well, I saw the <i>Cape Times</i> this morning&#x2014;not yesterday&#x2014;and it said : &#x201C;Rally comes to nothing.&#x201D; The great boom on the Stock Exchange started by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech came to nothing in ten hours.</p>

<p>Are you rejoicing in this&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>No, I sincerely hope that something will happen in the Main Budget next week which will give cause for rejoicing. I want to give the hon. the Minister an example of how one sometimes can try to predict the state of, say, the Stock Exchange by what is happening in the Post Office. I want to refer to the hon. member for Rustenburg in this regard. He pointed out that he had no difficulties whatsoever in Rustenburg as far as the telephone situation is concerned. There are plenty of phones there, he said. Well, we know why that is so, don&#x2019;t we&#x003F; We know that the platinum mines in that area are on short time. We know that there are many homes empty where there were phones previously. We know that many miners are out of work and that they are not there any longer. So whenever, as in Rustenburg, one finds that there is no phone shortage, one can almost be sure under this Government that there is a near depression and unemployment. So I want to give this bit of financial advice to the country. Whenever there is a phone shortage in Rustenburg, buy Rustenburg Platinums again !</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister also replied to the accusation made by the hon. member for Rustenburg against the hon. member for North Rand, when he said that the hon. member for North Rand was not a good parliamentarian: he was not looking after his voters, which was why there was such a big shortage of telephones in his constituency. The hon. the Minister replied to that accusation himself by saying that in his own constituency there is a shortage of 2 000. Out of the 54 exchanges on the Witwatersrand, his is the fifth worst of all. He cannot even help himself, so how can he be expected to help the rest of the country&#x003F;</p>

<p>*I see that I have made a note in respect of staff, although I have already spoken about that. A remark appeared in one of his newspapers. He is a member, a director of Perskor. He is one of the heads or owners of it. He is one of the &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I now want to say something about the telephone service in this country. We have had examples of what the service is like, but I think it is time we elaborated a bit on what has been happening in regard to the service. As far as telephones are concerned, we have two complaints : Firstly, there is a shortage but, just as bad, there is the service itself. Mr. James Michener, the famous author, said that our phone service was the worst in the world. I do not think it is, but Mr. James Michener knows the South Pacific very well. We can therefore accept that it is worse at any <span class="col_4089-4090" refersTo="page_0507"/>rate than anywhere in the South Pacific, worse than in Samoa, Tahiti or Okinawa.</p>

<p>The service in our country, and there is not the least doubt about it, is bordering on the atrocious today. I can mention dozens of examples. No other factor has contributed more towards retarding growth in our country than this bad telecommunication service which we have in this country. That is what happens when you hear that an executive has had to take two or three hours to make five phone calls. What happens to growth when you find that up to 20 or 30 different calls have to be made in order to get through five or six times&#x003F; I want to refer here to a true incident. A business man in Johannesburg wanted to phone an office of his in a neighbouring suburb in connection with an important deal but could not get through and had to phone his head office in London and ask them to phone through to his office in the suburb in order to get the message through. [Interjections.] It is quite true. I can mention a building contractor in a town close to Johannesburg who had to open a special office in Johannesburg in order to get a phone. With the staff he had to employ, it cost him R1 000 per month additional just to get a phone! In what town was that contractor&#x2019;s office&#x003F; It was in the town of Alberton, the constituency of our hon. Minister.</p>

<p>I know that Mr. Gerry Rooiyakkers complained to the Press about that, and that, at last he has a phone service in Alberton. The Postmaster-General himself, in an interview in <i>Rapport,</i> admitted : &#x201C;Ons het &#x2019;n swak diens, veral aan die Witwatersrand &#x2026; Ons veg met ons rug teen die muur.&#x201D;</p>

<p>I have taken the trouble of making a list of all the different things that can go wrong when you try to telephone someone. It is a case of a neurosis, a psychosis, in your telephone exchange; the symptoms are very similar to human ones. When you phone there are certain stages that you go through. First of all, you apprehensively approach the telephone, hoping for the best. Next you pick up the receiver, and then you find certain faults before even dialling. Next you find faults while dialling and in the end you find faults after dialling a number. Let me mention a few of these.</p>

<p>Firstly, there are the faults before dialling. You lift up the receiver and we all know what happens. Sometimes there is no dialling tone. The telephone is suffering from a state of anxiety. Secondly, all you may find is the &#x201C;number engaged&#x201D; tone. Thirdly, you find that long-drawn out tone meaning &#x201C;number unobtainable&#x201D;. Fourthly&#x2014;and this can all happen before you start dialling and after you have picked up the receiver&#x2014;you find crossed lines. You find two other subscribers conversing, and in that case I think the telephone is suffering from catatonia. Fifthly, you find a sudden variety in the intensity of the dialling tone, an intensity alternating between weak and strong. That is an obvious sign of neurosis. Sixthly, you find that the dialling tone suddenly stops after a few seconds.</p>

<p>Now, we come to the next series of faults, the faults while you are dialling. We come to No. 7. You get the dialling tone after dialling the first few digits, in other words, you immediately go back to square one. That is a clear sign of delirium in the telephone service. You next may find that the lines get crossed while dialling or at the same time you suddenly find that the dialling is interspersed with problem No. 9 : &#x201C;The number engaged tone&#x201D; or No. 10: Interrupted by that long &#x201C;no such number&#x201D; tone. This is very clearly a case of paranoia in the telephone.</p>

<p>That is while dialling. But what happens when at last you have succeeded in completing the dialling of a number&#x003F; No. 11 : You get the wrong number. How often does that not happen&#x003F; No. 12: You get no sound at all, only silence. Obviously, in this case the telephone is suffering from depression. No. 13: You get one or two rings and then more silence. No. 14: One or two rings, followed by the engaged signal. That is quite something, Sir. It is a sign of hysteria in the telephone. Then we have No. 15: You just find that after dialling the number, the original dialling tone suddenly returns and you are back to square one again. No. 16: An engaged tone is heard after dialling the number, but the person subsequently tells you: &#x201C;My dear chap, I have been nowhere near this phone all afternoon; it could not have been engaged.&#x201D; No. 17: The telephone rings continuously when one knows that there must be someone at the other end because, for example, you are telephoning a big business. Then there is No. 18: You get the &#x201C;no such number&#x201D; tone after dialling the number.</p>

<p>Yes, it happens when you have picked up the receiver; it happens while you are dialling and it happens after you have dialled. The hon. member is quite correct; it happens at all these different stages. It is clearly a case of a psychosomatic duality in the telephone, when you get a &#x201C;no such number&#x201D; tone after having been connected with the same number no less than five minutes before. Then, Sir, we have No. 19: You get a crossed line again. The best procedure is to cough politely and after the inevitable deep silence, ask for the number and try to report the fault. I once had a speaker from Kroonstad crossed with my line and once came in on a very interesting conversation about the winner of the next Durban July, and we had a very interesting three-cornered conversation on that crossed line. Then there is No. 20: This is a fault you can get at any time&#x2014;an earsplitting, crackling noise like lightning striking nearby. Obviously, at that stage the telephone has hysteria. Then there is No. 21 : This can also happen at any time. You hear a continuous scratching noise, like an inefficient tape recorder, while one is speaking. Sometimes that is accompanied by very slow, heavy breathing. Then there is No. 22: There is a sudden ghostly fading of the voice of the speaker at the other end, a clear case of involutional melancholia on the part of the telephone. There are all the symptoms, Sir. The hon. the Minister has not found the answer. I give him these as a clear indication of the type of service that we have today.</p>

<p>I do not have much more to say on the telephone service, but I conclude by saying that there is no doubt that local services in this country have worsened, that the capital problem has escalated, that losses will continue. There is no doubt that the hon. the Minister could give no firm denial about tariff increases in future.</p>

<p>No, I am concluding now. He could give no assurance about telephone shortages and he has given no indication that fuller use would be made of free enterprise, as has b&#x00E9;en demanded in this debate. He has also given no indication that use will be made of the most modern equipment and that he will see to it that there is no continued use and buying of obsolete equipment by the Post Office. With these words I conclude by saying that this Budget has ben a disappointing one, and it seems that next year we will be in for an even worse one.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before I come to the hon. member I want to refer to an announcement the Minister made in connection with the employment of table-mounted telephones. They are going to be installed on tables, desks and on business, caf&#x00E9; and hotel counters. I think it will be a very great aid to the public to have such telephones at their disposal. What is interesting, and really a feather in our cap, is that our own South African technicians manufactured these telephones. I think they will prove exceptionally efficient, and one accepts that the owners of such places will probably receive a commission for the supervision they are going to exercise in this connection. In addition this will also, in the course of time, eliminate the damage and the vandalism one encounters in respect of the ordinary call offices. Mr. Speaker, I have already listened to many Third Reading speeches in this House, but I do not know whether I have ever listened to anything poorer than the speech of the hon. member who has just resumed his seat. For a quarter of an hour and more the hon. member harped on only one single matter; there was a nagging about telephones &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; and he did not get round to anything else. The hon. the Minister put specific questions to the hon. member and the Opposition. The hon. member for Orange Grove has now spoken four times in this debate &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; and throughout the debate he simply harped again on what he said last year, and reiterated what he had said in previous speeches. He accused the hon. the Minister of trying to exploit race prejudice with the direct questions the Minister put to him. He evades his responsibility as the main speaker on Post Office matters by saying that the hon. <span class="col_4093-4094" refersTo="page_0509"/>member for Maitland had answered the questions, but we obtained no answers from him. Those questions still stand, and the hon. member still owes us replies. Last Wednesday, when the hon. member replied so close on the heels of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Budget speech, he said very theatrically at the end of his speech&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We shall come as an alternative Government of South Africa with a clear-cut, concise policy for the future of our country.</block>

<p>&#x201C;Clear-cut&#x201D; and &#x201C;concise&#x201D;. Sir, he had the opportunity as the so-called shadow Minister of Posts and Telegraphs to tell us in these four speeches what the United Party&#x2019;s &#x201C;clear-cut and concise policy&#x201D; will be in respect of the Post Office, but he never got round to that &#x201C;clear-cut, concise policy&#x201D;, particularly in connection with the two bottlenecks, i.e. labour and capital. The hon. member accused the hon. the Minister of having made certain promises in connection with not increasing tariffs in the next five years. The Minister has already given an adequate reply by pointing out that he used the word &#x201C;object&#x201D;, but subsequently the hon. member and his colleagues continued to harp on the same subject in the subsequent speeches. Sir, in his Second Reading speech the hon. member also very theatrically, and with arms waving, held up a newspaper cutting in connection with what Mr. Louis Rive is supposed to have said. He read the heading: &#x201C;Telephones more important than cannon.&#x201D; I concede that he said that this is not what Mr. Rive said, but just the interpretation given to his statement. Sir, Mr. Rive said this (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We must have a sound infrastructure in order to develop a vigorous economy. In my opinion economic viability comes even before military viability, because the latter cannot be maintained without the former.</block>

<p>Like the hon. member for Orange Grove, I agree with that, but what dumbfounds me is that while the hon. member was reading the cutting he made no more use of that particular interview Mr. Rive held with the relevant newspaper reporter.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>But I quoted him; I said that you were standing with your backs to the wall.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, if the hon. member would just give me a chance you will hear how he quoted. He did not quote another heading there, i.e. &#x201C;Rive states it is easier for us to phone than it is in parts of the United States&#x201D;. He did not get round to that. He did not go further with this quotation that he is now trying to broadcast to the world. I want to quote a little further. Listen for a moment to what the Postmaster-General went on to state (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I can just mention that the service in a modern country such as France is generally much poorer than ours. Even in the American rural areas the service leaves much to be desired in numerous places, and in New York it is not much better than ours here.</block>

<p>No, he kept quiet about that. It does not suit him to quote that as well.</p>

<p>This year, under the leadership of the hon. member for Orange Grove, the Opposition again came along with destructive criticism. Sir, I have been hearing this criticism for the past 10 or 11 years that I have been here. As soon as the Post Office Budget is discussed, the Opposition can say nothing good about it, and this was again typical of them this year. They again conducted themselves in the old tradition characteristic of the Opposition. In these attempts at criticism, and to support their negative approach, they look with a magnifying glass for weak spots in the Post Office organization. Why do the hon. members not come along with something positive&#x003F; Why do they not congratulate the Post Office Administration on the planning&#x003F; Why do they not congratulate the Post Office staff on the excellent advance planning, particularly after the Post Office became independent&#x003F; But I must say there is an improvement in their arguments, because only last year the hon. member made a terrible fuss about the lack of planning. This year he did not speak about that, but why does he not congratulate the Administration&#x003F; Why does he not congratulate the Minister and the Administration on the consistent progress &#x2014;I purposely call it the consistent progress &#x2014;of the telecommunications services, a service which is one of the most important cornerstones of our country&#x2019;s infrastructure&#x003F; Why, in all reasonableness, does the Opposition not mention the fact that while we were still dependent, to a large extent, on <span class="col_4095-4096" refersTo="page_0510"/>manual service up to five years ago, 80 per cent of our 1,6 million subscribers can already dial one another directly&#x003F; Why does he not mention that&#x003F; Why does he not mention the great increase in the number of automatic exchanges&#x003F; I could continue in this vein and mention positive achievements on the part of the Post Office, despite the oppressive factors of capital and labour. No, the United Party are people who see only a future of sombreness and shadows; that is why that party will only furnish shadow Ministers.</p>

<p>I want to say that this Budget reflects the faith of the Minister and the department in the economic future and the economic boom of our country. It reflects the department&#x2019;s confidence in the future of the Post Office despite these problems. It also reflects once more the determination of the department to comply with the demands laid down to improve the country&#x2019;s infrastructure, particularly in the sphere of the telecommunications service which, as I have said, is one of the most important connerstones of our infrastructure. I think the Opposition suffers from many political ailments. In this debate the criticism ailment was perhaps the most striking. The hon. members of the Opposition actually vied with one another in this attempt at criticism. The 1972 debates will be preserved in Hansard and will once again prove what a negative attitude this Opposition adopted towards the serious matters we are dealing with.</p>

<p>I want to say a few words in connection with the staff. The temporary and permanent White staff of the Post Office amounted to 40 325 at the end of 1971. As against that the permanent and temporary non-White staff amounted to 18 037 at the end of 1971. This gives a total of 58 362. The Minister and several speakers on this side of the House have already expressed sincere thanks and appreciation to these staff members, particularly for their sound and excellent spirit of loyalty and their willingness to serve. Speakers on this side endorsed this without qualification. I must acknowledge that speakers on the other side of the House also tried to do so, even though this was at times done in a subtle or stealthy fashion.</p>

<p>I should now like to ask the Opposition: How can you complain about inefficient telephone services, about telephones that are out of operation and other trifles if you are not, with that complaint, also subtly indicting the officials&#x003F; That is what you did, but you do not realize it. After all, the technicians and eingineers are responsible for the installation and maintenance of our automatic exchanges, the telegraph and telex equipment and so on. If anything goes wrong, we cannot always say it is only the Minister&#x2019;s fault. Circumstances also play a role. Often it is due to difficulties in connection with link-ups and as a result of work being done on those telephones. You come along here and subtly attack those officials.</p>

<p>The White postal workers are members of various staff associations, each with a separate organ. There is, for example, the <i>Postal Journal,</i> the official organ of the South African Postal Association; <i>Live Wire,</i> the official journal of the South African Telecommunications Association and the Postal and Telegraph <i>Herald,</i> the official journal of the Posts and Telegraphs Association of South Africa. If one pages through these magazines and reads them one cannot help noticing what esteem and respect there exists for the hon. the Minister and the Postmaster-General and his Administration. One also notices what harmonious co-operation there exists between the Association, the Minister and the Administration. What strikes me, however, is the loyalty that beams forth as far as the Post Office and its various branches are concerned. What beams forth above all is patriotism in respect of our country. I was particularly struck by an introductory article in the Postal and Telegraph <i>Herald</i> of March, 1972, under the title &#x201C;Patriotism and Bread&#x201D;. In strong, simple language in this introductory article the writer states what patriotism encompasses. I shall quote you a portion of it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In these times of financial stringency, price rises, threatening depression or possible inflation we also see the railway lines merging in the distance&#x2014;we also see the lines of patriotism and bread merging: &#x2018;I shall remain a patriot while I receive my bread&#x2019;.</block>

<block name="quote">We know that there will be a cry for bread and, considering present conditions, it is probably justified. That it is a dangerous situation which can lead to ruin and misery, cannot be doubted, and for that reason it is our duty not to cherish this thought too much without giving a <i>quid pro quo.</i></block>

<block name="quote">What <i>quid pro quo</i> can we possibly <span class="col_4097-4098" refersTo="page_0511"/>still give? you may ask. We have already weighed in with longer working hours; and are we not doing our best to increase productivity? All that is true. The Association is proud of its members who have done these things, but can we not go a little further?</block>

<p>Sir, is this not really fine language? One does not want to comment on it any further, because however appreciative one&#x2019;s comments may be, they will only be an anticlimax. Our people, our country and everyone in this Parliament can only have the utmost esteem and appreciation for officials embued with such patriotism. One ventures to hope that this example will be followed on all fronts.</p>

<speech by="#stephens">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. M. STEPHENS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Koedoespoort charged us with not having praised the Post Office for the actual improvements in the telecommunications system. The difference between our approach and that of the hon. member is that we expect actual improvements from any Government, hence from this Government as well. We want South Africa to be developed, and we are not going to exult at every improvement if it does not comply with the very best standards and does not meet South Africa&#x2019;s needs. We believe that the improvement should and could have been greater. While we appreciate the fact that there was in fact an improvement, we emphasize that this does not comply with the standard we expect this Government to set.</p>

<p>I must say I am disappointed in the Minister&#x2019;s conduct today and yesterday. He came along with absolutely superficial arguments. He did not listen and properly respond to the contributions made from this side of the House. Before I came to this House I heard that that hon. Minister was one of those vying with the hon. the Prime Minister, but it seems to me he has now fallen far behind in this race. Each time he comes along with the same senseless type of questions that mean absolutely nothing and have little or nothing to do with the problems of the country. In as much as I prsonally listened to this debate, answers were given to each of the questions put to us from the other side in a way which would satisfy any normal person. [Interjections.] The problem with those hon. members is that they are not really looking for answers. No answer one gives them

would satisfy them. They are not looking for answers; they are looking for election slogans.</p>

<p>I actually want to go on to a few problems that have cropped up in my constituency in particular and that I should like to bring to the Minister&#x2019;s attention. In the Estimates of Capital Expenditure provision is being made under subhead 6, item No. 5 for a telephone exchange at Blackheath. We welcome this and are very grateful for it. It is definitely an advantage for that portion of my constituency. But I should like to ask the Minister to investigate the possibility of a new post office for the North Cliff portion of my constituency. There is a post office at the moment, but it is a very small one. That area has developed tremendously in recent times. At present the post office is also situated at a very inconvenient spot. It is not ideally situated at all. I would appreciate it if the hon. the Minister would institute investigations there so that we can obtain better accommodation, particularly since new centres have been opened. Under item 38 provision is also being made for an automatic telephone exchange in Florida. In this connection the hon. the Minister and I have already received representations from the Roodepoort Chamber of Commerce. I should like to hear from the hon. the Minister what his reaction to these representations is. The position is simply that the present post office site is situated in Golden Street, which is Florida&#x2019;s main street. That is where all the business undertakings in Florida are at present concentrated. There is an open piece of land available that belongs to the State. I should like to hear from the hon. the Minister if it is in fact their intention to construct the telephone exchange there. A telephone exchange is inevitably, from an aesthetic point of view, not the type of building one would like to have in the main street. If its design could be different to those one normally sees I should also like to hear about this from the Minister. In addition I should also like to hear if there is any particular reason why the exchange should specifically be built there. There are certain objections this body mentioned. I do not want to go into that any further at the moment, but I hope we shall obtain a favourable reply from the Minister in this connection. We are proud of our town and of the way it is developing. We do not mind the exchange being built there, provided the aesthetic aspect is taken into <span class="col_4099-4100" refersTo="page_0512"/>account, of course. I shall be glad to know the Minister&#x2019;s attitude in that connection.</p>

<p>Lastly I have also received representations from a very well-known welfare organization that also does tremendously good work in my constituency; in fact throughout South Africa. I am sure their problem is also experienced by many welfare organizations. At Christmas they send out printed Christmas cards that people order from them. It is a source of income to them. People order Christmas cards from them on which the names of those people are then printed. They then post the Christmas cards. Parcel post rates are then levied on those parcels, rates that are considerably greater than those for printed matter. It will entail a great saving for them if they could send them at the lower rate instead of at parcel post rates. My information has it that they spend about R6 000 per year on postage in order to post these Christmas cards. I will be very glad if the hon. the Minister could see his way clear to granting relief to these welfare organizations in this connection by allowing them to despatch the cards at the lower rate. I can mention that the minimum order of 24 cards weighs 398 grams. A packet of 50 weighs 767 grams. I think the heaviest weighs 1 420. It is such parcels that they would like to send at the rates applicable for printed matter instead of at the parcel post rates.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. HENNING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Florida will certainly not blame me if I do not follow up on what he said, because I think he must still learn what the difference is between the Committee Stage and the Third Reading. He came to the House with the personal problems of his constituency, something that does not belong to this stage of the debate. If he had linked this up to the Committee Stage it would probably have fitted in much better with the debate.</p>

<p>Since we now come to the third and final stage of the debate, in which we must finally sanction and approve the Budget, I want to say that several questions were put to the members of the Opposition from this side of the House. Only rarely were answers forthcoming. There was to a certain extent a reply from the hon. member for Constantia, a reply that dealt more with the financing of the capital expenditure of this Budget. Had he spoken a little louder we would perhaps have heard more of what he said, but unfortunately he speaks a little indistinctly. I nevertheless think that a few sound ideas emerged from the proposals he made to this House. Coming now to the other members on that side of the House, we are compelled to say that there were no constructive and positive suggestions from any member about how we should get this Budget to balance. It is very easy to give advice and to give counsel when they have the Advisory Committee&#x2019;s report to hand. Every member who stood up on that side merely repeated the recommendations of the Advisory Committee. They want to plough here with that Committee&#x2019;s heifer and make this House believe it is their ideas that will lead to a solution for the problems of this Budget.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the hon. member for Orange Grove, the member who is labelled the &#x201C;Shetland pony&#x201D; by the Sunday Times. When one hears the words &#x201C;Shetland pony&#x201D; one thinks involuntarily of the circus. &#x201C;Shetland ponies&#x201D; usually act in circuses. Hon. members know that they trot in there with feathers on their heads and their tails in the air. This hon. member is rather like a &#x201C;Shetland pony&#x201D;, short and chunky. When he entered the Postal arena, he also trotted in with a feather on his head and his tail in the air. He wanted to come and tell us how the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs should administer his department. After I had listened to him in the Third Reading debate, however, he reminded me more of the clown in a circus. Hon. members know that frequently a circus also has chimpanzees participating. The way he carried on here about the problems in connection with the telephone service made me think of the chimpanzee that wanted to dial Pretoria. I do not know whether he knows how to handle a telephone properly.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not think I called the hon. member a chimpanzee. I only said that his conduct reminded one of that chimpanzee or clown that acts in a circus. The shadow Minister of Posts and Telegraphs moved into this <span class="col_4101-4102" refersTo="page_0513"/>arena, his tail in the air and a feather on his head. You know, at this stage he has his tail between his legs and the feather has been plucked off by the members of this side of the House. Typical of the build of a &#x201C;Shetland pony&#x201D;, short and chunky, he trotted on with a short, tense and matter of fact policy which he calls the &#x201C;clear-cut policy&#x201D;. It almost puts me in mind of the old booklet they issued with the last election. The booklet is called : &#x201C;You want it; we have it.&#x201D; In respect of the Post Office they came along with the same idea, the idea of &#x201C;You want it: we have it.&#x201D; In respect of their &#x201C;policy&#x201D; I can tell them : &#x201C;If you get it, you&#x2019;ve had it&#x201D;.

<speech by="#henning">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. HENNING</person>:</from>

<p>Before the adjournment for lunch I referred here to the expected policy that would be forthcoming from the United Party. As I put it, and as it was stated by the hon. member for Orange Grove, they would have presented the House with their so-called &#x201C;concise and clear-cut policy&#x201D;. Of all the speakers who stood up on that side of the House during this debate, not one came along with constructive or positive proposals about the curtailing of expenses or the collecting of more revenue. On the contrary; every Opposition member who stood up here advocated more services and therefore greater capital expenditure. I want to begin with the hon. member for Benoni. I must congratulate the hon. member because he succeeded well in reasonably successfully reading another man&#x2019;s speech here. He also advocated the extension of telecommunications services. If we look at the provision being made for capital expenditure in the Estimates, we see that it amounts to R140 million, R115 million of which is destined for the extension of telecommunications services. In other words more than 82 per cent of the amount provided for capital expenditure makes provision for the extension of the telecommunications system. If we look at the statistics we had before us we can compare the 1970-&#x2019;71 trunk-line equipment with that for the year 1969-&#x2019;70. We shall then see that the development for that one year was 20,9 per cent while in the past year we have had a growth rate of more or less 5,5 per cent.</p>

<p>The hon. members opposite want to join in the talk for the sake of being popular. I refer here to the hon. member for Jeppes. Unfortunately that man suffers from an ailment: Once his tongue starts moving he cannot stop it. We also had the hon. member for Orange Grove. Both of them stood up in this House and advocated more staff. To be popular and to try to canvass votes they will, of course, try to win popularity by asking for better and higher salaries. If we look at the Estimates dealing with operating expenditure, we see that the amount for salaries and wages alone totals R143,5 million. This is more than 50 per cent of the total Budget.</p>

<speech by="#henning">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. HENNING</person>:</from>

<p>I cannot even call that hon. member a &#x201C;U.P. man born and bred&#x201D;. I must call him simply a &#x201C;testamentary U.P. man&#x201D;. So he had better keep quiet. We have found here that every member simply advocates greater expenditure. There was not one who spoke of reducing expenditure. With respect to the Estimates before us not one of the hon. members had the courage of their convictions, except for the amounts I referred to, to recommend the reduction of direct expenditure such as pension commitments, medical commitments, the rental of foreign telecommunications channels, the interest redemption and the provision for depreciation. They all just want more services. What is the difference between the United Party&#x2019;s attitude and that of the Post Office staff. I think that in the first place the attitude of the Post Office staff is largely attributable to the competent action of the Postmaster-General. He made it his task, when he took over the post, to travel through the whole of the Republic and visit his people in the various departments. He addressed them and I think was largely successful in his efforts, because today those people are proud to be Postal officials. They are industrious and they are loyal. The difference between the United Party and the Post Office staff is that the officials still possess a great love for their fatherland, while the United Party&#x2014;I accuse them of this&#x2014;are prepared to sell South Africa for a mess of pottage. The hon. member for Orange Grove rejoiced when he heard of a recession <span class="col_4103-4104" refersTo="page_0514"/>in the share market. I want to ask hon. members, must one rejoice if there is a recession in the share market? Does a patriot do that? Does a person do that for love of his fatherland? No, one cannot be patriotic if one makes such a statement. [Interjections.] Those people are prepared to besmirch South Africa from morning to night. They are prepared to do South Africa even more harm. They rejoice when South Africa suffers an injury. That is how we have come to know them! Then they speak of an alternative Government! I do not believe that South Africa could ever get a bigger stepfather than if they should come into power.</p>

<p>The hon. member for North Rand fought the Second World War all over again, neglecting only to tell us whether he was a red or blue tab. What did he say here? He also flung out a few ideas here by levelling the accusation of a &#x201C;tremendous waste of manpower&#x201D;. I wonder whether the hon. member has ever properly seen how a Post Office functions and what is done there. I want to tell him that the Postmaster-General will most certainly arrange a visit for him to one of the post offices. Last year during the recess we had the privilege of visiting the Johannesburg post office. I want to tell hon. members that it was worth the effort.</p>

<p>I do not want to come back to the labour question. I think the Minister dealt with it very thoroughly. There is, however, one other matter I should like to come to, i.e. the question as to who authorizes us to deal further with the Budget and to bring it to the point of implementation. In that connection I should like to refer to the Postmaster-General and his staff. We are going to approve this Budget, but they are the people who will have to implement it. Let us look at the testimonials of those people to whom we are entrusting this Budget. I should like to refer here to the Auditor-General&#x2019;s report for the year 1970-71. In that financial year we find that although the revenue and expenditure account of the Estimates amounted to more than R225 000 000, the total bad debts that had to be written off totalled the small amount of R426 000. I say that this is truly an achievement. If we look at the thefts that took place we find that there were only 18 or 24 cases of irregularities involving the staff of the Post Office. The meagre amount of R5 100 was involved. However, it is tragic to say that there were many other cases, i.e. 1 764 cases of theft. The amount involved there is R104 000. And here I want to advocate that we, as members of the public and citizens of the country, must assist the Postmaster-General and his staff in completely exterminating this spirit of vandalism that prevails in a small sector of our people&#x2014;the small value they place on what they have. I referred, inter alia, to the revenue that was written off, and I should like to mention one more figure in that connection. Of the R63 000 that was written off in the relevant financial year as unrecoverable revenue, R54 000 was in respect of telephone services. This is absolutely minimal if one thinks of the number of transactions the Post Office deals with.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with the Government having made certain decisions in this House concerning the Post Office, we have now reached the stage where we must concern ourselves with the implementation of those decisions. Before I say a single word about what awaits us in the coming year, I just want to tell members that matters belonging not to a Third Reading debate, but to a Committee Stage debate, but which were nevertheless raised during the Third Reading, will be replied to in writing.</p>

<p>I should like to say a few words about the task awaiting us in the coming year. We, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, realize that we have a big task in getting our telecommunications system to function well. We realize that we have a task of developing this communications system and letting it function as satisfactorily as possible. In that respect there are three main requirements, as I see it. There are three main requirements for the effective and smooth functioning of our Post Office telecommunications system. The first is that we must have financial means at our disposal. That is the first requirement I want to refer to. Sufficient announcements have been made in this debate by myself and hon. members on my side to indicate in the light of the Franzsen Committee&#x2019;s recommendations&#x2014;which were accepted by the Government&#x2014;what financial means can be placed at our disposal to enable us to comply with the growing demands. This will <span class="col_4105-4106" refersTo="page_0515"/>give the Post Office elbow-room. These proposals, which were also accepted in principle by this House, will enable the Post Office to plan and implement that.</p>

<p>We also received an announcement from the Opposition about the same matter, i.e. from the hon. member for Orange Grove, that informed us that during this debate the Opposition would come along to this House to give us, and I use his own words, &#x201C;a clear-cut and concise policy for the country&#x201D;. We all listened with very great interest to this &#x201C;clear-cut and concise policy&#x201D; which is actually to serve as a counter to the explanations I gave here on behalf of the Government. What did that &#x201C;policy&#x201D; give us? It was really a case of a mountain not even bringing forth a mouse. In the Committee Stage we got the hon. members on the other side of the House to the point of admitting&#x2014;and it takes a great deal to get them that far&#x2014;that they are in favour of private entrepreneurs being offered greater opportunities. Do the hon. members know what the extent of private contributions to our telecommunications system is? Up to now we have already issued the following contracts to private entrepreneurs : for the installation of automatic exchanges we have issued 94 contracts amounting to R16 million; for the laying of cable systems we have given 27 contracts to private entrepreneurs amounting to R1.6 million and at the moment we are awaiting quotations from private entrepreneurs in respect of 48 contracts for automatic exchanges. If we add the recommendations of the Franzsen Committee in connection with the rental of buildings from private bodies, in connection with the rental of apparatus and in connection with negotiating loans overseas, I really think that we have specifically begun to harness the private sector on such a large scale that this matter is least of all something to complain about. If we take this into account it is the last aspect that must be put to us as a point of their so-called &#x201C;concise policy&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The second requirement laid down for the Post Office to fulfil its big task during this year is a dedicated labour force. However important financial means and the matters presented to us in this report and accepted by this House may be, human beings still remain the most important factor in any production undertaking. Fortunately the Post Office has a very dedicated and motivated labour corps. This is evident from the fact that they work these extra man-hours willingly and without compensation. It is also evident from ther responsible conduct in these economically difficult times and, lastly, it is evident from their attitude, their patriotic attitude as revealed in their press organs. This morning the hon. member for Koedoespoort quoted from one of these organs. I say that we are fortunate to have such a dedicated labour corps at our disposal. The labour corps is after all just like a person because it consists ultimately of people. Just as an individual would like to have safety, security and protection for his way of life, a labour corps also wants this. A labour corps is no different from the individuals composing it. Under this Government the labour corps in South Africa enjoys that security because we respect their way of life and their life pattern. As a result of the discussions conducted in this House, the question cropped up about how safe our labour corps can feel about the statements and the silences we have had from the United Party side. This silence of theirs creates in our labour corps a complete uncertainty in respect of the cardinal labour principles of the United Party. Despite everything I did from my side, and despite everything that hon. members on this side did, to get the United Party to the point where they would unequivocally state their standpoint about vital matters, they continued to shy away from every vital question put to them. The only two matters in respect of which the United Party was prepared to adopt a standpoint were, firstly, the question of controlled employment. They, of all people, are also in favour of controlled employment.</p>

<p>Fine! That is a very fine attitude to life. Let us see how the next requirement accords with that. The second matter in respect of which they also share our feelings is that the trade unions should be consulted. Then it appeared this morning that there is a very radical difference in our view of this matter. It goes without saying that the trade unions are important <span class="col_4107-4108" refersTo="page_0516"/>as far as the National Party is concerned. We continually consult them. I as Minister, the Minister of Transport and everyone who has anything to do with them, consult them continually, but we make no secret of telling them, and whoever it may be, that our task as a party is to protect the identity of the Whites. If a trade union like Tucsa, for example, were to give us advice &#x2026;</p>

<p>If, as a trade union federation, with its lot of subsidiaries, it were to give us advice that is contradictory to the interests of the Whites, this Government would not accept it. I told the hon. members that this morning and I am repeating it now. The United Party would not do that; oh no! They would be only too glad to hide behind such a conglomerate in the hope that they will have their integration policy implemented.</p>

<p>It is not only Oudtshoorn, but let me tell the hon. member for Yeoville that before and after Oudtshoorn we shall be chasing them with this until they are revealed for what they advocate, i.e. integration. The third requirement laid down for the Post Office in the performance of its big task this year, is that there must be confidence in South Africa. We can only obtain the necessary revenue to finance this big undertaking from our own sources if the economy is vigorous enough. Such a vigorous economy depends again on confidence in the country. This is an important matter as far as we are concerned. The National Party has confidence in South Africa, and we have clearly evidenced that confidence in South Africa in the Budget up to now. We have confidence, but in order to succeed fully and to enable the Post Office to obtain its maximum revenue, we need the public&#x2019;s confidence. What do we now get from a certain portion of the public in this connection&#x003F; What do we get from the other side, from the United Party in this connection. In this connection we have had a series of lamentations nourished by a negative and destructive attitude to life. Sir, in spite of this the Post Office goes to meet this year with confidence, and I am convinced that the Post Office will accomplish its task in spite of the fact that the Opposition has made no positive contribution to this matter. In the past year we have accomplished much under difficult circumstances, and I want to give you, Sir, and the country the assurance that the Post Office will achieve even greater success in the coming year.</p>

<p>Clause 2:</p>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, we return to clause 2 of this Bill because we are still hoping&#x2014;perhaps hoping against hope&#x2014; that the hon. the Minister is going to give us some idea of what exactly he has in mind with regard to the make-up of the council which he is now going to establish, because we have established in the Second Reading that this Bill is going to allow the hon. the Minister to appoint a certain number of people and allow a certain number of people to be elected, and that the total shall not be more than 30. The one thing that rather concerned me when the hon. the Minister was replying to the Second Reading debate was that he seemed to give the impression that it was more important in his mind to consult with the Indian Council than it was to take this House into his confidence and to tell us what he has in mind. Surely to goodness, if he is going to consult with the Indian Council, that consultation should already have taken place. He should have had the consultation and he should have been able to come to this House with a clear-cut <span class="col_4109-4110" refersTo="page_0517"/>plan and say that there will be 16 nominated members to 14 elected members, or some other ratio. Surely there must be some idea in his mind. We are concerned, and it was for that reason that I took hon. members opposite to task in the Second Reading debate because they were simply allowing the hon. the Minister to come before this House with something which is as completely vague and undefined and indeterminate as clause 2 of this Bill is. I appeal again to the hon. the Minister to give us some idea of what he is thinking about. Here he is going to constitute a council which for the first time will give the Indian people the right to elect members of their own race to represent them on that council which deals with their own affairs. Surely he must have some idea in his mind now. We feel that it would give this Bill itself and the idea of elected members of the council so much more weight and force if he could take us into his confidence. I resent it very much indeed that he appears to think that it is more important to consult with the Indian Council than with this House. He will consult with the Indian Council and then make up his mind, and the result of his deliberations will simply he put before this House by way of a proclamation, for which the opportunities of debate are very limited indeed. Sir, I again ask the hon. the Minister whether he can tell us more about clause 2 and what he has in mind.</p>

Hon. members opposite now accuse the Government that it never consults non-White leaders in this country, but that hon. member now suggests that the hon. the Minister should deal with this whole matter in this House. I think the hon. the Minister himself will furnish the hon. member with a reply in this connection. I should like to come back to another matter. You will recall, Sir, that the hon. member for Zululand said in the Second Reading debate that this proclamation, of which reference is made in clause 2, will never be discussed in this House. On that occasion I specifically asked on what grounds the hon. member for Zululand could say that those proclamations may not; be discussed in this House. As the hon. member for Zululand is unable to be here today, the hon. member for Mooi River, who is also a laywer, has an opportunity to rise and tell us why they suggest that it is impossible for these proclamations to be discussed here.</p>

<p>First of all, I would like to say that the hon. member for Houghton has written to me to say that there has apparently been a death in the family and that she has left for Johannesburg. She will not be here, therefore, to move the amendment which stands in her name on the Order Paper. She discussed the matter with me, and she was well aware that the amendment which she proposed to move was not acceptable to me. As hon. members know, I stated at the Second Reading that as far as I was concerned, this was not going to be a fully elected council.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Mooi River has referred to what he called the &#x201C;vagueness&#x201D; of this clause. In the first instance perhaps I could give him this explanation. If he looks at subsection (4) of this clause he will see that it states that 25 will be appointed and five will be elected; this is how the Indian Council is going to <span class="col_4111-4112" refersTo="page_0518"/>operate at this stage. The basis of further development of the Indian Council, after the period of office of the new council has transpired will be discussed by me with the Indian Council as far as the elections are concerned. I say quite frankly &#x2014;I make no bones about it&#x2014;that I am going to discuss that matter with them. The hon. members will have every opportunity to discuss the decision.

This is the way we intend doing it, and the hon. members will have all the opportunity as a parliamentary Opposition to criticize whatever decision is reached when the proclamation is placed on the Table of this House. The hon. members will also remember that they tried to make out that they would not have the promulgation before them, until it was pointed out that they would have it before them; so they must not pretend that they are kept in the dark; every opportunity will be there, but as far for discussing the matter with them beforehand, I am not prepared to do it.

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>That means that the hon. the Minister is suggesting that the maximum number that can be elected if he so desires after consultation, will be five out of the 25. In other words, whatever the Indian Council indicates to be their wishes, there will be bound to be only five elected members and he will have to come back to this House to change that position. That is the first point. The second point I want to raise with the Minister is this. One appreciates the position in regard to proclamations which may be issued under this <span class="col_4113-4114" refersTo="page_0519"/>Act. Sir, there are two ways of considering legislation. The one is to ask a person to change his mind after he has committed himself, and that would be the case if the proclamation is issued and is then debated under the Minister&#x2019;s Vote. We will then be in the position of having a proclamation which is of force and effect. Then we must debate it and ask the Minister to say that it is wrong and he must change his mind. But I believe the whole basis of democratic Government is that when there is a proposal to put something into operation, the Government discusses it and hears the views of the Opposition. We have a democratic parliamentary function to perform in terms of which we can voice views which are contrary to those of the Minister, and then the Minister weighs the views one against the other. I do believe that that rule by proclamation is an undesirable procedure. It is certainly easier for the hon. the Minister simply to make a proclamation and then to come and defend it afterwards instead of discussing it first, and then he has to go through the whole procedure of amending it after proclamation. I hope the Minister will realize that that is the significance and the basis of our discussion with him on this point, that this is now being removed from the Parliamentary purview to the extent that it will be an <i>expost facto</i> discussion. Only after the event has taken place, will we have an opportunity of discussing it with the Minister and saying whether we think he was wise or not. I believe it is an undesirable procedure to adopt this legislation. We do not for one moment say that he must not consult the council. By all means, he must consult the Indian Council; he must consult those persons and ascertain their views, but then those views should be debated here before a decision is arrived at. That is our complaint about this clause, and that is why we feel that it is not desirable in the form in which it is.</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister has now indicated his intention of retaining the 25 existing members who shall all be appointed and that the additional five members who will be required to extend the council to 30 members will be elected. Considerable confusion has arisen, because in terms of subsection (2) of this clause it is provided that any proclamation in terms of this section may be amended by the State President by proclamation after consultation by the Minister with the council. As I read it, this allows the Minister by proclamation to be able to vary the situation between the number of appointed and the number of elected members, as indicated in subsection (1) of this clause where no specific mention is made of how many members are to be appointed and how many are to be elected. What is of importance is that the council as it now stands, the way it is constituted, will retain those 25 appointed members until such time as the Minister might wish to vary the situation by proclamation. But as the clause now stands this could be done on that basis. The hon. the Minister has indicated that he wishes to consult the Indian Council on these matters, and he said during an earlier stage of the debate that he had the support of the Indian Council for a number of these matters. However, this specific and important matter of the number of elected and the number of appointed members of the council, was referred to by the chairman of the executive committee of the council who recently expressed an opinion and it would be interesting to know what the Minister&#x2019;s reactions are in regard to this matter. Mr. A. M. Rajab, the chairman of the council&#x2019;s executive committee, said, according to a Press report on 15th March, that he welcomed the move to increase the membership to 30, and then he went on to say that he would like all council members to be elected so that the stigma that the council was a Government-controlled body would be lifted. He said that for a start there could be no objection if at least 40 per cent of the members were elected. So this appears to be the thinking of the chairman of the executive committee of the council, who will also of course retain its position in the council in terms of the legislation that is now before us. They have clearly indicated through the mouthpiece of the chairman of their Executive Committee, that they could see no objection to having at least 40 per cent of the 30 members that are provided for in this clause elected although they preferred to see the whole council elected. However, the hon. the Minister disclosed this afternoon that he intends to have only five of those 30 members elected by the Indian people as such. Here I think we require further elucidation from the hon. the Minister in regard to the feeling and attitude of the Indian Council, whom he says he has consulted and from whom he says he has received support as far as this measure is <span class="col_4115-4116" refersTo="page_0520"/>concerned. This is perhaps the most important clause in this Bill. We have now heard from the hon. the Minister that he interprets the legislation in this way, that there shall only be five elected members to this council. It will be interesting to hear whether the hon. the Minister agrees that this matter can be amended by way of proclamation as contained in subsection (2). I should also like to know what the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attitude is in regard to the view that has been expressed by the chairman of the executive committee of that Indian Council.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we on this side of the House are very disturbed at the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attitude in regard to this clause. He says that the clause can be interpreted clearly as meaning that there is going to be five elected members and 25 nominated members. I want to ask the hon. the Minister why he did not state that clearly in the clause itself. What was the difficulty&#x003F; Surely this House needs to be taken seriously. When the hon. the Minister comes with a Bill in which he means something, why does he not say what he means&#x003F; The way I read this clause, it is certainly not as clear as the hon. the Minister likes to think it is. If the hon. the Minister wants to have five elected members, why on earth did he not state in the Bill that there was going to be five elected and 25 nominated members&#x003F; Is there any reason why he should hide this fact from the House by wording it like this in the Bill&#x003F; The hon. member for Umbilo is perfectly correct. The Indian Council has asked for a fully elected council. The Minister himself tells us that he prefers to consult with the Indian Council rather than with us on this side of the House.</p>

<p>Keep quiet for a moment! The Minister said that he preferred to consult with the Indian Council rather than with us here on the Opposition side. If this is how he consults with the council, he certainly ignores every bit of advice he receives from them. They have asked for a fully elected council. We are not debating that particular point at the moment. The Minister now says that five of these councillors can be elected. I want to know where that is clearly stated in the Bill&#x003F;</p>

<p>I should like to go a bit deeper into this. In electing five members for the new council, he is going to have to draw up voters&#x2019; rolls, and so on. Having drawn up the voters&#x2019; rolls, which will allow every Indian who qualifies to have a vote, would it make any difference whether the number is five or 25 or 29&#x003F; He will have to go through the same machinery to do so. He will have to go through all this work to elect the small number of five out of the 30. I do not believe that the hon. the Minister is doing jusitce to this House by bringing forward a Bill so badly worded as this. If this is what he means, why did he not put it in clear and plain English&#x003F;</p>

<p>Then in subsection 3 (a) of this clause he talks about the qualifications of the candidates and of voters. Here again, why are the qualifications of the candidates and the voters not clearly stated&#x003F; Is there any reason why this cannot be stated as well&#x003F; It seems to me that this particular clause is so badly worded that the Minister can virtually do anything he likes under this clause. It seems to cover a multitude of sins.</p>

<p>It is quite clear that they did not do so. They are now hiding behind what the chairman of the Indian Council was supposed to have said.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>It seems to me that the hon. member for Koedoespoort was not here when we discussed the Second Reading of this Bill. The hon. member for Berea voiced specifically the point about the statement made by Mr. Rajab, the chairman of the Indian Council. What is happening now is that the hon. the Minister is going to all the trouble of registering Indian voters. He has to consult with the Indian Council, first of all, to establish qualifications of voters and candidates. He then has to register all those voters, after which he will have to decide on constituencies&#x2014;all for the purpose of electing five members to a council on which there are 25 nominated members. All this has to be done for the purpose of consulting with that council of 25 nominated and five elected members as to what they want the future of the council to be. At this stage we know already out of the mouth of the chairman of the council that they want a fully elected council. Surely to goodness, it would have been more to the point if the hon. the Minister had come before the House with a statement that he was going to have a council which would have more than five elected members at least&#x2014;whatever you want the number to be, even if there were only 14 elected and 16 nominated members to give them a majority of nominated members on the council. I think the hon. the Minister is really being self-defeating in clause 2 of this Bill because he has got to put himself to endless trouble merely to elect five people. Then the hon. the Minister says that we are trying to make political capital out of a thing like this when, out of the kindness of our hearts, we came here to support him with this Bill. I fail to understand where the political capital comes from. We are supporting the principle which he has in his Bill, as has been explained to him in detail during the Second Reading. We feel that he is going an awfully wrong way round to get himself back just to the edge of square one. When he gets to the edge of square one, then he knows he is going to get to the stage where the chairman and the council are going to ask him for a fully elected council.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we made it quite clear during the Second Reading that it was the tradition in South Africa for all legislative authorities to develop in this way, in other words, by means of an evolutionary, constitutional process of development. In the initial stages such a body is usually a fully appointed body. In the various and subsequent stages this authority is gradually transferred into the hands of the elected members. This is merely the first stage of such constitutional development. I really do not know what the hon. member is so concerned about. We all know that this situation is not a static one. It is an evolutionary, constitutional development.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Koedoespoort is obviously confused about this question. He did not get the position clear in the Second Reading debate. In order to assist him, I would like to read what Mr. Rajab himself has said, so that he can know what the position is. It appeared in <i>Fiat Lux,</i> an official publication. Mr. Rajab is quoted quite specifically. He said:</p>

<block name="quote">With the preparation of voters&#x2019; rolls, and other electoral machinery necessary for holding elections, having been completed in the near future, and with the delimitation of electoral boundaries being determined, it is envisaged that the Indian Council will be fully elected by the people themselves.</block>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>We made it quite clear that it is the policy of this party to have a wholly elected Indian council. We use the argument of Mr. Rajab to indicate that he, as the chairman of the executive committee of the present council, was of the opinion that this should be the position. I fail to understand members opposite who cannot see that this is an expression of opinion from a responsible person, a member of the executive of the Indian Council. I cannot understand why the hon. the Minister is not prepared to admit that <span class="col_4119-4120" refersTo="page_0522"/>this is an expression of opinion and accept it as such. There is no need further to consult on the question of allowing just five members, when Mr. Rajab has made his position quite clear, having said &#x201C;fully elected by the people themselves&#x201D;. Then he says:</p>

<p>Now I come to another point I want to put to the hon. member for Green Point. We have had all this lovely soapbox oratory about democracy, about Parliament being a democratic machine and about this promulgation being something terrible. Let me point out to him that under the United Party Government in he old days hundreds of proclamations were made without the consent of Parliament. They were simply put on the Table of the House and accepted or criticized. Why then all this nonsense over an issue like this&#x003F; The whole basis of government of the country is by way of proclamation. Parliament is a machine which serves the purpose of criticism but the running of the country is by proclamation. Hon. members who have had experience will know it. The country has to be run also by proclamation. Parliament is not always in session, and the government of the country still has to continue. So all this business about this being a terrible, undemocratic way of doing things, is absolute nonsense.</p>

<p>Now I want to come to the hon. member for Berea. He quoted Mr. Rajab. Obviously I do not deny the quotation read out to the House. I appreciate the situation. But I consulted with the Indian Council. The hon. member for Green Point indicated that I was going to face them with a <i>fait accompli.</i></p>

<p>The hon. member also mentioned the council. He said &#x201C;Now that the five members have been appointed you go back to the Indian Council&#x201D;. I do not. I have already discussed the matter with the Indian Council. When this term of office expires, the question of what should happen for the future constitution will be discussed with them. They will be consulted in the matter. The hon. member for Port Natal asked why I did not say in the Bill itself that 25 members would be nominated and five elected. I did it for the simple reason that the Bill states quite clearly that from time to time, as a new council is to be constituted, these consultations will go on with regard to the elected members. Why should I then put in a Bill that five members will be elected, when the matter is going to be handled from time to time in what I regard as the proper way of doing it&#x003F; I am sorry that the hon. member feels that I should come to him and to Parliament and let Parliament and the Opposition tell me or give me advice on how many members should be elected and how many should be appointed. I am prepared to go to the Indian Council and discuss it with them, and the <i>fait accompli</i> will be promulgated in this House. That is how it is going to be. It is what has happened in the past in regard to so many matters. This atmosphere hon. members opposite are trying to create about the terrible action of the Minister is quite incorrect, because if I had said that I was never going to consult with the Indian Council they could have said that it was a dictatorial way of doing it, but that is not so. They feel that I should consult them about it.</p>

<p>I can answer the hon. member immediately. He is quite correct. It is laid down in the Bill that the first reconstituted Indian Council of 25 nominated and five elected members will retain office until the terms of office of the appointed members have expired. Then the formula for a newly reconstituted council will be submitted to the Indian Council and discussed with them. The hon. members opposite talk about &#x201C;vagueness&#x201D;, but as is allowed for in this Bill, the number of elected members can then be, instead of five, a larger number. But this is a matter in which consultation will take place with the Indian Council.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>This Bill is before Parliament. The hon. member for Turffontein should not try to create an atmosphere that does not exist. My consultation is with the Indian Council. That is what I intend to do in future. As far as Parliament is concerned, I want to say that the decisions reached will be promulgated and will then be discussed in Parliament. The hon. member can then discuss it when my Vote comes before the House, or at any other opportunity that comes his way. The formula that will be applied in the appointment and election of members of the council will be adopted after consultation with the Indian Council. That is what I have stated and that is what is meant.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Mooi River, was in my opinion, able to convey to this committee the many problems that faced myself and the department in connection with this arrangement. He is quite right. There is no statutory election roll for the Indian Council. All these matters have to be worked out. All I can say to the hon. member, and I think he will agree with me, is that the people who will understand the situation more than anyone else, are the Indian Council members themselves. Those are the people who will be consulted on every one of these points. This Bill provides that the Indian Council will be consulted in connection with, for instance, the areas or provinces which elected members of the council shall represent, the procedures to be followed in the nomination of candidates and the qualifications of candidates and voters. All these matters will be sorted out with the Indian Council. It is impossible to lay down all the details in a statute, but it will be done in the manner that is laid down in this Bill. I do not know why hon. members on that side of the House think that there is something very bad and sinister in the way in which we are handling this matter. The Indian Council does not. We discussed the matter in full with the Indian Council. The amazing thing is that they accept the situation, but the hon. members on that side of the House do not. [Interjections.] The hon. members in my opinion approach the matter in the wrong way. They do not approach the matter in the light of what is in the interests of the Indian community. I am <span class="col_4123-4124" refersTo="page_0524"/>the responsible Minister, and the whole point is that they are of the opinion that the powers which I have, or the powers which the State President has, are too much. Here we have the situation that the Indian Council agrees with this arrangement, but the hon. members on that side of the House disagree with it. That I cannot understand.</p>

<p>He may have. That may be so, but all I can tell this House is that this was accepted by the Indian Council. It was not even accepted with any dissenting votes. It was a procedure that they accepted. Quite frankly, they appreciated it. The one thing that I wanted to do was to get this legislation under way. I did not want to hold it over for a few years while I sorted out all the details which the hon. member for Port Natal thinks I should sort out and lay down in legislation. I wanted to allow much of this by promulgation and do it immediately. I wanted to give them a basis and therefore introduced this skeleton of five elected members. All this is accepted. I want to ask hon. members opposite to be reasonable about it. This is the situation.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I rise to reply to four points raised by the hon. the Minister. In regard to the first one, I should like to say to him quite clearly and categorically that it ill behoves a sawdust Caesar to talk about soap-box oratory to other people. The hon. the Minister made a statement and I wonder whether he realized the significance of it and whether his colleagues realized the significance of what he said. He said that this country is run by proclamation, that we have government by proclamation and that that is a normal form of government. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister is speaking out of the arrogance of a pocket dictator or whether he is talking out of ignorance. It is far-fetched to suggest that we have reached a stage of parliamentary government in South Africa where we run things bureaucratically, by proclamations coming from departments and that that is now the basis of government. I hope the hon. the Minister will think again about his words when he reads his Hansard.</p>

<p>I hope he will think again about his words and whether he really means that this country is to be run by proclamation. I want to tell him that that approach to government is one that we on this side of the House will fight day in and day out as long as Parliament exists. There can be no question of government by proclamation.</p>

<p>The second question I want to ask the hon. the Minister is whether he is suggesting that the Parliament of the Republic of South Africa must accept the views of a statutory creature which it itself has created, namely the Indian Council. What the hon. the Minister is saying is that, when he has consulted the Indian Council and has obtained their views, he must issue a proclamation and Parliament must accept it. What is the sovereign authority in this country, if it is not this Parliament&#x003F; But apparently we are not to be consulted. We can merely discuss afterwards what has taken place. I want to remind the hon. the Minister that this is a complete change of policy so far as the Government is concerned. Its first effort, its first step or action in Parliament to create some form of self-government was the Transkei Constitution. The hon. the Minister knows that that constitution cannot be changed in any way or altered without a resolution of both Houses of Parliament. It is true that the Government has unfortunately departed from that principle with regard to some of the other legislative authorities. That was, however, the basic and proper approach which is enshrined in the constitution of the Transkei. The hon. the Minister now feels that that is of no value.</p>

<p>I have just one final point to refer to the hon. the Minister who said we were raising questions here for party political gain. Perhaps the hon. the Minister is unaware of the fact that no Indian can vote any one of us into Parliament. I do not know where the party political gain comes in when we <span class="col_4125-4126" refersTo="page_0525"/>are fighting for what we believe is right for a disenfranchised group of the country so far as this Parliament is concerned. The hon. the Minister suggested we are doing this for party political gain. I hope that there again he will think again before making stupid remarks of that nature in this House.</p>

They insist upon it that certain numbers must be appointed by the Administrator. Now these hon. members come and tell me how we should conduct our affairs in South Africa. I do think that this clause is a workable clause which allows the elasticity needed for the handling of a subject like this and the hon. member for Mooi River is aware of it.

On that basis, it has two and a half years to run.

<p>Unless he has got it all ready, but I do not believe that this is so. We have to start from scratch to create the mechanics of bringing this into operation. With only 2&#x00BD; years left for the Indian Council, the present <span class="col_4127-4128" refersTo="page_0526"/>council, it would mean that anybody elected, even with the best will in the world, would probably not serve for more than a year before the council&#x2019;s time has run out. I hope the Minister has borne in mind that the people who will be elected will have a very short term of office before that period runs out. I hope the Minister appreciates that and therefore appreciates the urgency of getting this started. Then we are on the same ground.</p>

<p>Before I sit down, I would like to say something else to the hon. the Minister. He asked who disenfranchised the Indians. I would like to remind the hon. the Minister that this side of the House did not disenfranchise the Indians in 1949.

<p>It was the intention of this side of the House to seek to move an amendment in line 17 which would cause the line to read: &#x201C;in such proportion as the Minister, after consultation with the council, may deem equitable&#x201D;. In terms of the Rules of the House we were told that this would be broadening the scope of this Bill. This I accept, but in the light of many other clauses where it is entrenched that there will be consultation with the council, I wish to ask the hon. the Minister to give the Committee the assurance that this particular step will be taken after consultation with the council.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I give the hon. member that assurance. I can say that I have already discussed the matter of the geographical division with members of the council. If I remember correctly, the suggestion of the five was that one should be from the Cape Province, one from the Transvaal and three from Natal. However, no finality has been reached. It is a matter in regard to which a decision will be reached after consultation with the Indian Council itself.</p>

<p>Clause 4:</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. L. F. WOOD : Sir, I wish to move the amendment standing in my name on page 204 of the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</block>

<block name="quote">In lines 20 and 21, to omit &#x201C;capable of being&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Subclause (3) of clause 4 reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No person shall be appointed or be capable of being elected as a member of the council &#x2026; if he is not permanently resident in the Republic &#x2026; (or) &#x2026; if he holds an office of profit in the service of the State.</block>

<p>It is this particular section to which I wish to refer, because as I understood the hon. the Minister when he dealt with this matter in the Second Reading debate, he made it clear that the intention was that teachers would be incapable of being elected to the council. The object of our amendment is to provide that at least they shall not be precluded from offering themselves as candidates for election. If members of the teaching profession are not allowed to stand, they can obviously never be elected, but if members of the teaching profession are prepared to stand for election, they should be allowed to do so. Should they be elected, then it will become necessary for them to resign from their teaching post, which is an office of profit in the service of the State. I believe that this suggestion deserves the very serious and sympathetic consideration of the Minister. I want to point out to him what the position is in this House at the present moment. I just want to give a few details which I think will illustrate my point of view most succinctly. The present Minister of National Education, Senator Van der Spuy, was in the teaching profession; the previous Minister of Education, Senator De Klerk, now the President of the Senate, was in the teaching profession. When we come to the House of Assembly, as at present constituted, we find that we have two Ministers&#x2014;I think my facts are correct &#x2014;the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development and the hon. the Minister of Information and of Immigration, who were members of the teaching profession. But, in addition, we have the hon. members for Algoa, Worcester, Durban Central, Carletonville, Germiston, Koedoespoort, Hercules and, I believe, Kempton Park; all of them were in the teaching profession.</p>

I also want to put it to the hon. the Minister that as far as I am aware, there is no provision which prevents a Bantu teacher from being elected or standing for election in the Transkei, and I do not believe that in so far as Coloured teachers are concerned, they are precluded from being eligible for election either. I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister not to deprive this embryo Indian Parliament, for which the Indians themselves hold out such great hopes, of a solid corps of intellectual people who I believe have reached the stage of development where they can play a constructive and notable part in the deliberations of the council. At least give them an opportunity to stand for election and at least give the Indian community the opportunity either of electing or rejecting them at the polls.</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to support the amendment of the hon. member <span class="col_4131-4132" refersTo="page_0528"/>for Berea as I believe this amendment has a direct effect on the functioning of the council and on its future functioning, particularly in view of the fact that a clause which still has to be dealt with, clause 8, specifically outlines the functions to be delegated to and administered by the executive of this new council to be that of education and community welfare. I assume that by &#x201C;community welfare&#x201D; the hon. the Minister intends social welfare, pensions and other aspects dealing with community welfare. Obviously there will be an interest in the affairs of this council from Indians in those two professions : the profession of education, the educationists, and those people who are professional welfare workers and social workers who occupy posts which may deprive them of the opportunity of being elected to this council. I think it is indeed in the interests of the council to encourage people of these two professions to be elected to this council, whereby they can make definite contributions to the functioning of this council. I therefore think the hon. member for Berea in moving this amendment is really doing a service to the Minister in assisting him in creating a more effective council to represent the Indian community. We will have the situation whereby the Indian community will be deprived of the services and the experience of these people, like educationists and social welfare workers and other professional people, who can render such services. I hope the Minister will see his way clear to accept this amendment, which is in the interest of the council as a whole and of the Indian community.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF INDIAN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I think the position is that there is no prohibition on a person who is a teacher to stand for the council. It is the same situation which applies to all elections. The point is that, as hon. members will see, the original Bill refers to a person who holds a post in the Public Service. But this has been changed to holding a position of profit in the service of the State. From that point of view it is not a bar to any intellectual. The only point is that he cannot hold a post of profit in the service of the State and at the same time stand for election. This matter was thrashed out fully in the Indian Council. Do not forget that the disciplinary code in the service is such that a teacher for example who criticizes the department would be guilty of a disciplinary offence against the department. The normal procedure is that a man resigns as a teacher, after which he can say what he likes. It is a process which is of general application. The hon. member referred to members on this side. All the members of the Opposition who were teachers before they became members of Parliament, resigned from the teaching profession. You have them here and you have them on that side of the House.</p>

<p>Mr. Rajab, for instance, who is chairman of the executive committee, in his early days was a teacher. He therefore did not go into this with a prejudice against teachers. He considered what was best under all the circumstances. I should like to point out to the hon. member for Berea that I went into this matter immediately I saw his amendment on the Order Paper. I will tell the hon. member what advice I got from the legal advisers. I discussed the omission of the relative words with them, and they say that the words must be retained. The word &#x201C;capable&#x201D; refers to the qualifications of a candidate. It refers purely to the qualifications; it does not refer to his person, to him as an individual. He may be a first-class individual. It refers to his qualifications. And in regard to the qualification, it has been laid down on what basis you can stand as a member of the council.</p>

<p>It reads that &#x201C;if he does not have the relevant qualification prescribed by proclamation in terms of sec. 1A&#x201D;. I think these are qualifications quite different from the disqualifications. I think clause 6 talks about disqualification. If he cannot be disqualified, he can stand. If he has a position of profit in the service of the State, then he cannot stand. That is the recognized position in our electoral system as far as the White people are concerned.

If the words &#x201C;no person shall be capable of being elected if he holds an office of profit in the service of the State&#x201D; in clause 4 are adopted, then the hon. the Minister won&#x2019;t be able to say that a teacher is a qualified person to stand for election.

I think the position is still in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s hands as to what the qualifications should be.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want the Minister to clear up some doubt in my mind. Today White teachers are capable of standing for election. After they are nominated they are not permitted to hold an office of profit under the State. They must no longer be in State employment, which means that they can resign the night before, or whatever the case may be. But the process of establishing oneself as a candidate starts a long time before the date of nomination. It is now going to be that no person holding an office of profit in the service of the State is capable of being elected&#x003F; Does it mean that, for argument&#x2019;s sake, no teacher, welfare worker or anybody else, can make himself or herself available for nomination&#x003F; I think this is a limitation on the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own powers, which I am sure he does not want. If he wants to say that teachers will be eligible to stand for the council he has to take out the words &#x201C;capable of being elected&#x201D;; because without taking out those words, no person who has an office of profit under the State can make himself available even for party nomination with a view to ultimate election. This is our concern. I am sure the hon. the Minister can see the point, that he is virtually cutting out the whole of the teaching profession from any chance of being capable of being elected. They cannot be elected in terms of this provision.</p>

That is my interpretation of the words &#x201C;capable of being elected.&#x201D; That signifies the situation. I went to the trouble of going into the matter with the law advisers.

<p>I do so following a point I made in my Second Reading speech. I could see that under this clause the Minister must have quite clear definitions as to how and when a member of the council can be dismissed from that council. I agree with those which he set out very fully. I believe that they are quite essential and I can find no fault with them at all. I explained to the Minister in my Second Reading speech that paragraph (h) caused me some concern. In terms of this paragraph it is possible for the Minister to dismiss from the council, after consultation with them, a person deemed unfit to be a member of the council. I agree, too, with the Minister that this may on occasions be necessary but, as I said in the Second Reading debate, I would by far prefer that all the conditions for dismissal are clearly stated in this clause. I can foresee that if the Minister, acting on the advice of the council, were to dismiss a member when it is not clearly stated why, and if this member was elected, the people who elected him could cause all sorts of difficulties for the council and the Minister. The Minister may not wish, for instance, to publicize why he or the council has decided to act against that particular member. He may have very good reasons, but obviously he cannot state them publicly without running the risk of damages. So he would not like to make a statement. But I think that, if these reasons were stated in the council and this clause was altered in terms of the amendment which I moved, with the approval of the council, at least then the Minister&#x2019;s defence would be that it was the council itself who acted against the member.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister can dismiss a nominated member. That is entirely a different matter. I am concerned with the man who is elected by the voters. Those voters send him to the council. The Minister may have perfectly good reasons to dismiss that man; there is no argument about that. In fact, the various reasons are set out in this clause for the dismissal of a member. The Minister also says that he can dismiss a man for reasons not stated here. I believe that when a member of the council is an elected member and the Minister should choose to dismiss that man, he would be running a grave risk of destroying that council because the electors themselves might be his greatest critics. I want to try to strengthen the hand of the council in this case and to take the onus off the Minister, so that if the council approves of the dismissal of a member, then one assumes it will only approve of the dismissal by a majority, otherwise it would not be approval. If the elected member then says that he has been dismissed unfairly, the decision would, at least, have been taken by a majority of the council; it would then not be the prerogative of the Minister. He would not get the blame. The council will not be brought into disrepute. One must face facts. A man may be dismissed perfectly legitimately, but he will obviously make propaganda that he was dismissed unfairly. We will not be able to deny this unless you are prepared to run the risk of all sorts of action being taken. I would like to see this amendment introduced into this clause. I believe it will strengthen the hand of the council and will obviate a good deal of trouble that could possibly arise in future.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to speak on the amendment standing in my name on the Order Paper in respect of paragraph (f) which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the condition of his health becomes such that the Minister, acting on the advice of a registered medical practitioner, considers him unfit for further service on the Council and informs him in writing accordingly.</block>

<p>During the Second Reading debate certain doubts were expressed on this side of the House and reasons were sought for the intention behind this particular paragraph. The Minister gave reasons which we accepted as being valid. We move this particular amendment suggesting that the words &#x201C;recommendation of at least two registered medical practitioners, one of whom shall be a specialist&#x201D;, should be substituted for the wording as it stands in the clause. We did this because we felt that in view of the Minister&#x2019;s explanation during the Second Reading debate, this could improve the position and possibly leave the Minister in a much stronger position than he would be with the clause as it stands now. Last night the Minister gave an example. I too wish to give an example of what could happen under these circumstances. If the Minister operates under this paragraph and he removes a person from the council acting on the advice of a registered medical practitioner to the effect that he is regarded as being unfit, and this particular person, who may not necessarily be in the same poor condition of health as the gentleman to whom the Minister referred, could decide to seek other medical advice and goes to another doctor to get a certificate which is contrary to the Minister&#x2019;s and has that certificate endorsed by a specialist&#x2014;and I believe this is not impossible&#x2014;the situation may arise where the Minister or the council may be placed in an embarrassing position. This was the reason which activated our amendment in this respect. I have been advised by the hon. the Minister that he is prepared to accept at least two registered medical practitioners and we on this side of the House are not going to take issue with the hon. the Minister as to whether one should be a specialist or not, although we believe that this may be desirable. But in view of the Minister&#x2019;s undertaking that he will move such an amendment, I wish to withdraw the amendment standing in my name on the Order Paper.</p>

<p>May I not discuss the idea of the hon. the Minister moving such an amendment in the Other Place&#x003F; This is my request to him, because I believe that it is of vital importance to the council. As I understand the position, the proceedings at meetings of the council will be privileged but I can imagine that some of the meetings of the council will be open to the Press. Now, if the onus is on the hon. the Minister to remove a certain person from the council, he will be covering himself and he will be in a much stronger position to make it quite clear to everybody that the removal was taking place for a very real and genuine reason, because on a privileged occasion a reason will be able to be given which will satisfy the people outside that it is being done for a very good reason. It will be able to be reported in the Press if the council itself so decides. I think the Minister will have to use this power, and he will admit it, with the utmost circumspection. It is not something that can be done right and left. It is something that will be a very serious step indeed and I honestly think that the hon. the Minister would be covering himself, the council and the status of the council, if he were to move in the Other Pace that this amendment should be inserted in the Bill.</p>

<p>These matters will be discussed fully with them. We specifically mention education and community welfare, because these are matters which we are quite satisfied can be completely handled by the council.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Natal mentioned housing, group areas, and so forth, in connection with community welfare. Of course, these matters do not come under my portfolio at all. This clause deals with powers that I can delegate to these people. I have just received a note which says that this clause deals with the delegation of powers and that I, or any other Minister, can only delegate powers assigned to me by Acts of Parliament. I have no powers with regard to group areas, neither have I any powers with regard to housing. All I handle are those aspects of community welfare that come under my department. These are pensions, like old-age pensions and so forth. The Bill refers to the delegation of powers in regard to community welfare and not in regard to social matters. The hon. member is quite right when he says that, for instance, a housing problem is a social matter. In this Bill reference is made to community welfare and I can delegate powers in connection with community welfare to this council. The matters in regard to which I am quite happy to delegate powers to this council are the matters which they can handle for their own people.</p>

<p>There is another point which I should like the hon. the Minister to clarify. Subsection (4) brings into account the fact that there may be certain other powers which the Administrator of a province may wish to have delegated to this executive committee. If one considers the question of Indian hospitalization, where today you have a large Indian hospital in the Chatsworth area, which has an Indian advisory board appointed by the provincial council, one realizes that such a situation may arise where certain health matters and hospitals may fall under the jurisdiction of this executive committee. In the event of such delegation being desirable, is it necessary also for the Minister to ratify the position in terms of subsection (4), or can the Administrator and the executive committee delegate those powers to this executive committee of the Indian Council&#x003F; My question therefore is whether the hon. the Minister must also ratify any delegation of further powers to the executive committee in terms of subsection (4).</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_indian_affairs">

<p>Mr. Chairman, subsection (4), to which the hon. member has referred, states specifically that &#x201C;the executive committee of a province may by notice in the <i>Gazette</i> delegate any power conferred upon it or the Administrator concerned&#x201D;. For instance if in the province of Natal they want to delegate certain powers to the executive committee of the Indian Council, I would say the executive committee of the province, presumably with the approval of the Administrator, will delegate those powers to the Executive Committee of the Indian Council.</p>

<heading>MINES, WORKS AND MINERALS IN SOUTH-WEST AFRICA AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading resumed)</summary>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House will support the Second Reading of this Bill. However, I should like to make it quite clear that it is well-nigh three weeks since the hon. the Minister made his Second Reading speech. I take exception to the fact that the Order Paper has been so arranged that there has been this large hiatus between the Second Reading speech of the Minister and the opportunity given to this side of the House to reply. I think things could have been arranged a little better to keep the continuity of this debate going. It breaks the debate and one feels that a certain amount of interest in the matter has been lost during this very long period between the Second Reading speech of the Minister and today&#x2019;s continuation of the debate.</p>

<p>There are several matters in this Bill which I should like to discuss with the hon. the Minister. Perhaps the hon. the Minister will later have an opportunity of enlarging upon these matters. We all realize the great importance of the mining industry and the great role it is playing in the economy of our country. It follows that if those individuals and companies who are prepared to search for and prospect for deposits of minerals in any part of our country, if they are going to spend large sums of money, time, etc., on the search, we, as a responsible body, must give these people every reasonable opportunity and every encouragement. At the same time, in view of the fact that, in South-West Africa particularly, the mineral rights remain vested in the State. I would say that the owners of the land where these minerals may be present, should receive special attention. How can we do this&#x003F; The Minister has seen fit to bring into being a board,</p>

<p>which I think is a satisfactory one. It will consist of people who are interested in mining operations and in agricultural fields as well. This will be presided over by a magistrate, and they will settle any differences. But every man who has a piece of land, especially if he feels there is something valuable there, will naturally want the best possible compensation for any inconvenience he may suffer as a result of prospecting or mining operations. The hon. the Minister rightly has appointed this body to discuss these matters with the parties concerned. However, I would say that when operations are taking place to see whether a piece of land is valuable from a mining point of view, the owner of the land should be given full details of what has been discovered. If he is told that gold has been found on a piece of ground&#x2014;or uranium or diamonds&#x2014;he will be able to judge to what extent his piece of land is going to be disturbed. He will then be able to judge whether this disturbance is going to be of a permanent nature or whether it is only going to be temporary. For that reason I would urge the hon. the Minister to make sure that the owner of a piece of land, on which prospecting is going to be done or mining operations are going to be carried out, will be fully informed of what is going to take place. He will then be able to know what section of his land is going to be wasteland as far as he is concerned, and that he will not be able to cultivate that land or use it for grazing or any other purpose. He will also be able to assess what the land which is virtually going to be taken away from him, is going to be worth.</p>

<p>There is another matter in this Bill which concerns a similar type of consideration. In terms of three clauses in this Bill, the hon. the Minister is going to take away the custom that has been in vogue up to now, in that notices will no longer have to appear in the <i>Government Gazette.</i> I think the hon. the Minister is making a mistake. I have listened to what the hon. the Minister said. He said that the purchasing and reading of the <i>Gazette</i> is going out of vogue and that very few people buy the <i>Gazette.</i> Consequently he felt it would be sufficient if the notices were placed outside the mining commissioner&#x2019;s office. It is not only the people in the immediate vicinity who are interested in what takes place on a piece of land. It is not only the people in the vicinity who want to know where discoveries are being made, but this is vital <span class="col_4145-4146" refersTo="page_0535"/>information of which the whole of the mining community should be informed. For that reason I say that it should not be necessary for people on the Reef or people in Johannesburg, to have to go to Windhoek or to a mining commissioner&#x2019;s office to find out what is taking place. They would continually have to wait to see what notices are being put up. I urge the Minister to reconsider this matter and to continue publishing notice of mining activities in South-West Africa in the <i>Government Gazette.</i> The hon. the Minister also mentioned that he thought it was an unnecessary expenditure.</p>

<p>The expense will actually be negligible. I think he should think again on this particular matter and make full use of the <i>Gazette</i> issued by the Government.</p>

<p>Another problem in regard to which I do not have clarity at all, is the control of mining operations in those areas which are going to be set aside or which have already been set aside for the Bantu. I would like the hon. the Minister to tell the House whether or not mining operations in these areas will fall under the control of the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. I have been under the impression that the Minister of Bantu Affairs through the Bantu Mining Corporation will be the Minister responsible for any mining operations that take place in Bantu areas. I wish to quote from the Minister&#x2019;s speech as it appears in Hansard in Column 2660&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What we have in mind here is more specifically claims and mining areas which were obtained from my department prior to control &#x2026;</block>

<p>He says &#x201C;control&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; having passed to Bantu Administration in terms of the present ordinance. That was, I think, in 1968. In this regard I may just mention for the sake of completeness, that certain more important prospecting rights and mining rights obtained in the Republic from my department may also be transferred only with the consent of the Minister of Mines, even if they are situated on Bantu land.</block>

<p>Does that mean that the Minister of Mines is in full control of any mining operation in Bantu land&#x003F; We are dealing with South-West Africa at the moment, but I want to know whether that is the case and whether he will give his permission to the Bantu Mining Corporation to carry on its work or whether he will give permission to the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development &#x2026;</p>

I and the rest of the House would very much like to hear whether the hon. the Minister is going to do this in stages or whether he is going to do it at once.</p>

<p>These are the points I would like to make. I am asking the Minister to clarify the point I have just made. I also want him to tell the House how compensation is going to be paid to owners of ground if they are not fully informed of findings that are being made and that could be developed on the ground that they own, having regard to the fact that they do not possess the mineral rights. With those few words I say again to the hon. the Minister that we on this side of the House welcome the Bill and that we give it our full support.</p>

<p>I thank the hon. member for his support of this Bill. I think this Bill deserves the support of all members of this House. The hon. member started off with a rather queer protest. In years gone by we have had protests that hon. members have had too little time to study the Bill or to study the Minister&#x2019;s speech, but now the protest is that the time was too long in this particular case. I do not think, therefore, that we should regard that protest as a very serious one, and in any case these arrangements are made by the Whips with the Leader of the House and the matter is not in the hands of either the Minister or the member concerned.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, in this regard I want to do the same thing that was done by my colleague the Minister of Indian Affairs, in view of the fact that one holds in very high esteem and regard not only this House, but also you as Mr. Speaker. I am sorry if any inconvenience was caused by the fact that I was absent on Wednesday when this Order of the Day came up for consideration, but hon. members will appreciate that there were two other measures on the Order Paper which were supposed to have been dealt with first, i.e. one in the name of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, which was to be dealt with by the Deputy Minister, and the other in the name of my colleague the Minister of Indian Affairs. I had consulted him before I left the Chamber, and I was informed that there would at least be another six speakers and that he himself would give a reasonably lengthy reply. I was busy with the Secretary for Mines in my office in this building when I was informed that a problem had arisen here owing to the fact that it had not been possible to proceed with measures which preceded this measure on the Order Paper.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville made the point that when prospecting operations were carried out and companies made certain findings of a geological nature, the owners of the land had to be the first people to be informed in full of the findings in order that they might decide whether they wanted to sell the mineral rights and at what price. As far as the mineral rights are concerned, I want to tell the hon. member that in South-West Africa these vest in the State in any case; all that is involved here is the surface rights. In the second instance, this would introduce a very far-reaching, new principle, since restraints would be imposed on prospecting operations as a result.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member has correctly said that prospectors spend large sums of money; that they take the risk and that it involves their time. I do not think that we can consider a principle of that kind at this stage, but in any case it does not apply in South-West Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member also raised the question of the <i>Government Gazette.</i> May I point out to him that I said very clearly in my Second Reading speech that in the past the notice had to appear in the <i>Official Gazette</i> in South-West Africa. When we dealt with the 1968 legislation here, we made provision for the notice to appear in the South African <i>Government Gazette.</i> That is not the position in regard to these matters as far as the mining laws in South Africa are concerned. All we are doing now is to bring the position into line with the existing position in the Republic of South Africa. Prospectors and representatives of the big mining houses are constantly visiting the mining commissioner&#x2019;s office in Windhoek or, for that matter, in other parts of South-West Africa. This is the way it has been done for many, many years; it has worked well, and the fact that we have continued with it in South-West Africa has been creating a tremendous amount of work for my department.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member also raised the question of the Bantu areas in South-West Africa. The position is that the South-West Africa Administration was responsible for everything until 1968.</p>

<p>*As far as base minerals are concerned, the Bantu Trust is responsible in the Bantu area. As far as precious minerals and natural oil are concerned, the Government of the Republic is the responsible body, and at this stage we are not giving any consideration to effecting any change in this respect. That was done in 1968 already.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, I do not think there is any other point raised by the hon. member that I have not dealt with. If there is any other point, I will deal with it in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to come back to subsection (2) and refer again to a matter which I raised in the Second Reading debate, and that is that the priorities are not stated here in so far as consent is concerned. The subsection reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the spouse or any major child or any parent or guardian or any major brother or major sister of such person &#x2026; may after his death donate his body</block>

<p>I dealt with the difficulties that may arise in the family if two or more people disagree with the decision made by the senior member of the family, and I want to know from the Minister what is going to happen if there is disagreement in the family. There may be two or more people who are majors. There may be a major brother, a major sister, and five children in the family. Two of them may agree to a donation taking place, and the others may be against it. I do not know how the Minister is going to sort this out. Does this mean that a part of the body or the whole may be donated even though there is an objection from some member of the family&#x003F; Is there not some way of overcoming this difficulty&#x003F; I know that it is very difficult indeed. I wonder if the hon. the Minister will not have a look at this again to see whether he cannot sort this out by laying down priorities. Perhaps the eldest brother or the eldest sister should be allowed to decide if there is no spouse. If, on the other hand, there is a spouse, the final decision should be left to him or her. This is an important matter, and the Minister must realize that at a time like this, when emotions run high in the family, a difference of opinion may lead to serious trouble in the family. The Minister knows what publicity is given to this sort of thing. I wonder whether the lawyers cannot get together and see whether they cannot give us a list of priorities in this matter. If the wording is going to be left like this, I can foresee that we are going to have trouble in the future.</p>

<p>I have a certain amount of sympathy with the hon. member&#x2019;s point of view, because as he quite rightly says, in circumstances like this people are in a state of emotion in the family and I think one should have some consideration for the family. On the other hand we are dealing here with conflicting interests. On the one hand it might be&#x2014;we think only in rare cases&#x2014;that there is dissension in the family. On the other hand we have to consider the interest of the person whose life is to be saved. That is why I say there are conflicting interests. This point has been thrashed out very thoroughly, as I pointed out in my Second Reading speech, with all the Attorneys-General and with the Directors of Hospital Services. I think we consulted 27 different people, all of whom have had some experience of this particular matter. Of course, we must realize that we are dealing here with a rather new situation and that this is the best that we could come to. I would not like to write anything into this which would create priorities because if we do that, we will write in a factor which will retard procedure, and that will not be in the interest of the patient. I do feel that ultimately the interest of the patient must prevail, that is why it is drafted in this manner, so that there are no specific priorities.</p>

<p>Clause 8 :</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>This clause is one which was also raised tentatively in the Second Reading debate, but I believe the hon. the Minister could perhaps give us some further information in this regard. The first part of this clause, which introduces the new section (1) (a), is the one which deals with the onus of proof mentioned by the hon. member for Rosettenville during the Second Reading. I would like the Minister to give us some further information as to why he deems it necessary to introduce this provision whereby the onus of proof rests on the person who is being investigated. The S.A. Dental Technicians Association has pointed out that they believe that this section would not really achieve the aim which the Minister has in mind. They refer to the fact that certain situations may arise where there might be connivance between certain parties which then, as far as that particular incident is concerned, could lead to the position that the onus of proof would be less effective than independent evidence establishing guilt. I hope therefore the Minister can give us further information as to why it is necessary to take this step in regard to the onus of proof in the new subsection (1) (a).</p>

<p>The other matter in this clause which perhaps requires further explanation, is subsection (4), which brings about the situation whereby all persons who are employed in this calling of dental mechanician, are required to be registered in terms of the Bill. That is clause 8 (d). It introduces a new additional subsection (4) into the original Act. Here we have the position of the mechanician, particularly the contractors, who feel that there is certain work which is perhaps being undertaken at the present time by auxiliary labour. If this clause is passed as it stands, it would preclude them from continuing to employ auxiliary labour which undertakes certain tasks which I understand are possible to be undertaken by a person other than a registered dental mechanician or a registered apprentice dental mechanician. They refer to the fact that plaster work, polishing and cleaning the making of dentures, can be undertaken by a person who is not necessarily required to be a registered dental mechanician. Here I would like the hon. the Minister to give an indication whether he has given thought to this particular objection and, if he has, whether it is not perhaps possible in the Other Place to make some provision whereby those persons can be employed, provided they maintain the necessary standards in their workmanship, which could be retained under supervision. I know the Minister holds the view, which we share, that it is important to maintain standards and that is perhaps one of the reasons why this has been worded as it has been worded. However, there is a further provision which would assist in the control of this matter. Further on we will come to a clause which gives further details concerning the appointment of inspectors of dental laboratories. I think that with the inspection that is required in terms of a later clause it would be possible for the Dental Mechanicians Board who would appoint these inspectors to ensure that the standard is maintained and at the same time to ensure that the particular work is done only by those persons who are registered in terms of other provisions of the Bill. I hope the Minister will feel that the dental mechanician contractors have a case in feeling that some provision should be made; in other words, that the position as it now stands should not be proceeded with exactly as it stands in view of the fact that it will affect them in their employment of certain persons who are presently employed in the laboratories to do certain work.</p>

<p>During the Second Reading debate I mentioned my objection to clause 8 (1) (a). I told the hon. the Minister that this was rather a harsh clause and that I cannot really agree that a person who makes a set of dentures and who is unauthorized should have to subject himself to this type of legislation. I would urge the Minister to look at this again and think it over. Perhaps in the Other <span class="col_4153-4154" refersTo="page_0539"/>Place he can bring this into line with the ordinary law and charge these people if they have done wrong, instead of accusing them of having done wrong and then make them prove that they are innocent. I think the Sate should prove guilt in these cases, and for that reason I ask the Minister to amend the Bill in the Other Place.</p>

<p>Mr Chairman, the hon. member for Umbilo has raised the same point in regard to clause 8 (a) as was raised by the hon. member for Rosettenville. Let me say that we are introducing a new principle here which did not exist in the past. The reason for this is that I was persuaded to introduce it by the Dental Mechanicians Board as well as by the police, as a result of the fact that they had tremendous problems in bringing these people to book.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I want to explain to hon. members that I think they are misunderstanding the position slightly. This provision only applies to people trading in dentures with the public. It does not apply to their manufacture, but only when trading takes place. It is frightfully difficult to get hold of these people, and that is why we have introduced this new principle. I do not want to mislead the hon. member, but I have gone into this matter very fully. I do not intend to change this clause either here or in the Other Place. I think this provision is necessary. There is only one reason for being a little bit harsh, and that is if it is in the interests of the public. This is a specific measure to protect the public against unqualified people trading in dentures with the public for gain.</p>

<p>The second point raised by the hon. member for Umbilo was in regard to paragraph (d). Here I think there was total misunderstanding on the part of the hon. member. It is the position today, as the Act stands, that nobody who is not properly trained to do this work &#x2026;</p>

<p>Yes, that is the position today. According to the position as it is today, if a person such as a dental contractor employs an unqualified person, that unqualified person can be prosecuted. Often such unqualified persons are innocent: they are not aware of the provisions of the Act. All we are doing here is to say that the person who employs the unqualified person can also be prosecuted. We are just going a step further; we are not bringing in a new principle. It is the position today that no unqualified person can do the work of a dental mechanician. I may say that those who contravene the law usually employ Bantu people, and they do not know what the provisions of the Act are. They are the people who are being prosecuted today. I think the correct thing is being done here, where we say that the person who ought to know what the position is, the person who is employing these people for financial gain, is put in the position where he will be prosecuted if he employs people who are not properly trained to do the work of dental mechanicians.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause deals with the labour committee, and substitutes a new subsection 25 in the principal Act. This matter has caused certain difficulties in the past, and in terms of this clause, the functions of the committee are now being changed. It is deemed to be an industrial council for the purposes of the Industrial Conciliation Act of 1956, and not the Act of 1937. I should be grateful if the hon. the Minister could indicate in what manner he feels that his amendment will improve the position as far as the functioning of the labour committee as an industrial council are concerned, in other words, how the position will be improved if the committee is deemed to be an industrial council for the purposes of the 1956 Act, as opposed to the 1937 Act.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I shall be perfectly frank with the hon. member. I have not studied either the Act of 1937 or the Act of 1956, except for the general knowledge which one has of these Acts. Certain problems have arisen, which ended up in court, as the hon. member knows This was under the 1937 Act. The Dental Mechanicians&#x2019; Board went into the matter very fully, as did my department and the law advisers. I am told that the position was changed because the problems we had in the past could be ironed out if we dealt with them under the modern Act of 1956 instead of <span class="col_4155-4156" refersTo="page_0540"/>the old 1937 Act.

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to move the amendment standing in my name on page 204 of the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit subsection (3) of the proposed section 28A and to substitute the following subsection:</block>

<block name="quote">(3) Any inspector shall exhibit the certificate referred to in subsection (2) to any person affected by the exercise or the performance by such inspector of any power or function referred to in subsection (4).</block>

<p>This whole clause, as I understand it, is new, and this provision makes its first appearance in this Act. I want to suggest that the amendment I am moving really concerns a situation involving human relations. I believe that any Act functions more efficiently if there is co-operation between the parties concerned.</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>I am going to try, because I feel strongly about this matter, and so do many other people. As the proposed new section 28A reads at present, subsection (3) states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An inspector shall on demand by any person affected by the exercise or the performance by such inspector of any power or function referred to in subsection (4), produce the certificate referred to in subsection (2).</block>

<p>Basically the change which I suggest is that when an inspector commences an inspection, he shall exhibit the certificate to the person whom he is inspecting. I do so, Sir, with a certain amount of personal experience behind me. Let me say straight away that although I have been, as a chemist and druggist over the past years, subjected to visits of inspectors, all of whom operate under the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department, I can say in all sincerity that I have never met with anything but complete courtesy. I believe, however, that a situation is developing, under controls and under bodies which operate under this Minister&#x2019;s portfolio, where the relationship is perhaps not always as good as this. I believe, as I have said before, that to have maximum co-operation means a smoother working of the Act. I put it from a human relations point of view: If a person comes to you and says: &#x201C;I am an inspector and I want to inspect something&#x201D;, you either have to accept his <i>bona fides,</i> or ask him to prove them. I believe that most inspectors have a reluctance of being queried, as regards their <i>bona fides.</i> Although the person concerned has the right to ask for them, I believe it immediately creates a barrier between the inspector and the person being inspected. It seems to me, Sir, that although this is a small amendment, it could have a very important effect. If the inspector walks in and says: &#x201C;I am an inspector under such and such an Act, and this is my card authorizing me to examine your books etc.,&#x201D; I believe that automatically he will enjoy the confidence of the person whose books etc. he wishes to inspect. Co-operation will then be extended to him, except, of course, in the case where someone is definitely contravening the Act, but the inspector would then in any case encounter difficulties, obstructions and hindrances. But in the average case, where a man is having a routine inspection, I believe that this would be a better provision. I want to suggest that the powers of the inspector, as defined here, are pretty broad. Subsection (4) states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any inspector may&#x2014;(a) without previous notice, at all reasonable times enter any dental laboratory; (b) examine any book, writing or document which relates to the performance of any act specially pertaining to the work of a dental mechanician; (c) question any person &#x2026;; (d) require the production of any account, invoice or other document issued by any person in connection with the performance of any act specially pertaining to the work of a dental mechanician &#x2026;</block>

<p>These may be confidential documents to the man who owns them and who is the person being inspected. Not only that, but the inspector may &#x201C;make extracts from and copies of any book, writing, document, account <span class="col_4157-4158" refersTo="page_0541"/>or invoice&#x201D; referred to in the previous paragraph for the purposes of any proceedings against any such person, and seize any such book, writing, document, account or invoice. I believe, with all these strong powers, it would be desirable for the hon. the Minister to give very serious consideration to accepting this amendment which I believe will only improve and not in any way hamper the work of the inspector. May I say that there is a precedent as far as this is concerned. The Atmospheric Pollution Act, when it was passed, incorporated the principle that, where an inspector in terms of that Act carries out his duties, he would establish his authority before he conducted an inspection. I appeal to the Minister to give his sympathetic consideration to this amendment. I know that the people who are involved in these inspections would appreciate the arrangement suggested by my amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Berea said this was a small amendment that he was proposing. In effect, he is asking for the deletion of a whole subsection, namely subsection (3) of this new section 28A. But I must say that the hon. member has put up a very good case. He has impressed me on one point. Instead of having a negative clause, he wants to change it into a positive one. Instead of the negative situation where the person who is being inspected has to ask the official to prove who he is, our official would be doing a positive action by saying, &#x201C;I am so-and-so from the department; here is my inspector&#x2019;s certificate&#x201D;. For that reason I am only too pleased to accept this amendment.</p>

<p>Clause 3:</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr Chairman, I move the amendment standing in my name, namely&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 7, page 5, to omit &#x201C;two&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;three&#x201D;. This will have effect that instead of a Remuneration Commission being appointed every two years, one will be appointed every three years. Experience has taught us that, generally speaking, in South Africa and in the world, two years is regarded as a very short period for the determination of many things. As hon. members know, the period of two years was originally introduced because there was a large measure of disagreement between the medical schemes and the profession. Fortunately, we managed to eliminate it to a very large extent and this was a compromise proposal at the time of the acceptance of the principle of a Remuneration Commission. This Remuneration Commission sat once, and in general the tariffs determined by them seem to have been received very well by both the medical schemes and the profession. This commission has now sat a second time, and it was the experience of the department and the schemes, as conveyed to me by the associations as well, that when the tariffs come into operation on a certain date and the next commission has to be appointed within two years, they have hardly finished with their evidence before having to start working on the next evidence. Therefore I think it is sensible to make it three years, with the added provision as laid down in the Bill, which is supported by all, that the tariffs then come into operation on a specified date, namely 1st January. I do not want to mislead this House; I admit that I had objections from the Medical Association to the changing of the period from two years to three years. I considered the objections very thoroughly, and also paid attention to the matter in the light of the experience of the Association itself in regard to evidence, but I am convinced that this change is a sensible one and places the matter on a much better basis.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the Minister must realize that this interval will not be three years, but that it will actually be four years before the new tariffs of fees come into force. If they sit in the third year, the tariff of fees does not come into operation until the beginning of the following year. There will therefore be a four-year interval. I wonder if it would not be a good idea for the Minister to take powers which would allow him to call the Tariffs Commission into being if it becomes necessary before three years.</p>

<block name="quote">Accounts of medical practitioners, dentists and suppliers of requirements or appliances, and the payment of certain accounts by certain medical schemes.</block>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. JURGENS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in terms of this clause the penalties are being made more severe than they were in the original Act. I understand that in the five years this Act has been on the Statute Book nobody has yet been prosecuted in terms of it. Usually penalties are made more severe if it is found that they are too light and that too many offences occur. In this case no offences have occured, and therefore I cannot understand why these penalties should be made more severe. Accordingly want to ask whether it would not be desirable that the Minister should rather withdraw this proposed section. I wonder if he would be prepared to agree that we should rather delete the proposed section 40. I wish to suggest that it be omitted if the hon. the Minister agrees.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, during the Second Reading debate I said that I was against this clause. I still am. I have not been persuaded to change my mind after having listened to what the Minister said about it. I cannot for the life of me understand why the hon. the Minister wants this proposed section and particularly the proposed addition to it. Surely there is no other business or profession that would want to penalize its members for not sending out accounts&#x003F; The hon. the Minister said to me that this applied to medical schemes that did not pay their accounts, but this is not made clear in the Bill. It does not say in this clause that it applies to medical schemes only. This means that, if a doctor does not send his accounts out during three consecutive months, or within four months at the latest, he can be charged and punished for it. The addition to this clause means that, on a second offence, he can be fined up to R1 000 or sent to prison for two years. That in itself is bad enough but it concerns the medical profession on top of that. The doctor who commits this &#x201C;terrible&#x201D; offence of not sending out accounts will, on top of that, have to appear before the Medical Council and explain why he was fined or why he was sent to prison for two years. It is absolutely ridiculous. He could be suspended from practising because of this.</p>

<p>Provision is made in the Act for control by the Nursing Council over two classes of nurses and midwives, <i>viz.</i> fully trained persons entitled to registration with the Council as nurse or midwife, and partially trained persons who are entitled to enrolment with the Council as auxiliary nurse or auxiliary midwife.</p>

<p>Unlike the medical profession nursing is at present not a closed profession. Consequently any person, regardless of whether or not he or she is qualified, may practise nursing for gain, except in what are known as &#x201C;prescribed areas&#x201D; where nursing for gain is restricted to persons either registered or enrolled with the council. The declaration of any area as a prescribed area is subject to whether there is a sufficient number of qualified staff in such areas to meet the needs of all members of the community. In view of the shortage of nurses, only one area, i.e. Bloemfontein, has up to now been declared to be a prescribed area with regard to nursing.</p>

<p>This shortage has to a considerable extent been met by the utilization of the services of persons who do not qualify for registration or enrolment with the Council. These persons fulfil an important role by relieving the qualified staff of less skilled duties, and by so doing enabling the latter to concentrate on those aspects of nursing where their ability is needed the most.</p>

<p>The above-mentioned category consists <i>inter alia</i> of the following: Persons who have qualified in other countries but who do not comply with the requirements of the Council&#x2014;these are persons from abroad; and secondly untrained persons, called nursing assistants, who through experience have acquired a measure of proficiency in the care of the ill.</p>

<p>The Nursing Council has for a number of years now expressed its concern at the fact that, while qualified persons fall under its control, such control is excluded where it is extremely necessary, i.e. in regard to untrained persons or those persons who have not attained the standard required by the Council for registration or enrolment.</p>

<p>One of the principal objectives of this Bill is to remedy this unsatisfactory state of affairs. With this object in mind provision is being made in this Bill in terms of which overseas nurses, who in general comply with the prescribed requirements for registration but whose training in one or more branches of nursing has been inadequate, are being afforded an opportunity of being registered for a period not exceeding two years. During that period these overseas nurses may not, however, exercise their profession in such branch or branches of nursing as may be determined by the Council. If they complete the required further training within the period in respect of which they are registered, they are then entitled to unrestricted registration.</p>

<p><span class="col_4165-4166" refersTo="page_0545"/>In this regard experience has shown that the vast majority of foreign nurses whose training does not comply with the minimum requirements of the Council, have to undergo further training for a period of only a few months.</p>

<p>Since we are now discussing these nurses, it is clear that there are already many of them in the Republic. In view of this it has been decided to restrict the proposed concession to foreign nurses to those who comply with the prescribed requirements for registration, except that their training in one or more branches of nursing is incomplete by a total period not exceeding six months. During their period of restricted registration they shall not be entitled to vote at elections of members of the Nursing Council&#x2014;provision in regard to the registration, etc. of these foreign nurses is contained in clause 7. It is expected that the passage of the measure containing these proposed provisions will contribute to alleviating the shortage of nurses, since a relatively large number of foreign nurses who make enquiries at the immigration offices of the Republic overseas, decide to emigrate to other countries when they are informed that they will not be allowed to practise as trained nurses in South Africa without undergoing further training.</p>

<p>The position in regard to untrained nursing assistants is that of the total nursing staff employed at provincial hospitals, approximately 45 per cent consists of untrained nursing assistants. If this is the position in provincial hospitals, it is not unreasonable to expect that the percentage is a similar or even greater one in the private sector.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that no statutory provision exists for the exercising of control over almost half of the persons practising nursing for gain in the Republic, it is no wonder that the Nursing Council has urged that the Nursing Act be amended to prohibit nursing for gain by any person not registered or enrolled with the Council &#x2014;something which for obvious reasons is imperative in the public interest. I think this is a major step forward, and one which is specifically in the interests of the patients. Provision in this regard is being made in clause 7&#x2014;this is the proposed section 12 (8) (a), in terms of which only persons who are registered or enrolled with the Council may practise as a nurse for gain. In terms of clause 7 (2) this provision comes into effect after the expiry of a period of one year after the commencement of the Amendment Act. When this happens of course the provision in sections 45 and 46 of the Act, relating to the declaration of prescribed areas, to which I referred previously, lapses.</p>

<p>It is obvious, however, that the health services of the Republic cannot afford to lose the services of the said large number of unqualified persons who, as has already been mentioned, have acquired through experience a measure of proficiency in the care of the ill, since they represent a considerable labour force in a sphere in which there is a serious manpower, or in this case womanpower, shortage. Consequently it has been decided to make provision for the enrolment of a new class of nurse, <i>viz.</i> nursing assistants, and to incorporate these persons in that class. This is being accomplished by providing that any person who furnishes a certificate from a registered nurse or doctor to the effect that she practised for gain as a nurse on the date of commencement of the Amendment Act, within one year after that date, will be entitled to be enrolled as a nursing assistant. The established rights of these persons are therefore being protected in this way.</p>

<p>Provision is being made in clauses 1, 5 (b), 6 (a) and 9 of the Bill for the training of those who in future want to qualify as a nursing assistants. It is the intention that this will be done on the basis of two or three months practical training in wards at approved hospitals.</p>

<p>As in the case of nursing it is the intention to make midwifery a closed profession as well by providing that no person, who is not registered or enrolled as midwife or auxiliary midwife with the Nursing Council may practise midwifery for gain.</p>

<p>The Bill also protects the established rights of certain unqualified persons who practised midwifery for gain on the date of commencement of the Amendment Act and who within one year after that date convinces the Nursing Council&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) that she practised in a Bantu homeland; or</li>

<li>(b) that her name appears on the list of unqualified midwives kept in terms of a regulation made under section 133 (3) (a) of the Public Health Act.</li>

</ol>

<p><span class="col_4167-4168" refersTo="page_0546"/>These are the two categories that exist at the moment.</p>

<p>Group (a) relates to the old Bantu women (old wives) and has been incorporated in the Bill at the request of the Department of Bantu Administration and Development, while group (b) comprises unqualified persons, who are known as gamps, and who are regarded by the local authority as being competent to practise as midwives in its area.</p>

<p>All these important proposals, to which I have been referring up to now, meet with the support of the Nursing Council, the Nursing Association and the Provincial Administrations. In addition to that, and this is important, the Nursing Association conducted a survey among unqualified persons employed at the provincial hospitals. Virtually all of those who participated in this survey gave their full support to the proposal relating to their enrolment as nursing assistants. I could just mention that this was a relatively comprehensive survey. One can quite understand their supporting this, for it gives them something tangible which imparts status on them and which places them in a position where they will always be regarded as persons competent to perform a certain task.</p>

<p>Consequential amendments of importance are the repeal of sections 45 and 46 of the Act relating to the declaration of prescribed areas which, as I have already indicated, will lapse.</p>

<p>Arising out of the proposal to bring all groups practising nursing or midwifery for gain under the ethical control of the Nursing Council, it was decided, upon the recommendation of the Nursing Association, to make provision in terms of which those subsidiary groups, <i>viz.</i> auxiliary nurses and midwives, student auxiliary nurses and midwives and nursing assistants, who are at present not members of the Nursing Association or who are not entitled to vote at an election of members of the Board of the Association or of the Advisory Committees for Coloureds and Bantu, shall be junior members of the Association and shall thus be entitled to vote. Provision in this regard is being made in clause 22.</p>

<p>The passage of the measure containing these proposals will result in the organization of nursing in the Republic falling under a single statutory body&#x2014;something which for obvious reasons will be in the interests of the orderly development of our nursing services. In addition to that it constitutes important advantages to the relevant auxiliary nurses and midwives and nursing assistants on a personal basis. They will, for example, have a measure of say in regard to various matters affecting them as groups and also as individuals. In addition to that they will enjoy cover in terms of the Group Compensation Insurance scheme of the Association, as well as its Professional Indemnity Insurance Scheme. At the moment they are excluded from these.</p>

<p>It will be observed that provision is being made in clause 24 (2) in terms of which representation of the said subsidiary groups on the Board of the Association and the Advisory Committees shall be postponed to such dates as will be fixed by the State President and the Minister by proclamation and notice, respectively in the <i>Gazette.</i> This is being done in compliance with a request from the Nursing Association to the effect that it should first be allowed an opportunity to organize the relevant subsidiary groups effectively before they assume their new responsibilities in regard, for example, to the election of their representatives on the said bodies and in regard to related matters. I think this is a sensible thing to do.</p>

<p>The remaining provisions of the Bill contain for the most part different amendments requested by the Nursing Council and the Nursing Association on the basis of experience acquired over the years in the administration of the Nursing Act. As hon. members know, this Act has now been in existence since 1957.</p>

<p>Firstly, the Nursing Council submitted proposals with regard to the membership of the council, the object of which is to ensure that&#x2014;since this is the intention at present but it has not been stated clearly in the Act&#x2014;certain members shall in fact be qualified persons registered in terms of the Act as nurses or in terms of the medical Act as medical practitioners. This affects, for example, the representatives of the provinces and the Department of Defence on the Council, and is therefore a completely reasonable request. Provision is also being made to ensure that the nursing profession is represented on the Council on a more comprehensive basis than is at present the case&#x2014;in other words, that all classes or categories of nurses, i.e. general nurses, psychiatric nurses, nurses for mentally disordered persons and nurses for mentally defective persons, are represented <span class="col_4169-4170" refersTo="page_0547"/>on the Council. Enrolled nurses and midwives, instead of pupil nurses, shall also elect a registered person now to represent them on the Council. This change is a reasonable one since the majority of pupils, a third or whom are in their first year of training, cannot possibly know the members of the profession so well that such an important duty may be entrusted to them. Arising out of the decision to keep separate registers for Indians&#x2014;a matter in regard to which I shall inform the House later&#x2014;provision is being made for the election by the proposed Advisory Board for Indians, as in the case of the existing Advisory Boards for Coloured Persons and Bantu, respectively, of a White nurse to represent them on the Nursing Council. In addition to that those universities which have a department of nursing, such as the universities in Bloemfontein and Pretoria for example, shall in future be represented by a registered nurse. In this case the Committee of University Principals appoints the member in question. Clause 2 of the Bill deals with the aforesaid matters.</p>

<p>In view of the amount of administrative work which will have to be done before the Council will be in a position to effect the envisaged changes in its membership, the commencement of the said provisions is being postponed until the next election which is to be held on 31st March, 1975. In other words, it will then for the first time function in this way.</p>

<p>In view of the developments which occurred in regard to the Indian group of the population since they were recognized as South African citizens, provision is being made in the Bill for the establishment of separate registers for Indians. This is being done at the request of the Department of Indian Affairs, and also meets with the approval of the South African Indian Council and the Nursing Council. The provisions in question are contained in clause 7 [proposed section 12 (4) and (5)]. clause 8 [proposed section 14 (2)] and clause 9 [proposed section 15 (2)]. Consequential amendments are contained in clause 11 [proposed section 16] which relates to the establishment of an Advisory Board for Indians, and in clauses 12 (b), 23, 24 (c), 26 and 27 which relate to the constitution of the Advisory Board for Indians, the holding of separate meetings of the Association in respect of Indians and related matters, the representation of Indians on the Board of the Association by a White nurse elected by Indians, the establishment of an Advisory Committee for Indians and the establishment of separate regional branches for Indians. The passage of the measure containing these proposals will place the Indians in the same position as the Coloured persons and the Bantu as far as the Nursing Act is concerned.</p>

<p>In terms of section 8 of the Act the Council may delegate any of its powers to a committee. However, the Council has expressed the opinion, and the Department of Health is in agreement with this, that this provision should not apply to the provisions of section 28, which relate to the termination of the specified period of a suspension imposed under that section of the restoration of a name to the register which has been removed therefrom under that section. This is a very important aspect and ought not to be delegated. The object of clause 4 of the Bill is to effect a suitable amendment in section 8 of the Act.</p>

<p>In terms cf paragraph (k) of section 11 (1) of the Act, the Council may prescribe the different uniforms, badges or other distinguishing devices in respect of White persons, Coloured persons and Bantu. In actual fact, badges or other distinguishing devices are prescribed only in order to indicate registered or enrolled qualifications, and are the same for all races. The policy of the Council in this regard is regarded as being reasonable, since persons who are entitled to registration or enrolment as nurse, regardless of their race, must be in possession of the same qualifications. Uniforms as such are not prescribed. These are left to the discretion of employers. Consequently provision is being made in clause 6 (c) of the Bill to delete the provision in regard to the prescribing of separate uniforms, badges, etc.</p>

<p>During the 1971 Parliamentary session the Medical. Dental and Pharmacy Act, No. 13 of 1972, was amended in order to empower the Medical Council to postpone or suspend in its discretion a penalty imposed by it in disciplinary actions taken by it on such conditions and for such period as it may deem necessary. Similar provision is contained in section 352 of the Criminal Procedure Act.</p>

<p>The Nursing Council requested that similar provision be made in the Nursing Act, and that in the case of student nurses it should also be provided that their period of training may be extended instead of <span class="col_4171-4172" refersTo="page_0548"/>their being suspended, because in most cases if a student has been suspended, it means in practice that the training cannot be resumed again and that one loses such a student. Provision in the abovementioned connection is being made in clause 18 and 19, respectively.</p>

<p>In terms of section 27 of the Act any accused person who feels aggrieved by the finding of the Nursing Council may appeal to the Minister and if such person is not satisfied with the decision of the Minister, such person may apply for review to the Supreme Court. The Council requested that this right should be conferred upon the Council as well as the complainants. This request is a reasonable one and provision is consequently being made in clause 20 to give effect to it.</p>

<p>In terms of section 28 of the Act the Council may, in its discretion, restore to a register or roll any name which has been removed therefrom. It has now requested that provision should be made in terms of which it may impose conditions when allowing such restoration. Therefore, provision is accordingly being made in clause 21.</p>

<p>In terms of section 43 of the Act certified copies of the record of the proceedings before any court of law shall be transmitted to the Nursing Council in cases where there is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of improper or disgraceful conduct on the part of a registered or enrolled person. The Council has requested that this provision should also be made applicable to inquests. The Department of Justice supports this proposal and the necessary amendment is consequently being introduced in clause 30.</p>

<p>Section 81 of the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Act, No. 13 of 1928, which relates to the restriction of practice of a medical practitioner who has become mentally or physically disabled, or who has been using a habit-forming or potentially harmful drug, was amended recently with a view to effecting improvements thereto. The Nursing Council has requested that section 47 of the Nursing Act, which deals with the same matters in regard to nurses, should be amended to bring it into line with section 81 of Act No. 13 of 1928, since this section is more comprehensive. Such provision is accordingly being made in clause 32 of the Bill.</p>

<p>As a result of the proposal to which I have already referred, in terms of which persons who are not registered or enrolled will not be prohibited from practising as nurse or midwife for gain, it has become necessary to provide that persons who have completed their training&#x2014;and whose names have therefore been removed from the register of pupils&#x2014;but who are still awaiting the examination results, may in the meantime practise for gain. Provision to cover such cases is consequently being made in clause 7 [proposed section 12 (3) (c) and (14)], of the Bill.</p>

<p>According to the Nursing Council the provincial administrations, mission hospitals and the South African Nursing Association have for a number of years urged to the Council the necessity for the deletion of the prefix &#x201C;auxiliary&#x201D; in regard to the words &#x201C;auxiliary nurse&#x201D; and &#x201C;auxiliary midwife&#x201D; and the substitution therefor of the word &#x201C;enrolled&#x201D;, because a stigma attaches to the former word. They aver that the use of these terms makes the recruiting of pupils difficult. I, personally, agree wholeheartedly with this and provision is consequently being made in different clauses of the Bill to introduce the desired amendment throughout the legislation.</p>

<p>The remaining provisions of the Bill comprise only:</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) Amendments and additions of a lesser important nature such as

<ol>

<li>(i) the provision in clause 3 to the effect that the president and vice-president of the Nursing Council shall be registered persons;</li>

<li>(ii) the deletion of the restriction to R1 of the fees which shall be paid annually to the Nursing Council by registered or enrolled persons&#x2014;clause 5 (a);</li>

<li>(iii) the empowering of the council to require employers of nurses to furnish to it annual staff returns&#x2014;clause 5 (f);</li>

<li>(iv) the insertion of section 15 (a) [clause 10] in terms of which the Council may refuse registration or enrolment of a person who has already been convicted of a prescribed offence;</li>

<li><span class="col_4173-4174" refersTo="page_0549"/>(v) the provision that a decision of the majority of the members shall constitute a decision of the said advisory board&#x2014;clause 13;</li>

<li>(vi) the provision in clause 25 relating to the increase in the number of members which shall form a quorum at meetings of the board of the Nursing Association;</li>

<li>(vii) the substitution for the designation &#x201C;organizing secretary&#x201D; of &#x201C;executive director&#x201D; in clause 27 (b); and</li>

<li>(viii) the empowering of the Nursing Association to establish and administer nursing agencies&#x2014;clause 27 (d); and</li>

</ol>

</li>

<li>(b) Drafting improvements in order to state the intention of certain provisions of the Act more clearly, for example&#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(i) the addition of the words &#x201C;including meetings of advisory boards&#x201D; to section 10 (i) of the Act and the words &#x201C;and accounts&#x201D; to section 10 (a) [clause 5 (c) and (d)];</li>

<li>(ii) the amendment of section 24 of the Act [clause 17] to make it clear that where any person has been accused of improper conduct under the Nursing Act in respect of an offence of which such person has been convicted by a court of law, the record of the relevant court of law constitutes only <i>prima facie</i> proof that such person was convicted by the court of law&#x2014; this fact cannot, however, be accepted by the Nursing Council as <i>prima facie</i> proof of improper or disgraceful conduct in terms of the Nursing Act,</li>

<li>(iii) the amendment of section 25 (c) [clause 18] relating to the removal of a name from a register or roll; and

<ol>

<li>(iv) the rephrasing of section 51 [clause 33].</li>

</ol>

</li>

<li>(c) Language improvements&#x2014;for example, the translation in different places of the English words &#x201C;student&#x201D; and &#x201C;profession&#x201D; as &#x201C;student&#x201D; and &#x201C;beroep&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;leerling&#x201D; and &#x201C;professie&#x201D; respectively; the use of the word &#x201C;leerling&#x201D; and the English word &#x201C;pupil&#x201D; in regard to persons who are being trained in the subsidiary categories of nursing&#x2014; i.e. the enrolled nurses or nursing assistants&#x2014;and the changes effected in clause 34 [section 53 (e)].</li>

<li>(d) An increase in the maximum penalties which may be imposed in certain cases [clauses 5 (d), 6 (f), 7, 16 and 35].</li>

<li>(e) The deletion of certain sections which are not necessary or applicable now, viz. section 42 [clause 29] and sections 44, 45, and 46 [clause 31].</li>

</ol>

</li>

</ol>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have furnished a comprehensive elucidation here because this is a very important milestone in the development of our nursing profession and also of the legislation which has served that profession very diligently and with great success up to now. It is for that reason that I have gone into the matter in detail.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>We on this side of the House welcome this Bill and will support the Second Reading. I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the nursing profession, for the efficient, knowledgeable and responsible way in which they are serving their country, and have done especially during the past few years when we have had such difficulty in getting a full enrolment of nurses. They worked terribly hard over this period. Some of them, without any complaint at all, have done double shifts. Some have done the work of two people. For this I am sure that all members in this House will join with me in paying a well-deserved tribute to this wonderful band of people.</p>

<p>I have listened with great interest to what the hon. the Minister said and I want to thank him for going into the matter so carefully with us. It is not my intention to go through the clauses one by one this afternoon, but I do want to make a few general remarks during this Second Reading. I want to say to the hon. the Minister <span class="col_4175-4176" refersTo="page_0550"/>that his department should do everything they can to bring in as many people from outside as possible, to augment our already overworked nursing profession. If they have not already reached the standard which we require in this country, I say to the Minister that it is our duty to bring them in and encourage them to reach these standards. They can come and join the profession at a higher level than they would if they were enrolled as students. Ways and means must be found to encourage them to learn as quickly as possible the ways of our country and what we require from them before they attain the status which our locally-trained nurses already have.</p>

<p>Provision is being made in this Bill to curtail the unlawful activities of women who set themselves up to be nurses. I am pleased that the Minister is taking precautions to curtail their activities. Some of these people have come into being because of the shortages of nurses. When people are ill and they cannot get a trained nurse, they take anyone into their home to help them over a difficult period. This has only to happen once or twice to the person who sets herself up as a help and she immediately takes upon herself the duties of a trained sister. For this reason I think it is good that we should put a check on the activities of these people. I am also pleased to see that the Minister is going to make it his business to watch the activities of the nursing agencies. I think they do need watching. The Minister might find difficulty here, because they virtually work in a closed field and it is going to be difficult to spot the irregularities that these people have been committing in the past two years, particularly, as I have said, due to the shortage of nurses available in the country.</p>

<p>I also want to recommend here that we should watch out, where nurses are employed through an agency, that the burden of charges made by the agency itself is not passed on to the patient. When people are sick and they need a nurse, we have found that the charges made by the agencies are sometimes very much higher than the charges made by the sister herself for her duties. We also find that part of the sister&#x2019;s salary goes to the agency to keep it going. I also feel that the agencies may be responsible in some measure for taking away nurses from the provincial hospitals through the agencies directing them into private nursing homes. This should be discouraged. I do not say for one moment that a trained sister, who has gone through a very hard school, should not be allowed to offer her services to the highest market, but there must be a ceiling to what the nursing homes should pay these nurses, otherwise we will find a vicious circle coming into being and we will have more and more girls leaving the hospitals to work for the agencies and being diverted to nursing homes. We will find that at the other end of the circle, the hospitals will have to go to the agencies to re-employ the people they have trained so that they can fill their complement of nurses. We must try to stop that if possible. At the same time, as I say, if a nurse feels, after completing her training at the hospital, that she wants to go and work outside the hospital, she should be at liberty to do so, but I for one will do everything in my power to discourage them from doing this, especially those younger nurses who have qualified at the expense of the province but leave at the first possible opportunity. I think we must discourage this practice. To me service in a hospital is the highest service that any nurse can render to humanity. We must bear in mind that the people who go to hospitals today, are people who cannot afford private nursing fees and private doctors, and private beds in nursing homes. We must remember that we do get these people who are obliged to go to the Hospitals, through no fault of their own, but only through economic circumstances. It is to those people that we want to give the best possible service. I plead with the nursing profession to stay at provincial hospitals for as long as possible. There are faults to be found in provincial hospitals. The Minister knows and I know, and the members of the medical profession know that we are continually getting complaints about the harsh treatment that young nurses, particularly, get both from patients and qualified sisters in the wards. If we can ease the lot of these young nurses and encourage them through kindness and give them a better deal, we will attract more people to the profession while fewer will be leaving it before they qualify. I want to bring to attention the fact that many qualified non-White nurses are working in private homes. The gap in fees should be closed as quickly as possible. These people who are working in private institutions or in homes should get the same salary as their colleagues. If RX is paid for a trained nurse for a night or a day service then that <span class="col_4177-4178" refersTo="page_0551"/>same amount of money should be paid to the trained non-White sister. I should not like to see the public take advantage and discriminate in the payment of fees to the different races.</p>

<p>I am pleased that we have here some control of the use and wearing of uniforms and insignia. I am rather perturbed at the large number of women we see in the street dressed as nurses with insignia on their shoulders. Not only are they not qualified nurses but they have hardly set a foot into a sick-room. These insignia are not from hospitals. It may be merely a badge with the word &#x201C;medical&#x201D; or &#x201C;surgical&#x201D; or something of that sort on it. They pass as qualified people. I am pleased that steps have now been taken to stop this practice. I am sure that the nursing profession will be grateful to know that as from now their rights are being protected through this new Bill which is coming into being today.</p>

<p>I want to say a word or two about the advisory boards which the hon. the Minister is now extending to the Indians. I take it that the Indians will have an advisory board and that they will elect one person to the Nursing Council, in the same way as the Coloureds and the Bantu.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>In exactly the same way.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>In exactly the same way. Now I want to ask the hon. the Minister a question, i.e. what is going to happen in the Bantu homelands&#x003F; A day or two ago we handed over the hospital services to Bantu homelands. Does that mean that the Department of Bantu Affairs is going to look after health in the homelands and that the White Nursing Council is going to look after the nurses working in the homelands&#x003F; Is that what is envisaged&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>That is the position today.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>I am asking whether that is going to be the position in future. I should also like to know from the hon. the Minister whether or not the door is closed for all time to non-Whites ever sitting on the Nursing Council. I do not know what sort of liaison the White Nursing Council as now established is going to have with the nurses working in the Transkei, which very soon will be an independent State. Does that mean that at that stage there will be a Black Nursing Council in the Transkei and in the other homelands&#x003F; What is going to happen&#x003F; The position is rather fluid at present. We would like to know what direction the hon. the Minister is taking in this matter and whether he has consulted with the hon. the Minister of Bantu Affairs as to the future of these people. The hon. the Minister knows that if things come about as they wish, there will be an exodus of Bantu nurses from our large hospitals. There are teaching hospitals in the homelands and if progress is going to be made as envisaged, then I can see that there will be an exodus. Because the policy of the government is to encourage the professional people to go back to their homelands. That is the stated policy of the Government. If you are going to do that, then you must be prepared at all times to train Bantu from our present reservoir of urban Bantu, whom the Government has not given full residential status in White South Africa, to provide a nursing staff for the hospitals for their own people in the urban areas. If you are going to drive them out and encourage them to go to the homelands, the hon. the Minister is going to find himself very short of Bantu nurses in the White areas.</p>

<p>All right. We are short of Bantu nurses, and I think that we must hear from the hon. the Minister this afternoon what provision he is going to make in that regard. I should also like to know whether the hon. the Minister is going to encourage a separate nursing council in the homelands, one for each homeland, each drawing from the same reservoir of Bantu. I also want him to tell the House what is going to be the position in regard to the Indians and the Coloured people. Are they all going to be encouraged to have their own nursing councils at some stage or is he going to retain the <i>status quo</i> as at present&#x003F; It is an important matter. The nurses themselves would like to know how they stand in this regard.</p>

<p>There are various other matters that I would like to deal with, but these actually refer to different clauses. It would be better <span class="col_4179-4180" refersTo="page_0552"/>therefore to say that I will deal with these in the Committee Stage. However, I await with eagerness the hon. Minister&#x2019;s replies to the questions that I have put to him.</p>

<speech by="#grobler">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. S. J. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to begin in a very unusual way today by tendering my thanks to the hon. member who has just resumed his seat. I am doing this not only on my own behalf but on behalf of the entire nursing profession. I am referring to the very kind remarks the hon. member made at the beginning of his speech in regard to the nursing profession. I think they were very well-deserved, and I consequently endorse them wholeheartedly and with the greatest frankness. Now, the hon. member referred during the course of his speech to the bringing in of nurses from overseas, who then have to undergo further training here with a view to registration if they have not yet been fully trained. The necessary facilities for those people already exist in South Africa. They exist at provincial hospitals and nurses who are not yet fully qualified can receive the necessary training which will enable them to register. But now there is one matter which we must not lose sight of; it should not be deduced from this that a large group of people can simply be brought in from overseas and that concessions will be made in regard to the requirements which are laid down, in other words, that there will be a watering down of the standards set in South Africa. As I know the nursing profession, those people regard very jealously the high standards they have already achieved.</p>

<p>There is another matter however, in regard to which I also agree wholeheartedly with the hon. member, namely his reference to the control over agencies. I think that the time will still come when the agencies and their conduct will have to be looked into far more strictly, in the interests of the profession itself. I (hope that there will in future be another opportunity of discussing this matter further.</p>

<p>I think it is fitting that we should at the beginning of this discussion give the House the immediate assurance, as the hon. the Minister did in fact do, that these proposed amendments meet with the wholehearted approval of the South African Nursing Council. There is a good reason why the South African Nursing Council endorses these amendments. They see in these amendments the opportunity of continuing to serve the fine profession which they exercise with sustained, full dedication. They create for the Nursing Council further opportunities of carrying out its functions, so that the community will benefit from that. Before I draw the attention of this House to certain amendments, it would probably serve a good purpose if I referred to another matter. I want to do this with reference to what the hon. member actually omitted to say. In his speech he offered a pot pourri of different matters which actually had very little to do with the Bill. This is proof to me that this Bill before us is a very thorough piece of legislation. I now want to associate myself with this by drawing attention to the fact that the legislation in regard to nursing matters has always been dealt with very thoroughly. Since the nursing Act No. 69 of 1957 was passed, it was only necessary on one occasion to effect a very minor amendment, one which was in fact of no great importance. Now, I am saying this for another reason, namely that the present hon. Minister was at the time the chairman of the Select Committee which gave substance to that particular Act. In the same way as very thorough work was done at the time under his chairmanship, very thorough work is being done again today&#x2014;the conduct of the hon. member confirmed this&#x2014;under the guidance of that hon. Minister.</p>

<p>The amendments before us actually emphasize the phenomenal progress which has been made in the nursing profession since 1957. For example, if one were merely to look at the ratio between the number of nurses who are available and the population of South Africa, we will see that in 1960, for example, there was one White nurse available for every 176 Whites in the country. Today there is one White nurse available for every 157 Whites. This is a very fine improvement. As far as the Coloured persons are concerned, the ratio in 1960 was one to 2 206; today it is one for every 1 093. This is a tremendous improvement in that particular sphere. As far as the Bantu are concerned, there was 1 for every 2 206 persons; today it is one for every 1 393. In other words, as far as the total is concerned, there was one nurse for every 686 members of the population in 1960, as against one for every 581 today. This surely confirms that great progress has been made. But the legislation before us also draws attention to another matter. In the proposed new section 3 (2)<span class="col_4181-4182" refersTo="page_0553"/>(o) we see that provision is being made&#x2014; the hon. the Minister also referred to this &#x2014;for the representation on the Nursing Council of the departments of nursing at our universities. Now it is interesting to note in this connection that at nine of our universities already a full-fledged degree course in nursing is being offered. Those courses consist of a bachelors degree in nursing, a bachelors degree in nursing education and administration, masters degrees, doctors degrees, diplomas in nursing, diplomas in nursing education, etc. I maintain that this indicates that very great progress has been made. It is also an excellent thing that representation is now being given to these particular groups on the Nursing Council. I may also add, for the sake of interest, that there are already 604 nurses who have completed their studies at our universities and have today entered the nursing profession. I hope that this recognition which is now being accorded them through the proposed amendment will also serve as an increase stimulus to more young women to equip themselves in this direction, through training at our universities as well. I also believe that this recognition which is being accorded will lead to an enhancement of the status of the profession.</p>

<p>There is a second matter to which I should also like to refer, for which provision is being made in the proposed Bill, and this is that our traditional policy of separation is in fact being taken further in this measure, because clause 11 makes provision for the establishment of an advisory board for Indians. Arising out of that an opportunity is also being created now for a separate register for Indians. I maintain that this is as it should be, and that we should be grateful for our having reached that point.</p>

<p>The third aspect for which this legislation, to my mind, makes provision and which is very important, is the training and enrolment of nursing assistants. I think we have every right to claim that as far as the control over the care of the ill is concerned, South Africa has always been among the leading countries of the world. In 1891 South Africa was the first country in the entire world to make provision for the state registration of nurses. With this control measure, to grant recognition to the sub-professional and non-professional groups, we are again one of the first countries to establish anything of that nature. I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister on this step which is now being taken.I also want to emphasize very strongly perhaps in conjunction with this and arising but of what the hon. the Minister said, that it must be noted that a year after this Bill is passed, the nursing profession will be a closed profession. I want to believe that everyone who has an interest in the matter will acquaint themselves with the fact that they have to take the necessary steps in time to ensure that they do not, after the expiry of that period of a year, commit an offence.</p>

<p>Now it is also true on the other hand that when one is dealing with a living organism there are always things which have to be added and others which have to disappear. Now it is true that according to the Bill which is before us today&#x2014;I am referring to the new section 3 (2) (j)&#x2014;the male nurse who has up to now served on the South African Nursing Council will disappear.</p>

<p>I should like to pay tribute in this way today to those male nurses who over the years have served on the Council, to very great advantage, and I want to thank them for the contribution they have made there. We must also emphasize that the Nursing Council&#x2014;and this was never the intention either&#x2014;does not consist of representatives of interest groups, and that it is consequently logical that the male nurse should ultimately disappear from the Council. I think and I hope on the other hand that there will be a few of the male nurses in the profession who will be able to make a very positive contribution to the functions of the Council and who will in future perhaps make themselves available for election, perhaps standing against nurses, and that it will not create insurmountable problems if a choice has to be made between a man or a woman, so that we may still in future have the presence of a male nurse on the Council. It is my great pleasure to give my full support to this Bill.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to identify myself with the words expressed by the hon. member for Springs and also by the hon. member for Rosettenville. They expressed words of thanks, appreciation and commendation of this noble profession which is so closely related to my own profession. I can only say that it was a pleasure to have been able to be chairman of the Select Committee on the Nursing Bill in 1957 and I <span class="col_4183-4184" refersTo="page_0554"/>think it is a good thing that we are introducing these changes in the year 1972, mainly on request of the Nursing Association and the Nursing Council. The hon. member for Springs referred to the standard of nursing, and I think that knowing the people who serve in the Nursing Council I can give the House the assurance that the standard will be raised rather than lowered. Recently we took the step of stipulating matriculation as the qualification for admission, and I am very glad to be able to say that it has created no probblems in regard to the recruitment of nurses. The hon. member for Springs also raised the question of agencies, and I think I should only say that I have confidence in the ability of the Nursing Association to make proper arrangements in this regard by means of the powers which are now being conferred on them.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Rosettenville raised three matters. The one was the question of the shortage of nurses. I want to point out to the hon. member that there is no shortage of nurses in my department and in my departmental hospitals. We do have a shortage in provincial hospitals and private institutions, of course.</p>

<p>It is not the responsibility of the Department of Health to see to it that there are enough nurses in South Africa. It is the responsibility of provincial administrations and other authorities to see to it that nurses are found in this country and also recruited outside South Africa. It is a completely wrong impression that my department is responsible for that function and I just want to put that right. Secondly, the hon. member raised the question of homelands and that there will now be an influx into the homelands from the Republic. That will not be the case at all for the simple reason that there is no shortage of nurses in the homelands. The training is adequate and the number of nurses is enough to do the job in the homelands. The hon. member also wanted to know from me what the future would hold and whether there will be a Black nurse on the White Nursing Council in South Africa, or something to that effect. The position is very simple. If the Transkei becomes completely independent, it is their choice whether they would like our Nursing Council to be the Nursing Council for the Transkei as well. If they so wish, such a situation will be created in consultation with our Government. It is our Nursing Council and that consultation need only be on the basis that the present situation continues. If they wish to have their own separate nursing council and nursing association there is nothing in the world to stop them and we will certainly not try to stop them. I will certainly say to that Government as Minister of Health that it will be much wiser and in their interest, in the light of the geographical position of South Africa and the training facilities and experience we have gained over the years, to have one nursing council such as we have today to look after the interests of those self-governing countries which are within the geographical borders of Southern Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member also mentioned the position of the Indians. In regard to the Indian community the position will be arranged in exactly the same way as that of the Coloured people and the Bantu, in terms of the Act of 1957. I do not think there is anything else I have to reply to and I am very grateful to hon. members, not only for their support, but particularly for their spirit of goodwill and of appreciation for one of the finest professions I know.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>In pursuance of a recommendation of the Committee of Inquiry into the Financial Relations betwen the Central Government, the Provinces and Local Authorities (the Borckenhagen Committee) the Financial Relations Consolidation and Amendment Act, 1945, was amended in 1968 so as to empower the provinces to levy licence duties on trades and occupations. At the same time, the provinces were empowered to repeal the Licences Act, 1962.</p>

<p>Up to now the provinces have not yet been able to introduce legislation giving effect to the amended provisions but, as the hon. the Minister of Finance indicated in his Budget speech last year, the Government intends giving effect to the spirit of the recommendations in the meantime, and consequently provision was made in last year&#x2019;s Budget for the transfer of an amount of R4 million to the provinces in the 1971-&#x2019;72 financial year in respect of licence duties and fines payable in terms of the Licences Act, 1962.</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House do not intend objecting to the Third Reading of this Bill mainly because of the fact that we consider it an improvement on the existing position. The establishment of the South African Indian Council was a step towards achieving the object of giving the Indian community a means of consultation with the Government and we on this side of the House have felt that this body should be used also as the means of giving the Indians a right to elect their representatives to that council so that they may truly put the point of view of the Indian community whom they represent. For this reason we have supported the measure.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister, speaking during the Second Reading, indicated that this Bill must be regarded as an interim measure. When we look at the contents of the Bill, we find that the existing council of 25 appointed members is now to be increased to a number not exceeding 30 members, and the additional five members are to be elected by the Indian community. The hon. the Minister has indicated that these five elected members would possibly be one from the Cape, one from the Transvaal and three from Natal. We hope that the hon. the Minister will give us some indication this afternoon as to the future of this council, particularly in regard to the question of representatives being elected to that council. He has mentioned at various stages during the discussion of this Bill, during the Second Reading debate and during the Committee Stage, that the Indian Council accepts this Bill and indeed supports it. However, I think it is only fair <span class="col_4187-4188" refersTo="page_0556"/>to say that we understand that that acceptance of the Bill is an acceptance of the principle of having some elected members of the council, and not necessarily an acceptance of the basis which this Bill outlines, namely that five members only shall be elected to that council. The position here has been clearly stated by the present chairman of the executive of the Indian Council, Mr. A. M. Rajab. In a letter published in the <i>Daily News</i> on Thursday, 16th March, he made it clear that he, as chairman of the executive, is in favour of a fully elected council. Mr. A. M. Rajab writes as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I wish to make it perfectly clear that I have always striven to make the council a fully elected body, chosen by the Indian people themselves, and have made representations to the Government for the realization of this objective as quickly as possible. I am convinced that the sooner this can be realized, the sooner can the present hard-worked and often misunderstood nominated council hand over its enormous task to the elected body.</block>

<p>He then goes on to make this observation&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The work of the Indian Council is difficult enough as it is and frustrating in the extreme, because progress in these matters is necessarily slow.</block>

<p>Sir, this is the view that was expressed only a few days ago by the present chairman of the Indian Council. I think it is quite obvious that although the Indian Council has accepted the contents of this Bill, they themselves wish to see a situation develop where there will be a greater number of elected members sitting on the council and where ultimately there will be a fully elected council. I therefore hope that the hon. the Minister will be able to indicate this afternoon what he sees as the ultimate constitution of this council, and whether he and the Government accept that ultimately this council must be a fully elected council.</p>

<p>Then I want to touch upon certain other aspects in connection with this Bill, particularly the provisions of clause 8, which extend certain administrative functions to the executive committee of the newly constituted council. We accept that as a necessary step forward so that there will be greater consultation and so that there the members of the council elected by the Indian community will be able to express their views with regard to education, social welfare and pensions and any other matters which may be delegated to the executive committee by proclamation in terms of this Bill. However, there is one important aspect which I think requires greater consideration, and that is the question of the functions of this executive committee in discharging the various tasks allotted to it. The hon. the Minister has indicated that he as Minister of Indian Affairs intends to delegate to the executive committee of the new Indian Council those powers vested in him appertaining to the Indian community. But this is going to be quite meaningless unless the hon. the Minister is going to give further consideration to the financing of the administration of these two portfolios. As you know, Sir, the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council has been charged with that responsibility for a number of years now, and when one looks at the reports which are issued from time to time, one finds that many resolutions which are passed by the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council are not acted upon by the Government because of the financial position. Here I refer particularly to social welfare and pensions, which are now to form part of the functions of this new executive committee. We know that there was a strong feeling amongst many members of the Indian community that an effort should be made to close the gap between the amounts paid to the Indian community and the amounts paid to the White community. In terms of the Bill before us, this new council will merely be able to make recommendations to the hon. the Minister and to the Government to make available more funds so that they in turn can implement their ideas and their views on these important social welfare matters. I do hope that the hon. the Minister will give this House some indication as to how he proposes to avoid the stalemate situation where on the one hand you will have the Indian Council passing resolutions and asking for more funds to be made available so that they can implement their policy to close the gap between the amounts paid to Whites and the amounts paid to the Indian community, and the Government on the other hand refusing to act on those resolutions. It will be a case of coming back to <span class="col_4189-4190" refersTo="page_0557"/>the Minister again and again to ask that effect be given to these various resolutions passed by the council.</p>

<p>Then I come to the last point. I think it is important at this Third Reading Stage that the Minister should give the House some indication as to when he intends to have the election of these five members of the Indian Council. We realize that the Bill provides for the compilation of voters&#x2019; rolls and for other steps that have to be taken in order that an election may be held, and we know that this will be done, as the Minister has said, in consultation with the Indian Council. However, in view of the fact that the 25 members of the old council were reappointed for a period of another three years, their period of office will expire at the end of August, 1974, and therefore I think it is important that the hon. the Minister should give some indication as to when he expects the five elected members to be able to be elected so that they can gain some experience in this council before its term of office expires in August, 1974. We will also then be in a position to see what role the five elected members will be able to play in making this Indian Council a more effective body which will be able to voice its opinion, through its elected representatives, and come forward with suggestions as to how they believe the lot of the Indian community may be improved. At this stage, Sir, we support the Third Reading of this Bill in the hope that it will bring about an improvement and that it will be of assistance to the Indian community as a whole.</p>

<p>We are pleased to hear that the Opposition is supporting this Third Reading. Consequently it is also unnecessary to comment to any great extent on the speech made by the hon. member who has just resumed his seat. The hon. member said that this measure would be interim legislation. I do not think that one should view it in the light of interim legislation, but rather as legislation which will remain on the Statute Book for as long as is necessary, and then to pass on to greater deeds at a later stage. The Minister very clearly intimated here that there was consultation between him and the Indian Council all the time; that he and the Indian Council understood and trusted each other, and that they knew how to operate in these matters. The Minister and the Indian Council came to an agreement as to what steps were to be taken in order to constitute the council and how the council was to be elected, and I think it speaks volumes that there is so much confidence in the actions of the hon. the Minister and the Department of Indian Affairs that this population group is prepared to co-operate and go along on this road of development along individual lines. As regards the final shape which the Indian Council is to gain, we should accept that at this stage they would rather see slight progress instead of knowing right now what is going to happen to them from now until a point in time in the distant future. It is typical of the inherent code of conduct of this population group to practise patience and forbearance, and in my opinion we should drive them into moving faster than they themselves think they can move. They practise patience and forbearance; they believe in the honesty of the Minister and of the National Government, and to me it is very clear that they are prepared to make haste slowly in this respect. An author of repute once said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No man, in any condition of life, can pass his days with tolerable comfort without patience.</block>

<p>This is also what we may in this case say about the Indian community, for they feel, as this author said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The loud complaint, the querulous temper, fretful spirit, disgrace every character; weaken thereby the sympathy of others, and estrange them from offices of kindness and comfort.</block>

<p>Let us join them in this thought. I think that what I have just said here, reflects the attitude of the Indian community. The following words by the same author embody the development of the Indian community in their new fatherland, as they have in fact accepted it now, in which they want to achieve more and more, namely&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Patience produces unity in the church, loyalty in the State, harmony in families and societies.</block>

<p>It is against this whole background that we should see the Indian people of the Republic of South Africa. They are assisted by the Minister and the Department of Indian Affairs in their gradual and certain growth and in their going from strength to strength on the road of development along individual lines and self-realization.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from><span class="col_4191-4192" refersTo="page_0558"/>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am going to take the same line in the Third Reading of this Bill that I took in the Second Reading, and that is to oppose it. I was not here unfortunately during the Committee Stage of the Bill, but I have read the debates and the points of view expressed by hon. members here. I have also read the replies given to them by the hon. the Minister, and I cannot say that very much has emerged from the Committee Stage of the Bill and that any improvements have been effected. As far as I can make out there was one only, and that relates to the question of the removal of a member of the council should he be found to be of unsound mind. That procedure has been changed and improved to some extent, but obviously in the Committee Stage no principles which were involved at the Second Reading could in fact be changed and therefore I am back to square one as far as this Bill is concerned, and so of course is the official Opposition. They take the same line that they took in the Second Reading, namely that they are going to support the Bill. I must say at once that I think we are deceiving ourselves if we think that this Bill will satisfy the Indian people. The hon. the Minister has told us that he has consulted with the Indian Council and that they have said that they want him to go ahead with the Bill. The quotations which have been made in this House from the chairman of the council show that the Bill is very far from what is really wanted by the council, and I would say that it certainly is very far from what is wanted by the mass of the Indian people. I do not believe that the council itself can be considered to be truly representative of the feelings of Indians who have any political opinions because, as we know, over the years political Indians have largely been silenced in South Africa. The once powerful organization which represented them and their political aims and ambitions, the Indian Congress, has been emasculated because many of the leaders of the organization have been banned or placed under house arrest and so on, so that these people no longer function in the political sense; they are no longer vocal as they used to be when they represented the Indian people. Some of them may have been extreme but the majority of them were asking for what all men ask for if they wish to live in a democratic society, and that is the right to have a meaningful say in the government of the country in which they live. I do not believe that this council offers anything of the kind. It is, as has been shown in discussions during Second Reading and in the Bill itself and in the Committee Stage, a body which certainly <i>pro tem</i> and for the foreseeable future will consist of 25 nominated members and of 5 elected members. So it can hardly be considered a representative body at all. The hon. member for Port Natal stated at Second Reading that he was surprised and disappointed at my attitude during the Second Reading of this Bill. I must tell him that the feeling is not mutual. I am never surprised and I am never disappointed at what the United Party does in this House. Six years in the caucus of the United Party relieved me of my youthful illusions, so I am neither disappointed nor surprised. But I must say to the hon. member for Port Natal, that he must have discovered in the Committee Stage discussions of this Bill that he was very wrong in one assumption that he made, and that is that meaningful powers as regards group areas and housing were going to be handed over to the Indian Council. When I read the Bill I immediately assumed that this was not the case because I knew full well that neither the portfolio of housing nor the portfolio of group areas fell under the Minister of Indian Affairs. The Department of Indian Affairs has nothing whatever to do with housing for Indians, or with group area proclamations and the administration of Group Areas Act, and I see that during the Committee Stage debate this is what the hon. the Minister has had to tell the hon. member for Port Natal&#x2014;that the Indian Council will not in fact have as one of its delegated functions the right to handle group areas proclamations. So the hon. member must realize that the powers which he hoped the council would be able to use, are in fact not going to be handed over to the council.</p>

<p>The other little comment which I must make before I get on to the Bill again, is about his statement, or words to that effect, that my attitude was that if the Indians could not have the whole loaf, I would not want them to have half a loaf. He spoke I think of a slice and I said that I did not consider that this was even a crumb. As far as this loaf business is concerned, I just want to remind the hon. member of the words once used by the late Chief Luthuli in this regard. He said that if people offered you half a loaf, you should be very careful that it was made of bread. In this case I do not believe that the half a loaf is made of bread, it is a sawdust loaf.</p>

<p>Has the hon. the Minister forgotten the 1927 agreement&#x003F; Has he forgotten the Cape Town agreement of 1927 when Dr. Malan was the Minister of Interior of this country&#x003F; [Interjections.] Most important of all was that Dr. Malan, by agreement with the Indian Government &#x2014;his agreement was on behalf of the South African Government&#x2014;recognized that those Indians who remained in South Africa were a permanent part of the population. I took the trouble to look this up because I remembered suddenly, as I was preparing this, about the 1927 agreement and I remembered the famous upliftment clause. I think I should like to read it to the hon. the Minister, because I think he has forgotten it too. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Union Government firmly believes and adheres to the principle that it is the duty of every civilized government to devise ways and means to take all possible steps for the uplifting of every section of their permanent population to the full extent of their capacity and opportunities and accept the view that in the provision of educational and other facilities, a considerable number of Indians who will remain part of the permanent population, should not be allowed to lag behind any other sections of the people.</block>

<p>That was in 1927. It was then already accepted by the Nationalists in the Nationalist Labour Pact Government with Dr. Malan as its spokesman. The Indians were at that time accepted as a part of the permanent population. I should like to say that the upliftment part of this clause has been taken somewhat literally and thousands of Indians have been uplifted from their houses and removed elsewhere.

<p>I wish to tell the hon. Minister that it is a long time since the 1927 agreement was signed. If this is all that this Government can produce now by way of giving the Indians any political rights in this country, it is a very sad story indeed. The hon. the Minister in reply to the Chairman of the executive committee of the Indian Council, when the gentleman informed him that very strong public <span class="col_4195-4196" refersTo="page_0560"/>opinion had been built up in favour of the council as an entirely elected body, said that he did not want to be rushed. I have his exact words here. He said he did not want to be rushed, and he gave a very interesting reason for this. He said that practical difficulties had made this impossible at the present time. He said that these difficulties included the finalization of group areas and the resettlement of people, which must be done before voters&#x2019; lists could be compiled and the electoral divisions could be demarcated. Furthermore, he said that the system of elected members could therefore only be introduced gradually. I do not know what the hon. the Minister means by that, and I hope he will explain it to us. A large number of Indians have already been moved under group area proclamation and a large number remains to be moved. I think there are over 12 000 families who still have to be moved under the present proclamation. There may still be further proclamations in the future. However, this is no excuse for delaying the existing council in becoming a fully representative body.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says that he is worried about the verkramptes, which may very well be true. Certainly this excuse does not hold water. After all, there is a floating population in the whole of South Africa. Even the so&#x002D;called White settled areas are full of mobile people. All of us know that when it comes to running an election, about a quarter of the constituents have disappeared. They have to be traced all over again. We would never have delimitations if we had to worry about whether the population was permanently settled or not. This excuse is simply not valid: it is not valid from a practical point of view, and it is certainly not valid from a moral point of view. The Indian people are one of the most advanced groups in the country. Educationally, they are certainly the most advanced non-White group. In this regard I give credit to the department for the improvements in education as far as the Indians are concerned. However, there is no valid excuse at this stage, in the year 1972, for offering the Indian people this poor excuse for political rights that this Bill represents. I am not prepared to put a stamp of approval on this Bill, which I believe does not only not go far enough, but which does not even begin to go anywhere at all. I believe that that is the opinion of thinking politically-minded Indian people. I believe that it is really an insult to the Indian people at this stage to offer them a council like this as a so-called substitution for political rights in this House.</p>

<p>I want to refer to the finances again. I asked the hon. the Minister where the council is going to derive its finances and he said that this Parliament would vote money to the Department of Indian Affairs, which in turn would hand the money on. This shows that the council has no political say of any importance, and it has no financial independence whatsoever. So far we have heard only of the two portfolios which they are going to handle. Other powers may be delegated in the future as the State President, i.e. the Minister in Executive Council, will decide, but as the hon. the Minister has pointed out, his own Department of Indian Affairs has very limited jurisdiction indeed. The things that really matter to the Indian people are group areas proclamations, job reservation and economic problems which flow from those two particular things. These things are entirely out of their control. Therefore we can at no time envisage that the Indian Council is going to be able to take a practical hand in assisting in finding a solution for the economic problems caused by the tremendous shunting around of the Indian population which has taken place already and which is still to take place. For all these reasons I am afraid I am unable to support this Bill, and I must express my disappointment at the fact that the hon. the Minister of Indian Affairs, who says that he has consulted with Indian leaders, can for one moment imagine that this Bill, which we are passing this afternoon, is going to satisfy the aims and the ambitions of the Indian people in South Africa.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#viljoen">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. VAN B. VILJOEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Houghton, the self-appointed champion of the non-Whites in South Africa, has spoken once again. Sometimes one wonders with what end in view that hon. member always comes forward with this tragic appeal in regard to the conditions of our non-Whites. Sometimes we wonder whether they want her as their representative here. I do not think so. In any case, the hon. member tried to make out a case here to establish by whom the Indians had originally been <span class="col_4197-4198" refersTo="page_0561"/>granted the right to exist in South Africa. Whether or not it was Dr. Malan or Gen. Hertzog in 1927, or whether it was during the sixties, the fact nevertheless remains that it was done by the National Party. That is the only point that has actually been made.</p>

<p>This Bill will serve as an important step towards the self-realization of the Indians in South Africa as regards their political say in their own affairs. This Bill contains two important principles. The first principle is that this will now be a partly elected body. As I said before, this is really a tradition in South Africa. Many forms of executive powers in South Africa have developed in this manner. In this regard I pointed out that in years gone by the same thing happened in the history of the Cape, i.e. that a nominated body became a partly elected body in the course of time. That was also the tradition in Natal. Therefore I think that this Bill follows a typically South African tradition.</p>

<p>The second principle contained in this Bill is that this Indian Council is going to be granted certain executive powers. These two principles are supposedly supported by the United Party. The only thing that I find rather strange, is how, when one says one supports something, it is possible that during the debate conducted on this Bill we have now virtually had to listen for a week to the objections of the United Party in regard to a matter which they support. The hon. member for Umbilo once again made it clear this afternoon that the United Party supported this principle, but then he did not go on to attack the details of this Bill, but specifically the principle of this Bill. That is something one cannot understand. This has been the pattern throughout the Second Reading and the Committee Stage of this Bill. How is one to save a nation with the aid of such people! Of course, this is typical of the United Party, which can never adopt an attitude on a matter. They always want to have it both ways in order to satisfy certain people here and another group of people over there.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#viljoen">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. VAN B. VILJOEN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, when we discussed sea-side resorts last week, it was very clear that they always tried to follow a dual policy on any matter that came up for discussion here. The United Party regards itself as the champion of the Indians, but in the course of the debate on this Bill the dubious motives of the United Party were exposed in regard to this matter. The Indians realize this very well. That was why the hon. member for Port Natal made a special effort during this debate to make personal attacks on me and others; he tried to make a big fuss of the fact that allegedly I know nothing about Indians. Then he went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I would like to remind the hon. the Minister that this side of the House did not disfranchise the Indians in 1949. It was that side of the House which scrapped the 1946 Act of Parliament in 1949.</block>

<p>Now I want to ask, in the first place, why they never proclaimed that Act before 1948. When they granted the Indians these rights in 1946, did they not have the courage of their convictions to proclaim that Act&#x003F; This Act was never proclaimed. If they are supposedly so concerned about the rights of the Indians in this House, why did they not state unambiguously, when they had the opportunity to do so over the years, that if they ever came to power, they would restore the representation of the Indians on the basis of 1946&#x003F; Why have they never said that&#x003F; They are afraid of what the voters outside will say. When one looks at their constitutional plan today, one sees that in terms of that the Indians will have a miserable representation by Whites in this House of Assembly. I want to ask whether that side of the United Party has any morality. None whatsoever. On the contrary, we are dealing here with a United Party which advocates a policy of &#x201C;communal councils&#x201D;, and heaven only knows what that means. I believe that there are very few people who know what it means. Apparently this qualified franchise of 1946 is now far too enlightened for the United Party in these times, because at the moment they are engaged in recruiting rural voters again. Over there we have the true United Party in the person of the hon. member for Houghton, for up to now she has consistently adhered to the pre-1948 policy of the United Party. In analysing the matter, one cannot arrive at any other conclusion. The United Party also said in this debate that we were not going far enough. I wonder how far they want to go in regard to this matter. Why do they not say how far they want to go&#x003F; To what lengths do they want to go in this White Parliament, should they ever come into <span class="col_4199-4200" refersTo="page_0562"/>power&#x003F; All I know, is that the Indians themselves are rejecting the United Party&#x2019;s policy.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Natal also made a personal attack on me. The fact remains, however, that last year, when he along with certain members of the Other Place tried to plot and scheme behind the scenes with the Indians at Newcastle, the Indians told them, &#x201C;Be off! We do not want to have anything to do with you.&#x201D; That hon. member and certain United Party Senators tried to plot and scheme behind the scenes with the Indians in order to persuade them to get a court order against the chairman of the Group Areas Board. It is true that these people have been rejected by the Indians. In fact, the Indians very soon discovered that that trick of the United Party was only employed for one single purpose, namely for their own miserable political gain and not for the benefit of the Indians. This delicate situation of group areas is constantly being exploited by those people for their own miserable political gain. That is one fact we cannot argue away. I am supposed to be the person who knows so little about Indian affairs, and the hon. member for Port Natal did not even want to reply to a question of mine because, ostensibly, I do not know a thing about this matter. And yet I have had the closest contact with the Indian leaders of Natal on various occasions. I can assure you, Sir, that their thinking does in any case not go as far as was suggested here by the United Party. They reject the United Party with the contempt it deserves. This Bill is another important step on the constitutional road of the Indians. They will accept it with the same responsibility as that with which they handled the old Indian Council.</p>

<p>The next matter we come to, is another very important one. The United Party is also opposed to this Bill because of the provision that extensions to the council and its functions may be effected by proclamation. Now, how is one to understand this&#x003F; In the same breath they say that we are not going far enough; but because this Bill provides that the powers and the constitution of the Indian Council may be extended by proclamation, they are raising objections. Surely, this is the very thing they asked for, i.e. that we should go further than this Bill envisages at this stage. But, Sir, if this Bill is passed, surely the House of Assembly will have adopted this principle. Why then should we come back to this House every time in order to reconfirm this principle over and again&#x003F; Surely that would be absolutely foolish. That would be inconsistent. That would be ridiculous and contrary to all logic. The National Party&#x2019;s standpoint is consistent and clear, and this Bill reflects our singleness of purpose to implement our policy in South Africa. The United Party is once again riding its two horses, one for the city and one for the rural areas, and now it also has a foal to ride on&#x2014;the Indians.</p>

<speech by="#winchester">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in speaking the other day, I said the hon. member for Newcastle knew nothing about the Indian problem. I felt at the time that I might have been a bit harsh in making that statement. However, after listening to the hon. member this afternoon, I can state with far more authority that he certainly knows nothing about the Indians. He talks with some pride about what the Nationalist Government has done for the Indian community, but I have yet to hear an Indian talk with any gratitude for what the Nationalist Government has done for the Indian community. He mentioned that in 1946 we passed an Act of Parliament and asked why it had not been promulgated. But he overlooks the fact that in 1948 his party came into power and repealed the 1946 Act in 1949. I want to give that hon. member the assurance that, though this Bill of 1972 will not have been put on the Statute Book by the United Party Government, when we come into power we will certainly not repeal this Act and offer the Indians less than they have now. The hon. member also talked about my activities in Newcastle. I want to say to him in that respect that the last has certainly not been heard of Newcastle. In future months a good deal more is going to be heard and that hon. member&#x2019;s activities will not be noted with a great deal of pride.</p>

<p>I should like to turn to what the hon. member for Houghton had to say. I criticized the hon. member for Houghton in my Second Reading speech, and I believe justifiably so. Her attitude, as she clearly stated herself, after I had said that half a loaf was better than no bread, was that it was not even a crumb. I should like to remind the hon. member for Houghton that even a crumb to a person who has nothing is almost a meal.</p>

<speech by="#winchester">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton can speak with these high motives from her point of view, but I believe that she is speaking from the point of view of her own Party and not from the point of view of what is good for the Indian community. We on this side of the House judge our motives from what is good for the community for which this legislation is being passed. For this reason we supported this measure and we continue to do so. Finally, as far as the hon. member for Houghton is concerned, I should like to quote to her what was said in 1946&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is only to the extent that we can see in this Bill a means also to the upliftment of the present still unrepresented Indian community that we are justified in supporting it.</block>

<p>This was said by the late Mr. Hofmeyr in 1946. He took that point of view in 1946, but the hon. member for Houghton today takes a completely opposing view. As far as we are concerned, we have to judge every measure that comes before this House from the point of view of what benefit it will have for the community affected. We on this side of the House, although this Bill does not go nearly as far as we would like it to go, nevertheless believe that it is an improvement on existing legislation. For that reason we must not only accept the Bill, but we welcome it; we welcome any improvement for the Indian community and any other community in South Africa as well.</p>

<p>We see this as a sign that we are moving into saner and more realistic times in South Africa. We, in common with the Indian Council, and the Indian people would like to see a fully elected Indian Council. We have made our point of view in that regard quite clear. We see this nevertheless, though it is far from what we would like it to be, as an improvement on the existing position.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister says that he consults with the Indian Council. One of the disturbing features is that he certainly may consult with the Indian Council, but he appears to ignore their views. As the hon. member for Umbilo pointed out, when the Indian Council made it quite clear that they wanted a fully elected council, they were ignored, although the hon. the Minister himself, in an earlier statement some time ago, said that he would give them a council when they asked for it. They have asked for it, and the Minister has cut down that representation to only five elected members. The Indian Council have also made other pleas to him over the years. They have asked him to do away with provincial travel permits; this is one of their biggest bones of contention, and the Minister has ignored that act of consultation as well. The point I am making is that there is no point in consulting with this Indian Council if the Minister is then going to ignore their every wish. For this council to be effective, the Minister must accept their recommendations. In the past this has certainly not been the case.</p>

<p>The Indian Council is now going to have five elected members. For the first time the Indian people, the ordinary Indian man-in-the-street, the Indian community, is going to have a voice, and an elected voice. If the hon. the Minister now ignores the recommendations of the council, he will be ignoring the wishes of the Indian people themselves. If he chooses to do this, we shall be back where we started. At long last an element&#x2014;a small element, it is true, but nevertheless an element&#x2014;of democracy has crept into Indian affairs in South Africa. There will be elected members in the Indian Council who will be the watchdogs for the Indian people on the council. The nominated members owe their position to the Minister himself and they would be less than human if they did not watch and guard their tongues in the council. The elected members, however, are not going to be in this position. They will have a tremendous responsibility, because there will be nothing to stop them speaking their minds in the council; their position in the council will not be dependent on the whim of the Minister. It is to these people that the Indian Council are going to look for an improvement in their affairs. These elected members in the midst of the Indian Council are, as I have said, going to be the voice of the Indian people. I believe that the Minister will be very chary of not carrying out their wishes. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister, when he replies to this debate, to tell me whether the hearings of this newly constituted Indian Council are going to be held in public. One of the criticisms of the last council was that its meetings were held behind closed doors. I should like to know from the hon. the Minister <span class="col_4203-4204" refersTo="page_0564"/>whether these meetings are now going to be held in public, whether Hansards are going to be published of their proceedings, and whether these Hansards are going to be made available. It is important, more to the Indian people than to anybody in this House, that they are aware of what is going on in their council. Up to the present they have not been aware of the proceedings in the council except by means of Press statements, which are not at all satisfactory. If, therefore, democracy is to work in the Indian Council, it is going to have to be seen to work, and so I ask the hon. the Minister to let us know whether these meetings are going to be held in public and whether Hansard reports are going to be published of their proceedings.</p>

<p>This new Indian Council is also going to have a wonderful opportunity, in that it will for the first time be able to draw up full voters&#x2019; rolls and constituency boundaries. It will be a very simple matter, once this has been done, to increase the number of elected members from five to the full thirty, because all the machinery will have been established. For this reason too, we support this measure, because it is a move in the direction which we ourselves wish to travel. It is a move in a direction in which the hon. member for Houghton would also wish to travel. So, for this reason and for the other reasons stated by the hon. member for Umbilo, we shall support this measure as we did in the Second Reading. We hope that the Indian Council will have a great deal of success. We hope, more than anything else, that its members will be as outspoken as they need to be, because if they are not outspoken the council will not be a success. For those reasons we support this measure.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, at the start of his speech, as well as on a previous occasion, the hon. member for Port Natal accused the hon. member for Newcastle of having no knowledge of Indian affairs. I leave it to the judgment of this House to decide on the basis of the arguments advanced by the hon. member whether he may be regarded as being an expert in the field of Indian affairs. The hon. member had another disagreement with the hon. member for Houghton about her refusal to accept this legislation.</p>

<p>Sir, it is a long time since I have seen a party giving its support to legislation and then having four or five speakers participating in the Second Reading debate in order to tell us of its support for the legislation, and then having two more speakers participating in the Third Reading debate in order to tell us once again of its support for the legislation. I do not think the Minister had stronger support than that of those hon. members in regard to this legislation, particularly in that they said the Bill &#x201C;moved in the direction we wished to travel&#x201D;. It was striking that those members of the United Party did not have the courage to move an amendment to the Second Reading, or even now, to the Third Reading. Throughout they quoted what the chairman of the executive committee of the Indian Council had allegedly said. They accepted the statements he had made, i.e. that he would like to see the entire council being an elected one. They probably repeated that four or five times in the Second Reading debate, during the Committee Stage and once more during this stage. I repeat that hon. members of the Opposition do not have the courage of their convictions to say that they do not accept this principle. This principle of elected and appointed members is an important one in this legislation.</p>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am not going to reply to questions now. I say the principle laid down in this legislation is a very important one, i.e. the principle of elected and appointed members, and hon. members of the United Party support it. Although I do not agree with the hon. member for Houghton at all, she is at least honest in opposing the entire principle. Sir, hon. members of the United Party say every time: &#x201C;We would like to see a fully elected council.&#x201D; but they have supported this legislation throughout.</p>

<p>To have all the members of the Indian Council elected at this stage would, to my mind, be in conflict with the policy of gradual or evolutionary progress of the Indian Council in respect of their powers and privileges on the one hand, and their responsibilities on the other hand. It will wreck the object of systematic constitutional progress, because hon. members of the United Party and the hon. member for Houghton want to place too many responsibilities too soon on the shoulders of the Indian Council. What is the constitution of the existing council, which consists of appointed members <span class="col_4205-4206" refersTo="page_0565"/>at the present time&#x003F; Sir, after the Minister had given thorough consideration to the fields of interest, etc., of persons, he decided to retain the 25 appointed members. On what basis&#x003F; On what basis were these members appointed&#x003F; In the first place, the geographical distribution of the members was taken into consideration, and, in the second place, their religious and cultural interest, and in the third place their commercial, professional and public activities. On that basis Natal obtained 15 members, the Transvaal 7 members, and the Cape three members. I say that this Council was constituted judiciously. A particularly fine balance was maintained. The Minister may act as a kind of arbiter to give fair representation to the various groups. I do not think that at the present time the Indian electorate is sufficiently educated politically to be able to consider matters as judiciously as the Minister. If one religious group were strong, they would simply elect members of their own religious group if all members had to be elected. In the course of time they have to be educated politically so that they may judge objectively. Sir, I want to mention to you what has already occurred in a few cases. In the case of Verulam, an independent Indian city council or town council came into being in 1969. It was a local authority of full status. It used to consist of appointed members. Those appointed members were the people who were originally appointed by the Administrator, and in the election virtually all those people were successful and were elected. That is proof that the Administrator&#x2014;and this is the case with the Minister as well&#x2014;acts judiciously when they appoint the people. I am not sorry that the United Party supports the legislation, but I am disappointed that they come forward and said time and again, despite the fact that they support the legislation, that they would have liked to see this council being a fully elected Indian council at this stage.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF INDIAN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, first of all I would like to say that the debate has not gone contrary to what I expected. I expected the hon. member for Houghton to oppose the Bill. She did that in the Second Reading, as I expected. I expected the United Party to display its usual attitude, that they support the Bill but &#x2026; [Interjections.] Then they continued to criticize the principles of the Bill in their roundabout way. I know how they do these things. They are playing up all the time to the supporters of the hon. member for Houghton. After all, in regard to the hon. member for Port Natal, I first of all said that I hoped this lovers&#x2019; quarrel would be settled, but now I can see what is happening. He is jealous of the position he has held in Natal with the Indian Congress as the champion of the Indians and he is afraid that the hon. member for Houghton would take over his role. That is why he said what he did. I am afraid it goes much deeper than I originally thought, and I am afraid that the hon. member for Houghton will not be able to woo him over. He is so much in the United Party at the present moment that they have fixed him good and solid. They have gone out of their way to tie him to them because they were afraid that the hon. member for Port Natal might have been looking a bit too hard at the hon. member for Houghton. [Interjections.] Now let me deal with the hon. member for Umbilo, who had so much to say. He said that I said that this was an interim measure.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member came with this business about the United Party actually believing in a fully-elected Indian Council. The hon. member for Port Natal came with the same sentiment. They believe in it and that is United Party policy, a fully-elected Indian Council. It amazes me that they can still come with that argument, because I told them in my Second Reading speech exactly what the position was. I read out a regulation under a Natal Provincial Ordinance. The United Party controls the province of Natal. They control the local authorities in Natal, and if they felt so strongly about this &#x2026; [Interjections.] &#x2026; why do they not change their regulation&#x003F; I want to read it again.

Now at least they are more circumspect. They now talk about their having to guard their tongues. With reference to what the hon. member for Umbilo read to the House what Mr. Rajab, who is chairman of the executive said, I want to ask hon. members whether it sounds as if that man is knee-haltered and that I opposed his saying what he did. Does he sound like a man who expresses his opinion, or as the hon. member said, does he sound like a man who has to guard his tongue&#x003F; It is just talk, an attempt to give not only the Indian people, but the people outside, the wrong impression about the Government&#x2019;s attitude to the Indian people. That is the situation. The point is that the hon. members in the United Party are retreating. First of all, the members of the council were stooges. Now they say there is no real consultation and that I ignore them. When they find out that that is not the case, they will come with something else.</p>

<p><span class="col_4213-4214" refersTo="page_0569"/>For years now this council has operated, and operated successfully, on a basis which has been decided by the council. They do not allow the Press to be present. They allow the Press to be present only at certain stages. When I addressed the council, the Press was present.

We intend proceeding on this basis, because we find it the best.

Delaying it in any way is not my intention. In fact, the mere fact that I introduced this measure to say that the 25 members already appointed will remain and that five members would be elected to increase the council to 30 members, points to the fact that I want to get on with that job immediately, so that the five members can be elected. The hon. member also talked about the Cape and the Transvaal, but he will appreciate that there is no voters* roll for Indians in the Cape at all. There is no voters&#x2019; roll for Indians whatsoever, and I have to start from scratch. That is why we may have to do it piecemeal and will have to tackle the Transvaal and Natal first, for example. We may not be able to tackle the Cape immediately and I am not going to hold up the elections in the Transvaal or in Natal because I am waiting for the position as a whole to be clarified.</p>

<p>Sir, in the first place the hon. member&#x2019;s question refers to land. Although provision was made for certain activities, we have found in South-West Africa that these did not <span class="col_4217-4218" refersTo="page_0571"/>specifically include administrative offices, etc. As regard the sea, there are, as the hon. member knows, activities concerning diamond mining and prospecting.

<p>The matter of natural oil is, of course, something quite different, as the continental shelf determines the prospecting for and the mining of natural oil. Now one does find that sometimes the continental shelf is under very deep sea, but this is recognized internationally and is also defined very clearly in the various agreements entered into by Soekor with the various companies.

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause amends the definition section in the principal Act, and I should like to raise a point in this connection. I hope the hon. the Minister will be good enough to explain the position. In paragraph (d) of clause 1 the expression &#x201C;pupil nurses&#x201D; is inserted. The definition of &#x201C;training school&#x201D; now reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;training school&#x201D; means a training school or institution where student nurses or midwives, pupil nurses or pupil nursing assistants are trained.</block>

<p>I wonder whether the hon. the Minister would explain the difference between a &#x201C;student nurse&#x201D; and a &#x201C;pupil nurse&#x201D;, because I can find no definition in this regard, although both expressions are used in this Bill. Later on in the Bill there are references to student nurses and pupil nurses as regards the curricula to be established; there appears to be a different curriculum for student nurses and pupil nurses. There are other references of this type as well which appear from time to time in the Bill. I shall be grateful if the hon. the Minister would indicate the difference between the two, and where that difference is defined in the legislation before the House.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this change has been brought about in a number of clauses. The present position, as the Act stands at present, is that &#x201C;student nurse or midwife&#x201D; refers to students who are studying for a diploma which entitles them to be registered with the Nursing Council in general nursing, in psychiatry or in midwifery. In the Afrikaans <span class="col_4219-4220" refersTo="page_0572"/>version the present position is that &#x201C;student nurse and midwife&#x201D; is translated by the words &#x201C;leerlingverpleegster&#x201D; and &#x201C;leerlingvroedvrou&#x201D;.</p>

<p>*We are now changing it to &#x201C;studenteverpleegster&#x201D; and &#x201C;studentevroedvrou&#x201D;, to bring it into line with the English, as it was. It is also related, however, to the further changes which are being introduced, namely that &#x201C;hulpverpleegster&#x201D; and &#x201C;hulpvroedvrou&#x201D; are also being replaced.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The present position is that in the case of auxiliary nurses or midwives we are using the expression &#x201C;student auxiliary nurse or midwife&#x201D;. This is now being changed, because of the diplomas, to &#x201C;pupil nurses or pupil nursing assistants&#x201D;. This is translated as &#x201C;leerlingverpleegsters of leerling-verpleegassistente&#x201D;, because they are entitled only to enrolment with the South African Nursing Council. In other words, we are drawing a clear distinction between those studying for a diploma to be registered with the Council and those undergoing training to be enrolled with the Council. I may say that this request came from the Nursing Association, from the Provincial Administrations and also from the missionary hospitals in the Bantu homelands and outside the homelands.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I thank the Minister for his explanation. I appreciate the purpose behind the difference between &#x201C;student nurse&#x201D; and &#x201C;pupil nurse&#x201D;, but one still has to bear in mind the question of definition and the legality of the position. I do not want the Minister to worry about this now, but I wonder whether his department, at any rate, should not ensure that the power to differentiate is in fact given to the council, because I cannot find it in the regulations. However, I leave the matter with the hon. the Minister to see whether that power to apply a titular differentiation between student nurses and pupil nurses in fact exists.</p>

<p>There is no provision whatsoever for a panel. It will be done in exactly the same way as it has been done since 1957 by the Bantu and the Coloured nurses. We have had no problems in that regard at all; it has worked extremely well. They get to know the White nurses who are active in nursing affairs. Hon. members must not forget that they have their separate congresses where White nurses address them on different matters, but apart from that, there are very few places where they are in employment where there are not White nurses also who play a leading role. The system has created no problem whatsoever so far, and I do not think hon. members need worry about this point at all.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>In this Bill before us the hon. the Minister has done away <span class="col_4221-4222" refersTo="page_0573"/>with the compulsory fee to be paid for registration with the council and which was limited before to 10 shillings. There is now to be a prescribed fee in terns of the new subclause (c). I have heard the point raised on occasion that it is virtually compulsory for nurses to join their associations also. I know that legally it is voluntary, but it is well-nigh compulsory for them to join their associations as well. The fees are becoming extremely steep, and I wonder if the hon. the Minister could give us an assurance that where there is not equality of pay between the different races, he will look into the question of some adjustment in their membership fees. At the moment I believe it is R20 for a White nurse who wishes to join an association, in addition to her registration fee, and if that is to apply to all races, a fee of R20 per annum for membership of their associations could place a very heavy burden on these nurses. I should like the hon. the Minister to look into this, because apparently the associations can levy whatever fee they wish for membership of their association.</p>

<p>Yes. Since 1957 the association has been a statutory body, so all nurses are members. I think the fees to be paid are laid down by regulation. I will certainly keep an eye on this in view of the fact that, as the hon. member has pointed out, there is a discrepancy between the pay for different categories of nurses and nurses of different colours. In terms of the Act passed in 1957, the association in this case is different from the Medical Association or the Dental Association. This was laid down at their request, and I must say that I have had no complaint about this whatsoever in the 15 years during which this measure has been in operation.</p>

<p>The hon. member has somewhat mixed up this matter of students and pupils, but let me explain to the hon. member. The term &#x201C;student nurses&#x201D; applies to those who are studying for the diploma in general nursing, in psychiatry or midwifery. To become a student nurse, that student has to comply with certain requirements.</p>

<p>No, wait a minute. She has to have at least Std. X. Only then can she become a student nurse. A pupil nurse can become a pupil nurse without having Std. X, having Std. VIII only, but after she has gone through the course of a pupil nurse, she can go on to become a student nurse without ever attaining Std. X. In other words, the training as a pupil nurse takes the place of the higher requirement of Std. X. So what the hon. member has in mind can happen today. I might also inform the hon. member that I was a bit worried about this Std. X qualification, but I made extensive inquiries even in the Bantu homelands, and it is creating no problem at all. The nurses are enrolling as student nurses in large enough numbers, even in the Bantu homelands, with one or two <span class="col_4223-4224" refersTo="page_0574"/>small exceptions, so that this has not brought the number of nurses, of young ladies who are studying or who are becoming student nurses, for the diplomas in South Africa, too low.</p>

<p>I want to refer to page 11, line 44, paragraph (s). I want to tell the hon. Minister how much one welcomes the substitution for the word &#x201C;calling&#x201D; of the word &#x201C;profession&#x201D;. I believe this is long overdue, that nursing should be regarded as a profession; there has been some difficulty in this regard in the provincial legislation. One has in the Cape Provincial Ordinance for instance a division of the hospital staff into the professional, which is the medical and the para-medical section, and the &#x201C;nursing division&#x201D;, as they call it, and then they go on to the administrative division. I hope that under the Minister&#x2019;s pressure, this will lead to the full recognition of nursing as a profession, with all the full privileges of a profession in so far as their positions in hospitals are concerned. There is at the moment a distinction which I believe is no longer necessary, having regard to the advances which have been made and which will be made under this new dispensation.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have no doubt whatsoever that these ladies can look after themselves, but this, again, is at their request and I think it is a great improvement, as this whole Bill is. I think that this Bill is one of the best Bills that we have had before us for a long time. A lot of work has gone into this, not only on our side, but also on their side. This is brought about after 15 years of experience of the new Act, which has never been amended, as hon. members know.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister mentioned to me the difficulty of trying to find a definition for &#x201C;nurse&#x201D;. We find the problem on page 13, line 47, subsection (2), which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The council may register as a nurse for a period not exceeding two years any person who &#x2026;</block>

<p>and then it goes on to stipulate certain intermediary registrations. One wonders how this person fits in. With all the obligations and duties of a registered nurse, does that become her category when once she is registered in this form under this particular clause, notwithstanding the fact that she is not a completely qualified nurse and still has to undergo certain training and should therefore not really be in the same category as a registered nurse&#x003F; Is this something in the interim stage between &#x201C;nurse&#x201D; and &#x201C;fully registered nurse&#x201D;&#x003F;</p>

<p>Yes, that is really what the position is&#x2014;it is an interim registration.</p>

<p>The other point is the difficulty which one sees arising in regard to the penalty provisions which are included in this particular clause. I am referring to the words &#x201C;a person who wears a uniform&#x201D; as prescribed in respect of a nurse. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister can tell me whether there has been any success in defining, or designating or determining what is a uniform for a nurse, apart from the embellishments, apart from the badges of rank, the particular belt or something of that nature. We should like to hear whether it has been possible, because I doubt whether that has in fact been done, to determine a uniform exclusively for the nursing profession; that is, apart from the cape or the epaulettes or badges of rank. I am referring to the actual uniform which is normally a white uniform with a belt.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member referred to page 13&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The council may register as a nurse for a period not exceeding two years any person who &#x2026;</block>

<p>This I think can truly be called an interim registration. The hon. member will recall that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout explained some time ago that non-Whites will be represented in this House by Whites, but according to his views, that would only be an interim period. In other words, after the interim period you might have to continue with the Whites or the Whites might be replaced by Blacks or Coloureds or Indians. In other words, it is not permanent.</p>

<p><span class="col_4225-4226" refersTo="page_0575"/>In this particular case we have the situation that there are many nurses in South Africa who became qualified in other countries, but they cannot be accepted by our Nursing Council for full registration. There are also many nurses who qualified and registered overseas, and who are still there, who inquired at our offices what the position would be were they to come to South Africa. After this has become law, such a nurse will be able to register with the council as a nurse, most probably on a separate register, and she will be able to follow&#x2014; not her calling&#x2014;her profession in any institution, either government, provincial or private, with the only exception that, in so far as that part of the nursing profession is concerned for which she is not qualified, she will not be able to be recognized as a fully qualified nurse for that specific branch of medicine. For instance, she may not be qualified as an orthopaedic nurse. In the two-year period she will be able to qualify in that branch as well and then she will automatically be entitled to be registered as a fully qualified nurse. I think this is a great step forward towards making it possible to make use of those who are in our country and also to draw more qualified nurses to this country, nurses who are considered as qualified in their countries. In terms of this measure we shall be able to create an opportunity for them to get immediate registration as nurses.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to quarrel with the hon. the Minister in regard to these provisions because they are excellent provisions and will help considerably in the staffing of hospitals. It will help considerably because girls with training and experience sufficient for them at least to be utilized while they are awaiting further registrations, can now be used. My difficulty was purely one of the entitlement. This girl would now call herself &#x201C;a registered nurse&#x201D;. A &#x201C;registered nurse&#x201D; in terms of the Act, is a nurse who is registered under section 12. The first subsection of section 12 determines that the council shall register as a nurse any person in possession of the appropriate prescribed qualifications. Therefore, if a woman says that she is a &#x201C;qualified nurse&#x201D;, it implies that she has full qualifications. Here, when these women are registered in terms of this new subsection, she does not have full qualifications. I wonder whether some precaution should not be taken to ensure that she does not hold herself out as a fully registered nurse, when it is in fact purely interim registration. This precaution should be taken because such a person may be applying for a post and then, to my mind, it must be made quite clear that she only has an &#x201C;interim registration&#x201D; as the hon. the Minister has said. I leave it at that, but I think it is necessary to differentiate between such persons. This should be done because all registered nurses fall under this particular section of the principal Act, which is now going to be extended in order to include these people. I think the wording &#x201C;interim registration&#x201D; or &#x201C;temporary registration&#x201D; in terms of section 12 (2) (a) or 12 (2) (b) should appear on the certificate so that when it is produced to an employer or the hospital, it is clear that she is in possession of a temporary or an interim registration.</p>

<p>If one of these temporary registered nurses fails to obtain a clearance as a registered nurse after a period of two years, will she lose the registration&#x003F; Is that what the hon. the Minister is indicating in this clause&#x003F; I ask this because she is only going to be registered for three years under certain conditions. The conditions are that she will qualify in those subjects in which she is not fully qualified at the time. She gets this temporary registration. Will that be on her registration certificate or will the Minister introduce some examination after two years, the examination required to reach a certain degree of proficiency in the subjects in which she is not fully proficient at the time of temporary registration&#x003F; We would like to know what the difference is going to be between such persons holding temporary registration and permanent registration certificates.</p>

<block name="quote">is not entitled to registration as a nurse of subsection (1) (a) because he has not undergone training for the period prescribed by regulation &#x2026; or of the nature so prescribed in respect of some branch of nursing; and &#x2026;</block>

<p>Now I want to quote subsection (3) which provides the following&#x2014;</p>

<p>Hon. members will see that provision is being made here not only in regard to the two years, which is final, but also that regulations can be made in regard to the registration of these nurses. Regulations will be made with regard to the certificates issued. So, all the points raised by the hon. members will be covered in the regulations made. This is a very serious attempt to register that person as a nurse, not temporarily, but for the interim period of two years, which gives the nurses firstly the opportunity of exercising that part of the profession in which she is proficient and which our council recognizes and, secondly, the opportunity of being trained within that period. I am advised that clause 12 (2) (a) also refers to this particular registration. We will come to that in a moment.</p>

<p>As I understand the position, officials of the Nursing Council attend these meetings. Of course, an arrangement is made and can be made at any stage for either the president or another member of the Nursing Council to attend the advisory board meetings&#x2014;not as a full member&#x2014;in order to enlighten them on certain points or to listen to a particular point being discussed. Also, there is nothing debarring the advisory council having dialogue with the Nursing Council or members from it at a round&#x002D;table from time to time.

That means that a White person will attend a non-White meeting or a White meeting.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The Food, Drugs and Disinfectants Act, Act No. 13 of 1929, has now been applied for 42 years. This Act enjoys the particular distinction of not having been amended ever. When this legislation was passed by Parliament in 1929, it was described by the <i>British Medical Journal</i> as the most complete and comprehensive legislation of its kind in existence at that stage. However, gradually it became apparent that it contained certain deficiencies, that it did not afford sufficient cover in every respect and that it did in any case no longer meet modern needs. Drastic changes would have had to be effected to the Act in order to meet these needs by way of amendments. Under these circumstances it was decided to repeal the Act as a whole and to replace it with a new Act. The old Act was aimed at protecting the public against exploitation as a result of dishonest and fraudulent commercial practices, and at protecting the health of the public by prohibiting the adulteration and false description of foodstuffs and other articles, and to regulate related matters.</p>

<p>When this Bill was drafted, the following approach was adopted&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) As drugs are now being controlled fully in terms of the Drugs Control Act, Act No. 101 of 1965, the inclusion thereof in the Bill under discussion is no longer necessary, and they have been omitted.</li>

<li>(b) The Bill is aimed at controlling the articles which one consumes, uses and with which one comes into contact daily, namely food, cosmetics and disinfectants.</li>

<li>(c) The Bill is aimed at prohibiting dishonest and fraudulent commercial practices, which may lead to the exploitation of the public.</li>

</ol>

<p>In this Bill it is provided that&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) foodstuffs, cosmetics and disinfectants, which are in such a condition or of such a nature that they are or may be harmful or injurious to human health, shall be prohibited and may not be imported, manufactured or sold. In this regard I should like to point out that the Public Health Act, 1919, and municipal ordinances deal with the unsuitability of food because of contamination, decay, putrefaction and the presence of parasites. This matter does not belong in this Bill;</li>

<li>(b) foodstuffs, when they are in a particular condition or when specific processes or actions have taken place in regard to them, shall be deemed to be false. This provision is aimed <i>inter alia</i> at preventing foreign substances being added to foodstuffs, such as water to milk, and ingredients being abstracted from foodstuffs, although such additions or abstractions may not be harmful to human health. The principal motive is that the consumer should get what he expects to get as far as foodstuffs and other attributes are concerned; and</li>

<li>(c) foodstuffs, if they are described or advertised in a specific manner, shall be deemed to have been described falsely. The object is mainly to protect the consumer against deception. In recent times the public have become more and more aware of the effects of certain foodstuffs and their ingredients on the bodily constitution, and are insisting more and more that ingredients and their ratios should be specified on the label.</li></ol>

<p>Now I should like to deal briefly with the contents of this Bill. In order to obviate unnecessary references, I shall use the word &#x201C;clause&#x201D; with reference to the Bill and the <span class="col_4231-4232" refersTo="page_0578"/>word &#x201C;section&#x201D; with reference to the Act, which is common practice.</p>

<p>In clause 1 the customary definitions are made.</p>

<p>Clause 2 contains prohibitions in regard to the sale, manufacture or importation of articles which contain substances prohibited by regulation, which do not comply with the standard as prescribed by regulation, which are impure or decayed, or which contain foreign substances. Provision is also made for exceptions in this regard. The provisions of section 4 have been embodied in this clause.</p>

<p>In clause 3 it is provided that a person may not sell any article which differs from the article described on the label. The use or employment of any process, method, appliance, container or object in connection with the manufacture and preparation of articles, or the sale or importation of such articles in connection with the manufacture, preparation or conveyance of which a prohibited process, method or appliance has been used, is being prohibited in terms of clause 4.</p>

<p>Clause 5 deals with the false description or advertisement of articles, and has been included in order to protect the public against deception and adulteration.</p>

<p>In clause 6 provision is made for special defences, in terms of which the accused may plead <i>inter alia</i> that the article was not sold for human consumption, or that it was imported under a written warranty. The warranty mentioned in the previous clause, is dealt with in detail in clause 7, and provides <i>inter alia</i> by whom it shall be furnished, what information it shall reflect, that the furnishing of a false warranty shall be an offence, and what court shall have jurisdiction in respect of an offence.</p>

<p>In order to combat malpractices, it is essential to place the liability on the employer to accept responsibility for the acts of employees in regard to foodstuffs, cosmetics and disinfectants. Such provisions have been embodied in clause 8, in which provision has also been made for defences by the employer. Similar provisions exist in section 30 of the Act.</p>

<p>In terms of clause 9 the liability shall be placed on the person who, according to the label of any article which is sold in a sealed package, is presumed to have imported, manufactured or packed the article in question. Similar provisions already exist in section 10.</p>

<p>Clause 10 makes provision for the appointment of inspectors by the Secretary for Health, and prescribes certain requirements in regard to such appointments. In section 3 of the Act one finds a similar provision, which has to be implemented by the Minister. It is really unnecessary to burden the Minister with such matters, and one may therefore feel free to entrust this task to the Secretary, i.e. the administration and appointment of inspectors, and so forth.</p>

<p>The powers, duties and functions of inspectors, are defined in clause 11.</p>

<p>In clause 12 provision is made for the appointment of analysts by the Secretary for Health. In order to afford accused persons every opportunity of proving their innocence, provision is made in clause 13 for the further analysis of samples, which may be done by a decision of the court, or at the request of the prosecutor, or the accused. Similar provisions exist in section 31.</p>

<p>Clause 14 deals with the inspection, sampling and detention of imported articles. Similar provisions exist in section 11, which are being amended in the following respects, i.e. that&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) the provision that the detention of articles shall be done with the consent of the Secretary for Customs and Excise, be deleted as it is unnecessary;</li>

<li>(b) the provision that the removal of articles and the warranty of the owner shall be approved by the Secretary for Customs and Excise, be changed to approval by the Secretary for Health, since it is actually the latter who has control over articles of the kind in question; and</li>

<li>(c) the responsibility for the decision on the disposal of the consignment, be entrusted to the Secretary for Health instead of to the Minister. It should be mentioned here that officials may not act arbitrarily, as the requirements with which articles must comply, are prescribed fully by law and regulation.</li>

</ol>

<p>In terms of clause 15 the Minister is authorized to make regulations in regard to&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) the nature, composition or standards of any article;</li>

<li><span class="col_4233-4234" refersTo="page_0579"/>(b) the use of substances, processes or appliances in connection with the manufacture, treatment, etc., or abstraction of substances;</li>

<li>(c) the disclosure of the use of particular substances, processes, additions or abstractions, etc.;</li>

<li>(d) the maximum presence of substances which may unavoidably be present as a result of the process of manufacture;</li>

<li>(e) what articles shall be deemed to be harmful or injurious to human health;</li>

<li>(f) the foodstuff which is declared to be perishable;</li>

<li>(g) the prohibition on the sale of a particular article;</li>

<li>(h) the name under which the article may be sold;</li>

<li>(i) the prohibition on, or restriction or regulation of appliances, etc., in the manufacturing process;</li>

<li>(j) the packing of articles;</li>

<li>(k) the labelling of articles;</li>

<li>(l) the exemption from labelling;</li>

<li>(m) the duties and powers of inspectors in regard to samples;</li>

<li>(n) the duties and powers of analysts; and related matters. The duty is imposed on the Minister to publish draft regulations for comment not less than three months before promulgation. This is the usual practice, and it works satisfactorily that way. Regulations under the present Act are dealt with in section 42.</li>

</ol>

<p>Provision must also be made to protect manufacturers against the disclosure of information obtained as a result of analysing articles. This is being done in clause 16, in terms of which information may only be disclosed in a court or with the authority in writing of the Secretary for Health. Similar provisions exist in sections 39 and 40.</p>

<p>Offences and contraventions are dealt with in clause 17.</p>

<p>Consequent upon these contraventions, the penalties are provided in clause 18. Increased penalties are being proposed in order to fit in with the passage of time since the passing of the present Act in 1929. In clause 19 the jurisdiction of the court is defined, which corresponds with section 41.</p>

<p>The only difference between clause 20 and section 35 in regard to the forfeiture of goods, is contained in the fact that the responsibility for the decision on the disposal of the articles passes on from the Minister to the Secretary. Forfeiture as such is done by the court, and the decision on the disposal thereof, may be done by the Secretary.</p>

<p>Clause 21 deals with the time limit of trials in prosecutions and the evidence of analysts.</p>

<p>In clause 22 it is provided that&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) copies of or extracts from documents may serve as <i>prima facie</i> proof in a court;</li>

<li>(b) a certificate signed by an analyst may serve a <i>prima facie</i> proof;</li>

<li>(c) unless the contrary is proved, any quantity of an article shall be presumed to be in the same condition or possess the same properties as the sample;</li>

<li>(d) any sample obtained by an inspector, shall be presumed to have been sold to him;</li>

<li>(e) articles that have been manufactured, treated or imported, shall be presumed to have been obtained for purposes of sale;</li>

<li>(f) appliances and materials found in any premises where articles are manufactured or stored, etc., shall be presumed to be used for that purpose;</li>

<li>(g) any person who sells, manufactures or imports any article which contains any other article or in which any other article is present, shall be presumed to sell, manufacture or import such other article.</li></ol>

<p>A similar provision is already in existence, and is now being extended.</p>

<p>In terms of clause 23, the Minister may authorize any local authority to enforce the Act within its area of jurisdiction.</p>

<p><span class="col_4235-4236" refersTo="page_0580"/>In clause 24 the local authority is being granted the right to prosecute, and it provides to whom such fines shall be payable. A similar provision exists in section 24.</p>

<p>From the nature of the case provision must also be made so that the Secretary may delegate his powers. This is being done in clause 25. These powers of delegation already exist in section 2.</p>

<p>In clause 26 it is provided that any person who is prosecuted, may not plead a defect in the form and, in doing so, be acquitted on a technical point. A similar provision exists in section 26.</p>

<p>Any person who acts in good faith in the exercise or performance of a power or duty, is exempted from liability in terms of clause 27. This is a new provision aimed at exempting officials from judicial liability for anything done in good faith in the course of their services.</p>

<p>In terms of clause 28 the State President may, at the request of another state or territory, by proclamation apply any time any provision of this Act to articles which are imported in transit through the Republic to such state or territory. The same provision exists in section 12.</p>

<p>The Food, Drugs and Disinfectants Act, 1929, is repealed in clause 29, and at the same time any proclamation, regulation, etc., made under the said Act, is authorized.</p>

<p>Clause 30 contains the short title and provides that different provisions of the Act may come into operation on different dates. This is being done because proper directives in regard to cosmetics have not yet been drafted, and the opportunity must be created for doing so. Hon. members will appreciate that this is a new addition and that we want the other regulations which are in existence and are working satisfactorily, to remain in force. This measure may therefore be introduced on another date, when we are ready.</p>

<p>I have now dealt briefly with the contents of this Bill, indicated the respects in which it differs with the present Act, and tried to motivate them. As you will notice in a comparison between the present Act and the Bill, the latter is a great improvement. The provisions of the Bill follow one another logically and those which belong together, have been consolidated. The most important aspect is that now, for the first time, clear and detailed provision is being made for control over cosmetics.</p>

<p>This Bill was also sent beforehand to interested parties for perusal, and the comments received were, as far as possible, incorporated in it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>We on this side of the House will support the Second Reading of this Bill and, in fact, we welcome it. The principal Act was considered to be a model piece of legislation; it dates back to 1929, as the Minister has said, and I feel, after comparing the principal Act with this Bill, that this Bill represents a great improvement. I feel strongly about maintaining the high standards of produce in this country, and I consider that this type of legislation is going to help considerably to maintain those standards. Standards of quality and purity are most essential, especially in the case of foodstuffs and cosmetics, or products which are used to keep food and households clean and in a sanitary state. The public outside should welcome this Bill as well, and I think if the provisions of this Bill are implemented as envisaged, those people who in the past have perhaps been a little too gullible in buying produce of this country will now feel that they are safeguarded. Now only does this Bill look after the produce of our own country, but, what is equally important, we are making sure now that produce which comes into our country from other countries shall have the same standards of purity and excellence as those which we are trying to maintain in this country. This Bill contains some measures which are very strict indeed, and I have no hesitation in saying that I for one, and I am sure all hon. members in this House, support the introduction of these strict measures. The public must realize that these strict measures are being taken for their own good. There may be members of the public, who are interested in producing substances which are now brought within the purview of this Bill, who may grumble about these strict provisions, but I have no sympathy with those people who try to bluff the public, and I think they must be suitably punished if they contravene the provisions of this measure. Sir, the implementation of the provisions of this Bill will require a large number of inspectors. These inspectors will have to be properly trained, and I want to suggest to the Minister that the training of these inspectors should be undertaken by the South African Bureau of Standards. I think every inspector who is enrolled to do this work should go through a curriculum drawn up by the South African Bureau of Standards. To <span class="col_4237-4238" refersTo="page_0581"/>have a group of inspectors who are not well trained could be just as dangerous as having no inspectors at all, and for that reason I say that the quality of the knowledge of these inspectors should be of the highest standard.</p>

<p>There is one clause&#x2014;I think clause 14, if I remember correctly&#x2014;which deals with the detention of articles which are suspect. I do not like this clause very much, because I think the Minister is being a little too liberal in this clause. Here we are dealing with people who are producing foodstuffs in this country, or who are importing foodstuffs which for some reason or other are suspected of being impure or contaminated or polluted. According to this clause&#x2014;I am talking here particularly about foodstuffs &#x2014;those foodstuffs, after having been inspected and, I take it, sealed, will be allowed to remain in the warehouses where they are landed or they can be taken from those warehouses and put into a warehouse of the owner or the consignee of the foodstuffs. I think that is dangerous, and I would like to recommend to the Minister that where foodstuffs which are suspect come into our country, the crates or containers in which they come should be suitably labelled to show that they are suspect. There are many ways of doing this, but I do not think that sealing is enough. If they are dangerous products which can cause death through contamination or deterioration, I think they should be labelled to show that they are contaminated or polluted or unfit for human consumption. In view of the fact that some of these articles may be found after examination to be pure, the labels put on these containers should be removable so that the contents can be sold without suspicion. There are one or two other matters with which we intend dealing in the Committee stage, but these are my suggestions which we think will be necessary to make the Bill even better than it is now.</p>

<p>With these few words I want to say that we on this side of the House welcome this legislation. We think it is for the good of the public; we hope that the public will realize what is intended by the legislation, and we hope that the legislation will safeguard the purity, the excellence and the high standard which we require in products of this nature.</p>

<speech by="#viljoen">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. VAN B. VILJOEN</person>:</from>

<p>According to calculations there has been a four fold increase in the knowledge of the world since the year 1900. It is calculated that over the past 20 years alone there has been a threefold increase in the knowledge of the world. For that reason I think it is extremely important that we should now amend this Act, which has been in use since the twenties. The knowledge explosion, with the concomitant technological development, and the more sophisticated specialization of the manufacturing industry, with special reference to the science of medicine, the science of organic chemistry, are inevitably making new demands on our responsibility in respect of legislation which protects the interests of the public and which also effects orderly administration in regard to such matters. Therefore there is also a need for continually amending and adapting existing legislation, not only to knowledge, but also to modern circumstances. In this respect the Department of Health should to my mind be congratulated on the fact that they have always, by way of adapting legislation, kept pace with this development. We may as well say, &#x201C;They are always on the ball.&#x201D; In introducing this Act, the Minister is once again meeting the major need that exists for justice to be done to these new standards and for protecting the public against exploitation, as well as protecting the health of the people. I am of the opinion that there are probably few products on the market in South Africa in respect of which there are as many irregularities as are in fact to be found in the sphere of specialized foodstuffs&#x2014;which, of course, include baby food and concentrated baby foods&#x2014;as well as in the sphere of cosmetics and also disinfectants. It is because the ordinary layman and the public do not have the knowledge to discriminate in regard to the various kinds of these products that this legislation is so important. It quite often happens that members of the public are exploited in an atrocious manner by unscrupulous dealers who bargain on the ignorance and sometimes on the superstitiousness and gullibility of the buyer in order to deceive him for financial gain. Futhermore, I am of the opinion that literally thousands of foodstuffs, cosmetics and disinfectants are marketed in South Africa, articles which, in the first place, do not comply with the purpose for which they are used or sold; or, in the second place, contain insufficient concentrations of the active ingredients, or too little of those active ingredients; or, in the <span class="col_4239-4240" refersTo="page_0582"/>third place, reflect inadequate directions for use, and of which the volume has also been supplemented artificially by inactive ingredients in order to make up the weight of such an article; and, in the last place, contain impurities which are injurious to health and do not serve any useful purpose either.</p>

<p>In this regard I should like to mention to the House a number of examples as far as my own experience is concerned. Although this does not have any bearing on any of these articles, it does have a bearing on medicine. A number of years ago a European firm advertised tetracycline hydrochloride capsules at approximately a quarter of the price.</p>

<speech by="#viljoen">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. VAN B. VILJOEN</person>:</from>

<p>I think the old Act deals with it, but I am merely mentioning this as an example of the type of thing with which we are dealing now. After many medical practitioners had ordered this drug and used it freely, it was found that these capsules did not contain 250 mg of the ingredient concerned, but only 100 mg. This is an example which also holds good for these other substances dealt with in this Bill. Then I want to mention to you. Sir, drugs which are advertised and in respect of which the distributors claim that they are suitable for anything imaginable, and I think this is also applicable to these particular articles which we are discussing now. Some of these advertisements are really shocking, not only in respect of the use and the composition of a product, but also in respect of the directions for use, which are quite often given in the most atrocious language. I hope that this Act will also meet that particular need. I should like to mention an example to you of the monstrosities that are sometimes found in such advertisements. The first one I should like to mention, is an antiseptic. The advertiser calls it in Afrikaans, a &#x201C;antiseptik en keel en mondwas vir seerkeel en die mond sal was. Gebruik die vir reukende van die vuil asem&#x201D;. I want to mention another Afrikaans example: &#x201C;Hierdie medisyne is vir die mense wat nie kan sien nie. Hierdie medisyne is baie belangrik. Dit help blinde mense om te sien.&#x201D;</p>

<speech by="#viljoen">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. VAN B. VILJOEN</person>:</from>

<p>I think this would be very good medicine for the hon. member for Durban Point. Then, as far as cosmetics are concerned, we find the following in Afrikaans : &#x201C;Die volmaakte reukwater. Dit is een wat die soek reuk het. Die soek reuk hou baie dae lank. Dit is slem gemeng en by u sal bly. Mense sal verlang om naby u te wees.&#x201D; Sir, if this Bill would eliminate advertising monstrosities of this type, it would render a great service. There are also many monstrosities which I have come across in the English language as well. This does not sound like Afrikaans to me, but I must tell you that we also come across this in other languages in South Africa. In this connection I should like to put in a plea by asking the Minister whether consideration could not perhaps be given to making it compulsory for the directions for use of all commodities of this nature to be presented in both official languages. However, if the Afrikaans part were to consist of monstrosities of this nature, it would perhaps be better to keep such directions for use in one language only. For that reason it is essential that there should be certain minimum standards in respect of the use of language. Furthermore, I should just like to mention that as far as advertisements are concerned, we should perhaps, on the other hand, not take the matter too far, for to my mind a measure of flexibility should be permitted in so far as advertisements are concerned. The right of the distributor or manufacturer to place an advertisement in restrained psychologically motivated language, should not be interfered with. This is the method they use, sometimes in colourful language, to advertise their products, and as long as it is within limits, I think we ought not to impose any unnecessary restrictions on it.</p>

<p>Then I think we should like to have more clarity in the course of this debate on the respects in which chemists, for instance, are concerned in this regard. It is customary for chemists, especially in respect of prescriptions, to remove the labels from bottles and then to place their own labels on them; they do so in good faith. The question that arises now, is whether the chemist is liable if he removes the label from a bottle and places on it his own label with his own directions for use, or the directions for use specified in the prescription. This is a common practice, and perhaps we should have clarity in this regard.</p>

<p>Then I should like to refer to another <span class="col_4241-4242" refersTo="page_0583"/>aspect which is applicable to drugs and may also be made applicable to these particular commodities, and that is the question of expiry dates. Although it is the practice in most cases to make use of codes, printed on the bottle or the packing, to enable one to determine from what particular production series such a commodity comes&#x2014;codes from which one may from the nature of the case also deduce the date on which the product was manufactured&#x2014; I think it is perhaps important that we should also think in the direction of also making it compulsory to have a date of expiry displayed on certain products, or at least a code, on the basis of which it may be determined when the product was manufactured. This would serve to protect the public, and when people buy these commodities&#x2014;and this also has a bearing on foodstuffs in particular&#x2014;they would be in a position to know whether they are buying quality and how long the product has been on the market or on the shelves in that particular shop. I think it would be a good service to the public if we could in fact specify the date of manufacture and the date of expiry of these preparations.</p>

<p>I should also like to make a request to the hon. the Minister to the effect that, in drafting regulations in terms of this Bill, he should pay particular attention to the minimum requirements in respect of prescribing methods for the purpose of analyses, in order that there may also be a system of cross-checking in regard to the analysis of commodities so that the human error may be eliminated. Approximately a year or so ago there were serious misgivings about certain methods being followed for determining alcohol content, and also in respect of determining the alcohol content of the blood. It was found &#x2026;</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Point is merely displaying his ignorance, because there are many of these commodities which also contain alcohol. I am talking about the determination of the alcohol content, and he will not put me off my stroke through his interjections, because I do not think the hon. member really knows what is involved here. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The fact remains that according to certain surveys that have been made there can be a reasonably serious factor of error when different people do the same analysis under different circumstances. Therefore I want to ask that we should have proper standardization so that that factor or error may be eliminated. We would not like to see people being prosecuted because of the factor of error of the analysts. I am saying this without having serious misgivings about their intelligence.</p>

<p>As regards the regulations which, are applicable to inspectors, I want to ask the Minister to make these regulations very strict and to apply them very strictly, also as regards instructions to these inspectors in regard to their conduct towards the public, for it is true that we quite often find that inspectors are not quite diplomatic in their dealings with the public and that this may present a major problem when the public is offended. Strict provision should also be made in the regulations as in regard to the specific method for the taking of samples. I myself was a witness in a particular case where an inspector had, for instance, taken a sample without having shaken properly the original contents in the bottle, and the result was that there was a considerable difference in concentration between the contents of the top half of that bottle and that of the bottom half. Naturally, all of these are human errors, but I think that if we drafted our regulations on that basis, we would be able to reduce the number of errors to a considerable extent.</p>

<p>I am also interested in what the Minister envisages in respect of clauses 12 and 21, which deal with the establishment of analysing laboratories, unless use is going to be made of the existing Government laboratories of the S.A.B.S. Furthermore, it is not clear from clause 23 how the local authorities will exercise the power delegated to them, especially in regard to the free analysis of samples. These questions will possibly be clarified through the regulations. Then I have problems in regard to clause 15, which provides that the regulations may not be made applicable to a particular area. I am not quite sure what the object of this is and whether it may mean that the regulations will perhaps not be made applicable in certain distant areas, where inspectors are not available, or that it may perhaps cause a shortage of services.</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I find myself in agreement with certain of the remarks made by the faon, member for Newcastle. I am, however, puzzled by his reference to the question of chemists and druggists who remove labels in order to put other directions on them. Quite frankly, I would have thought that that particular procedure has been confined to Act No. 101 of 1965, namely the Drugs Control Act. I should say that it would apply in very few cases to the subject matter of this Bill, namely foodstuffs, cosmetics and disinfectants.</p>

<p>I want to express my appreciation to the hon. the Minister for the detailed manner in which he introduced the Bill and dealt with the various clauses. I believe that it makes it much easier for the House to consider a Bill of this nature if the background is given so thoroughly.</p>

<p>But there is one question I would like to ask him. Only this week we heard the disturbing news about the standard of our export meat. I believe Great Britain has indicated that they do not find the standards which control the handling and preparation of our meat to be adequate in so far as allowing the importation of these meat products to the United Kingdom is concerned. I want to ask the Minister if he can give us any indication whether this Bill, the provisions in this Bill, since meat is a foodstuff, will be of any assistance in ensuring that the standards are adequate and that this difficulty we have encountered will be removed&#x003F;</p>

<p>I would like to say that this Bill has a short long title, but it deals very adequately with the matters concerned. I want to quote the long title&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To control the sale, manufacture and importation of foodstuffs, cosmetics and disinfectants; and to provide for incidental matters.</block>

<p>It is very comprehensive and it has a very broad scope. Seeing that the original Bill has remained intact without amendments since 1929, I think we can appreciate that it is obvious that in this particular instance many of the provisions of this Bill, when it is enacted, will have to be carried out by regulation so that it will not be necessary to come to this House frequently in order to amend it.</p>

<p>The sentiments which I now express are not my own and I do not necessarily endorse them. However, I feel that it is only fair to quote them to the hon. the Minister bcause they come from an informed opinion in the cosmetic manufacturing sphere. While we on this side of the House accept the Bill the pharmaceutical and cosmetic manufacturing industries seem to accept it with reservation. They seem to be critical in regard to certain aspects. I felt that it was only fair that this should be placed on record. First of all there is the comment :</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill include cosmetics, which fay their very nature are unable to be controlled as it is extremely difficult to measure the benefit which any particular person derives from the use of cosmetics.</block>

<p>How very true! It then goes on and says:</p>

<block name="quote">It is beyond comprehension how the State envisages it would obtain a prosecution against a manufacturer who claims that his cosmetics beautify on the grounds that such a cosmetic does not, in fact, beautify. It would seem that the quality of beauty is subjective to the beholder and that it is incapable of definition.</block>

<p>Well, that may be very profound, but I believe the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s intentions in this regard are laudable and that we must do the best we can so as to ensure that there is no abuse in regard to the manufacture, marketing or promotion of cosmetics. This comment records the fact that &#x201C;a person is innocent until proven guilty by the State but this Bill creates a situation where a person is presumed guilty until he has proved his innocence&#x201D;. They feel that this onus of proof is not acceptable.</p>

<p><span class="col_4245-4246" refersTo="page_0585"/>The fourth comment is that:</p>

<block name="quote">In view of the restricted nature of the Bill, it imposes still further controls on industry as a whole and unnecessary restrictions in a free enterprise system. It might make it unattractive for overseas companies to invest in South Africa.</block>

<p>If I may add my own comment to this, I believe that in other countries there are just as stringent requirements and believe that they are necessary in this country as well, and that it will effect no particular hardships to the manufacturing industry as far as cosmetics are concerned. It also refers to the very strong powers which are given to the inspectors. This is a matter I believe could be dealt with adequately in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>I think that what is most important, though, in regard to this Bill, is the fact that it protects the consumer. It protects him against undesirable practices in manufacturing and it also has the power to deal with undesirable practices in so far as promotion is concerned. I believe that consumers basically welcome these safeguards. The comprehensive nature of the definitions and the stricture on false and misleading advertisements is something which offers protection to the consumer because, to say the least of it, many of the advertisements we do see, are dubious and can be misleading. May I make it quite clear that I am not referring to firms of repute in South Africa, who themselves obey a strict disciplinary control over their products and are prepared to submit themselves to various marketing codes which have been compiled and introduced on a voluntary basis. I still believe, though, that there is some room for the State to supervise these particular codes. I do believe, too, that we must have strong measures to deal with the get-rich fly-by-nights, who come and go on the marketing scene and usually conduct operations through a post office box. We know that there are provisions in the existing Act whereby they cannot do this, but the number of firms who advertise from a post office box in contravention of the existing law, surprises me. The post office box is then the only means, really, whereby they can be contacted. I believe that, in so far as cosmetics themselves are concerned, there is ample scope for exploitation particularly with regard to manufacturers&#x2019; claims and their methods of advertising. I believe, too, although I do not see how this Bill can have any effect on it, that the question of the price of some cosmetics is something which should not pass unnoticed by the State. One hears of face creams priced from R15 to R100 per jar, although we know&#x2014;and I think the hon. the Minister will agree with me&#x2014;that the cost of the ingredients bears no relation whatsoever to the consumer price. We also know that the manufacturer&#x2019;s profit margin is boosted by various costs of distribution, marketing and promotion and by fancy containers. Because of this I think it is time that the position is at any rate watched. Here again I wish to emphasize that I believe that these are exceptions rather than the rule and that many firms do have an honest and decent standard by which they market their products.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Then they put a sales tax on it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to that. The hon. member for Durban Point and I are on the same wave-length, because I was going to refer to the steep increase in prices of cosmetics and toiletries, coupled with this imposition of the sales tax at the point of manufacture. This is a problem and makes a lady&#x2019;s pursuance of beauty a very costly undertaking indeed. The definition of &#x201C;cosmetic&#x201D; as it stands in the Bill is broad and I believe there is one aspect with which we can deal in the Committee Stage, because I believe there is a loophole in this definition.</p>

<p>I want to come to the definition of &#x201C;disinfectant&#x201D; because I have a problem here. The definition as stated in the Bill is that a disinfectant means &#x201C;any article or substance used or applied or intended to be used or applied as a germicide, preservative, or anticeptic, or as a deodorant or cleansing material which is not a cosmetic&#x201D;; my problem is whether it is intended that substances such as benzine, carbontetrachloride, turpentine, commercial ether, acetone, etc., should be classified as disinfectants, because they are cleansing agents or can be used as cleansing agents. If this is the intention will the hon. the Minister give the reason for this particular definition of a disinfectant.</p>

<p>I believe that as far as the definition of &#x201C;foodstuffs&#x201D; is concerned, it is adequate. I believe that it could mean to include the cyclamates. I want to ask the hon. the Minister if at this stage there is any intention <span class="col_4247-4248" refersTo="page_0586"/>by his department to control or limit the use of cyclamates. This is something which certain people in the industry have expressed concern about.</p>

<p>I would like to deal briefly also with the question of advertising. This has been referred to by the hon. member for Newcastle. This comprehensive definition appears in clause 5 and I believe is the same definition that appears in the Drugs Control Act of 1965. But I find a problem here because, whereas the Drugs Control Act lays down specifically that in so far as the regulations are concerned, the Minister may make regulations, the question of advertising being specifically dealt with in one of the subsections dealing with regulations in this particular Bill although the definition of advertising is the same, and although I believe the need for the control of advertising is just as necessary, there is no specific mention in the regulations clause, that the Minister may make regulations laying down the manner in which products may be advertised. I would like to point out that although the original provision in Act 101 of 1965, the Drugs Control Act, has been amended on two occasions since then, there is still the provision which stands in the amended Act. I believe that if it is necessary to include that provision in the Drugs Control Act it should then also be necessary in this Bill to have some specific provision in regard to the manner in which advertisements can be phrased, and can be dealt with under the Act. I welcome the carry-over from the previous Act of the provision in regard to regulations. The Minister has indicated that the same system will be put into operation, that regulations will be published for information and that three months will be allowed to elapse to enable interested parties to give their comments. I believe this is the way in which workable and satisfactory regulations can be framed to the satisfaction of most people who are concerned.</p>

<p>I now come to the question of inspection. Quite a large portion of one of the clauses deals with the powers of the inspectors. It is my intention to raise this matter further in the Committee Stage and I trust that the Minister will show me the same consideration and sympathy which he did in a previous Bill which we debated last week. I will not deal with this matter any further now.</p>

<p>There are some other queries I would like to have clarified at this stage, and that is in regard to clause 2. Paragraph (c) (ii) of clause 2 (1) provides that any person shall be guilty of an offence if he sells, or manufactures or imports for sale, any foodstuff &#x201C;to which any substance had been added so as to increase the mass or volume of such foodstuff with the object to deceive;&#x201D;. I would like to ask the Minister if this is intended to deal with some of the poultry dealers who have been known to add <i>aqua pura</i> to poultry prior to sale.</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>I heard you say &#x201C;water to milk&#x201D;, but I am asking if it is also &#x201C;water to poultry&#x201D;. Clause 13 deals with analysis and I want to ask the hon. the Minister if he would give consideration to the question of whether it is necessary in subsection (3) to lay down in this Bill that &#x201C;A request by the accused for such a further analysis or examinations shall be granted only on condition that he deposits the sum of R25&#x201D;. My submission is that if this measure stays on the Statute Book for 40 years without any amendment, and it could well do so, the sum of R25 could become completely unrealistic with the value of money changing as it does. I believe that in the light of this it would be much more satisfactory if such a matter were dealt with by regulation. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister if he does not feel that this is something which he would care to amend in the Committee Stage in order to make that provision.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of penalties. The Minister referred to penalties and indicated that they have been increased in so far as the first section of penalties is concerned. On first convictions there is a fourfold increase and in the case of a second conviction there is also a fourfold increase, but that on the third or subsequent conviction there is a tenfold increase together with a period of imprisonment not exceeding 24 months It seems to me that this increase is exceedingly harsh and I wonder whether the hon. the Minister feels that it is really necessary to embody such a harsh <span class="col_4249-4250" refersTo="page_0587"/>clause in a Bill of this nature. Notwithstanding the doubts of manufacturers, with which I do not fully concur, we support the Bill and we hope that the amendments which we will introduce in the Committee Stage will receive sympathetic consideration in order that we may produce an even better Bill than the one we have before us now.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#vosloo">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we are very grateful to the hon. the Minister for having introduced this Bill. We are also very grateful to the hon. members for Newcastle and Berea who so clearly stated the existing problems and how extensive present-day development is. I should again just like to make a brief summary of the Bill. This measure is of great importance, as far as I am concerned, because it concerns human beings and the human body. I do not want to wax theological now, but in the first place this Bill tells me: &#x201C;You must not injure the body of your fellow-man. You may not do so by giving him prohibited materials.&#x201D;</p>

<p>In other words, you may not poison him. You may not give him anything that is contaminated either. Neither may you give him a mixture that can be contaminated. In addition you cannot give it to him in a container that can contaminate that article. The second thing this Bill tells me, and this is very important, is: &#x201C;You may not bear false witness, not with respect to a label or the contents of a bottle. What you state on a label must be contained in the bottle and this must not harm your fellow-man.&#x201D; If you do these things we are going to keep on eye on you. We are going to see what you are doing; we are going to appoint inspectors; we are going to give them certain powers; we are going to give them a letter of authorization and ask them to see that you do not harm your fellow-man. They will be given the right to take samples which will be regarded as having been purchased from you, so that you cannot have an excuse. These will be analysed; that evidence will be used in court against you. These are amendments the hon. the Minister explained very clearly in his Second Reading speech.</p>

<p>And to protect you we shall also order those inspectors to preserve a certain measure of secrecy, so that the results of the analysis of those samples will not be generally known thus giving you a chance to wriggle out of it in court. We shall punish you; the first time we shall punish you with a fine of R400, the second time with a fine of R800 and the third time with a fine of R2 000. I wholeheartedly agree with the hon. member for Berea&#x2014; third time does the trick. He asked whether the penalty was not perhaps a little severe. We go further and state that if we catch you and you are punished we shall confiscate those goods and declare them to have been forfeited. I have now said what I wanted to say about the matter.</p>

<p>I should also like to join the hon. member for Rosettenville in lodging a plea with the Minister. In thinking of the tremendous explosion in the field of cosmetics and with respect to disinfectants and the other aspects dealt with by the Act, we must make sure that we have inspectors who are, in fact, well trained. This Bill makes provision for the local authorities to implement the legislation on behalf of the Minister. But do we have local health inspectors who have the necessary time&#x003F; We know there is a great shortage of local health inspectors. Are they going to have the time to read these regulations and to get the hang of the Bill so that they will consequently know when and how they should act&#x003F; The Bureau of Standards can help, but this is still a matter that must be handled by the Minister of Health. The training must also be done by the Department of Health at whatever level.</p>

<p>There is only one matter I want the hon. the Minister to assure me about. The matter is mentioned on page 3 and involves the definition of a cosmetic. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any article or substance intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled or sprayed on or otherwise applied to the human body for purposes of cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness or improving or altering the appearance, and includes any part or ingredient of any such article or substance.</block>

<p>I should just like to ascertain whether the word &#x201C;article&#x201D; can also be an instrument, because it could also be a cleansing or rejuvenating cure.</p>

<p>I want to conclude with that. I am convinced that here we have a very good Bill and I should like to congratulate the hon. the Minister on our being able to place this Bill before this House in so comprehensive a form.</p>

<from><span class="col_4251-4252" refersTo="page_0588"/>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Brentwood referred quite rightly to the explosion in the world of cosmetics. This is the first time a measure of control is going to be exercised over cosmetics in South Africa, and I think it is high time. In the second place, the ladies will now have the assurance that the cosmetics they buy are quality goods, or at least contain what they think they contain. With reference to the cosmetics used nowadays, perhaps you will allow me, Sir, to relate the story of the little girl whose mother asked her when she arrived home: &#x201C;I see your hair has been plaited; who plaited your hair&#x003F;&#x201D; The little girl replied that she could not remember at all which teacher had done it. The mother then said to her: &#x201C;But, my child, surely you must remember; which teacher plaited your hair&#x003F;&#x201D; To this the little girl replied: &#x201C;Mommy, that one with the dirty eyes,&#x201D; referring to the eye-shadow ladies put on nowadays. The fact of the matter is that the cosmetics being used can constitute a danger to health. The hon. member also referred to the price of cosmetics. In this regard I can tell the hon. member that I do not have as much sympathy with the ladies as he has. One has sympathy with people when it comes to the prices of medicine and essentials, but cosmetics &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>They are highly necessary.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>A member of the Pharmaceutical Commission told me that a few weeks ago a lady sat in front of his pharmacy to have a petition signed about the high cost of medicines. When another lady took over from her, she walked into his pharmacy and bought a very small bottle of cosmetics for R15, and this while she was asking people to sign a petition about the high cost of medicine! The pharmacist also told me that if a cosmetic is cheap, they simply cannot sell it. But, in any case, I think that this problem will also be combated to a certain extent if we at least have this control so that we can ensure that the cosmetic complies with the standard it professes to comply with and, secondly, that it constitutes no danger to health.</p>

<p>Under clause 18, the hon. member for Brentwood also asked me whether it would include an instrument as well. This is how I interpret it, but I shall ascertain with the law advisers whether it is in fact included, after which we may discuss the matter again in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Berea raised the question of poultry being injected with water or some other substance to increase the weight of the poultry being sold. This can be controlled under clause 2 (c) (ii). He also raised the question of penalties which are now being increased ten-fold for a third or subsequent transgression of the Act. Sir, that is being done on purpose because one must not forget that these people make a tremendous amount of money. I think it is necessary to take this step for the protection of the public. Hon. members must realize that we are not embarking here on something completely new; we have had this for the last 42 years, and experience has shown that those people who are found guilty for the third time of having contravened the provisions of the Act do this for substantial financial gain.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member referred to the question of disinfectants and inquired whether a certain disinfectant, which he mentioned, would also be included. The answer is no, because those which he mentioned are patently not for use on the human body but for cleaning clothes and so forth. If we covered a wider field than the definition covers at the moment, we would have had to include substances such as petrol and paraffin, and this would have made the administration of the Act virtually impossible. For practical purposes, therefore, we have to confine the definition to the substances mentioned here. We cannot include the substances mentioned by the hon. member, such as spiritus, carbon tetrachloride and a few others.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Newcastle quoted very good examples here which relate to the Bill. He asked specifically that in the regulation in which stipulations in respect of labelling are laid down, it should be ensured that justice is done to the two official languages. I will definitely give this undertaking; it will be done. It is problematical whether one can lay down a minimum standard for the one or the other language by way of regulations, but I think it should be obvious to the manufacturer that it would be to his disadvantage if he did not use proper English and Afrikaans on the label he places on his product. It would be difficult to prescribe minimum <span class="col_4253-4254" refersTo="page_0589"/>language standards, but nevertheless there may be a method by which it can be done.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>What about imported goods&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It definitely applies to imported goods as well. Surely the importer knows that he is marketing his products in a bilingual country. If, for example, an exporter in Italy exports products to Spain, surely he knows that the people in Spain speak Spanish. Therefore, in respect of labelling, I do not think one can make any differentiation at all between the imported product and the locally manufactured product. It would be totally wrong. The same regulations should be applicable to both.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member referred to advertisements. Control over advertisements as far as medicines are concerned, falls under the Act in terms of which the Drug Control Board was established. Furthermore, he mentioned the question of analyses and the necessity of cross-control. Of course, we make use of the South African Bureau of Standards, but we also have our own laboratory, which many other departments make use of today. We also have a director in the department, the director of laboratory services, who is at the same time a professor at the University of Cape Town. I may just mention in passing that very recently he gave very good advice to the Lesotho Government as well in regard to their laboratory services. Furthermore, they have instructed him to visit them every six months in order to see that their services are developing properly. Of course, they would prefer us to render services to them from Bloemfontein, instead of their having to erect a small laboratory themselves, which is perhaps going to be very expensive for them.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Then the hon. member for Rosettenville had one problem. He said that we were being too liberal in clause 14. In terms of clause 14, the Secretary for Health could in certain circumstances allow the goods to be removed.</p>

<p>*I just want to say to the hon. member that it was put like this premeditatedly. When the Secretary allows it, he may, in the first place, allow it to be done under guarantee. In the second place, he may lay down certain conditions, not only as laid down in the clause, but also by way of regulation. He may also issue regulations in regard to the duties of inspectors. We may include the question of labelling, etc., in those regulations. I want to say to the hon. member that it was put like this for three specific reasons. As far as customs and excise are concerned, they may need the space, and such an analysis may take a long time. The second point is that the importer must pay storage charges, which may cause him to be prejudiced. A third very important point is that the nature of the substance or the remedy may be of such a nature that it must be kept in cold storage, and naturally the importer has cold storage rooms available for whatever he may import. I want to give the hon. member the assurance that past practice and experience have shown that this creates no problems at all and that, by promulgating proper regulations, one can eliminate any possible dangers of misuse.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Lastly, the hon. member spoke about this Bill in general.</p>

<p>Well, there are inspectors at the moment; it is not as if we are starting anew.

This Bill is there to protect the public. It has been modernized and improved and it has been rearranged. Cosmetics has been added and medicines have been taken out. That is the gist of the whole Bill.

<p>Yes. I forgot about that. I suppose it is in connection with the report in the papers about the abattoirs. Whether that report is true or not, I do not know, but the control of matters appertaining <span class="col_4255-4256" refersTo="page_0590"/>to abattoirs does not fall under the Department of Health. It is the responsibility of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, and any question that you would like to ask in connection with this particular matter, must be directed to the Minister of Agriculture. We have no powers in that respect whatsoever, neither in this Bill nor under any other measure, and quite frankly I would not like to have those powers either.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The most important provisions in this Bill should not be unfamiliar to hon. members, since I have already referred to them in a public speech I made in Johannesburg. I mean the prevention of physical decay in our cities and towns, and the role which private enterprise can play in the clearance of existing slum areas and the replanning and redevelopment of such areas. I am convinced that the new steps which are being envisaged in this respect will have beneficial results for the improvement of our urban areas.</p>

<p>I think it advisable, however, for me to explain each clause of the Bill in greater detail.</p>

<p>Clause 1 (a) (Prevention of physical decay): For some considerable time now there has been concern about the physical decay which is gradually taking place in our cities and towns. Residential buildings, as well as a vicinity, may in due course cease to comply with specific standards of habitability. The result is that the health or safety of the inhabitants is placed in jeopardy, or that the attractiveness or acceptability of the area is affected or reduced to such an extent that restoration is essential.</p>

<p>A comprehensive investigation of this matter was carried out by a committee which was constituted on a very representative basis. As you will recall, I made a comprehensive statement on the matter in this House after the investigation had been completed. I indicated at the time that completely new legislation to improve the situation was not necessary, but that only a minor amendment of the Community Development Act would provide the necessary machinery to establish preventative measures against physical decay.</p>

<p>Clause 1 (a) of the Bill, which seeks to amend section 15 (1) (a), meets this need. In terms of the said section 15 (1) (a) the Minister may designate an area, and then it becomes an object of the Community Development Board, subject to the directions of the Minister, to develop or assist in the development of the area and to promote community development in such area. The amplification of this section, as contained in the clause, envisages, in an area designated by the Minister, to make it the object of the Board as well to take steps to prevent decay in any such area or to rehabilitate or assist with the rehabilitation of any such area or any portion thereof which tends to decay so that unsatisfactory conditions may be prevented. When the aforesaid then becomes an object of the board, the board is competent in terms of section 15 (2) (f) (iv) to grant loans for the prevention of such decay.</p>

<p>As I have already indicated, responsibility for the prevention of urban decay has to be accepted by local authorities in the first place. Whereas local authorities were not perhaps in a position to guard against this in the past, the necessary machinery is now being established to enable the local authority, especially as far as finances are concerned, to take effective steps. I could just add that local authorities have already been fully informed about this matter and that a very favourable reaction was received from several of them.</p>

<p>Clauses 1 (b) and 5 : This clause deals with the second important matter I mentioned, viz. to enable private developers to make a contribution in regard to slum clearance and urban renewal. The Community Development Board may take steps to promote a slum clearance or an urban renewal scheme. Then, too, it is common knowledge that the Department has, during the past few years, taken positive steps in this regard through the agency of the said Board&#x2014;to which extensive schemes in Cape Town, Johannesburg, Durban, Port Elizabeth, etc., testify.</p>

<p><span class="col_4257-4258" refersTo="page_0591"/>Experience has already shown, however, that when such a scheme is attempted, all the properties in question should be acquired by one body. Such a step is essential in order to implement the new planning proposals which include the consolidation of existing sites, the closing of streets, etc.</p>

<p>It happens that private initiative becomes interested in the clearance and improvement of a slum and decayed area, and then draws up a development plan for such an area, and also buys up the land in such an area. Such steps make a very important contribution, of course, to the renewal of our decayed urban areas, and are welcome assistance to the Department and also to the local authoritize. Sometimes it appears that the private developer simply cannot succeed in acquiring all the properties within the renewal area. Then, too, one has the phenomenon that a developer, in the final stages of his attempt to redevelop a slum and decayed area is obstructed or prevented from achieving his object, after he has already purchased the vast majority of the properties, by owners who either refuse to sell or try to extort unrealistic prices. It is therefore the opinion that private developers who are prepared to utilize private funds in the interest of slum clearance and urban renewal, which is also to the advantage of the public, should be encouraged, and that they should be assisted in eliminating unreasonable obstacles.</p>

<p>Clauses 1 (b) and 5 were drawn up with this object.</p>

<p>What the provisions contained in these clauses amount to, in brief, is that the Community Development Board, with the approval of the Minister, may designate such an area as an area which is to be developed by such a developer. However, the Minister must first be satisfied that the developer is acting in the interests of slum clearance and the attendant urban renewal and that the said plan is acceptable to the administrator and the Board, that the developer has the ability to carry out the development and that he has already purchased 85 per cent of the properties, other than land owned by any religious organization, or by the State, the provinces, the Community Development Board, the National Housing Commission or a local authority, and that the owners of the remaining properties are not prepared to sell the land at reasonable prices. Upon such designation the ownership of the property in the area, subject to the obligation of the developer to pay compensation, is vested in the developer, with the exception of course of the properties which belong to religious organizations, the State, etc. The developer may then, after three months, take possession of the properties of which the ownership vests in him. Should it happen that the developer and the owner of the land in question cannot, within sixty days, agree on the compensation to be paid for the land, that compensation shall be determined by an arbitration court, appointed by the Minister and consisting of a former Judge or magistrate or an advocate and two other members of whom the developer and the owner shall each nominate one. The compensation determined shall not exceed the market value, and to that may be added an amount in respect of any actual financial loss or any inconvenience suffered by the owner in consequence of the designation. These provisions will prevent this type of development, which as has already been indicated is also to the advantage of the public, from being restricted in an unjustifiable way, but they will also ensure that owners are compensated for their properties on a reasonable and equitable basis.</p>

<p>Clause 1 (c): At present section 15 (5) (b) provides that the arbitration costs shall be determined in terms of section 23 of the Slums Act, 1934, and, according to a legal opinion, the procedure in regard to arbitration proceedings as laid down in the Arbitration Act, 1965, has to be followed. This is confusing and is not conducive to efficiency. Efficient directions in regard to arbitration costs in the case of expropriation are contained in section 45 of the Community Development Act, and consequently an amendment in this respect is being introduced. The regulations made in terms of the latter Act will also be applied, as soon as is practicable, in respect of the arbitration procedure in terms of section 15 (5) (a).</p>

<p>Clause 1 (d): In terms of section 15 (5) the Community Development Board has a preferent right to purchase such property in a &#x201C;frozen&#x201D; area at a price agreed upon between the Board and the owner. If the parties cannot agree the price is determined by an arbitrator. In the practical application uncertainty exists in regard to the determination of the price &#x2026; particularly when cases are referred to arbitration. There is for example, a difference of opinion as to the date on which the price <span class="col_4259-4260" refersTo="page_0592"/>has to be determined, and what value has to be taken into account in determining the price. In order to clear up this matter, an addition to subsection (5) is being made.</p>

<p>Clause 2: The definition of &#x201C;township&#x201D; as contained in section 16 (4) does not comply with the requirements of the Board when it has to take steps in urban renewal areas. However, the Deeds Registries Act, 1937, contains a subsequent definition of &#x201C;township&#x201D; which is far more comprehensive and will therefore cover any problematical cases the Board may come across, and consequently the definition contained in the Deeds Registries Act, 1937, is now being substituted for the existing definition of &#x201C;township&#x201D; contained in the Community Development Act, 1966.</p>

<p>Clause 3: When a property is expropriated by the Board the Act provides that the Board may pay as compensation the market value of the property as at the date of expropriation. The owner is therefore being compensated on a reasonable and equitable basis for his property. But the owner may also, in consequence of the expropriation, have expenses or suffer inconvenience for which he certainly was not responsible. Owners of property which has been expropriated in the past have already presented strong representations for compensation in respect of such costs and inconvenience, but up to the present the Board has not been in a position to make any payment in this respect.</p>

<p>The Expropriation Act, 1965 (Act No. 55/1965), in terms of which expropriation on behalf of the State takes place, provides that the market value shall be paid for the property and that an amount to make good any actual financial loss or any inconvenience caused by the expropriation, shall be added to that.</p>

<p>The formula prescribed in the Expropriation Act is undoubtedly more equitable than that contained in the Community Development Act, and consequently the latter Act is now being brought into line with the former.</p>

<p>Apart from expropriations, the Board, of course, also purchases properties by means of an agreement, for example&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) in the case of affected property where the disqualified owner has to resettle [section 15 (2) (a) or (b)]; and</li>

<li>(b) in the case of an area which has been frozen in terms of section 15 (2) (e) in futherance of slum clearance or urban renewal.</li></ol>

<p>It is consequently felt that in such cases, which actually constitute an obligation on the owner to sell, he should also be compensated for any actual financial loss or inconvenience, as in the case of expropriation. It is no more than fair that an amount which is paid for any actual financial loss or inconvenience, shall not be calculated as part of the consideration for the purpose of determining an appreciation or a depreciation contribution.</p>

<p>Clause 4: In regard to the transfer of expropriated property, the Expropriation Act provides that if a property is expropriated on behalf of a body corporate, the body corporate becomes the owner thereof and that the notice of expropriation shall serve as authority for the Registrar of Deeds in question to register transfer of that property in the name of that body corporate. Section 43 of the Community Development Act is now being brought into line with this provision in the Expropriation Act.</p>

<p>Furthermore, section 43 (3) provides that transfer of an expropriated property may not be registered unless a certificate has been furnished to the Registrar of Deeds to the effect that&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) the notice of expropriation has been properly served on the owner and the mortgagee; and</li>

<li>(b) all amounts payable by the Board on the transaction have been paid or guaranteed.</li></ol>

<p>The Board is required by the Act to serve the notice of expropriation on the property and mortgage holder in a proper manner. The Board is also compelled by the provisions of the Act to pay compensation for expropriated property and the Board is attempting throughout to determine and to pay out such compensation as quickly as possible. The obligation to furnish the certificate in question, particularly paragraph (b), has the effect of delaying urgent urban renewal projects. Owners refuse to agree on the amount of compensation, and even arbitration proceedings are delayed. Before the compensation has been determined, however, the required certificate cannot be <span class="col_4261-4262" refersTo="page_0593"/>furnished and transfer cannot be obtained. This delay not only results in heavy costs, but prevents the making available of urgently needed plots. Since the Board, as has already been mentioned, is required to pay compensation, there is no reason why the payment of such compensation should stand in the way of registration in the name of the Board, and thus obstruct projects involving thousands of rand. Consequently the clause provides that subsection (3) of section 43 be deleted.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this measure before us today, although in the form of an amending Bill of the Community Development Act, introduces into our law and our practice a new and vital principle as far as property ownership is concerned. The principle and intent of this Bill is to permit expropriation of defined urban property to enable an urban redevelopment scheme which is incidental to slum clearance, to be undertaken by the private sector. This is something entirely new in that these undertakings have been in the hands of local authorities in the past. This intended activity, which in the end is for the financial gain of a private developer, must be approached, I believe, by this House with great caution, especially as expropriation becomes a necessary incidental to such private sector interests in urban redevelopment. If one accepts that the need may arise for such expropriation, then I think it important that all relevant matters be provided for in the Bill, and particularly that expropriation will only be resorted to in special and clearly defined circumstances. We have had many comments, objections and proposals in regard to what I may call the test of the need and desirability of the intended expropriation. We on this side have doubts, which are shared in other sectors, whether these powers, should in fact be vested in the Community Development Board and not in some other authority. We also have queries relative to the method and determination of compensation. I mentioned this at the outset lest there be any misunderstanding. When we support the proposal or basic principle in the measure, namely that we believe circumstances may well exist where the right of expropriation should be resorted to, we nevertheless feel that this Bill needs careful consideration as to the surrounding <i>modus operandi</i> of the basic principle. I believe that the hon. the Minister will understand that we have no objection to what I might call the principle of this Bill as embodied in that part of the long title which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To empower the said Board to designate an area as an area which is to be developed by a private person in furtherance of a slum clearance scheme or the clearance of decayed conditions and any urban renewal connected therewith.</block>

<p>We accept that; there is no question about that.</p>

<p>I believe that reference of this Bill to a Select Committee before the Second Reading would enable that Committee to investigate the relevant aspects of the principle, both prior to and subsequent to the designation of the area for renewal. I wonder whether there is any matter relating to property which raises so quickly so many and so emotional reactions as does the suggestion that a man&#x2019;s property might be expropriated. Recently, following speeches by the hon. the Minister, we had reactions from the South African Property Owners&#x2019; Association which is investigating the proposals, and from property owners. I think the queries to hon. members opposite have been as numerous as those which we received. &#x201C;What happens if my property in a slum is in good condition; will it be expropriated&#x003F;&#x201D; or &#x201C;Must my property be in a decayed condition or a slum property&#x003F;&#x201D; According to <i>Die Transvaler</i> of the 7th March the hon. the Deputy Minister of Agriculture has stated his views in regard to expropriation in somewhat of an extreme way. No doubt the sound of Agliotti was ringing in his ears, because according to him no expropriation should take place and no compensation should be settled in any circumstances unless by a court of law. I believe the hon. the Deputy Minister is going too far in suggesting those means of dealing with expropriation. I believe that while that is not necessary, it should not be necessary if there is efficient departmental control in so far as these matters are concerned.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister gave warning of this legislation in a speech which he delivered in Johannesburg on 6th December, 1971. At that time he made certain other statements as well, but I only want to refer to one or two aspects of that speech. The first one is his statement which I quote as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_4263-4264" refersTo="page_0594"/>Soos ek tydens vanjaar in die Parlementsitting aangekondig het, sal wetgewing aanstaande jaar ingedien word om fisiese verval in dorpe en stede te voorkom en sal die nodige masjinerie daargestel word om nie slegs teen eienaars van geboue wat tot verval neig op te tree nie, maar ook in verdienstelike gevalle finansi&#x00EB;le hulp in die vorm van lenings te verleen en ook om ander hulpmiddels daar te stel om toestande te verbeter.</block>

<p>This is a sentiment with which we are in full agreement. I shall come back to this aspect a little later when I shall deal with the question whether this is covered in the measure which is before us. In the second place the hon. the Minister spoke about the role of private initiative in slum clearance and said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die regering besef watter belangrike bydrae private ontwikkelaars tot hierdie veld kan maak en daar is gevolglik besluit om aanstaande jaar wetgewing in te dien om private ontwikkelaars wat op enkele uitsonderings na alle eiendomme in &#x2019;n gebied wat deur die plaaslike bestuur, die provinsiale administrasie, die Gemeenskapsontwikkelingsraad en die Minister van Gemeenskapsbou as &#x2019;n stadsvernuwingsgebied aanvaar word, in Staat te stel om die oorblywende eiendomme te verkry.</block>

<p>Now that is not in this Bill before us. In this Bill before us the only reference where there must be satisfaction on the part of the provincial administration is that the plan for renewal meets with approval and not that the basic decision of the expropriation has the approval of the local authority, the provincial administration, the board and the Minister. There are interesting points which emerge from this speech of the hon. the Minister, e.g. that financially owners of individual properties will be assisted in doing repairs and renovations. In the new subsection (1) (a) of section 15 of the Act, inserted by clause 1 (a) of the Bill, provision is made for power to be given to the board to take steps to prevent decay in any such area or to rehabilitate or assist with the rehabilitation of any such area. I do not know whether that does cover&#x2014;the hon. the Minister did not say so in his Second Reading speech&#x2014;assistance to an individual owner of an individual property and that such a person can now obtain financial assistance to renew his individual property. I believe that that is desirable if it is possible, but I do not know whether that is so. The second point which was raised, was the introduction of private initiative in slum clearance and the need to deal with an unreasonable owner. The Minister went further and said the following in his speech:</p>

<block name="quote">Die beoogde wetgewing sal egter bepalings bevat wat streng toegepas sal word en eienaars van eiendomme binne sodanige stadsvemuwings-gebiede kan gerus voel dat indien hulle eiendomme verkry moet word, die stadsvemuwingskema eerstens in die openbare belang moet wees, en tweedens dat hulle op &#x2019;n billike grondslag vir hulle eiendomme vergoed sal word.</block>

<p>I believe that is correct, but I question again whether this Bill, and I will deal with it presently, does in fact provide just that which the Minister stated could be provided. Mr. Conradie, the M.E.C. for the Cape Province, addressed the South African Property Owners&#x2019; Association in Cape Town on 24th November, 1971, and expressed views which I believe deserve careful consideration before we actually pass the details of this Bill, namely how this procedure is to be carried out. According to a verbatim report of his speech he said:</p>

<block name="quote">Municipalities can expropriate land for municipal purposes and the courts upheld that this can include the putting into effect of a town planning scheme. A council can therefore itself expropriate, say, all the properties in a city block, in order to consolidate the block, and resell it to private enterprise for development. Perhaps the time has arrived to empower a local authority to expropriate on behalf of a developer who already owns the major portion of a block. This would, however, be a very drastic step and strong safeguards would therefore be necessary, safeguards against misuse and for the protection of the rights of affected property owners. It is understood that the Department of Community Development has been thinking of legislation on those lines, but the type of redevelopment just mentioned is hardly a field for them to enter since the power belongs more properly with the town planning authorities, i.e. the local authorities and the province.</block>

<p><span class="col_4265-4266" refersTo="page_0595"/>This was a view expressed&#x2014;and I had the privilege of listening to him&#x2014;which indicates to me that this is an aspect which needs more consideration than merely to pass a Bill in the form that it is here. We therefore have at this level a conflict between province and State as to where the terms and the powers of this Bill should vest.</p>

<p>I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;the Order for the Second Reading of the Community Development Amendment Bill [A.B. 39&#x2014;&#x2019;72] be discharged and the subject of the Bill be referred to a Select Committee for inquiry and report, the Committee to have power to take evidence and call for papers and to have leave to bring up an amended Bill.&#x201D;.</block>

<p>My reasons for moving this amendment will become clear if I deal with some aspects of the Bill itself. We have, for instance, on page 5, line 58, a new paragraph (d) in regard to compensation. I believe the wording there is most unfortunate. It reads:</p>

<block name="quote">The price referred to in this subsection shall not exceed the market value of the property &#x2026;</block>

<p>Immediately when an owner reads this, he becomes apprehensive. Why is it not stated quite clearly that he should get the market value of his property. The need for this becomes clear when one realizes the extraordinary number of laws which are applicable at various levels, municipal, provincial and State, regarding expropriation. The laws in this country dealing with the expropriation are almost legion, each one having some slight variation on the other, each one having some different emphasis in regard to the determination of compensation. I do believe, and I hope, the Minister&#x2019;s department is busy with what is has been requested to do, viz. to try and consolidate all the expropriation laws under one umbrella, so that people know what is going to happen, how they will be treated and in what manner they can make representations in the event of their being in danger of losing their property.</p>

<p>I think we should remind ourselves that the ownership of a piece of land which gives such pride to a person who feels&#x201C;I am the registered owner of this land&#x201D;, gives to him three basic rights: The one is the right of possession and to recover possession from another person who wrongfully takes it from you. The second one is the use and the enjoyment of that land. The third one is that he has the right to dispose of that land. There is, of course one overriding restriction, and that is that the land should so be used as not to injure another person or another property. There was initially a compulsory aspect to this provision. You will remember, Mr. Speaker, that part of the penalty on someone convicted of certain crimes in the old days was to dispossess them of their property. That was abandoned before the 1800&#x2019;s in South Africa, in the Cape Colony. But it is interesting that dispossession was always regarded as a punitive measure. This expropriation as it now exists in South Africa, is based only on one criterion, viz. whether it is in the public interest that a man should be dispossessed of the ownership of his property. I wonder whether the criteria in the Bill before us are sufficiently strong. I have my reservations as to whether they are, if one looks, for instance, at the suggestion in this Bill, that a man, if he owns 85 per cent of the property, can obtain the other 15 per cent by expropriation. 85 per cent of an area may well be obtained in one transaction between two wealthy concerned owners, while the remaining 15 per cent might affect the individual homes of 5. 6 or more persons, if one is dealing with area only. If one is dealing with value, one has other considerations. I mention it as one of the aspects which I do not think is sufficiently covered and which I believe justifies our suggestions from this side that this Bill should go to a Select Committee, so as to take the views of persons and local authorities into account. The expropriations in the past have been approved for utility undertakings. I was interested to find a quotation in regard to one of these matters of Mr. Justice van den Heever in the appellate division, who quoted with approval a judgment in England of 1866, which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Now it must be observed that the Legislature, in providing for such an object as that of widening and improving the streets of the Metropolis, has to deal with a subject totally different from that of enabling &#x2026;</block>

<p><span class="col_4267-4268" refersTo="page_0596"/>The hon. the Leader of the House might be interested to know that this was the case in 1866&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; a body of adventurers to form a railway.</block>

<p>It is interesting to know that as recently as 1866 the formation of a railway was regarded as the undertaking of an adventurer.</p>

<p>How far the Minister has gone, is another matter which worries me in this case. I have a copy of an affidavit, which I believe has also been submitted to the hon. the Minister, in regard to the Doornfontein scheme. I want to read this out to the hon. the Minister, because I hope we can get it quite clear that he has not committed the Government or ourselves in regard to the type of legislation to be passed. This affidavit by the owner of one of these properties who is holding out, if I may put it that way, in Doornfontein says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">During September, 1970, Mr. X approached me and informed me that on the properties which they had acquired they were giving a two-year lease as by then they will have acquired expropriation rights from Minister Blaar Coetzee, who gave them their blessing, and that accordingly they were not negotiating further for any properties.</block>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>I suppose that this is a stunt that is being used to try to force somebody to part with his property under the threat of possible expropriation.</p>

<p>If I may go on to the Bill itself, I see no protection in this Bill for a person who owns property in a slum area and who says, &#x201C;I am quite prepared to develop my own property if this whole area is to be developed; I am prepared to rebuild; I will put up a modern garage, for instance, in place of my old dilapidated garage.&#x201D; Should he not have some protection and not be forced, because he is holding out, to give up his property&#x003F; There is no provision in this Bill for the protection of an owner of that type, the owner of a property which is in a slum area but whose property is in good condition. Would he be forced to part with his property because some private developer wishes to use that particular site for a purpose other than the one for which the owner is entitled to use it and is using it in the proper manner&#x003F; When the Bill talks about 85 per cent of the land, does it mean in terms of value or in terms of area&#x003F; Should it not possibly be higher&#x003F; It has been suggested by the South African Property Owners&#x2019; Association that it should be as high as 90 per cent or 95 per cent before one goes to the extreme of expropriation. The provisions of clause 2 (b) will have the effect of vesting in the Community Development Board the ownership of areas set aside for public purposes in a local authority area, which again seems to be most undesirable where a township or plots have been obtained for an urban development scheme and areas are reserved for open spaces. I do not think that the ownership should vest in the board. Obviously, according to normal practice, the ownership should vest in the local authority. Then, Sir, according to clause 3 (1) (b) the board in its discretion may make good any financial loss or any inconvenience caused. What is intended by &#x201C;inconvenience caused&#x201D;, and how does one relate inconvenience to rands and cents&#x003F; I believe that that is an aspect that needs further consideration. Sir, another aspect that I want to raise is that the hon. the Minister has not mentioned why this Bill should be introduced with retrospective effect from the beginning of 1971. It is provided here that clause 3 (1) shall be deemed to have come into operation on the first day of January, 1971. What outstanding expropriations are waiting to have their &#x201C;inconvenience&#x201D; assessed in rands and cents&#x003F; One wonders for what reason that provision is being introduced with retrospective effect. The Minister has not suggested any reason.</p>

<p>As far as clause 4 is concerned, the hon. the Minister has said that this provides for a short procedure of registration. You <span class="col_4269-4270" refersTo="page_0597"/>merely lodge documents with the Registrar; he then endorses the bond &#x201C;Cancelled&#x201D; and that So-and-So now owns the property. I would hesitate to suggest that a procedure of that sort carries the support of the Chief Registrar of Deeds, who is responsible for our deeds registry system, or the support of the Minister of Justice. I doubt whether they would support this form of encroachment on the system of registration which applies in South Africa.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to mention the grave risks of loss which can arise under clause 5 in the event of the financial failure of a developer company before the compensation has in fact been paid, because under this clause one is providing for ownership of the property to vest in the developer before the compensation has even been determined. One can imagine the complications which would arise if the developer company were to fail in those circumstances. Sir, there are other matters with which other hon. members on this side will probably deal, but I think I have indicated sufficiently why we on this side of the House would urge the hon. the Minister and hon. members opposite to allow this Bill to go to a Select Committee before the Second Reading so that these ancillary matters to the basic principle can be determined in a manner which will be acceptable to both sides of this House and which will also set at rest the disturbed minds of many persons who visualize that they are to be the first victims of these expropriation procedures.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. A. CRUYWAGEN</person>:</from>

<p>I think there are two matters we must first obtain clarity about in respect of this matter the hon. member for Green Point enlarged upon quite extensively. The first is that we would also like to include the private developer in redevelopment schemes in decayed urban areas that have been designated slum areas, firstly because we want to give the private developer himself the opportunity to come to light with original plans, with a view to redevelopment, and also because it becomes financially difficult for the Development Board and the department to finance all those development schemes themselves. We therefore agree that the private developer must he given the opportunity of assisting with urban renewal but, on the other hand, we are also saddled with the problem of the private owners, the owners of that 15 per cent of the land area that has not yet been obtained by the private developer. How must we protect his rights so that he can defend himself against the rights we grant the private developer&#x003F; Must we not give him the right to come light with his own plans and perhaps, within the framework of a large and broader plan, to erect a new building on his property&#x003F; Sir, here we are dealing with a very important principle that we on this side of the House are also fighting for, and that is that the private individual must not be surrendered to the large developer and that the rights of the private owners, eventually occupying that 15 per cent of the land area to which the Bill refers, must be fully protected. We on this side of the House are set on the private individual, who is being caught up in a process of urban renewal, not being surrendered to the large developer. What are the methods we must now employ to protect such an individual with his property&#x003F; I really have no objection to what the hon. member for Green Point said. To tell the truth, we on this side of the House, who are also involved in these matters and have usually discussed them, went personally to the Minister and told him that we agreed that we should eventually include the large developer to help us, but that we would have to look very carefully at the method by which the private owner is protected. The hon. member rightly said that when there is talk of expropriation, emotions are stirred up. We do not unnecessarily want to stir up emotions here. We do not unnecessarily want to squeeze out the small owner. We actually want to bring the two principles together so that this will be to the benefit of the whole community and also to the benefit of the small private owner in such an area. I personally want to tell the House honestly that some of us approached the Minister in connection with a Select Committee. I therefore have no objection to conceding to the hon. member for Green Point that it is perhaps the best way for us to solve the matter. There are other members on this side of the House who will make further reference to the matter, but there is something else in the legislation before us to which I want to refer in greater detail.</p>

<p>This concerns the first portion of the first clause, the portion that deals with the renovation of decayed areas. If we look at the Minister&#x2019;s speech last year under his Vote, where he referred to the committee he appointed to investigate the question of urban decay and to report to him, we <span class="col_4271-4272" refersTo="page_0598"/>find that there is a very practical classification of an urban area. We find this in column 7806, where the committee states that in practice we can actually divide the areas of a town into three groups, (i) the redevelopment areas, i.e. where the degree of decline is such that the entire area will have to be replanned and/or redeveloped; (ii) rehabilitation areas, i.e. areas which only fall short in respect of certain factors and must therefore be rehabilitated and (iii) conservation areas, which the first part of that clause is actually concerned with.</p>

<p>Decay is a phenomenon an urban area cannot escape and which no urban area is exempt from. There are also various reasons why decay sets in, and it is perhaps interesting to just point out again the reasons the hon. the Minister mentioned at the time. It is important for us to repeat these reasons. For all of us who concern ourselves with these matters, it is a good thing to look at the reasons why urban areas decay. The Minister mentioned the following reasons&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Decline is caused as a result of the infiltration of practices irreconcilable with urban zoning or planning in certain areas, or as a result of exceptional, undesirable factors, such as excessive population densities; (ii) decline results from poor control over buildings and a lack of standards for buildings; (iii) decline occurs in cases where there is a general downward trend in human activity as a result of stagnation or even deterioration of the economic, physical or social conditions; (iv) decline results from areas being inhabited by various race groups on an integrated basis and (v) decline is also experienced in areas where the inhabitants, especially members of the lower income groups, are not house&#x002D;owners.</block>

<p>Most recently we have given particular attention to urban renewal. We have already gleaned considerable knowledge in connection with urban renewal; we gained good practical experience where urban renewal schemes are carried out and we have already spent a great deal of money on urban renewal schemes. It is an expensive and cumbersome method but it is unfortunately the only remedy when an area has totally decayed. To think that we can simply allow urban areas to decay would be a wrong attitude. It would be wrong to have the plans and the money ready and then only come to light with these when the area had totally decayed, spend a large sum of money on an urban renewal scheme and then think we have saved the area. Such a policy would in the long run cost us a great deal of money and time will catch up on us because we shall not be able to keep abreast with the general renewal of urban areas. To continually replace buildings that have to be razed as a result of these aging factors, leads to one eventually falling behind with the provision of new accommodation. If one must continually be engaged in reconstructing decayed areas, this prevents one from providing new accommodation.</p>

<p>In that way one can easily fall behind with the provision of new housing. That committee was appointed and investigated the existing legislation. They investigated whether our present legislation, the Slums Act, the Community Development Act, provincial ordinances and even the regulations of local authorities grant us the powers we should like to have. It appears that we do not have the powers to renovate decayed areas. Local authorities in particular are faced with the problem that an owner continually advances the excuse that he does not have the money to renovate such a building. A big responsibility now rests with local authorities to keep an eye on possible conditions of decay in such a conservation area; to identify such an area or certain buildings in such an area and to negotiate the necessary loans to help the owners, whether of dwellings or business premises, to do the necessary renovation work. At this moment no standards are being laid down; there is a great measure of flexibility and local authorities are being left a large degree of discretion, but it is now their task to keep a weather eye open for possible decay.</p>

<p>I now want to express my personal opinion. I think we in South Africa have contempt for old buildings that still have a sturdy structure and are strongly built. We just like moving into new buildings. A new dwelling affords status and one does not like to live in an old dwelling. I think that in this respect we are making a very big mistake. I say again that I am speaking of strongly built structures and not of buildings that will in any case decay within ten years. Since this legislation is now clearing the way for us, we must give attention to renewing, beautifying and <span class="col_4273-4274" refersTo="page_0599"/>again putting our older buildings to efficient use along these lines.</p>

<p>A new dwelling does afford status, but just like people in overseas countries we must evidence respect for an old building. When I speak of an old building, I am not speaking of historical buildings, but of serviceable buildings, where the frontage and the recent style of architecture are not of primary importance, but where convenience is the factor that counts. The face of our cities is, as it were, changing from year to year as serviceable buildings vanish. By means of this Bill we can retain, beautify and usefully employ serviceable buildings. In this way we can again give greater status to the old buildings. The most important aspect that goes hand in hand with this is that by spending money in this way we shall eventually be saving a grat deal.</p>

<p>Since we are at present spending money to prevent buildings from decaying, we shall have to use this money correctly because once buildings have decayed completely we shall have to devote much more money, time and manpower to redeveloping and rebuilding those areas eventually. We must therefore be grateful to the Minister for this legislation. Because we do not want to set the large developers and the private owners against one another, we shall also have to solve that problem. I also want to associate myself with the hon. members opposite and ask the hon. the Minister, as we have done in the past, to consider this matter very carefully and to ensure that here we do not adversely affect the rights of the private individual, but give him proper protection against the big developer. I also support this legislation in principle.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased indeed to hear that hon. member on the other side of the House find a great deal commendable in the amendment that thas been moved by the hon. member for Green Point. Obviously this amendment has been moved in the spirit of the Bill with which we are dealing, namely that here we have an important problem facing the country, a problem which has exercised the mind of the hon. the Minister for some years now. We well know the importance he attaches, he has said this on many an occasion to urban renewal and slum clearance. In fact, in Johannesburg, which is the largest city in the country, and which I know better than some other cities&#x2014;I represent a constituency there&#x2014;the hon. the Minister has in terms of the Community Development Act frozen a certain portion of my constituency for urban renewal purposes. Over the last few years we have seen quite a lot of change taking place in that private owners themselves have purchased property there and, with the consent of the Community Development Board, have effected some very sound restoration. They have in fact brought some new ideas from Europe into the manner of restoration of old homes and have in this way enhanced the appearance of that area. They are thus making their contribution to this urban renewal scheme which the hon. the Minister has set in motion. I would like to say that it is important to remember, as has been stated by the hon. member for Green Point, that when it comes to the ownership of land and the expropriation of a man&#x2019;s rights to his property, it does arouse tremendous feeling. Over the years I have always believed with regard to the question of expropriation even by local authorities, that everything possible should be done in the interests of the owner of the land, who innocently has found his property to be in the way of certain public interests which are important to the community as a whole. One must unfortunately accept this because the over-all requirements of the community are paramount. I have always, however, believed in the principle, for which I have fought, with regard to arbitration negotiations, that the owner of the land must receive every possible consideration and be given, if anything, every possible advantage. If there is to be any erring in dealing with his rights, the erring should be to the advantage of the owner who is being deprived of his ownership and the use of his land. That is the spirit in which we approach this particular Bill. I believe too that, if anything, a Bill of this nature should have been a Bill standing completely on its own feet; and that, particularly as it introduces an entirely new principle, it should have been appropriate and within the historical perspective of land ownership in this country, that a private developer, for whom land is expropriated, believes that his objective will ultimately prove to be in the interests of the community.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>It must be in the interests <span class="col_4275-4276" refersTo="page_0600"/>of the community also in the opinion of the local authority.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want the hon. the Minister to misunderstand me. We hope&#x2014;after all we are only human&#x2014;that our belief that it will be in the interests of the community, will be well-founded and this will be so assessed. It is only a hope we express, because we realize that, to the private developer who is developing the property, to the organization or consortium that does this development, there is also the important element of profit. Therefore we believe that one has to approach the whole of this aspect with a great deal of caution and care. That is why we do not want to bind ourselves to all which is contained in the title, it contains a varied number of principles which particularly attach the whole administration of this new concept to the Department of Community Development. We believe that the Department of Community Development has a purpose which is entriely apart from this particular kind of development by the private developer. Whereas the Department of Community Development has hitherto concerned itself mainly with urban renewal of housing areas, we find that in the first scheme which may be became a real scheme it is a part of the city so close to the centre of the city that it will eventually form part and parcel of the business as well as the flat life of that particular city. It will therefore not be urban renewal in the truest sense as we know it, and as we have accepted it to be, but will be a scheme of development which will become part of a city; in other words, of oity development. It will give tremendous advantages to the developer who may enrich himself considerably. It could be In the interest of the community, because it will take away land which has deteriorated into slum conditions or which has deteriorated generally or which has decayed with the passage of time. That is why I suggest that all with which we are left, is the hope that it will ultimately be in the interest of the community.</p>

<p>Therefore we would rather prefer the provisions of this Bill not to be an amendment of the Community Development Act. For that reason we believe it is important that before the Second Reading of this Bill is agreed to, before any principle is accepted, particularly the detail in the title, the Bill should be considered by a select committee. We accept, as the hon. members rightly said, the principle of permitting a private developer into this field. We believe that where there is a holding out of just a small portion of an area which we consider is sufficiently broad to be regarded as a designated area, some provision should be made. It is a matter of the detail of such provision, the authority which should deal with the matter, which is at stake, and I believe this is very important.</p>

<p>When one looks at the details of the Bill, one is also disturbed by the suggested form of arbitration, which differs to some extent from the Expropriation Act, although an endeavour has been made to introduce the provisions which apply to compensation under the Expropriation Act into the Community Development Act, specifically for this purpose. However, it does not go far enough for two reasons. One is that it limits the actual compensation to the market value. It does not even provide room for negotiation. Once notice has been given, that is the end of the story in so far as the price is concerned. I think that must be a disturbing element in considering this matter. The second reason is that in terms of the Expropriation Act an owner can go to court.</p>

<p>He does not have to rely on choosing arbitrators, who are sometimes laymen and sometimes people who you only believe have some experience. The courts give a much wider opportunity for debating a matter of this nature, because proper legal principles can be discussed by a court which deals with these matters constantly. Costs, for instance, can be awarded on proper scales. There is a Supreme Court scale when the amount concerned is in excess of R10 000 and there is also the Magistrate&#x2019;s Court scale where the amount is below R10 000. However in terms of the Community Development Act, it is confined to the Magistrate&#x2019;s Court scales of costs only. I want to remind the hon. the Minister that where arbitration does take place at present under the Community Development Act, and if a private person wishes to appoint a leading counsel, a leading silk, because of his particular intimate knowledge of the subject, the costs which the department will permit, will only be R40 per day for that particular counsel who normally would charge anything from R150 to perhaps R250 per day, because be is a leading man with a tremendous practice and has specific knowledge in this particular <span class="col_4277-4278" refersTo="page_0601"/>field. We are not dealing with small properties. In the case of smaller properties we could make use of an arbitration court as suggested in the Bill itself. In the case of larger properties over a certain price the normal course of the Expropriation Act with the right of appeal to the Supreme Court should be followed. After all, we do not envisage the expropriation of little cottages here. We have to bear in mind that we may have large blocks of buildings involved, because most of this type of private development will take place close to a city. We have knowledge of only one particular scheme at the moment which in a sense has inspired this Bill and that is the one in Doornfontein. There has also been a suggestion in the Press of a similar scheme close to the House of Assembly in the Roeland Street, Hope Street and Buitekant Street area, about 200 yards from the House of Assembly. That is the sort of thing that happens. I want to go further and say that we believe that primarily the authority should be the local authority, because the local authority, which must seek the approval of the administrator in any event, has more intimate knowledge and is in closer contact with what is taking place in its own city. It has a complete perspective of its own city and merely to consult with it, in my view is not sufficient. It must be in agreement; it must give its approval to any such scheme I do not mind if the hon. the Minister, the administrator and the local authority confer as long as the local authority&#x2019;s approval is obtained as well in the overall picture of town planning. I believe that this is an important factor, because the local authority is responsible to its citizens primarily. We had a very interesting case in the local authority of Sandton just recently where the entire council was voted out of power because it was developing high-rise buildings and large roads as part of a new town. The citizens of that particular town felt that this was not warranted and that it was contrary to the spirit in which that town have been established. There we have an example of the importance that a local authority should attach to the view of its citizens as to what is good and what is useful in the public interest.</p>

<p>Let me go further. The question of the procedure in the vesting of ownership has been touched upon, just as a further example of why this needs such careful consideration by a Select Committee. Clause 4 (b) provides for the deletion of section 43 (3) of the principal Act. This is a very important subsection, because in terms of this subsection as it stands, a certificate had to be provided to the registrar that all procedures described in sections 39 and 40 (1) (b) had been observed and that all amounts payable by the board had been paid. I for one believe that before ownership vests in a private developer or a private consortium which is a developer provision should be made for the payment of the full purchase price. Whether it is done partially in cash and partially by guarantee, does not matter. The detail does not matter, but the owner should be assured of his money. The owner should not have to loose one moment&#x2019;s sleep or have one moments concern as to what will happen to his money. [Interjection.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the bond holder too. He has to be considered; he does not want what he regards as the gilt edged security which covers his investment or his loan, to be disturbed in any way. Not all countries in the world lightly interfere with the private ownership of property. The United States, for example, does not have any law to that effect. I was told by a friend of mine who had been to Washington that the world bank has been erected on a block where there is a chasm between two wings of that building, a very narrow chasm of about 15 metres by about 30 or 40 metres in depth, in a building which I think is 45 to 50 storeys high. At the bottom of that chasm the owner of that particular piece of land carries on business as a purveyor of newspapers and paperbacks. Just recently a visitor from America was asked whether that man was still there. The answer was &#x201C;Yes, he still carries on because he believes that he needs to do something and this is the way he wants to do it&#x201D;. It is his own property and he does not want to sell it. He is not concerned if they offer him 50 million dollars; he is a happy man looking after his own business. That very often happens with people. That is the socio&#x002D;section of the socio-economic problem that faces the person. The money does not become so important as the fact that he can do something. Let me give the hon. the Minister an example as regards this very case in Doornfontein. There is one person &#x2014;I will not name him&#x2014;the Minister will know his name&#x2014;who has six or eight plots <span class="col_4279-4280" refersTo="page_0602"/>&#x2014;I am not sure how many&#x2014;all contiguous to each other and who submitted some plans not very long ago for the erection of a modern structure. It is a matter which certainly must be very carefully considered as to whether he should not have the right to integrate his particular scheme into the globular scheme. He happens in this extraordinary instance, to be on the perimeter of the scheme. Why he should not be able to retain his ownership and integrate his scheme into the overall scheme, is something which must be thought about. That is why we believe that we should not at this stage go so far as to accept any specific principle which would then tie the hands of any Select Committee which might consider any further details of the matter.</p>

<p>Then we find that there is a tie-up with the Community Development Act, in so far as affected properties and basic values are concerned. Who is concerned with the appreciation or depreciation advantages&#x003F; The private developer&#x003F; Why should he come into the picture&#x003F; One can understand some of these provisions in regard to community development where the State has set up a board and an administration in the interests of a community, but there should not be a provision of this nature which would apply to a private developer, to look after his costs of administration, the board that he has established or the technical people that he employs in order to develop a scheme. There are many facets in this type of legislation which we believe are completely foreign to the spirit of the Bill.</p>

<p>Let me go further. This type of legislation is not entirely new in South Africa. In the Expropriation Act provision is made for the expropriation of immovable property by the State for the benefit of certain juristic persons. By that I imagine is meant public utility companies, perhaps State departments or some associated organization which is probably of a public nature and on behalf of which the State is entitled to expropriate. The State does that under the Expropriation Act and constitutes a very much wider and different field to that covered at this stage by this particular Bill.</p>
