<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, last night I was asking the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development for certain information regarding this item of R2 557 000, Item N. The hon. the Minister kindly informed me what the position was with regard to the hospitals which were taken over and administered by the Department of Health in the Bantu areas. I come now to the question of those Bantu hospitals which are in the White areas. Will the hon. the Minister tell me whether any <span class="col_2333-2334" refersTo="page_1184"/>of this money is going to the payment of fees or subsidies to the provincial administrations in respect of those Bantu hospitals which are in the White areas and administered by the provincial administrations&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>The position is that after they are taken over by my department and the Department of Health, the finances for missionary as well as State hospitals (previously provincial hospitals) in the Bantu homeland areas, now come through my department to the Department of Health, but with regard to Bantu hospitals outside the Bantu homeland areas, that is to say, in White towns or in White cities, in all four provinces, the position remains absolutely unchanged. Those Bantu hospitals in the White area still fall under the provinces and will all be financed, as in the past, by funds from the provinces. In South-West Africa the position is the same. There, too, we do not through my department finance any hospitals in the White area of South-West Africa; so in the four provinces the position has changed only in respect of Bantu hospitals inside the Bantu homeland areas where the financing now comes through my department to the hospitals and the Department of Health, but in the White areas in the four provinces the Bantu hospitals in the cities and towns will undergo no change as far as financing is concerned. The position will be just the same as in the past.</p>

<p>In the light of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply to the hon. member for South Coast, I would like to ask him whether he will now exercise control entirely and solely over those hospitals which are inside the Bantu Areas. The point is whether the provinces are free to plan and extend these facilities to Bantu outside the Bantu areas.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I do not know whether I must reply to that question because it is totally irrelevant here. The position is that I have no say whatsoever over Bantu hospitals in the White area of South Africa, except for the sitting of such hospitals; I have no say with regard to their running.</p>

<from>Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. C. VON KEYSERLINGK</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, last night the hon. the Minister told us that part of the increase in salaries, wages and allowances was due to the posting or the seconding to the homelands of more White personnel than they had at first anticipated. Could the Minister tell us what his Budget is; can he tell us how many persons he really had in mind, and what extra number had to be posted&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>No, we do not keep statistics in that form. The position is that we plan the hierarchy for every one of these Bantu homelands; as I have said, as a matter of principle we always try to get as many Bantu persons as possible to man the various posts, but it was not possible, especially as far as the top ranks are concerned, to get all the Bantu persons we hoped to get and consequently we had to take in more White persons who are, of course, on a higher salary scale.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I have said very clearly that we do not keep statistics in that form. Theoretically the answer is that right at the beginning we intended to have so many posts but that ultimately we had to fill a quarter number of posts with White persons, but the statistics are not kept in that way; it is not necessary.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, when the hon. the Minister draws up his Budget, does he draw it up on a guesswork basis and simply make provision for a globular sum, or does he have a specific establishment&#x003F; When the Budget is drawn up, the original Estimates show the various posts and grades, the number of people in those grades, the rate at which they are paid and the total amount. That is how the Estimates appear before this House. When the hon. the Minister draws up his Budget, does he not have before him the individual grades, the individual posts, the number of people planned for it, and the amount required&#x003F; He now comes to this Committee with additional Estimates and says, &#x201C;I do not know, because we do not have the statistics.&#x201D; He does have those statistics, Mr. Chairman. He had them in the original Estimates; they had to be there because they were presented to this House. The original Estimates appeared before us in this House; they were debated and the money was voted. The hon. the Minister now comes to us <span class="col_2335-2336" refersTo="page_1185"/>for an additional amount. What we want to know is where this additional estimate differs as far as numbers are concerned from the estimates which the Minister presented when we considered the original Estimates last year. The hon. the Minister cannot say &#x201C;We do not keep those statistics.&#x201D; Of course he keeps those figures.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>But the hon. the Minister knows how many people he budgeted for, White and non-White&#x003F; Surely, if he has done his job, and if he knows what is going on in his department, he can say: &#x201C;We budgeted for so many; in fact, we could not fill these posts at this rate; we had to fill them at a higher rate with different people.&#x201D; The hon. the Minister cannot shrug his shoulders and say: &#x201C;I have no statistics.&#x201D; That means that when we have the Main Estimates before us, we are going to have to say to the hon. the Minister that we cannot accept any of his figures in the Main Estimates because they are not based on any statistics. For instance, I have here a copy of last year&#x2019;s Main Estimates. I refer to Vote 24. on page 142. This shows the number of deputy secretaries, under-secretaries, principal Bantu Affairs commissioners, right down the list, to &#x201C;other staff&#x201D;. There are 127 in this latter category. We then find separate sections dealing with the Territorial Authority of the Tswana, the Territorial Authority of the South Sotho, of the Ovambo, and each Bantu Territorial Authority, showing the exact number of people. The numbers are listed, and in each case there is a group of &#x201C;other staff&#x201D; at the bottom. It shows the number of officials, the rate and the total amount. I have here before me a copy of the Main Estimates. Now, can the hon. the Minister tell us under which heads&#x2014;and in respect of which groups he has not conformed with what he asked Parliament to approve, and where he has asked us to depart from what this House approved, and from the establishment which this House granted the hon. the Minister. That is what we want to know. That is what the Minister should know, and that is what we are entitled to ask him. If he cannot reply, then we have every reason to ask: &#x201C;Why does the Minister not know what is going on in his department&#x003F;&#x201D;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, to anyone participating in an intelligent way in the functions of this Committee and this House it became clear long ago that the Opposition avails itself of every opportunity to wage so-called psychological warfare against this side of the House, by alleging that none of us knows anything about any of our departments.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>It seems like it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, it is no problem at all to ask the Opposition a question about their functions, in respect of which they will not be able to give the answer. What we are dealing with here is not the number of posts in my department. Nor is it the number of posts in the various Bantu Governments, because all this money is not intended solely for posts in my department. There is money here for posts in the Bantu departments of the various Bantu Governments. I do not know whether the hon. member is aware of that. What we are dealing with here is not the number of posts; we are dealing here with a necessary increase in all the various Bantu Governments, and apart from the Transkei there are seven others which have recently come into operation. There are Bantu posts in the establishments of the Bantu Governments in the case of each of those departments they have, and those Bantu posts are financed out of the estimates of those Bantu Governments. If these are Bantu persons, then it is their business and they have the particulars of how many there are. In so far as Bantu persons cannot be found for those Bantu posts, White persons are on loan from us to occupy those Bantu posts at the remuneration of the White salary scales of those whom we employ. That is the position, and one of the reasons which I have already expressly mentioned. I want to point out that there are various reasons for this. Yesterday afternoon I mentioned five categories, and if the hon. member wants to know from me how many posts there are in each of the Bantu Governments in general, and how many of those posts are at present occupied by Whites, and how many are at present occupied by Bantu, I can give him the information, but I cannot give it to him at the moment. It is useless for me to bring this information along to this House, for when these particulars were given to me last week, the position was different to what it is today. It fluctuates from week to week, as persons <span class="col_2337-2338" refersTo="page_1186"/>come and go. Hon. members must remember that we are dealing here with seven different Bantu Governments, where there are a few thousand such posts. There are more than 50 000 teachers&#x2019; posts alone. If the hon. member really wants to know how many Bantu persons there are in the various Bantu Government posts, and how many White persons, then I give the hon. member the choice of doing one of two things. Firstly he can raise the matter under my Vote. I shall then furnish him with the total number. I shall not want to furnish him with the names of the people as well, though, because to do so would be a waste of both time and paper. However, if the hon. member does not want to wait for that, he can put a proper question on the Order Paper in regard to the posts of all the various Bantu Governments, Whites and non-Whites, and then I shall furnish him with the information. We do have the information available in that way, but we do not have it available in the way which the hon. member for Umhlatuzana &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is a sorry day for this House when I have to hold up the hon. the Minister of Indian Affairs as an example to other Ministers as to how they should conduct their business. All the hon. member for Umlazi wanted to know was: &#x201C;What is the increase in the number of White personnel who have had to be employed in the different departments during the year to bring about this difference in the salaries, wages and allowances.&#x201D; Last night the hon. Minister of Indian Affairs gave us those figures in respect of his department. Admittedly he could not break down the amounts, but he was able to give us the numbers. Now the Minister very unreasonably says that if we want to know the numbers of all the Whites employed in the different departments he will give them to us. He facetiously adds that he cannot give us all the names. Nobody is asking for that sort of thing; he is just trying to be a bit too smart. One of the excuses he gave was that he also had to furnish the Bantu Governments with White personnel if they cannot find sufficient numbers of Bantu officials to fill the posts. Then he said &#x201C;Dit is hulle saak&#x201D;, as to how many they require. I submit that it is not &#x201C;hulle saak&#x201D;, if we are paying for those people.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Well, then this House is entitled to know how many he had to second to help them. Surely we are entitled to know the extra number that had to be employed. We are only asking for the extra numbers. We are not asking for the details of all the servants employed by the department. We are merely asking how many extra officials had to be employed. That is what the hon. member wanted to know. I submit that that is not an unreasonable request to put to the Minister. It is no answer to say that they vary all the time. When he placed this fixed amount in these Additional Estimates, he must have known how many he was budgeting for. Surely his department can tell him how many additional Whites&#x2014;that is all we want to know&#x2014;had to be employed to fill these posts&#x003F;</p>

<from><span class="col_2339-2340" refersTo="page_1187"/>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to set the hon. member straight. In regard to drawing up estimates, and in regard to how many people have to be employed there, how many posts there are and how much money is required, the hon. member must remember two related points. An establishment is drawn up for a department. According to that establishment we know precisely how many posts there are. The ideal situation is to fill them all. You do not get the situation in any administration, not even in our White administrations, where all the departments have at all times filled all their posts. It fluctuates from day to day. Sometimes you will perhaps have a 90 per cent occupation of posts, and other times it will be 91 per cent, and on another day it may even perhaps be 96 per cent. It fluctuates from week to week and it may even happen that at the end of this year, when the final accounts are closed, all this money will not even have been used because you did not have 100 per cent occupation of the posts. This is for the establishment with the number of posts it has. For that establishment that money is necessary <i>in toto,</i> and so much as an additional amount. If you do not have full occupation of all the posts on an establishment, if you cannot find all the people you need, because others have resigned or something like that, it may even happen that money is returned unused. It is an impossible task to give the hon. member a precise reply in this regard at any given time. That is why it is an absolute waste of time to keep particulars of this kind up to date, and I repeat my offer to the hon. member opposite. If he wants a full and proper picture of what the overall set-up is, we will be pleased to give it to him.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I really do not understand the hon. the Minister now. When he submitted his Main Estimates, he indicated to us a full establishment of 6 540 people. Now he is asking for that to be changed. If he was able to give us the original, surely he can tell us what the change was, for example where the increase or where the decrease was. Were the original estimates false, and did the Minister come to this House to request money for things he did not want&#x003F; No, if he was able to furnish the number of posts on the original establishment in each of these categories, then he can also furnish the information in regard to this increase.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. member had rather asked me in private first, he would not have made such a great public fool of himself as he has just done. That book which the hon. member held up there indicates the posts of my department of which Mr. Van Onselen is the Secretary. This argument revolves round the posts in the Bantu Governments, which do not appear in that book. They appear in the books of the Bantu Government. That is the difference.</p>

Would he please inform us with what object he is today asking Parliament to vote this additional amount of R355 000, what it will be used for, whether it involves any new staff who will have to be paid out of this amount, and if so, what staff and in what capacity and how many of them.

<p>I furnished these particulars last night, and I want to repeat them now. This deals with the salaries, wages and allowances in respect of this <span class="col_2341-2342" refersTo="page_1188"/>R995 000. As I said, after expected savings were introduced, these excesses are there and this amount has to be spent for the number of posts which were necessary on the establishments for all these different activated Bantu authorities, because at the stage when we established the authorities it was not clear how many people they would be able to produce from among the members of their own peoples to fill those posts. White persons then had to be brought in for those posts, who, in the first place, are on a higher salary scale than the Bantu persons, and for whom therefore more money would be required.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>But how many of them are there&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>In the second place, more White persons were needed for that purpose. In addition there is also the expansion of the establishment, in other words, the normal expansion of the staff which occurs in any administration, and for which this money was required. Most of this money was spent on salary adjustments, salary improvements which took effect on two different dates in 1971, i.e. in January and October. This applies to both White and Bantu persons employed by those departments, as well as those employed by my own department, i.e. the Department of Bantu Administration and Development. These are the particulars I furnished the hon. member with last night. I repeat that if hon. members want specific particulars, specific numbers on specific dates, they must put the question in that way and I will have it tabulated for them in detail, in so far as we keep statistics of that kind up to date. One does not keep statistics up to date simply in order to have long rows and columns of figures. In so far as these are available, I shall furnish them to hon. members.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. the Minister. But, Mr. Chairman, although I accidentally mentioned the wrong figure to him a moment ago, I must point out that he replied to the wrong question. I do not want under the general heads in respect of which the money is being spent. I asked a specific question. The Minister must have calculated an amount of R995 000 plus R355 000. He must have calculated a further amount of R2 557 000. He must have calculated these amounts to the nearest thousand or nearest hundred.</p>

<p>How did he calculate these amounts&#x003F; He must surely have said, when he calculated these amounts, that he needed them for adjustments or new appointments. That is all we want to know. We are entitled to know. After all, we cannot blindly vote R3 million to the hon. the Minister. He told us that he is requesting this money because he had to appoint people to posts for which Bantu could not be found. He had to fill additional posts. Why did he have to fill them&#x003F; We are asking him specifically to motivate the reason for these people having been appointed, who they are, where they were appointed and how many were appointed.</p>

<p>No, not their names, but officially. In other words, what office do they hold. He cannot expect us to make him a gift of R3 million to do with what he wants. Surely he must use it for a certain, specific object. That is what we are entitled to know, otherwise he is unable to motivate it and explain to Parliament why he wants the money and what he wants to do with it. It is his duty, that is what he is Minister for and that is what he is paid for. His office is to justify his administration to the representatives of the people in this House of Assembly.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am concerned with the situation which the hon. the Minister has revealed in these departments. It shows a total instability of labour. He has told us that from day to day the filling of posts in a superstructure which is to become an independent state and which is to run a country, varies from 80 per cent to 90 per cent to 95 per cent to 100 per cent; not quite 100 per cent&#x2014;96 per cent was the highest. What sort of administration is this where from day to day the filling of your posts can vary to that extent&#x003F; The hon. the Minister has now come and asked us for an amount of money; he is asking us to budget for the maximum possible, but he admits in asking for that money, that he has no stability in this service he wants to finance. He admits that his labour force is so unstable that it would be necessary to pick a particular day in order to get the particulars of what Whites and what non-Whites fill these posts. What we want to know is, when these posts were classified and put on the original Estimates of the various authorities and when they were taken up in the planning of those authorities, did the hon. the Minister have no idea then of what work force was available to fill these posts&#x003F; Did he allow, under his authority, a staff structure to be created for, let us say the Kavango Authority, without any idea at all of how many Kavangos there were who were able to fill those posts&#x003F; Did he not know how many matriculated people there were, how many were able to fill posts, how many were able to fill administration posts such as clerks and all the different positions&#x003F; Does he simply create a structure on paper and when he comes to applying it, he finds that the reality is quite different. This is what worries us. We are handing millions and millions of rands for this Minister&#x2019;s department and it now appears that we are voting this money for a structure on paper, a structure which exists only in the imagination of the Minister, a structure which the hon. the Minister has dreamt up but which in fact does not work in practice.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this increase of R20 000 is due to a general improvement in salaries of teachers and other employees in the Department of Bantu Education which came into operation last year. It was done in terms of Public Service Commission Circular No. 4 of 1971 and came into operation on 1st October, 1971. There are also cases in which it was of retrospective effect. The hon. members will notice that the amount was R21 000 originally, less the excesses which had to be met from savings on other subheads, which amounted to R1 000. An additional amount of only R20 000 is now being requested. This amount is necessary for adjustments to and improvements in the salaries of 558 teachers, 74 of whom were principals. I think this is more or less the reply the hon. member wants.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there are a number of matters which we wish to raise and discuss under these various Votes. Under Vote No. 26 I want to refer to Item M, legal expenses incurred by the State Attorney for which an additional amount of R60 000 is asked to be voted. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister will indicate to us whether this is caused by unexpected litigation which was not budgeted for in the normal event, and if it is so, what sort of cases were they and to what amounts the State is involved. In fact, could the hon. the Minister be specific and indicate whether perhaps the hon. the Minister of Community Development&#x2019;s indiscretion is one of the cases which is included&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the legal expenses incurred by State Attorneys are absolutely unpredictable. The State Attorney acts on behalf of all State Departments, provincial administrations and the like. One cannot tell exactly what the amount will be in one particular year. We estimated that it would amount to R350 000 in this particular year. In point of fact we find that according to our most careful calculations the amount will be R410 000 on 31st March, 1972, an additional R60 000. We had quite a number of important cases, a few of which I have with me here. It is not necessary to name these cases, but if hon. members insist I shall do so. There are approximately ten of these cases amounting to a total of R124 708. It is difficult; one cannot say exactly how many. The hon. member <span class="col_2349-2350" refersTo="page_1192"/>referred to the case of the hon. the Minister of Community Development. He asked whether that was also included here. It is not included in these cases which I just mentioned here and which amounted to R124 000. It will certainly be included if it is finalized before the 31st March. The court fees <i>a quo</i> will then be included in this additional R60 000.</p>

<p>Sir, may I put it this way&#x003F; Here we find, for the first time in history, so far as I am aware, that the State has undertaken to pay the costs in the court <i>a quo</i> where a Minister of the State, in his capacity as a Minister of the State apparently, has defamed someone. What I am saying is that this raises a very important principle which involves whether we pass this additional amount or whether we do not, and it is this: Is it accepted by the Government that if Ministers in their capacity as Ministers, in the course of their duties, defame anyone, the State will pay the costs of the action when the defamed party sues them for defamation&#x003F; This is what we want to know. Will the hon. the Minister please give us a reply to that question&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>The position is quite simply this: the State and a Minister of the State are obliged to accept responsibility for what is done by their officials. The State is responsible for what is done by its Ministers. If a Minister should happen to go too far in his official capacity as Minister, then the State might just as well be sued as the Minister himself. Consequently the State accepts responsibility. Of course, if an official expresses himself in an irresponsible manner such an official will be discharged, and if it is a Minister who acted irresponsibly, then steps will be taken against him. I do not want to go into the matter in detail, but in this case it quite simply amounts to this: what was involved here was the question of a discussion between the Minister of Community Development and the mayor of Pretoria. The mayor of Pretoria addressed his council and told his council that the Minister of Community Development had broken the agreement which had existed between them. This caused large headlines in the newspapers. The Minister of Community Development was obliged either to let the report pass as it was, or to justify his department and himself, and consequently he replied to the report. He honestly believed, and believes to this day, that there was no agreement; that was the whole point at issue. The court unfortunately found &#x2026; [Laughter.] Sir, I do not know what hon. members are laughing at. I said the court unfortunately found that there had been an agreement, with the result that the State was obliged to accept responsibility. The hon. member for Durban North himself said, in a newspaper report I saw, that if a man spoke in his official capacity the State was obliged to pay, because the State could just as well have been sued in court as the Minister himself. The Minister of Community Development could have been sued as Minister of Community Development if he had made the statement in his personal capacity. That is accepted policy. There has not been a similar case in the past. This case is the only one of its kind. This is the first time it has happened; that is quite correct, and consequently the State accepted responsibility. So sincerely did the hon. the Minister believe that he was right in his interpretation of what had happened that he decided to appeal and the State then said: &#x201C;No, we do not believe that you should appeal against the verdict.&#x201D; The Minister then replied: &#x201C;But there was no agreement; I can prove that there was no agreement,&#x201D; and he said that he was going to appeal at his own expense. The State then said that he could go on at his own expense and that was what happened. That is why our expenses are limited to the costs <span class="col_2353-2354" refersTo="page_1194"/>in court <i>a quo.</i> The Minister paid the other costs himself and he also paid the damages.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I cannot see that whether or not there was an agreement has anything to do with the necessity of the hon. the Minister to utter libellous statements. You see, what the hon. the Minister is saying, is&#x2014;this is what it amounts to&#x2014;that there are times when, in order to express the views of the State, it is necessary for Ministers to do so by means of libellous statements. Now, one has only to state that to realize how unacceptable it is. One accepts the principle that when a Minister is acting properly in his official capacity, he should not have to bear the responsibility of his acting in that capacity, but I have yet to hear any justification for the point of view that there are times when it is necessary, in order for a Minister to do his duty, to do so by means of uttering libellous statements.</p>

Surely this will have one result and one result only, and that is to encourage the use of irresponsible utterances by such Ministers as are given to that sort of thing. Sir, with great respect to the hon. the Minister, who has given a long and careful explanation, it is no explanation at all which we can accept if that is the basis on which it is to be put.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is an outrageous statement which is now being made by the hon. member for Zululand. I did not hear the hon. the Minister make that statement. All that the hon. the Minister said was that if a Minister should, in the course of his duty, commit an offence of that nature and defame someone, the State would accept responsibility for it, but surely this is an analogy to the situation if a Minister should drive a vehicle and be involved in an accident. The State is then responsible for it if it was due to his negligence, but that does not mean that he can and will drive as he likes every day.</p>

<p>I think that is an absurd statement. All that happened here was that the hon. the Minister said that if something like this were to happen in the course of a Minister&#x2019;s duty, the State must accept responsibility for it because the State is also responsible for it in the second place. What is wrong with that&#x003F; Surely that statement is correct. I think the hon. the Minister explained the position very clearly. But the hon. member for Zululand has gone and twisted it for political purposes.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the Minister has now justified the Government&#x2019;s attitude towards this case by saying that it is an ordinary principle that an employer is liable for the actions of his employee <span class="col_2355-2356" refersTo="page_1195"/>during the course of his duties. On that basis they are paying the costs. An employer is responsible for the actions of his employee, but he is responsible for all the actions.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to reply to two questions. There is the question just put by the hon. member for Transkei and then there is a further question as well. The trouble is this: you cannot decide whether an utterance which has been made was in fact an insult before the court has decided that it was. Before the judge has decided we cannot take that decision. I told the hon. member that the Minister believed that there had been no agreement in this connection. Therefore he could choose between two alternatives. In the first place he could accept the amount that was claimed and pay it in full; and he could not possibly do that, after all.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister suggested that in this case there was a dispute as to whether or not a certain agreement had been entered into. Now, if that was the dispute it would not have resulted in an action for defamation. That is merely a dispute of fact, i.e. whether the agreement existed. Now I want to come to the hon. member for Prinshof, who seems to put his legal knowledge into vacuum containers somewhere when he does not want to use it, when it is to his disadvantage to do so. The hon. member for Prinshof said, quite correctly, that an hon. Minister in the discharge of his duties might give rise to an action for accidental or even negligent action. But the hon. member for Prinshof knows that defamation is not an accidental or a negligent act, and that before there can be an action for defamation there must be a deliberate statement intended to injure and be understood to injure the person concerned. Now the Minister of Justice says the argument was about whether or not an agreement existed. That might have been what heated up the Minister of Community Development, but the law case was not over whether there was an agreement or not. The law case was over whether the Minister was justified in using the language he did use towards two officials of the Pretoria municipality.</p>

<p>I want to go further than the Minister and say there must be logic. If the State must accept liability for the costs, why does it not pay the damages&#x003F; Where is the dividing line&#x003F; Where is the principle which says that the State can justifiably pay costs, but must leave the Minister to pay the damages himself&#x003F; Either it must defend because the Minister&#x2019;s actions were in the course of his duties, or not defend as it was not in the course of his duty. If it was in the course of his duty, the State should accept the whole responsibility. I suggest that the hon. the Minister here and his colleagues have shown their own weakness and their own lack of conviction in their arguments by just going, if I might say so, &#x201C;halfpad&#x201D; with the acceptance of the responsibility. It must be total or not at all. On this side we believe it should be not at all, because a defamatory statement is <span class="col_2357-2358" refersTo="page_1196"/>an assault, and can a physical act of assault by a Minister ever be held to be something which he does in the course of his duty&#x003F; This is an assault on the character of an individual and can be likened to an assault on the body of another person. I am sure the Minister would not ask this House to vote funds to defend a Minister who is guilty of a physical assault.</p>

<p>No, they are only vapour screens. That is not so pleasant. Mr. Chairman, the real point in the discussion of this particular Vote is the fact that a specific legal principle is at stake here. What is the real legal principle which is at stake in this particular debate and under this Vote&#x003F; This is namely that when officials of the State and Ministers of the State act in their capacity as servants of the State there is the pure legal principle that the State, which in this case is the employer in terms of our common law, may be held responsible for any unlawful act by either an official or a Minister. This is the position, irrespective of whether the unlawful act was committed through negligence or deliberately, violently or otherwise. The principle remains, irrespective of whether we condemn the particular act. Hon. members may condemn a particular act by an official or a Minister if they want to, but my submission is that this is not relevant here. What is in fact relevant is a legal principle which must apply. The accepted legal principle in our country is that when an employee or a Minister, as in this particular case, commits any unlawful act which results in damage, the State is co-responsible for the consequences of the act.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>We would like to take this matter further because the hon. member for False Bay went a lot further than the hon. the Minister of Justice. What exactly is it that the State or the Government alleges to be the principle involved here&#x003F; Does the Government allege that the principle is that whatever illegal act is committed by a Minister in the course of his duties, the State is responsible for whatever damage is caused by that&#x003F; Is that the test&#x003F; If it is not the test, then perhaps the hon. the Minister of Justice will tell us exactly what he regards the test to be. The hon. the Minister of Justice has said to this Committee that if in the course of the discharge of his duties, a Minister has caused a defamation, as happened in this case, the State is responsible. Let us examine this statement. First of all, if the State is responsible, then it must be responsible not only for the costs but also for the damage, but apparently the Government regards the State as not being responsible for the damages flowing from the defamation of the hon. the Minister of Community Development.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there is also another aspect. The hon. the Minister of Justice then went on to tell us that there may be circumstances where a Minister may be reckless or irresponsible in committing a defamation, and in such cases he may be disciplined. This is a very interesting proposition. What exactly does the hon. the Minister of Justice mean by it&#x003F; Does the Minister of Justice mean that the State will be liable only if there was no recklessness or irresponsibility or does it mean that the State will be liable even if there is recklessness or irresponsibility but that the Cabinet will then discipline that Minister in some way&#x003F; This matter is very important because it is a matter of principle. We would like to hear from the hon. the Minister whether he goes so far as to suggest that the test in a case like this is the degree of irresponsibility or recklessness with which the Minister concerned has committed a defamation. If that is the test, we must go very much more deeply into the defamation of the hon. the Minister of Community Development because in my opinion there was recklessness and irresponsibility in this case. I shall explain why I say this. The hon. the Minister of Justice has stated that this whole thing arose over whether or not an agreement had been entered into between the Town Clerk of Pretoria and the Minister of Community Development. This is a very simple issue. If the hon. the Minister of Community Development considers that there was no agreement, he can say that. He can say it very firmly and he can be very emphatic about it, but there is no need whatsoever in order to deny that an agreement had been entered into or in order to assert that an agreement had been entered into, to commit a defamation. Surely, if a defamation is committed under those circumstances it is reckless and irresponsible. We would like to hear very clearly from the hon. the Minister of Justice whether he regards the test as being one of recklessness or irresponsibility. On that note I will sit down. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, while I am on my feet, perhaps the hon. the Minister will also tell us how much is involved in the costs of the court <i>a quo</i>&#x003F; How much does the State, in other words, propose to pay&#x003F; Perhaps he can tell us whether the amount has already been paid out.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. Minister says it was paid in accordance with the established legal principle that the master is responsible for his servants&#x2019; wrongs. With respect, the hon. member for Green Point showed that this does not apply in the case of an intentional injury, where there is <i>animus injuriandi.</i> I challenge the hon. member for Prinshof, who got up a moment ago but was not seen, and the hon. the Minister, to cite a case where, in fact, the employer of an employee has been sued and held liable in damages for the defamation of his servants. I know of no case in the South African law. And that is why this is a most important matter of principle. Consequently, anybody who alleges that this is not an important matter, is trifling with the situation. I suggest that it is because of the Government&#x2019;s uncertainty on this point, because they are not sure of their law&#x2014;indeed, perhaps they suspect that they are wrong in law&#x2014;that they have not been prepared to pay the capital damages which have been awarded, but the costs only. After all, if this is a simple case of our South African principle of law, first and foremost it is the damages which a person has suffered that may be claimed against the employer, but costs are only incidental. Because of the very uncertainty of the Government in this matter, they have struck an unhappy compromise whereby they have helped the hon. the Minister with regard to the costs&#x2014;and we feel sorry for him in one respect&#x2014;but they were not prepared to pay the capital and they are not prepared to pay the costs of appeal.</p>

<p>I am not going to give you a case, I am going to quote you a principle. The whole matter is as clear as daylight. The hon. the Minister said that the principle of common law applied to these cases as well. The fact that this is the first time that defamation falls under this principle does not affect the principle at all. The principle of common law applies to this as well. The fact that the hon. the Minister was decent enough to say that he would pay the damages himself and that the State could pay the legal costs is now being held against this side of the House by hon. members on the other side. Surely that is ridiculous. In actual fact the Government would have had to pay the damages as well as the legal costs. Here is an hon. <span class="col_2363-2364" refersTo="page_1199"/>Minister, however, who is decent enough to say that he feels a need to pay the damages himself and that he does not want the State to pay it. Hon. members on the other side hold it against him, however. It is a ridiculous statement. Hon. members on the other side are now running around in circles and trying to find all kinds of peculiar deviations from the principle here, while there is no deviation from principles.

<p>Mr. Chairman, one hesitates, of course, to enter into a debate in which all these legal arguments are being advanced, but it interests me, all the same, to know that if the hon. the Minister of Justice is correct in his approach to the matter, and if the State is prepared to pay the man&#x2019;s legal costs, there need be no problems at all, apparently, if the State should pay the other costs of the hon. the Minister of Community Development as well.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to tell the hon. the Minister of Community Development that we sympathize with him. In my humble opinion we are dealing with a very serious matter here. The matter is very simple, namely that the hon. the Minister of Justice is placing the ministerial position on the same level as that of a public servant. When a Minister or an official then does something which is not correct the State is responsible for it. A Cabinet Minister is not an official, however. When an official commits an error the State is responsible for it and the State has to pay. In such cases the State has a disciplinary measure and this disciplinary measure is quite simple. Such a person can simply be dismissed. But what do we do with an hon. Minister&#x003F; One cannot put the same machinery into operation for a Minister. Because this is so it points very clearly to the basic fact that there is a difference between a Cabinet Minister on the one hand and a public servant on the other hand.</p>

<p>I have listened to the common law, but it seems to me that that law becomes rather common sometimes. What is the truth&#x003F; Let us look at the common law. Let us take the case of a traffic constable who sees someone he does not like and who then goes up to that person and gives him a few cuffs. Does the hon. member for False Bay want to tell me now that the municipality is going to accept the responsibility for that&#x003F;</p>

<p>Oh no. What will happen is the following, common law or not. Let the hon. member for False Bay answer me if he can. That official&#x2014;and he knows this is true&#x2014;will be suspended. If that particular person then takes him to court for a case he himself will have to pay and not the municipality. Sir, as soon as the official-&#x2014;this is very clear&#x2014;does something with the deliberate intention of injuring a man his employer has nothing to do with him, because he acted out of his official capacity. In this connection it is very clear to me that the hon. the Minister of Justice will have to take a firm stand. He dare not put the Minister on a par with a public servant in this basic case. To do that would be to create an example which might lead to great abuse in politics in South Africa.</p>

<p>We have heard the Minister enunciate a principle here this afternoon that the State accepts responsibility for the payment of costs that arise from defamation carried out in the course of a Minister&#x2019;s duties. He referred to the Minister of Community Development and his particular case of defamation. I would like to ask him, is this the only Minister who is involved in a case of defamation&#x003F; Are there other Ministers whose costs are going to have to be paid&#x003F; I would like to ask him particularly what the position is of the Minister of Water Affairs, who uttered defamatory statements in the course of addressing a public meeting. Was he addressing this meeting in an official capacity, was it in the course of his duties, or was it as a professional politician&#x003F;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>I have already replied, in the Other Place, to the question now put by the hon. member for Simonstown. I said that responsibility was only accepted for him when he was acting in his official capacity, in matters connected with his official duties, of course. That was the case with the Minister of Community Development. If he had not been Minister of Community Development there would never have been a case for which the Government had to accept responsibility. [Interjections.] That is right. Then it had nothing to do with his official duties. That is all. It is simple, after all. I qualified it and said, &#x201C;If he commits some action or another in the performance of his official duties.&#x201D; The Minister of Water Affairs, to whom the hon. member referred, did not act in this way. He was a Minister of the State, but he was not acting in connection with his official duties. Consequently he himself is responsible for the whole action which arises from it. This is the attitude that was adopted towards him. In fact, he knew it himself. He did not even approach the Cabinet in this connection. He did not even mention it. But the test is very simple here. If the hon. the Minister had not been Minister of Community Development, if he had not negotiated with the city council in that capacity, there would not have taken place what has in fact now taken place. Therefore responsibility was accepted for him, because we feel that while he happened to be sued it might just as well have been the State.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, it is quite clear from the discussion that has taken place here that there is a difference in principle between that side of the House and this side of the House as to whether or not the State should pay for the defamatory or actionable statements of a Minister of the State. As far as we are concerned, that is a matter for the Minister personally, not a matter for the State. Sir, once the arguments which have been put forward from that side of the House are accepted, then clearly, as in the case of a State official, the State should pay the damages as well. But once one accepts that that is so, as has apparently been done here, then the State is in charge of the operation; it is for the State then to say whether the matter goes on appeal and whether it settles the matter or not. But, Sir, what happened here&#x003F; One of the most extraordinary things that I heard here this afternoon came from the hon. the Minister of Justice. What the hon. the Minister said was that the State in fact believed that the Minister should not have gone on appeal and that that was the advice of the State Attorney. Despite the fact that they say that this is a matter in which the State was involved and that the State said that they were not going on appeal, the hon. the Minister was allowed to go on a frolic of his own in respect of the same matter and to go on appeal.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>That is not the point. If the State is involved, then it is for the State to decide. Let me give one example. If a Minister is sued because one of his officials has assaulted someone, then he is obliged to pay damages; judgment is entered against the hon. the Minister and the State official then says: &#x201C;I want to go on appeal; will you allow me to go on appeal&#x003F;&#x201D; He is not the <i>dominus litus;</i> the State is in charge of those proceedings. Sir, this demonstrates a difference in principle in our approach in this regard. As the hon. member for Green Point has pointed out, this is not just a case of negligence; this is a case of defamation involving an <i>animus;</i> it involves an intention, a deliberate act, and we do not feel that this should ever be the responsibility of the State. What the hon. the Minister does about this is a matter between him and the hon. the Prime Minister and the electorate of South Africa. That has nothing to do with this issue. But, Sir, because this is a matter of principle, because we will not tolerate this when we become the Government after the next election, I wish to move&#x2014;</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>The Department of Justice has an enormous amount of matter which it has to have printed, for which it places orders with the Government Printer. Unfortunately one is faced with the position that the Government Printer is not always able to execute these orders immediately. These accounts vary a very great deal. In one year you find that he was able to fit in the work, and consequently your account is bigger; the next year you find that he was unable to fit in the work, and then there is a large decrease. Then you know that there is still a lot outstanding and you estimate in advance. In the meantime printing costs and the cost of paper increase. The first time you know how much it is going to cost is when you see the account, and you are obliged to pay the account in that year. This is what happened in this case. For this year we received accounts from the Government Printer for a larger amount than we had expected, and consequently the amount had to be increased. You simply cannot tell when the Government Printer will complete the work and submit the account.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I would like to deal with a matter under South-West Africa Vote No. 12 which is an entirely new item; it is a contribution to the Legal Aid Board for legal aid in South-West Africa, and provision is made here for the paltry sum of R20 000. The object of legal aid is, where the means of persons do not allow it, to bring within their means the ability to prosecute their rights and to defend their rights in our courts. Sir, no one has more eloquently expressed the lack of this in some respects in our country than the hon. the Minister himself earlier this week when he spoke in his constituency at Klerksdorp at the official opening of the new P. C. Pelser Building. What the hon. the Minister said was this: He talked about our legal system, and said that it could not be surpassed. With that we agree entirely, bearing in mind, of course, the few changes we shall implement when we become the Government. Then he went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nevertheless there is an aspect of concern to me and that is the question of the high cost of litigation in our superior courts. One may well ask: Who can these days afford to be involved in Supreme Court litigation&#x003F; It is basic to our system that every inhabitant should have the right to go to court in order to settle a dispute with an adversary and that the doors of the courts should be open to all. Has the situation not developed that the ordinary citizen cannot afford to go to court and that litigation in the high courts is a luxury open to a privileged few such as the big financial institutions or companies (or Cabinet Ministers) &#x2026;</block>

<p>The words in parenthesis are mine and not those of the hon. the Minister&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_2369-2370" refersTo="page_1202"/>Our law has become inaccessible to the majority. To argue that high cost serves as a deterrent to litigation is therefore unwholesome &#x2026;</block>

<p>I agree with that last part. Sir, that is so. As the hon. the Minister has pointed out, this is not the first time this topic has been raised. We had the Van Winsen Commission which looked into the matter of the uniform rules of court and the high cost of litigation. However, that is what the hon. the Minister said then, at Klerksdorp. But, having regard to this paltry amount which we now find in these Estimates for legal aid, it is interesting to note what he went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The thought has occurred to me that the time may be opportune to overcome this problem by increasing the civil jurisdiction of the magistrates&#x2019; courts and to confer civil jurisdiction also on regional magistrates&#x2019; courts.</block>

<p>Then he went on to motivate this. The way to bring within the reach of every citizen the ability to prosecute or to defend his rights in court is through the medium of legal aid. That is the way to do it. We have said throughout that the amounts the Government has been appropriating in respect of legal aid are hopelessly inadequate. The hon. the Minister said: &#x201C;No, no, let us wait and see&#x201D;. Fifty thousand rand was the first amount appropriated for the Republic. This builds up to R250 000 and, today, on Vote 26, we see that an additional R100 000 has to be voted for this purpose. Sir, if we are going to do this job properly we have to expend more money. I venture to say that the way to do it is not the way in which the hon. the Minister intends doing it, namely to fiddle with our proven legal system, which, as he has said, has no peer and no better in this world. We must not fiddle with that system by giving increased civil jurisdiction to the regional magistrates&#x2019; courts. The way to do it is to increase the amount in respect of legal aid. Then you do not have to fiddle with the system. The hon. the Minister said in the course of this speech that the number of Supreme Court judges who were appointed as a result of the increased civil litigation was reaching proportions which had to be stopped. But if he is going to give regional courts civil jurisdiction in excess of that of the magistrates&#x2019; courts, but less, obviously, than that of the</p>

<p>Supreme Court, then he is going to have to employ more regional magistrates. This is obvious. In other words, we shall have to employ people to do this work, whether they are magistrates or whether they are judges. May I say to the hon. the Minister that if that is so, why try to fiddle with this system&#x003F; Why not, if it is necessary, appoint more judges&#x003F; Surely the cost in salaries cannot be a factor&#x003F; If you have to choose, obviously you should have a judge appointed, in our tradition, and not a regional magistrate. Let me say at once, and let me make it quite clear, that the regional magistrates have done a marvellous job of work. They have taken on a great deal of work which in the old days was normally done by the Supreme Court. They have taken on cases which could not come before magistrates&#x2019; courts. We need only look at the number of rape cases, for example, that are dealt with by the regional courts, which are marvellously done. These are not ordinary men, Sir; these are persons who have completed the Higher Civil Service Law examination, or who have an Ll.B. They have to have ten years&#x2019; experience as a magistrate before they are appointed to the regional Bench. They are men of experience, and they have done a very good job. But I want to say that this is neither fair to the litigant, nor is it fair to the regional magistrate, whose experience is almost entirely criminal. They are appointed, when they become magistrates, from among the ranks of the prosecutors, who are prosecuting in the criminal courts. They then become magistrates, and their experience is overwhelmingly of criminal work. Then they become regional magistrates, after ten years of criminal experience. But they have no training or experience in the civil law and it is not fair to the public and it is not fair to them, and you are not going to save the cost of litigation by increasing their jurisdiction and encouraging litigants to go to the regional court. For one thing, Sir, I venture to suggest that you may have many more successful appeals than you had before, for the reason that that is not their experience. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister will not at some time give consideration to the appointment of some sort of <i>ad hoc,</i> if you like, but intermediate court like a county court in Great Britain, where you employ an advocate of standing, of ten years standing if you like, to sit in those courts and to adjudicate upon those civil matters. That is their experience. 80 per cent of <span class="col_2371-2372" refersTo="page_1203"/>advocates gain their experience in the civil law. It is not something you pick up through a law degree or something you pick up anywhere else than through experience of life in the courts. That is what I would like the hon. the Minister to indicate to us. What is his approach in this regard&#x003F; R20 000 for legal aid is just playing with the subject, and it is not even paying for the staff. It might just be a start there. I do not know. But it can do very little else. And this is an important matter. Legal aid can be as important to a person as medical aid can be. If he is denied legal aid, if he is denied legal access to the courts, you deny his very existence in some cases. R20 000 is playing with the subject, and I hope the Minister will indicate that he will try at least to get his priorities right not only in respect of money but his priorities in respect also of the nature of the relief which is to be given to John Citizen.</p>

<p>It is a very interesting speech and a very interesting plea which the hon. member made, but I do not know what on earth it has to do with the question of legal aid in South-West Africa. These are legal aid moneys which are spent in accordance with court decisions which have been given and which laid down certain rules in terms of a hint I gave the department. His speech would have been interesting at an appropriate time, but most certainly not under these circumstances. If the hon. member wants to know why this amount is only R20 000, I want to make the following point. The Legal Aid Act was made applicable to South-West Africa only last year.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is why the amount is so small at this stage. When I made available R150 000 in the first case, the Legal Aid Board had not even decided what their guide-lines would be. They said they were not going to have everyone defended; we conducted a debate on that and at the appropriate time, the next year, I told them there was still some money available. When we asked for only R50 000 for the whole of the Republic the following year, the hon. member also objected, and I told him that there was some accumulated money and that the Legal Aid Board was not functioning yet. There is enough money, also in my main Estimate for next year, in which we are asking an additional amount for them in respect of the Republic. The position there is that we now have an indication of what we shall need. I may just tell the hon. member that we have not yet received accounts that we could not pay from the amounts available. The reason why the amount for South-West Africa is so small is simply that the scheme has only just recently been made applicable there. This being the case, we do not need any more, and in the light of our experience we do not think we shall need more than R20 000.</p>

<p>No, this is an increase. The reclamation plant is being erected there. As I told the hon. member, the increase is due mainly to the late execution of orders for expensive capital equipment. The order was placed in 1970-&#x2019;71, but was only executed in the present financial year. In other words, provision was made for the equipment, but it was not delivered. Therefore, as the hon. member knows, provision must again be made for it.</p>

<p>This amount is made up of four items: The first is the late delivery of X-ray apparatus for the new building in Johannesburg. Here the same circumstances apply as those in regard to the previous sub-head. The apparatus was to have been delivered in 1970-&#x2019;71 but is available only now. The amount involved in this is R55 000. The second item is the increase in the price of X-ray material and the maintenance of the equipment. This amounts to R17 000. The third item the hon. member will understand, is the increase in tariffs levied by the South African Institute for Medical Research and the fact that more mines have been declared controlled mines with the result that a larger number of tests are done. The amount in respect of this is R13 000. In addition there is the financing of the C Accounts, the Government account, with regard to pneumoconiosis compensation which amounts to R700 000. This account has had to be supplemented because, as the hon. member knows, since 1st April last year there have been increased benefits for widows and the equalization as a result of the amending legislation we passed here. The reason for paying in that amount of R700 000 is to make provision in the account for the payment of those benefits without its being necessary for us to convert the investment of the funds at a loss of interest, etc.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in respect of this item there is an increase of R340 000 which is made up as follows: Firstly, there is the increase in royalties paid which amounts to R10 800. In respect of the housing loan scheme there is an amount of R200. Postal services, as in all other cases, amounted to R11 000, advertisements to R5 000, insurance to R5 000 and the research fund contribution&#x2014;these are salaries and I shall come to them in a moment&#x2014;to R424 400, and the contribution to the International Atomic Energy Agency to an additional amount of R5 600. These amounts total R462 000. However, there were savings on administration, printing, general, and the purchase of isotopes, which savings reduce the net increase to R340 000. The amount I have mentioned in connection with the research fund contribution represents the largest increase here and this was caused by insufficient provision for salary adjustments, which became effective on 1st January, 1971, in respect of research staff. Unfortunately the full implications of these adjustments first revealed themselves during February, 1971, i.e. after the estimates had been approved provisionally. Unfortunately I cannot give the hon. member the number of research staff concerned in this matter, because the hon. member will realize <span class="col_2377-2378" refersTo="page_1206"/>that as far as the Atomic Energy Board is concerned, one would not like to reveal this figure.</p>

<p>In item L of Vote No. 28 and in Loan Vote Q provision is made for additional sums to be spent on the uranium research fund. This fund, as is well known to this House, has to do with the uranium enrichment complex. We are aware that at the time legislation was passed, provision was made for an ultimate expenditure of something of the order of R50 million and I presume that the amount of money now voted by way of share capital is a portion of that total contribution by the State in the form of a purchase of shares in the Uranium Enrichment Corporation. We have been concerned for some time as to the manner and justification of this expenditure. We are concerned that while the technique which has been developed is undoubtedly a unique and successful one, the economics of this process remain to be proved. We are asked here to vote a very large sum of money towards this process and this comes at a time when we find doubts apparently arising from no less a quarter than the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs. In <i>Nuclear Active,</i> a journal published by the Atomic Energy Board, there is an article by Dr. Muller which purports to deal with the economic factor in the uranium enrichment process in South Africa, and elsewhere. He has the following to say:</p>

<block name="quote">Individual national achievement alone is not sufficient. The world is a community of nations and co-operative progress is the goal &#x2026;</block>

<p>Then he concludes:</p>

<block name="quote">Economic factors remain of prime importance and can provide the nucleus of yet another multi-national effort.</block>

<p>Now, Sir, the implication of this article which, as I say, comes from the Minister of Foreign Affairs, not from the Minister of Mines, appears to be an appeal for economic considerations&#x2014;that is the title of the article&#x2014;for economic factors to be taken into account; and to prepare our minds for the possibility that this enrichment plant, which is now in its pilot plant building stage near Pretoria, should become the object of international co-operation. Well, I am not saying that it is wrong, but if it becomes the object of international co-operation, we will obviously have to revise our financial outlook. We will have to take a new look at this matter as regards the payment for this most expensive project. Now we have here Vote No. 28 a portion of which amount is to be devoted to the Uranium Research Fund, and under Loan Vote Q, an increase of R6 399 000 over the initial R13 000 000 estimated last year. These amounts have to be devoted in the face of a very recent apparent change of policy. I would be grateful if the hon. the Minister would explain whether there is indeed a basic change of policy in their approach; and whether in view of the economic factor, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs suggests, it will now be necessary to enter into some kind of international co-operative arrangement in order to implement this enrichment project.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member is quite correct in saying that this amount of R7 million is for the share capital of the Uranium Enrichment Corporation. The original estimate was R13 million, but you will realize that two factors are of major importance here. The one is that there are so many unknown factors at such a new plant that it was very difficult to make a correct estimate. The other factor is&#x2014;and this I think hon. members will be pleased to hear&#x2014;that very good progress has been made both as regards the building of the pilot plant and as regards material and equipment required. However, the hon. member&#x2019;s interpretation of that article by my hon. colleague, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, is wrong. There is no change in policy, no change in policy whatsoever. We must draw a clear distinction between the pilot plant and the use of this unique process in a large-scale plant or plants eventually. At the time of the announcement of the hon. the Prime Minister it was indicated very clearly, as I have repeatedly done since that time, that the pilot plant had a maximum capital in terms of the Act of R50 million. Whether the full amount will be used is a different matter altogether. The State accepts full <span class="col_2379-2380" refersTo="page_1207"/>responsibility for the pilot plant. The prospect was never held out of the State wishing to share the pilot plant with other countries. The article by my hon. colleague refers to the other aspect covered by the hon. the Prime Minister in his statement, i.e. that we are prepared to share this unique process and that we shall welcome participation, financially and otherwise, on certain conditions from the non-communistic countries which may be interested. This is the only point made by my colleague in that article, i.e. the desire of South Africa to co-operate with non-communistic countries in this matter. But he was not referring to the pilot plant. In other words, it does not refer to this additional share capital of R7 million either. I do not think I should say more than this.</p>

It is perfectly understandable that if more rapid progress than that anticipated has been made with the building of this plant, this additional money will be required. In brief I just want to draw attention to the fact that Dr. Muller quite rightly made a point of the importance of the economic factor. We accept that the basic technical problem has perhaps been solved. The economic factor still remains the criterion. It will be the decisive factor and where more money is to be spent on this plant, we welcome the fact that the Minister will always take it into account. As for the rest, we have no objection to this appropriation.</p>

Are any new mines being involved in the assistance the Government is giving or is this an increased amount for the mines that are already receiving help&#x003F; Is this help being used primarily for the pumping of water&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>May I just indicate to hon. members that this increase of R300 000 is on a total of approximately R17 million. In other words, this was a reasonably accurate calculation. Secondly, it is a statutory obligation which rests on us to render assistance to these mines according to a very complicated formula, as you yourself know. The amount of R300 000 is made up of two parts. The first part is an additional amount of R66 000 which is required because of an incorrect calculation made on the basis of this complicated formula with regard to the mines to which we are already rendering assistance. The second factor is the fact that the two mines on the East Rand, South African Lands and Vlakfontein, were flooded after the heavy rains we had, and that they are pumping water from those mines at the moment hoping to save the mines. This involves an amount at present estimated at R234 000. Together with the amount of R66 000 this makes up the amount of R300 000.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there is a great increase in the original estimate, an increase of over R2 000 000 required for medical poor relief. I wonder if the hon. the Minister would be good enough to enlarge upon the reasons for this vast increase in the original estimates.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member is quite correct in saying that this is a very large increase. But, Sir, I should like to mention to you the various factors which influence this. Firstly, he knows, and I sincerely regret that this is so, that many posts for district surgeons are vacant. In other words, we simply cannot find the people. These services are provided by private medical practitioners at present. Private medical practitioners, of course, provide these services at the ordinary tariffs laid down by the Compensation Commission. Secondly, the medicines prescribed by them are obtained on prescription, which inevitably is considerably more expensive than when such medicines are supplied by a full-time district surgeon who works for a salary.</p>

<p><span class="col_2381-2382" refersTo="page_1208"/>The next aspect is that according to statistics we have received from the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions, statistics which influence this matter, the number of people in receipt of civil pensions who lay claim to these services has inevitably shown a tremendous increase over the years. The figure I can give to hon. members is that there were no fewer than 160 719 on 31st July, 1971. Now, as the hon. member will also know an arrangement was made&#x2014;I think it was last year or the year before&#x2014;for the convenience of these pensioners to obtain these services on the production of their pension books. We foresaw that this service would be used on a larger scale, but we never realized that it would be used on this scale. This is the one aspect responsible for this. Of the R2 million the estimated amount to be voted for this is R1 900 000. In the second place there is an increase in the utilization of the family planning services of the department. I think all of us would welcome this accelerated attempt for all population groups. Our estimate in this connection was too conservative altogether. I think one of the major reasons is that the department has made a real attempt to encourage family planning amongst the various peoples, but also because certain contraceptives, apart from the pill and the injections, have become available to us in recent times, as the hon. member knows, ones which are popular but expensive. We have made further arrangements, which are working well at the moment, to have these contraceptives available at all times at the various points&#x2014;mostly at clinics, hospitals, etc. It is of no avail to apply family planning if the contraceptives are not available at all times. So as to have the contraceptives available at all times, we must carry certain stocks which we did not carry before. These are the principal reasons for this reasonably large increase in the amount.</p>

The chemist, of course, has no authority. He must dispense the prescription handed to him. That is the first point. The second point is that we did in fact take steps to impress upon district surgeons who prescribe medicines on prescription that the expenditure was tremendously high. How did we do that&#x003F; Circulars were sent to these people, circulars I had seen to personally. Secondly, we have in our department a directorate which deals with this, and the members of this directorate go from place to place, especially to places where problems have cropped up, where there has been over-prescribing, as the hon. member calls it.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>The additional provision is necessary to finance the payment of compensation for expropriated property in urban renewal projects. As you know, quite some time ago there were a large number of cases that were referred to arbitration, and since several decisions were recently given by the arbitration courts, the Department has no choice but to pay the compensation. For the rest, there is a general tendency, on account of the present economic climate, to settle for realistic amounts, and so far for even lower amounts than the market value. This means that claims which would only have been payable during subsequent financial years have to be paid forthwith. As a result the provision on the Estimates is insufficient and at least R5 million is required in order to meet the commitments. However, the department is able to apply R500 000 out of savings towards State housing, and consequently the amount has been put at R4,5 million. I may just say that this is also the case in connection with District Six, where negotiations in respect of the price determinations of the properties expropriated by the Community Development Board in District Six proceeded very slowly because owners would not accept what they were offered. They are now accepting the offers to an increasing extent, and more and more arbitration cases are being decided, and that is why we are obliged to request this additional amount.</p>

The Department of Defence told us that they are very interested in getting hold of this hotel for quarters for unmarried people. I believe, according to the Department of Defence that it is very suitable for single quarters for the Department of Defence. They asked us to buy this hotel for single quarters for the Department of Defence.

<p>The amount now requested in respect of the purchase of land represents the purchase price of 73 plots in Windhoek. Immediately after re-adjustment, the Department started negotiations with the City Council of Windhoek for the purchase of the necessary plots. The Works Division of the South-West Africa Administration conducted the negotiations with the City Council on behalf of the department. Initially only 45 plots were allotted to the department, but since these did not meet the needs, 18 and subsequently 10 more plots were allotted after further negotiations. The first 45 plots were expected to be transferred early in the 1970-&#x2019;71 financial year, in which case there would have been no problems in connection with funds. However, the plots were only transferred late in March, 1971, and early in April, 1971, and notice of the registration was sent to the South-West Africa Administration, from where it was sent through to this department in April, 1971. As a result it was not possible to pay anything during the 1970-&#x2019;71 financial year and the department was obliged to pay everything in the 1971-&#x2019;72 financial year.</p>

<p>On Vote 32, Public Works, there are two items which I want to raise with the hon. the Minister. The one is financial assistance to the Board of Control of the Huguenot Monument, which has gone up by R5 000. Is that to be a recurring increased subsistence grant or is it just one payment which is required&#x003F; The second question is to ask the Minister similarly to explain the assistance to the Public Service Association in respect of the restaurant in the Hendrik Verwoerd Building, an amount of R10 000 being provided for that.</p>

<p>I should like to ask the Minister for more information under Loan Vote B, on page 37. I take it the hon. the Minister wants to reply to the hon. member for Green Point first.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_public_works">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. All my notes are now in Afrikaans, and I hope hon. members do not mind. The provision to the Huguenot Monument Board of Control is for the purpose of putting up a fence round the monument. Originally the Board applied in September, 1970, for financial assistance to the amount of R11 120 for the erection of a granite ring-wall around the wall. The Treasury only approved an amount of R5 000, which was sufficient. After further representations the Treasury approved that a further concession of R5 000 be placed on the Additional Estimates for 1971-&#x2019;72. Subsequently the Board decided that the iron trellis fence, instead of a granite ring-wall, would fit in better with the existing trellis-work which forms part of the fencing, and that it would be more effective and cheaper and would also go further as regards fencing in the grounds as a whole. However, it has now become apparent that the costs will amount to considerably less than R10 000. At this stage, however, the actual cost is not available.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member can therefore see that these will not be recurring items. They are individual items which will not recur.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member asked a question in regard to assistance to the Association of Civil Servants running the restaurant in the H. F. Verwoerd Building. This organization is running restaurants for civil servants all over the Republic of South Africa. They have restaurants in the Union Buildings, at Onderstepoort, in the Department of Labour building in Pretoria and in the provincial administration building in Cape Town. In some instances they do make profits while in others they show losses. They were willing to run this restaurant on condition that we guaranteed their loss. That is why this amount was voted.</p>

<p>I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he will now deal with item J in respect of the increase in rent, rates, etc., of R1 274 000.

<p>I can furnish the hon. member with certain figures. New leases which, in the public interest, could not be postponed, amounted to R300 000. Increases in existing rentals amounted to R261 000. The consequences of devaluation and revaluation for a period of four months at an average of R15 000 per month, amounted to R60 000. Then there were increased rates to the amount of R13 000. Increased municipal rates and increases in consumption amounted to R620 000. The abnormally cold weather in the Cape and the additional consumption of electric current were responsible for R20 000. These amount to a total of R1 274 000.</p>

<p>It appears under sub-head (14)&#x2014;&#x201C;National Education&#x201D;, in the paragraph entitled &#x201C;New Service&#x201D;. It involves an amount of R24 000. Hon. members know that the open-air school is a special school and that it provides special education, which was previously under the Provincial Administration of Natal. It now falls under the Department of National Education. I would like the hon. the Minister to indicate how the amount of R24 000 was arrived at as a basis of compensation for the buildings. I would also like the hon. the Minister to indicate whether the buildings included the hostel facilities, which are in a separate portion and which stand separately from the rest of the school. The amount which appears here, an amount of R24 000, seems to be a very low sum indeed, the note at the bottom of the page indicates that the total cost is estimated to be R24 000.</p>

<p>The other item in regard to which I would like the hon. the Minister to give me further information appears on page 38. It involves a new service for the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions. I refer to the amount of R20 000 that is to be voted by the Committee for the accommodation for drug dependants at Cullinan. This new item is one in respect of which the estimated cost indicated at the foot of the page will be R130 000. This will be for the benefit of White drug dependants who will receive treatment there. It falls under the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions. I would like the hon. the Minister to give us more details concerning this building. Firstly, he must tell us how many drug dependants this building has been designed to accommodate. Secondly, he must give us some indication as to the expected date of completion of this particular establishment and this particular building. The overall amount to be spent now is R60 000 which appears to be approximately half the total estimated cost of R130 000. Of the estimated R60 000, R40 000 will be met by savings on other services. I hope that the Minister will be able to give us more detailed information in regard to the building and the establishment of this accommodation of drug dependants.</p>

<p>Concerning the Durban open-air school.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>When this school was taken over by the Department of National Education on the 1st April, 1969, in terms of Act 41 of 1967, there was still certain building work which had to be completed by the Natal Provincial Administration. The total cost of this work amounted to R23 933,30. The Natal Provincial Administration has now applied for a refund of the amount and has submitted an audited statement in support of its claims. In terms of section 6 (2) (e) of the Act, the Central Government must accept debit for this expenditure. Treasury approval has therefore been obtained to include this item in these Estimates to enable the Department to defray the relevant claim without delay.</p>

<p>I do not know whether I can answer the other questions. My difficulty is that they fall in the purview of another department. I do not have the knowledge concerning the building and its size, etc.</p>

<p>As far as Loan Vote B: sub-head (18), Social Welfare and Pensions, is concerned, I can say the following: The abuse of drugs in the Republic is reaching alarming proportions. Hence the passing of the Abuse of Dependence-producing Substances and Rehabilitation Centres Act, 1971. It will, however, not be possible to implement this Act until the minimum requirements for the treatment of drug dependence have been met. As the first step, the existing retreat for the men and women at Cullinan, which was erected in terms of the Retreats and Rehabilitation Centres Act, is being enlarged to accommodate these drug dependants. These institutions lend themselves to the proposed extension as an efficient kitchen and hospital facilities are available for additional patients. Additional sleeping accommodation also has to be provided. The cost of this service is estimated at R150 000. As this was a matter of national importance which could not be delayed, a special warrant was obtained to enable the Minister of Public Works to arrange for the erection and accommodation without delay.</p>

<p>About the Jan Smuts Airport and the new building at Pretoria.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>As far as the Jan Smuts Airport is concerned, I can give the hon. member the following information: In February, 1969, the Department of Transport reported that it had been decided that the date on which the Boeing-747 passenger aircraft were to be put into operation, would be advanced to October, 1971. The Department of Public Works was therefore obliged to make special arrangements <span class="col_2393-2394" refersTo="page_1214"/>for having the eastern boundary wing ready in good time. Tender Board approval was obtained for negotiating with the contractors for the non-White concourse to erect the accommodation at schedule tariffs plus a percentage to cover the increase in building costs in the meantime. No allocation or particulars in respect of trimmings, fittings, etc., are available, and the costs of the work in question were based only on particulars in respect of accommodation which were fixed at approximately R10 million. Working drawings were, as they were completed, handed to the contractor one by one. It was only in May, 1971, when the building had reached an advanced stage of construction and the allocation of all the fittings was available, that it was possible to survey the whole service thoroughly and to prepare a reliable estimate of the final cost of the building, which amounts to R14 million. When the estimates of the expenditure under Loan Vote B for the year 1971-&#x2019;72 were prepared during December, 1970, provision for the expenditure on the eastern boundary wing was based on the then estimated cost of R10 million. The amount voted at the time is quite inadequate at the moment. In December, 1971, the building was partly completed and occupied, and it is expected that the additional amount of R3 582 000 will have to be paid until 31st March, 1972. Since there are no savings on other sub-heads under Loan Vote B which may be used for meeting the excess expenditure on this service, additional funds are now requested. I think this will give the hon. member all the information he wanted to have. In any case, other than this I do not have any further information.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, it will not be reflected here. This is only the additional amount requested.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Green Point asked me about the new building of the Department of the Interior and whether this amount includes the cost of the new sculpture. The answer is &#x201C;yes&#x201D;. The plans for the erection of the sculpture are going ahead. During 1970-&#x2019;71 the building industry had to contend with serious shortages of labour and certain materials with the result that progress with the erection of the project was generally slower than had been expected. This resulted in the surrender of funds under Loan Vote B at the close of that financial year. During 1971-&#x2019;72 the position eased considerably as far as the supply of materials is concerned and there has been a general quickening in the tempo of construction by contractors, especially on the larger projects. This is also attributable to the need to complete the services within the contract period to avoid penalties and the financial climate prevailing in the building industry during this financial year. Owing to the curtailment of Capital Expenditure by the State and the general scarcity of funds in the Republic contractors have, as a result of the growth of new services, concentrated their labour forces and services on projects already under construction. This resulted in a much higher expenditure on certain large projects during the current financial year than had been expected when the Estimates of 1971-&#x2019;72 were framed in December, 1970. One of the services affected by the foregoing is the new building of the Department of the Interior in Pretoria and as funds are not available from savings and other services on Loan Vote B, this additional appropriation is necessary.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, just in passing I would like to express the appreciation of many people in South Africa that the Minister has not been persuaded by the criticism of old women of both sexes in regard to artistic works and sculpture intended for the building of the Department of the Interior in Pretoria and elsewhere. It is very rarely that I have occasion to express a word of appreciation, but I think I can do so in this case. However, the point I wish to raise is in connection with the Jan Smuts Airport.</p>

<p><span class="col_2395-2396" refersTo="page_1215"/>*Here an additional amount of R3&#x00BD; million is required until 31st March, 1972. In other words, this additional R3&#x00BD; million will already have been spent on these extensions at the Jan Smuts Airport by the end of this month. Last Sunday I was a passenger on the Boeing 747 to Johannesburg, and if the near chaos that prevailed there in regard to the discharge of passengers at the airport&#x2014;not only local passengers, but also through passengers en route to London&#x2014;is all we are going to get for this R3&#x00BD; million, then it is absolutely inadequate. The time will come when there will not only be one &#x201C;Jumbo&#x201D; at the Jan Smuts Airport, but three, four or five. Then 1 500 up to 2 000 people will have to pass through immigration, passport and the ordinary controls. In my case it would have been possible for me to rent a car and to make two important telephone calls first, and upon my return my luggage would still not have been there. A tremendous amount of delay is taking place, and I hope that the hon. the Minister will at least see to it that when these large amounts are requested, they will definitely be used for the benefit of passengers. The hon. the Minister will tell me that the Minister of Transport is not here, but, in that case, why is he not here&#x003F; Why is the Deputy Minister not here to explain to us why, whilst an amount of R3&#x00BD; million is being requested&#x2014;an amount which will have been spent by the end of this month &#x2014;the facilities at the Jan Smuts Airport are still so poor&#x003F;</p>

In the first place, I want to ask what the individual, total cost of the sculpture as such will be, and, in the second place, whether the hon. the Minister does not feel that the public in general would be more prepared to accept the sculpture if a solitary leaf (blaar) could be sculptured somewhere in the midst of all those naked figures!</p>

<p>Sir, you will recall that last year we published a white paper on decentralization. That was fairly late in the session. In that white paper provision was made for donations to industries which are removed, in order to compensate them for direct losses as a result of the dismantling and removal of their factories and the transfer of the factories and staff. I should like to read the hon. member the relevant part from the white paper. It is paragraph 68 (a) of the white paper. In fact, its operation is further set out in paragraphs 74 and 75, as well as paragraph 89 (a) of the white paper. But I think the only part which is really relevant, is paragraph 68 (a). It reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government aims to offer concessions to industrialists which will be adequate to cover their calculable net cost disabilities at a decentralized centre, plus some additional concessions in respect of non-calculable cost disabilities. The concessions will be granted in one or more of the following forms&#x2014;</block>

<block name="quote">This is the only relevant part of this paragraph&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) a cash grant to reimburse the industrialist for his immediate and direct costs in connection with the physical removal of his factory and personnel.

<p>I do not think I can say much more than this, except to add that this is in fact a new item. However, we can meet this from <span class="col_2399-2400" refersTo="page_1217"/>savings, and therefore provision is only being made for the nominal amount of R50.</p>

<p>Yes, it is the additional appropriation. This is an amount for which shares are being purchased from the I.D.C. by the Government; but in actual fact it is only intended to finance the I.D.C. to do other things. That is why the shares are being purchased from the I.D.C. in this way. This amount of R3 549 000 actually consists of two parts, if I may explain it to the Committee. The first part is for the development of industries in border and other less developed areas. This is an amount of R2 540 000, in other words, R1 million less than the total amount being provided here. Of course, from time to time sums of money are made available to the I.D.C., in most cases by way of loans, to encourage and to help to finance decentralization to the border areas and other developing areas. If the hon. member wants me to, I shall explain how it has come about that this additional amount is being requested. If the hon. member does not require that, I shall proceed to the next R1 million. This R1 million is for the development of South-West Africa; it is for the hydro-electric scheme on the Kunene River. Last year an amount was provided for this, but it was found that that amount fell short by R1 million, and consequently this amount of R1 million has to be provided for the scheme in the north of South-West Africa. The total amount is R3 549 000.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>No, the State&#x2019;s final commitments in respect of this scheme is much more than the amount provided under this Vote. An amount of R2 711 000 is being provided now, and this seems strange because an amount of only R139 000 was originally voted under this head. Briefly, the reasons for this are the following: Sir, you are no doubt aware of the fact that a consortium, i.e. the ZAMCO consortium, was established there, for the building of the dam, the hydro-electric power station below the dam wall and the power lines leading from there. In addition, the power line has to be taken further from the Limpopo River to the Apollo power station at Irene near Pretoria. Be that as it may, briefly this is more or less the entire system for which a consortium has been created. There is, <i>inter alia,</i> a company by the name of Power Lines with which a contract was entered into for the building of the power line from the Limpopo to the Apollo power station near Pretoria. These companies have, for various reasons, come to the conclusion that they would rather commence with the work earlier than originally planned, since particularly severe penalties have been imposed for late completion of the work. This applies to two phases of this undertaking, but I should not like to go into the details at this stage. Because they started with operations earlier in order to ensure that they will be able to finish within the prescribed time so that they will not be subject to the payment of any penalties, there are now financial commitments to them which have to be met earlier, and an amount of R2 711 000 will have to be voted for this year up to the end of March. Sir, I cannot say off-hand what the full and final commitment in respect of Cabora Bassa will be, but I can tell the hon. member that an amount of R14,4 million will have to be voted in respect of the Cabora Bassa scheme in the Estimates of next year.</p>

<p>No, not really. It would appear to me that in the light of the circumstances, this amount was merely underestimated. The reply is that this item was underestimated last year; that is what it amounts to, and therefore it is necessary for us to make provision here for an additional amount of R33 000. This subhead makes provision for the maintenance of persons in custody prior to their being tried, and also for mental patients detained in police care. All I can say is that the amount was underestimated last year. It appears that the costs involved are much more than was estimated originally.</p>

<p>I shall be glad to have details.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_police">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POLICE</person>:</from>

<p>As hon. members may appreciate, this is a difficult amount to estimate in advance, since one is never sure of what is going to happen, especially in dealing with a large force such as the South African Police, which consists of approximately 35 000 members. In this case the main reason for the increase is the rise in medical expenses: hospital expenses, part-time district surgeons, specialists, etc. The increase under this subhead is R725 000. I should like to sub-divide this amount for the benefit of hon. members. Provision is made for an additional amount of R500 000 for medicine, drugs, hospital expenses, supplies, etc. Let me deal with these first. This increase of R500 000 is attributable to increased medical expenses. Half the increase is probably attributable to the fact that during the past year the Force was enlarged substantially. I may just add, Sir, since I may not have the opportunity of saying this later on, that we have had a very successful year as far as recruitment is concerned. At the moment the number of vacancies in the Police is much lower than it was last year. As a result the numerical strength of the South African Police has been enhanced, and as the numerical strength is enhanced, one may, of course, expect the medical expenses to increase too. These arguments which I have now advanced, also hold good for an additional amount of R198 000 in respect of medical services and dentists. Then there is another additional amount of R27 000&#x2014;Contributions to Medical Funds. In that regard the explanation is the same as the one given here by the Minister of Defence. Hon. members on that side will recall that we received many representations from members of the Police Force who retired prior to 1st January, 1964. A medical fund was established for ex-members of the South African Police Force who retired prior to 1st January, 1964, and subsequently, after the numerous representations we received, we established another fund, which we call the B Fund, for ex-members who retired prior to 1st January, 1964. As this Fund will be very expensive to those who are members of it, the Treasury was approached and the Minister of Finance was kind enough to grant us a contribution towards the maintenance of this Fund, and that contribution amounts to R27 000 for the current year.</p>

<p>It is as a result of the exceptional extension of works owing to the drought. As the hon. member will know, on account of the drought in the past few years it was arranged that private boring machines were allowed to do work for the department to augment the department&#x2019;s own machines. As a result of that the amount allowed in the previous year was exceeded by R1 million.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_water_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>No, we regard waterworks, the minor waterworks, as consisting of two parts, i.e. boring operations and minor waterworks. The amount has actually been divided into two. They are more or less equal, and approximately R500 000 of the amount is supplementary to those boring operations which were approved in the past and which have been carried out in the meantime and have now come up for the payment of subsidies. This also goes towards the minor waterworks. But because the increase was such a tremendous one as a result of the drought, the amount that had been voted, was exceeded considerably and therefore we have to approach the House now. I may also tell the hon. member that this is because of two things we did. On the one hand we allowed private drillers to operate as well, and you can appreciate, Sir, that the farmers availed themselves of this opportunity rather than waiting for the drillers of the department itself, but also because we gave special instructions to the effect that our own engineers had to grant approval, on the spot, for minor waterworks, for the very purpose of disposing of them more rapidly, and therefore the rate at which they are completed has increased to such an extent in recent times that we have to augment it in this manner. If we do not do this now, it would simply mean that we would have to carry it over to the next year, which would mean that for the coming year we would have less to make available in respect of minor waterworks.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Under Vote No. 39 there are substantial increases under two headings. First of all there are the contributions to the pension and provident funds where an amount is required of R3 075 000, which is merely indicated as being under &#x201C;General&#x201D;. I would appreciate it if the hon. the Minister would give us some information in regard to the necessity for this additional R3 million. Under the same heading contributions to pension funds and provident funds, there are two new items. The first one is a special contribution to the Contingency Account of the Government Employees Provident Fund, amounting to R150 000. I will be pleased if the Minister could give an indication as to why it has become necessary for this special contribution to be made to this fund and whether he will give some indication as to the number of persons affected in terms of this fund.</p>

<p>The second item is also a new item, the amount of over R2&#x00BD; million which deals with the arrear contributions of members of pension funds. Here I will be pleased if the hon. the Minister could give some indication as to how this necessity arose, whereby these arrear contributions have to be paid and which funds are involved in regard to these arrear contributions, and the members of these funds who are now required to see that arrear contributions are made on behalf of the State.</p>

<p>The last item deals with the care of the aged and infirm, where there is an additional amount of R804 000. I shall be pleased if the hon. the Minister could give an indication as to why this increase has come about.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_social_welfare_and_pensions">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>The reasons for <span class="col_2405-2406" refersTo="page_1220"/>the increase in the first case are as follows. As a result of the new salary scales for White public servants which came into effect as from 1st January, 1971, the employer&#x2019;s contribution contributed by the State to the funds of the people, automatically increased. Initially it was impossible to estimate what the full exact amount of the increase would be. The current expenditure showed that the provision had been estimated too low and that additional money was needed, firstly, for supplementing those funds. Secondly, on 1st October, 1971, higher salaries for non-White public servants, employees of the State, were announced as well. Therefore there was no provision for them in the normal Budget, because these came into effect as from 1st October only, and the employer&#x2019;s contributions were increased to date as well and had to be added to that. This is how that amount of R3 million is made up.</p>

<p>In respect of the Contingency Account, the position is very clear. This account affects approximately 13 000 employees. Actuarially it was calculated that that fund was not sound enough and that an additional amount should be paid into it. The actuaries recommended this amount and we have accepted it at that figure in order to keep the fund on a sound footing.</p>

<p>Then there is the further question of the arrear contributions of members&#x2019; pension moneys. As the hon. member may know, the possibility exists in the Public Service for an official to buy back his period of service up to his eighteenth year for pension purposes. This is an attempt to afford our officials more opportunities of building up a better pension for themselves, which at the same time is to the benefit of the State, so that the employees may retire on a good pension and need not be a burden on the State. The position is that numerous officials bought their pensions back up to their eighteenth year. In certain cases it may happen that such an official owes an amount of R5 000 or R6 000 in order to buy his pension rights up to that time. Initially we arranged for small monthly deductions to be made in respect of the officials so as to enable them to make payments over a period of 10 to 14 years. But the problem has arisen now that one does not have control over all the officials in the various departments. All the officials are not from our department, but are spread throughout the country and it requires a tremendous amount of administrative work to check whether each one&#x2019;s payment is made every month. The Treasury found it practicable, and we obtained the approval of the Treasury, to pay in the full amount for all arrear debts which would be outstanding on 31st March, 1972, in one lump sum, and the Treasury now deducts directly from the salary payments of each official, whereupon the money is paid into the current revenue fund. This is being done for administrative purposes, to the benefit of the officials and to the benefit of the funds and in order to facilitate the administration.</p>

<p>The hon. member also put a question in regard to the last item, i.e. the amount of R804 000 for the aged. There are three main reasons for this. In the first place, we had a considerable number of settler tenants on settlements, while the ideal situation is to have settlers and not tenants. Consequently we replaced the settler-tenants with settlers, and in this way we lost R8 per month in the form of rent because we had to help other people who were more needy. This brought about a loss of revenue for us. Furthermore, we provided electricity at two of the settlements, namely at Ganspan and Sonop, for which the aged were very grateful, and the additional costs involved in that are included here. Thirdly, there was a considerable increase in subsidies to private old-age homes. The hon. member will be aware of the fact that we increased these subsidies a time ago. A considerable number of large old-age homes which were being constructed, were completed at the same time this year and this increased our expenditure in respect of the subsidies to a very large extent. The result of that was this additional amount.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to have information in regard to two items. The first is item H which deals with grants-in-aid to the Africa Institute. Under that item there is an increase of almost 30 per cent on the original estimate. The second item is item M which deals with financial assistance to universities and bursaries for university education. As regards item M, I accept that the amount of R2&#x00BD; million is due mainly to salary adjustments, but what I should like to know is how much is in fact attributable to current expenditure. I should be pleased <span class="col_2407-2408" refersTo="page_1221"/>if the hon. the Minister could perhaps give me a break-down on the basis of the universities and an indication of the amount actually involved in respect of bursaries.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_national_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>As regards subhead H&#x2014;the grant-in-aid to the Africa Institute&#x2014;I should just like to remind the hon. member that a committee of inquiry, i.e. the Wennie du Plessis committee of inquiry, investigated the activities of the Africa Institute. The report of that committee was tabled on 16th June last year and most of its recommendations were accepted. The amount we have in front of us now, in point of fact is the difference between the financial implications of the report and the amount originally estimated. This is required for a variety of matters. It is required partly for salaries, administration costs, the purchase of library books and for the extension of staff, to a maximum of R17 000 as approved by the Treasury. The committee of inquiry did in fact recommend R34 000 for extension in respect of staff, but the Treasury approved only R17 000 of that. This is all I want to say in regard to item H.</p>

<p>We then come to item N which deals with financial assistance to universities. This involves an amount of R2 539 200. The position in this regard is as follows. The salaries of university staff were increased as from 1st April, 1971. After the salaries of the entire Public Service staff had been increased with effect from 1st January, it was decided to make those of the university staff of retrospective effect as from 1st January, so as to bring them into line with the salary increases of the Public Service. This, of course, was applicable to all the universities in the country, and was done at the request of the various universities as it affected their staff as a whole. Therefore I am able to tell the hon. member that the entire amount concerns salaries which were increased with retrospective effect in order to bring them into line with the procedure which had been followed in the Public Service. The exact amount involved in respect of salaries is R2 479 200. In addition, there is a further amount of R354 800 in respect of housing loans to university staff. This amount is to be added to the first. If the two are added, they come to a larger amount than that reflected in this Estimate. The reason for that is that there were certain savings on this Vote as well, which have been subtracted. I can only say that the savings resulted from the following. In the first place, progress with certain projects was not as rapid as had been hoped; therefore the loans which were granted and on which the interest was calculated in the original estimates, were in excess of the actual figures. Consequently there was a saving in this regard. In addition, there were minor savings in respect of vacation saving bonuses. This involved an amount of R35 300. In addition, there was a minor saving of R6 000 in respect of Government study bursaries. Hon. members will know that the Department of Social Welfare has a scheme in terms of which 20 bursaries are awarded annually to children from schools under the control of the department who want to study at a university. Not all 20 bursaries were taken up; only 16 of the 20 were taken up, therefore there was a saving.</p>

<p>In the last place, there are also the national study bursaries awarded by the universities. Not all those bursaries were awarded by the universities either. A saving of R13 000 resulted from this. If one adds the savings and subtracts that total from the amount of the increase, one gets the total amount of R2 539 200.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, under sub-head D&#x2014;Printing, Stationery, Advertisements and Publications&#x2014; there is an increase of very nearly 50 per cent. I gather that between 1970 and 1971-&#x2019;72 printing costs, whether by contract on escalation clauses or simply by changes in cost, increased by approximately 10 to 15 per cent. Would the hon. the Minister please indicate the reason for this increase of nearly 50 per cent&#x003F;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I shall give the hon. member the principal reason for the net increase of R120 000. The entire amount in fact involves, firstly, a decrease which was brought about because fewer items of stationery were drawn from this separate account, i.e. the stores account of the Government Printing Works. This is the purchase account on which the Government Printing Works buys its stores. There has been a tremendous increase in the prices of paper and printing requisites.</p>

<p>As regards sub-head D, the increase is R490 000. This is a large increase. Sub-head D in fact concerns the Government Printing Works as a factory. Sub-head D must purchase the paper for the <i>Government Gazettes,</i> etc., from sub-head F. It is purchased by means of public tender. The larger volume of <i>Government Gazettes</i> printed, as well as the higher printing costs and increased printing requisites, will be reflected in subhead D. Eventually this also results from higher salaries and wages. From sub-head A you will notice that there were wage increases as a result of an agreement in terms of the Industrial Conciliation Act, in terms of which there will be a wage increase every year for four years in respect of the lower paid employees in the trade. As hon. members know, the Government Printing Works is a factory. These wage increases are in fact one of the main causes of this tremendous increase, which as you will notice, amounts to R220 000 under sub-head A. This is reflected in the higher printing costs and in the increased prices of paper and of printing requisites which are purchased by public tender under sub-head D. I am sorry that I am mentioning the sub-heads one after the other to the hon. member. In reality they fit into one another. The increase in the Government publications which the Government Printing Works has to produce, as well as the increase in the costs of <i>Government Gazettes</i> printed on contract&#x2014;the ordinary <i>Government Gazette</i>&#x2014;brought about a total increase of R340 000. In the first part of last year, the volume of <i>Government Gazettes</i> increased by almost 15 per cent. There even were two special <i>Government Gazettes</i> which involved R57 000. These are only two <i>Government Gazettes</i> for which no provision was made. In the second place, the volume of Government publications which the various departments purchased from the Government Printing Works, increased by 100 per cent in the first eight months of last year. The tendency seems to be, because of the measures of economy which are being taken, for the departments to want to have their publications appearing sooner. This has caused a tremendous increase in printing costs. Of course, the cost of paper increased as well. Paper is bought by public tender. There are in fact only two large companies which supply paper nowadays, i.e. the South African Pulp and Paper Industries and, I think, another company known as Mondi. An agreement has been made with Sappi for their contract to be renewed annually on 1st April. In point of fact it is not the contract which is renewed. The tender is called for anew. In the last case, the increase in the price was 12&#x00BD; per cent. Therefore this is due partly to the increase in printing costs or unit costs which depend basically on the wages and the increased printing requisites such as pens, ink, paper, etc. The most important reason is the bulk paper which is purchased by public tender and of which the price cannot simply be increased arbitrarily.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister has replied to me in much more detail than I desired, but I <span class="col_2411-2412" refersTo="page_1223"/>doubt whether he did in fact get to the point I raised. In my question to him I admitted that printing costs, including the price of paper, etc., had increased tremendously. I have ascertained that between 1970-&#x2019;71 and 1971-&#x2019;72, the price increased by between 10 and 15 per cent. Here, however, we have an increase of 50 per cent and my question in fact concerned the additional 35 per cent. I concede at once that there was an increase in costs, but my question was in regard to the remaining 35 per cent. Was it due to an increase in volume which was not foreseen in 1970, or was it perhaps concerned with the publications of very high standard, the prestige publications, which the departments issued last year&#x003F; Was this too not a very expensive factor in respect of this figure&#x003F;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I tried to explain to the hon. member that this was not merely a question of a difference of 35 per cent, and that it must be attributed solely to an increase in the price of paper. In reality printing costs are something which depend on wage increases as well. I also explained that the wage increase had been particularly high. Printing costs are the actual unit costs. However, there was the increase in volume as well. I also explained that the increase in volume had been exceptionally high. The hon. member also mentioned a third point which, incidentally, I did not include in my reasons. What it in fact amounts to, and it was also mentioned here last year by one of the hon. members opposite, is that prestige publications are expected of our departments and in such cases they cost more, of course. However, one does not draw a specific distinction in the statements and say that because a publication is a prestige publication, it costs more. The fact remains that in volume they increased by 100 per cent over a short period. In addition, their basic cost increased tremendously and we know that as a result of wage agreements and wage increases, an unusual increase took place in the costs of this printing work as well.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The scope, development and modernization of the services of the South African Broadcasting Corporation already call for large amounts of money, and this need is increased by the considerable capital expenditure which will be necessary in the preparatory phase of the television service which the corporation has been instructed by the Government to introduce eventually. In order to finance all these projects, the SABC proposes negotiating a revolving credit agreement abroad. With the permission of the Minister of Finance the Control Board is already negotiating in this regard with financial institutions abroad. There are certain doubts about the legal validity of such an agreement within the framework of the Broadcasting Act (Act 22 of 1936), in that the said Act provides that the Corporation may raise moneys only by way of stocks, by debentures, partly by stocks and partly by debentures, as well as on the security of bills. However, the agreement to be concluded provides that moneys shall be raised by way of promissory <span class="col_2413-2414" refersTo="page_1224"/>notes and also requires repayment to be guaranteed by the Government. The Bill before the House makes provision for this, and will enable the corporation to continue with its task.</p>

<p>Clause 1 of the Bill, which amends section 18 of the Broadcasting Act, inserts a proviso in subsection (2) to authorize the corporation to raise moneys by means of promissory notes as well, while the new subsections (3) and (4) authorize the Minister of Finance to guarantee any loan raised by the corporation. The wording of these subsections was taken from section 3 of the Finance Act (Act 67 of 1955).</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we on this side of the House have no objection in principle to this particular Bill. Like Escom, the Railways or the Post Office, for instance, we believe that the SABC should have the right to raise loans. As a matter of fact, in the original Broadcast Act of 1936, which was introduced by the United Party Government&#x2014;a farsighted Government, I might add&#x2014;provision was made for the raising of loans for acquiring movable and immovable property. I use the word &#x201C;far-sighted&#x201D;, particularly because that Act also provided that the SABC could not only acquire broadcasting stations and studios, but almost 40 years ago, it also provided that it could buy and acquire television stations. An amending Act of 1969&#x2014;in this particular case regarding the borrowing powers of the SABC&#x2014;was also approved by this side of the House. That extended the powers of the SABC in regard to short-term loans.</p>

<p>Now this present Bill gives the SABC the power to raise loans and also moneys on the security of promissory notes. The Minister of Finance will be able to guarantee the capital and the interest on these loans. Perhaps the Minister could give us the hope that, with these guarantees on ordinary loans too, in future, it would be possible that the rate of interest on loans raised by the SABC, even if they are raised abroad, would be lower.</p>

<p>The first schedule of the Electricity Act, is, according to this amending Bill, to be applied to the raising of these loans. We have read about the chairman of the SABC, Dr. Meyer, going abroad, trying to find credits and loans, particularly in view of the great expansion in regard to the proposed plan for television.</p>

<p>I see that the Minister of Finance &#x201C;may&#x201D; guarantee the interest on and the capital of the amount of any loan the corporation may raise. I am not quite sure why the word &#x201C;may&#x201D; is used instead of &#x201C;shall&#x201D;; perhaps &#x201C;shall&#x201D; would be a better word to have used in that case, so that the Minister of Finance can keep an eye on the loan-raising activities of the SABC.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister mentioned the question of a revolving credit arrangement abroad. I take it that that is the correct translation of &#x201C;wentelkredietooreenkoms&#x201D;. I think this is an excellent idea. Without wishing in any way to do anything that may harm the negotiations, I would like to know to what extent the Minister can at least inform us, and whether he would do so, as to with which country this revolving credit arrangement is being made. If he could go further, he could perhaps tell us at which institution in that particular country it would be made. I think the country and the public would be interested to know. It is a good thing that SABC loans can be guaranteed in future. To a certain extent I suppose they must have been guaranteed in the past, because they were actually semi-Government loans as they were concluded through the Treasury itself.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in saying that we approve of this Bill and that we approve of these particular financial arrangements, it does not mean that we in the United Party are in any way altering our attitude with these new financial arrangements in regard to loans, which is that we feel that control by Parliament should be greater than it is at present and that control by Parliament, through the Auditor-General, as we have so often stated in the past, should also be exercised in connection with these additional loans which will be raised and the additional revolving credit. Nor does it in any way alter our attitude regarding the watchful eye that we are going to keep over all additional expenditure that is going to be incurred under this particular Bill. We believe that the SABC has been extravagant in the past. The danger of extravagance still exists, particularly with television coming, and where in the past we have criticized unnecessary extravagances we shall continue to do so. The SABC has already had R36 million in loans, and as the hon. the Minister indicated this afternoon &#x2026;</p>

<p>That is why I am dealing with the question of the additional amount that has to be raised and the reason given by the hon. the Minister, namely that it is for expansion in regard to television.

Sir, these are new amounts and I trust that the Minister will keep a very close eye on how this money is expended.

<p>Sir, since we are so unanimous at this late hour of the day, it is not necessary for me to reply at length to what the hon. member for Orange Grove has just said. I am grateful that the Opposition has seen its way clear to supporting this matter, which concerns the creation and extension of services which all of us regard as essential and important, and I am pleased that we may follow this course together and in a spirit of unity.</p>

<p>The hon. member raised two matters to which I want to reply briefly. Firstly, he asked whether the word &#x201C;may&#x201D; was correct, and whether it should not rather be &#x201C;shall&#x201D;. In this respect I must allow myself to be guided by the legal draftsmen. I presume that this wording is probably connected with the discretion to be exercized by the Minister of Finance. If he is of the opinion that he can and should give that guarantee, he will do so, but I think the fact that the word &#x201C;may&#x201D; is used here, enables him to exercize his discretion as well. I think it is the customary term in cases of this nature.</p>

<p>In regard to the second matter raised by the hon. member I want to assure him that I always bear this in mind, and will do so particularly in the case of the planning of television, and this is one of the reasons I do not want to proceed helter-skelter with this television project as the hon. member apparently wanted us to do.</p>

The Bill purports to be a consolidating measure&#x2014;the Minister said it was&#x2014;and we are told that three levies or taxes will be combined into one, which will make it so much easier for the employer, who is in any event bound down by forms and red tape whenever he employs Bantu labour. Instead of paying the initial registration fee of 25 cents and a monthly registration fee of 20 cents, and a weekly services levy of 20 cents, making a total of approximately R1,05 a week, he will now pay some amount determined by the Minister but not exceeding R2,50. If this is truly a consolidating measure to make it easier for the employer, I would ask the Minister why he did not wait a while and then combine the transport levy, for which provision was made in the Bill which this House passed recently, and also the licensing fee of 50 cents for each Bantu over a certain number employed in the urban areas.</p>

<p>Sir, our first objection to this measure is that Parliament does not know how much the taxpayer will have to pay because the Minister is the person who will decide from time to time what he is going to levy on the taxpayer. Secondly, we do not know to whom this will apply. It can apply to every employer of Bantu labour, but the Minister can differentiate and discriminate, without a word to Parliament, without our being able to intervene. For instance, he can differentiate by providing that housewives need only pay 20 cents a month after a registration fee of 25 cents, but that the makers of garments can pay R2,50 a month. That means that not only can he differentiate, but he can also discriminate against the garment makers. He says he will not severely tax the housewives, that they will in fact receive preference, that he will discriminate in their favour, and he has indicated that he will not make them pay an additional tax but will allow them to pay only the 20 cents which they pay at present. But what was his reaction when the hon. member for Durban Point moved an amendment to put this promise in the Bill and to fix the amount that the housewife will pay&#x003F; His reply was this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On which grounds can one exempt one group of employers, even if these are the beautiful, attractive women of the Republic &#x2026;</block>

<p>That was before Brakpan, Sir, and before the municipal elections&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; while none of the other employers &#x2026; are exempted&#x003F; Surely that would be cheap!</block>

<p>Well, the women of Brakpan apparently thought it was cheap. Why could he not legislate for what he promised to do&#x003F; Why could he not in fact put in writing in the Bill what he promised, so that Parliament could know and the housewives would know what the position would be&#x003F; What <span class="col_2419-2420" refersTo="page_1227"/>did he say&#x003F; It was not even specious reasoning; it was just arrant nonsense. This is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Surely that would be cheap! Surely it is too absurd to wander around loose in a responsible place such as this House!</block>

<p>I do not know who is wandering about loose, I know who is lost&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I do not see my way clear to doing that. That is why I say that I can give them the assurance that what they are asking for will be done but we cannot write that discrimination into this legislation because we do not think it would be fair.</block>

<p>So apparently it is fair to promise but it is not fair to put it in writing. Sir, the first question a lawyer asks his client who is having trouble with a lady friend, is whether he put it in writing. This Minister is apparently so discreet that he gives verbal assurances, but he will not put them in writing. I would be glad if he would tell us why he thinks it is fair to give these beautiful women, as he calls them, a verbal assurance, but is not prepared to put it in writing. The hon. the Deputy Minister went on, and took great trouble, to explain that in the Bill he does not discriminate; he says he differentiates, but I have just read where he says he will discriminate, he intends discriminating but he is not going to put it in writing in the Bill.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>As far as I can see, discrimination and differentiation mean the same thing because you can discriminate in favour and you can discriminate against, and any differentiation in this Bill will act as discrimination against some other group. And I do not see how that can be done. The Minister says he does not discriminate, but I have just read from his own Hansard where he said he would not put the discrimination in writing. This is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But we cannot write that discrimination into the legislation.</block>

<p>He says he is going to discriminate, but he cannot put it in the legislation. This Bill abounds with discriminations. The Minister can discriminate between areas and he can discriminate between classes of employers or between categories of employees. He can by taxation adversely affect one area in favour of another. He can, for example, exempt or put a minimum levy on employers in Pretoria and put a maximum tax of R2,50 a month on the employers of Johannesburg.</p>

<p>Then, to get back to his remark that combines the three levies. It certainly does that, as the Minister has said, but the services levy. There was also another type of paid by a limited number of employers, while the new tax can be paid by all employers including housewives and farmers who were expressly excluded from the services levy. There was also another type of employer excluded from the services levy, namely the employer who supplies housing for his employees. They will get no protection of this nature any more. In terms of this Bill the Minister can apply it to them. Therefore I say it is not a consolidating measure as far as that is concerned. The employers were given the assurance by Dr. Verwoerd that once the objects of the levy had been met it would be abolished. We know from the Minister&#x2019;s own mouth that the levy has accumulated to over R30 million because by law, imposed by Dr. Verwoerd, he was restricted in the use to which he could put these funds. We know too that if Dr. Verwoerd had lived he would have carried out his promise and abolished the levy. We know too that although the levy as a service levy will be abolished, once this new tax is introduced, it will only be a continuance of the old levy and it will be permanent. So I say it cannot be said to be merely a consolidating measure. We know that the first two of the three levies referred to by the hon. Minister were fixed whereas he now takes the power to raise these levies or taxes without coming to Parliament. Although the services levy discriminated in that it could be levied in one area and not in another, where it was levied it did not differentiate in the amount that was to be paid by each employer. The hon. Minister has made amendments in the Committee Stage, but instead of being magnanimous and paying a tribute to our contribution to the debate, he pretended that it was only because of the intervention of the Chambers of Industries and Commerce that he introduced those amendments. <span class="col_2421-2422" refersTo="page_1228"/>The fact is that the Chambers of Commerce and Industries were taking the same line as we were.

<p>The fact is that the Chambers of Industries&#x2014;I do not know about the Chambers of Commerce&#x2014;were taking the same line as we were. The hon. Deputy Minister completely ignored us in giving credit for these amendments. He dealt with the matter and with the amendments as if they were something new that had been raised by the Chambers. In regard to clause 4 (2) he admitted that he had been compelled to amend it because&#x2014; and hon. members should listen to this&#x2014; of the machinations of this side of the House and as a result of the circumstances which arose out of that, the politicking which arose out of that. It is a pity that the Minister regards our honest and successful endeavours on behalf of the public as machinations and politicking. In other words, he says that, because of our scheming and intriguing, he was compelled to alter his Bill. The alteration or amendment must have been an improvement or he would not have accepted it. Why did we have to &#x201C;scheme&#x201D; and &#x201C;intrigue&#x201D; in order to get him to do something to the benefit of the public&#x003F; It is because of this attitude that the Nationalist Party is slipping; they do not know what is for the good of the public. In spite of our amendment, which he agrees to accept, and the further amendment which he will accept in the Other Place, I want to say that we are still opposing this Bill. We would have no objection to a truly consolidating measure which would reduce the number of taxes payable, and which will ease the administration, the work to be done by the employer and the officials. We would have no objection to money being used for the better administration and for providing the Bantu with better amenities, but we object to giving the hon. the Minister the power to tax almost without let or hindrance. Parliament must do the taxing. Taxation should be clear and ascertainable. An employer should not be in a position of uncertainty as to what tax will be applied to him and where and when the axe might fall. We are not prepared to delegate the authority of this Parliament to a Minister and we will oppose the Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Transkei did not really come along with any new arguments in respect of their opposition to this specific Bill. Hon. members came along with the same arguments they furnished in the Second Reading debate. I think there is one matter we must get very clear, i.e. that if any body, a Parliament included, passes any law in which there is a clause determining a maximum levy, there is a definable figure. In the first place the principle is accepted that a levy can be imposed. In the second place it is determined that there will be a maximum in respect of that principle. If the principle is accepted, the qeustion of a maximum becomes merely an administrative matter. Because we do not see it as a tax, but as a levy, seen in terms of the principle that a levy may be imposed, it is an administrative measure to give the Minister an opportunity to differentiate up to a certain amount according to the circumstances. The standpoint that when the principle is accepted there can be a maximum is, in my opinion, a very logical and practical standpoint. One of the hon. members of the Opposition&#x2014;I do not know whether it was the hon. member for Pinelands&#x2014; moved an amendment stipulating R1,05. I want to tell the hon. member for Transkei that with respect to this specific legislation we cannot come along with a figure that is already almost exceeded by the levies now being imposed. What about the future&#x003F; What about planning within that same framework&#x003F; It is very clear to me. Let me tell the hon. member for Pinelands that if he sees the amount being fixed at R1,05 in terms of his amendment as an interim figure, I can understand exactly how the hon. Opposition thinks.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. D. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member does not understand what I mean. Hon. members opposite are constantly dealing with interim measures and interim policy statements. With respect to this specific legislation, the hon. member for Pinelands also wants to come along with an interim determination of the amount. I just want to tell the hon. member for Transkei, who referred to Brakpan and so on, quietly muttering with heartfelt enjoyment, that with respect to the Bill we are dealing with, he himself must read what was written in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> the day before the municipal elections. It asked what the hon. Opposition&#x2019;s duty is with respect to the municipal elections. It is clear to me that they were again guided there in the sense that they were told: &#x201C;Look, you are just an interim party until such time as it happens.&#x201D; We cannot deal with any legislation here on the lines of this interim standpoint of the Opposition. I want to state this conclusively. We accepted the principle that a levy may be imposed. Within the framework of that principle we place a maximum which the hon. the Minister may impose as discretion, interests and necessity dictate. If that is not vision and proper planning according to which one can deal with a department, hon. members must say what more they can do. Their alternative is not acceptable to us because it is an interim alternative.</p>

<p>I want to state categorically that when I use the word &#x201C;tax&#x201D; in this debate, I do not recognize the hon. Opposition&#x2019;s standpoint that the levy that will be imposed in terms of the Bill is a tax. The hon. member for Transkei says that the public at large, the employers and all the others, want to know exactly what the amount is. At this moment every employer and employee knows what the levy is at this stage, even if the three levies are being consolidated. The hon. member now wants to imply that the employers and employees will never know exactly what the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s idea with this levy is. I now reiterate that it is logical that everyone affected by this legislation knows at this present moment exactly what their obligations are in terms of the legislation. The hon. the Minister intimated that sufficient time would be given so that if increases become necessary the matter can be discussed and consultation take place about it. I now want to ask hon. members: &#x201C;What better assurance can the hon. Opposition give the employer and employee than that they know at this stage what they must pay, that a maximum has been determined, that within the framework of this legislation notice will be given of any increase and that within the framework of this legislation the necessary machinery for consultation is being established.&#x201D; What more can the hon. Opposition offer employers or employees than specifically this, except an interim levy of R1,05 which is very impractical in any case.</p>

<p><span class="col_2425-2426" refersTo="page_1230"/>The hon. member for Transkei said that any lawyer would immediately ask his client whether this was in writing. Any lawyer dealing with a situation such as that to which the hon. member referred, would definitely not like to see that his client had committed everything to writing if he wants to defend his client. He would like to see that certain things be transacted verbally. Because that is so, we should not very much like to see everything committed to writing at this stage either, for the sake of administration and the optimum furtherance of the interests of interest groups. The hon. member, as a legal man, will have to concede that if he has to appear and has an opportunity &#x2026;</p>

<p>If the hon. member for Transkei is now saying we want to cheat the housewives, I want to ask him whether, if an assurance is given to housewives and farmers in this House by the Minister, and therefore also in public by this Parliament&#x2014;because if this legislation is passed it is not only a National Party Act, but also a national one&#x2014;he wants to tell me that we are deliberately going to cheat the housewives and the farmers, as he put it&#x003F; During the Second Reading debate I told the hon. member for Kensington how matters in agriculture functioned. This case was stated in our agricultural constituencies and not one of those people there made any objections. Those people accept the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s word that at this stage it is not applicable to them, possibly not in the future either. The hon. member now wants to say that because mention is made in the Bill of the term employer, we are now allegedly misleading the housewives and the farmers and are going to cheat them in the future. This legislation, which is a consolidating measure, whether the Opposition wants to recognize this or not, contains basic measures that appear in those Acts that are now being consolidated here. There the housewife and the farmer are excluded, and the hon. the Deputy Minister has given his assurance, Hon. members made a terrible fuss here about the question of the housewives. We know this was prior to the Brakpan issue, and as hon. members opposite tried to incite the housewives about this matter, we gave them certain assurances. The hon. member for Transkei and other hon. members on that side could not even incite the Housewives League to the point where they put any standpoint to the hon. the Deputy Minister with respect to this matter. If there is any organization that would definitely have acted, if it felt itself to be affected by this legislation, it would have been the Housewives League. There is no group of people so thin-skinned as far as their interests are concerned than this very Housewives League. I have no objection if the hon. Opposition wants to fill the role of the Housewives League, but then they must just not try to do so in this House, because then we are going to have very big problems.</p>

<p>I want to state one matter very clearly. The hon. member for Transkei accuses the hon. the Deputy Minister of the fact that in this Bill there is a discriminatory provision, and he also acknowledges that there is a differentiating provision. The hon. member now merely proceeds from the standpoint that certain groups of people are going to be discriminated against. The context and the spirit of this measure does not place the emphasis on any discriminatory provisions, it places the emphasis on the differentiating provisions.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. D. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>There is a very great difference. The hon. member, who is a legal man, ought to know that when one speaks of discrimination there must be <i>mala fides.</i> The hon. member ought to know this and must not try telling me that he does not know that when one speaks of discrimination there is <i>mala fides</i> on the part of the body practicing this so-called discrimination. He must ask the hon. member for Pinelands who is perhaps more scholarly than he is. He will be able to tell the hon. member. However, there is no <i>mala fides</i> in this legislation. There can only be a possibility of <i>mala fides</i> if a ceiling were not placed on the amount that may be collected. However, that ceiling has been introduced. Differentiation does not mean that there needs to be <i>mala fides.</i> When one differentiates this simply <span class="col_2427-2428" refersTo="page_1231"/>means that there are certain interests that are not always comparable and that those specific interests must each be handled on its own merits. And now, Sir, I want to ask the hon. member for Transkei whether he would agree that the interests of interest groups in South Africa are not all the same. Let me rather put it this way: Is the hon. member prepared to acknowledge that the employer interest groups in South Africa do not necessarily share the same basis&#x003F;</p>

If this is so, the hon. member acknowledges in the same breath&#x2014;that is only logical&#x2014;that differentiation can take place. This is precisely what this legislation envisages.

<p>No, the hon. member has housewives on the brain. I do not know why the hon. member is specifically concerned about housewives at this time of the evening. Because the hon. member acknowledges that there can be differentiation, our argument is simply that that basic concept was accepted and that we are looking after the interest groups that are being affected by this relevant Bill. We say that the interests of those people can best be served if there is differentiation. To be even more practical, it is not possible, when one accepts the principle of differentiation, to simply inscribe it in all its detail in a Bill; because the basis underlying interest groups can differ from time to time. Because this is so, it is essential that certain powers be given to the Minister so that adaptability can be maintained and adjustments made as the circumstances require. If we have accepted that point, the hon. Opposition&#x2019;s argument that we are discriminating falls away. If the argument falls away, the hon. Opposition must state what more they have against this legislation, apart from the fact that they see the levy being imposed here as a tax.</p>

<p>I now just want to come back to the very first matter the hon. member for Transkei mentioned. He asked why the hon. the Deputy Minister did not keep this Bill back so that the legislation which the hon. the Deputy Minister of Transport is handling, with respect to the transport services for Bantu, Coloureds and Indians, could also be included. But the hon. member ought surely to know that while the levy being discussed here is a consolidation of existing levies, the hon. the Deputy Minister of Transport is handling new aspects. These are not matters that can simply be embodied in a consolidating measure such as this. This would, as far as I am concerned, result in poor legislation. The hon. member for Transkei surely knows that that group of people&#x2014;employers and so on&#x2014;to whom the Bill will apply, will not necessarily be the same group of people to whom the other legislation applies.</p>

I do not want to repeat them, but merely want to add briefly that, since the S.A.B.C. now has these more comprehensive powers in regard to obtaining capital for expansion, I hope the hon. the Minister will not put obstacles in their way. They have very important tasks in regard to television now. He has mentioned these tasks, which will of course include the construction of the satellite station, the great Auckland Park complex, as well as the conversion of the F.M.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. D. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>When the House adjourned last night, we were dealing briefly with the statements the hon. member for Transkei made. This morning I also want to dwell on one of the statements he made at the very beginning of his speech when he virtually accused the hon. the Deputy Minister of not being prepared to give them credit for the positive suggestions which the Opposition allegedly presented to the Deputy Minister. In the process of accusing the hon. the Deputy Minister, the hon. member for Transkei said that certain bodies, such as the F.C.I., took a hint from the Opposition as far as this matter is concerned. The Deputy Minister told him they were aping the F.C.I. and it was not the F.C.I. that was aping the Opposition. On the surface this appears to be a quite innocent remark the hon. member for Transkei made with respect to this legislation. I think it was necessary for him to make that remark for the simple reason that in respect of this relevant legislation the hon. member does not want to concede that the Opposition did not handle the matter as the F.C.I. would have liked to see it handled. Now the people have to be made to believe that it was the Opposition who made the positive amendments to and remarks about this legislation. We know this was published for general information on 24th December of last year. We also know that a whole series of articles about this appeared in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> in which doubts were expressed and even spectres conjured up in respect of this legislation. But the Deputy Minister is bringing this Bill to the House this year, during this Session, and while it is being dealt with&#x2014;I want to reiterate, while it is being discussed in this House&#x2014;the F.C.I. becomes so concerned about the handling of the legislation by the Opposition that the F.C.I. comes down specifically to see the Deputy Minister.</p>

<p>The hon. member must not keep running away from it. The hon. member claims that they are the people who introduced the positive aspects into this legislation by way of amendments. We are telling the Opposition that this is not correct. The F.C.I. negotiated with the Deputy Minister about this matter, and they came to negotiate with the Deputy Minister while this legislation was under discussion in this House. I now wonder. In the Second Reading debate the hon. members <span class="col_2431-2432" refersTo="page_1233"/>for Albany and Kensington mentioned certain things which certain Chambers of Commerce and certain Chambers of Industries submitted to them, but they did not mention the F.C.I.&#x2019;s name. They mentioned regional groups. This aggravates the matter because if those regional groups made representations to the Opposition with respect to this legislation, why would the F.C.I. then come down here to hold discussions with the Deputy Minister, since it is in the Opposition&#x2019;s competent hands to attack the Government about the matter&#x003F;</p>

<p>What is more, on the strength of the F.C.I.&#x2019;s discussions and representations to the Deputy Minister, the Deputy Minister moved the only amendment to this Bill which reflects the spirit of the F.C.I.&#x2019;s interests. The Opposition also came along with amendments. Without elaborating on the matter, I just want to state that I wonder whether the Opposition is today still as happy with the amendment moved by the hon. member for Durban Point. We shall probably find out later whether the Opposition is still as happy. [Interjections.] No, the hon. member must not get excited now. This claim by the Opposition, that they are the people who introduced the positive improvements to this legislation, we must have a closer look at for a moment because it is our duty to do so. I want to repeat that the Deputy Minister, and not the Opposition, introduced the positive amendment to this legislation, an amendment that reflected the spirit of the F.C.I.&#x2019;s representations. The Opposition, in the person of the hon. member for Durban Point, moved an amendment which, I think we shall see, the F.C.I. is not satisfied with either. The Deputy Minister was prepared to discuss the matter here across the floor of the House. I want to leave it at that and just emphasize that the hon. member for Transkei must now not simply usurp certain aspects for themselves, aspects which are in no way due to them. This creates a confusing impression. There I want to leave this question for the moment.</p>

<p>If one uses a word in this House like &#x201C;discrimination&#x201D;, for example, it has a serious intonation in the sense that there is, as I said last night, an element of willfulness or otherwise ill-will involved, and that is what the Deputy Minister and this side of the House are being accused of; because the Opposition says this Bill is discriminatory. Now, when the Opposition uses that word they must be very careful, because what is the implication if this side of the House, which comes along with this legislation, is accused of discrimination&#x003F; The implication is that this side of the House is prepared to make a distinction, and an unfair distinction, in its treatment, specifically prejudicial treatment, of a person, a group or even a country. That is what discrimination means. It means, in addition, ruling out someone or something by way of condemnation or as a result of prejudice or jealousy. Does the hon. member agree with that&#x003F; Does he agree that that is what this side of the House is doing&#x003F;</p>

<p>We cannot simply allow a word such as discrimination to be used freely with regard to a delicate matter such as this. Although this Bill is a consolidating measure it deals with people, as all Acts do, but here it relates specifically to a relationship. We know that the majority of employers in this country are Whites and that the majority of employees are non-Whites but in that context where we are dealing with human relations, which are a delicate proposition, and since this Bill is regulating a specific relationship between employer and employee, we simply use the word &#x201C;discrimination&#x201D; so freely. This is a very dangerous thing to do when we are dealing with this employer-employee relationship in our national set-up in South Africa.</p>

<p>I think that in South Africa the time has come for us to choose our words very well and very clearly when we are dealing with such a relationship and discussing it. I want to charge the hon. Opposition with the fact that the mere use of this word can be harmful to our relationships and not only to our national relationships, but also to the employer-employee relationship. I want to express the hope that the hon. Opposition will be careful in future with the use of such a word.</p>

<p>We are talking about assurances, a question that was raised by the hon. member. That was a firm assurance, but we all know that that assurance was broken. That type of lesson alone should be sufficient to cause that hon. member to be just a little cautious when he tries to suggest that we should accept undertakings or assurances from that side of the House and I suggest that he should not get so hot under the collar about it. While we are on the subject of assurances, let us come a little closer to this Bill and go back to the assurance which was given <span class="col_2435-2436" refersTo="page_1235"/>again by Dr. Verwoerd that the original Bantu services levy would be a temporary levy.</p>

<p>We all know that Dr. Verwoerd gave an assurance about the original Bantu services levy. I am not going to burden the record by repeating it. It was mentioned in fair detail during the Second Reading debate and it was also referred to by the hon. the Deputy Minister himself.</p>

<p>We also have had assurances from the hon. the Deputy Minister. During his introduction to the Second Reading debate he gave us the assurance that there had been full consultation before he came forward with this measure. He relied on consultation with industry. But he is applying this measure not only to industry but to agriculture and housewives as well, or &#x201C;employers of domestic labour&#x201D; who were specifically exempted from the provisions of the Bantu services levy. In that, I say here and now, he broke an assurance and he did it within a matter of a few days.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oliver">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>This question was canvassed fully at the Second Reading stage and during the Committee Stage. That hon. Deputy Minister in fact accepted the principle that there should be consultation before these provisions were applied. While we are talking of assurances and seeing that he has mentioned what has been published in newspapers, may I remind him of an interview that he gave to representatives of the <i>Argus</i> company in Cape Town. It was during a Press conference that he gave on this Bill. He was quoted as saying&#x2014;and I quote here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This measure is aimed solely at providing the finances for the best possible administration of Bantu administration in the urban areas with minimum inconvenience to employers.</block>

<p>This is a direct quote. I have tried to establish whether he altered it on any occasion since it was published. I assume that he studied the reports after his Press conference. Well, Sir, this measure does not do that. It is not aimed &#x201C;solely at providing the finances for the best possible administration of Bantu administration in the urban areas&#x201D;. There is provision in it for money raised in urban areas to be used in other areas, for example in the Bantu homelands or border areas. Was this not an assurance which he gave to the public at his Press conference&#x003F; If so, how can he have the effrontery a few days later to come with this legislation which provides for doing the exact opposite&#x003F;</p>

<p>I am afraid I cannot understand the attitude of the hon. member for Christiana, who challenged us on a number of points. When I rose to speak, obviously to reply to some of the matters raised by him, he just seemed to have disappeared. Perhaps we can hold some of it in abeyance until he comes back. What is important at this Third Reading stage is to examine the application <span class="col_2437-2438" refersTo="page_1236"/>of this Bill. I think it is common cause that we intend voting against it at this stage in line with our attitude at the Second reading stage. What is important is to canvass the possible application of this Bill. I want to say here and now, that this hon. Deputy Minister will in effect be holding a succession of blank cheques payable by employers of Bantu labour which he can fill in whenever he pleases and for whatever amounts he wants up to maximum of R2,50 in respect of each Black employee. It can vary from the R15 million per year, mentioned by him when he replied to the Second Reading debate, to a sum many times that. During the Second Reading debate when he replied, he asked us not to hold him too strictly to the figure of R15 million. He told us that it might in fact be as high as R22 million and that it might even go as high as R23 million. We know that the hon. the Deputy Minister is not coy and I think we can accept that he was not being coy when he gave these figures. The truth of the matter is of course that he and his department have no idea how much they propose to call up from employers over the next two or perhaps more years. They have no idea at all, and are simply asking for a blank cheque. It could be R100 million per year, or more. There is just one warning I want to give to the hon. the Deputy Minister and that is that he cannot feel himself free to apply this tax just as he wants to, perhaps recklessly. The money will not be coming from a bottomless well. Every rand he charges employers of Bantu labour will have to be found somewhere and it is quite reasonable to expect that the employers of Black labour will pass it on, as indeed they pass on other taxes such as the sales tax and transport taxes.</p>

<p>Let us just come back to housewives and farmers. Before I continue any further I want to tell this hon. Deputy Minister that I consider it an impertinence on his part when he replied to the Second Reading debate to make fun about the fact that I, as a member representing an urban constituency, should try to protect the interests of farmers. He should be ashamed of himself and I want to tell him quite bluntly that I shall continue to raise matters in the interests of anybody in this country and any section in this country, whether they come from my own constituency or not. I want to tell him too, that we have evidence of hon. gentlemen on that side of the House who represent farming constituencies, who never put forward any representations about their constituents. I refer to the hon. the Minister of Sport, for one.</p>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! The hon. member must come back to the Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oliver">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>In the Committee Stage the hon. the Deputy Minister rejected our amendment aimed at exempting farmers and housewives from the provisions of this Bill, so that no tax of this nature could be imposed on them without the direct concurrence of this House. Instead hon. members on that side of the House expressed their satisfaction with an assurance from the hon. the Deputy Minister that housewives and farmers would not for the present, &#x201C;vir die huidige&#x201D;, be taxed more than they were being taxed today. We tried to probe what &#x201C;vir die huidige&#x201D; means. I suggest this is very material, now that we are dealing with the possible application of this Bill. The hon. the Deputy Minister did not explain what &#x201C;vir die huidige&#x201D; means. He told us that he did not envisage any dramatic or drastic change in the amount of the tax. I want to caution him, now that he has in principle been given the powers to apply this tax, not to try to apply it either to housewives or to farmers without consulting them. I believe even at this late stage we should get an undertaking from him, for whatever that is worth, that he will have such consultation. In fact, I want to suggest to him that he is morally obliged to have this sort of consultation. He is obliged to consult with organized agriculture and, as far as possible, to try to assess the feeling of housewives and other employers of domestic labour before attempting to apply this tax to them.</p>

<p>While we are talking about the hon. the Deputy Minister assuming the powers to apply this tax arbitrarily, I want to tell him that we on this side of the House have given considerable thought to the possible arbitrary application of this tax. He knows as well as I do&#x2014;I am sorry that we had to listen to so much nonsense from the hon. member for Christiana on this subject&#x2014;that this is a tax. Whether he wants to call it a levy or not, does not really matter. It is a tax. What is more, it is a selective employment tax. There is no other way of describing it. The hon. member for Christiana was simply playing with words when he tried to deny that it was a tax.</p>

<p><span class="col_2439-2440" refersTo="page_1237"/>Let us take a look at the overall position, because this hon. Deputy Minister in determining how he is going to apply the selective employment tax, must obviously not do it in a vacuum. He must look at other taxes that are being imposed on employers if only to determine what burden employers of Black labour are bearing already. If he is going to look at the position in its proper context, he cannot ignore other taxation. One of the taxes that he will have to bear in mind is the Bantu transport services levy. The hon. the Deputy Minister of Transport has legislation before this House to double the sum that can be taken from employers of Black labour from 10 cents a week to 20 cents a week. There is one thing that disturbs us about the approach of this hon. Deputy Minister in this regard. We happen to know that he was involved with the hon. the Deputy Minister of Transport in discussing the question of the doubling of the transport levy. We know that both of them were consulted. Perhaps he will indicate to me whether they were consulted together about the doubling of this levy. I want to know from him, when he was discussing this other levy with the hon. the Deputy Minister of Transport, why he made no mention of the fact that he himself was seeking to impose a higher sectional tax on employers of Bantu labour&#x003F; &#x2026; We get no reaction from him.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>He says I am making an accusation. He is muttering something under his breath. I wish he would say it a little louder. Why did he not tell the hon. the Deputy Minister of Transport that he himself was seeking to impose this tax&#x003F; Because he obviously did not, and I can prove it. I spoke on the Second Reading of the legislation to double the Transport services levy and I referred to the fact that there was already legislation before the House that would increase the burden on employers of Black labour to a considerable extent. The hon. the Deputy Minister of Transport pleaded complete ignorance of this. He seemed absolutely startled and asked what levies I was talking about. In other words, this hon. gentleman has not even bothered to tell the hon. the Deputy Minister of Transport that he, too, was seeking to tax employers of Black labour. He was prepared to let the hon. the Deputy Minister of Transport go ahead with his plan to double the Transport levy without telling him that he was doing something similar in his own right. This creates an interesting picture of what is going on in the ranks of the Government. We seem to get a picture of two departments, this hon. Deputy Minister&#x2019;s department and the Department of Transport, each punching businessmen with one hand. The one hits with the Government&#x2019;s left hand and the other with its right hand, but one hand does not know what the other is doing or how hard it is hitting.</p>

<p>While we are looking at the general position of what taxes must be paid by businessmen, it has emerged that the maximum the businessmen can now be taxed, or will be taxed in terms of this legislation and other legislation before the House, will now total approximately R3,85 in respect of each Black employee.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>How much&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oliver">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>Three rands eighty five cents! We have this selective employment tax, which can amount to as much as R2,50 per month in terms of this legislation, in the discretion of the Minister. Then we have the monthly licence fee of 50 cent, which is already payable by employers of Bantu labour in respect of the second and each further Bantu employed in certain proclaimed areas. This licence fee is not being absorbed in the tax being dealt with today. In other words, these two bring the potential figure up to R3 per month. That is not all. We then have the Bantu transport levy, which in terms of legislation with which we are now busy, can be raised to a maximum of 20 cents per week in respect of each Bantu employee, which, in other words, amounts to 85 cents per month. So we have a total of R3,85 potentially payable by employers in respect of each Bantu employee. I have mentioned this lack of communication between the hon. the Deputy Minister and his colleague, the Deputy Minister of Transport. He did not even bother to tell the Deputy Minister of Transport that he was doing exactly the same in pushing up a selective tax on employers of Black labour.</p>

<p>I want to ask him something else, something which is very material at the moment and will be even more material in future. Did this hon. Deputy Minister consult with the Minister of Finance before <span class="col_2441-2442" refersTo="page_1238"/>he came forward with this legislation&#x003F; Did he&#x003F; I can only take his studied silence as meaning that he did not. If he had, I am quite sure he would have said &#x201C;yes&#x201D; with some alacrity. I want to ask the hon. Deputy Minister whether the hon. Minister of Finance knows what is going on. Does he know that separate departments are each pouncing on employers and businessmen and taking their own private little sectional taxes&#x003F; I ask this because the Minister of Finance obviously has the first claim on the pockets of business people and they are already paying dearly enough for the policies of this Government. That is why I want to suggest to this hon. Deputy Minister that before he even attempts to vary the rate of taxation in respect of Bantu employees, he should, firstly, have the fullest possible consultation with those who are to be affected. Then I want to suggest to him that he should not only consult with the hon. Minister of Finance, but also get the approval of the Minister of Finance before he increases the rate of tax. I want to turn for a moment to the hon. member for Christiana and to come back to what he had to say about the question of whether this tax is capable of being used in a discriminatory manner. Of course it is. That hon. Deputy Minister is able to apply it in full, to business people of Johannesburg for instance, and perhaps only one half of it to business people in areas where he would like to see business being located. That is why we have said all along that this legislation places a powerful ideological weapon in the hands of that hon. Minister. I do not think for one moment that the businessman who is paying it, the man who perhaps has finally to pay as much as R3,85 in respect of each Bantu employee, is going to worry overmuch whether he is being discriminated against or whether he is the victim of differentiation, which are to my mind the same. I do not care for the fine dictionary definitions&#x2014;I do not accept them anyway&#x2014;put forward by the hon. member for Christiana. While we are on the question of where the tax can be applied and where it cannot, I want to refer again to the assurance given by the hon. Deputy Minister at his Press conference, namely that the tax would not be used other than for the best possible Bantu administration in the urban areas with minimum inconvenience to the employers. I want to ask him how this assurance squares with the provision of this Bill which makes it possible for the Bantu administration boards to make donations from their funds for Bantu administration in other areas&#x2014;perhaps in the homelands, perhaps in the border areas, perhaps elsewhere. The assurance which he gave at his Press conference obviously does not agree with what the Bill itself says. Sir, I want to caution him, too, about this rather neat provision in the Bill that these boards can transfer some of their funds to other areas. This has already been viewed by us with the utmost suspicion and I warn him that we are going to continue to view it with suspicion. On the face of it, it seems innocent enough. The boards will raise the money&#x2014;let us say, for example, the Bantu administration board that covers the area of Johannesburg&#x2014;through whatever selective employment tax this hon. Minister decides to impose, and then if they raise too much money they are able to transfer it elsewhere. I think we cannot look at this whole system without asking ourselves about the constitution of these Bantu administration boards. One thing stands out a mile, and that is that these boards are all appointed by the Minister himself.</p>

<p>Dr. Verwoerd was referring to the situation at the time; we are now living in another era in the Republic of South Africa, but let us leave it at that. The hon. member for Kensington also referred here to organized agriculture and the housewives who had supposedly not been consulted. As far as agriculture is concerned, the hon. member for Christiana pointed out very effectively during the Second Reading debate that organized agriculture does in fact have its sub-committees to which it refers legislation of this type. It is the task of organized agriculture, if it does not agree with this legislation, to come and discuss it with the hon. the Deputy Minister, or whoever is responsible for the legislation. In this case the hon. the Deputy Minister did consult organized agriculture, and he consulted many other people as well. I shall return later to the housewives. I just want to quote here what the hon. the Deputy Minister said during the Second Reading debate:</p>

<block name="quote">Not one but numerous discussions actually took place with organizations such as the Instituutraad and the United Municipal Executive. So, for example, I call to mind that we held discussions on four occasions during the past six months with the Federated Chamber of Industries, at which I was personally present and acted as chairman. There were also discussions with Assocom, the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut, the Instituutraad, etc. This is not therefore a mere irresponsible Bill which we have before the House.</block>

<p>That was very clearly stated, Sir. There was consultation. The hon. member for Kensington is trying to imply that there was no consultation. Surely it is not right to make a statement like that here. But let me quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Apart from the discussions which were held in regard to this matter, I saw to it personally that pains were taken to have this Bill published on the 24th December for general public information in the <i>Gazette,</i> which is the correct procedure.</block>

<p><span class="col_2445-2446" refersTo="page_1240"/>Sir, I want to return to the hon. member for Transkei. Yesterday afternoon when the hon. member was speaking here he referred in passing to the housewives of South Africa&#x2014;the hon. member for Kensington did the same thing&#x2014;and then the hon. member for Transkei referred to the housewives of Brakpan as well.</p>

<p>Sir, let me tell the hon. members for Transkei and Kensington that the National Party was governing when Brakpan was still U.P. Brakpan has remained a Nationalist constituency, and for that reason the National Party will continue to govern for a long time.

<p>Everything they are doing to turn the women of South Africa against us, will fail. Sir, I return to the Bill.</p>

<p>This Bill will contribute to the sound administration of Bantu in the White areas&#x2014;sound administration which is so important. It will also contribute to the orderly settlement of Bantu in appropriate occupations in the White areas, the orderly settlement of Bantu in all kinds of occupations. There will be no discrimination, for we do not believe in discrimination. The Bantu will be settled in good occupations. Just as, for example, we resettled the Bantu in an orderly manner in regard to housing, so this Bill will provide that they are placed in good occupations. This will contribute to an orderly distribution of the disciplined Bantu labour potential. This will increase productivity not only in the industrial sector, but in all sectors of the South African economy.</p>

<p>These matters are very important. It will, on the contrary, have just the opposite effect to what the hon. member for Newton Park predicted during the Second Reading. After all, the hon. member predicted that this measure would place a premium on productivity. What an absurd argument, Sir. As they say, &#x201C;He was at a loss for words&#x201D;. He was at a loss for words when he made this statement. This just shows you again in what an irresponsible way people can act when they are politically insolvent. I think it would be enough to make the forbears of the United Party turn in their graves if they had to hear this nonsense.</p>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>The nonsense the hon. member for Newton Park spoke. This measure deals only with the consolidation of the labour bureau, the registration and the levy fees. Those fees are going to be consolidated into one fund. The two other fees, i.e. the licence fees and the transport levy, are not being included in this. The maximum levy fees will be R2,50. That is the ceiling, and there will be room for movement in between. It is therefore not inevitable that the maximum is going to be applied. As a result of this they could even be less than they are today. But those hon. members are anticipating this matter. They are simply trying to scavenge some political gain out of this entire matter.</p>

<p>Since the hon. member for Houghton said that this Bill could be conducive to inflation, I just want to mention in passing that since there is a great demand for Bantu labourers, this Bill will contribute towards eliminating the deficiencies which exist at present. Secondly, it will be possible to exercise better organization and control over the supply of Bantu labour. Thirdly, it will be possible to provide better schools for apprentices in which to train potential workers. This is a very important matter, and now I want to ask the hon. member for Houghton: Since when could better training and the improved distribution of trained Bantu labour bring about inflation&#x003F; Surely that cannot happen, because this is something which takes place on an orderly basis. How can it therefore stimulate inflation&#x003F; But the Opposition, as well as the hon. member for Houghton, do not want this Bill on the Statute Book, because it is against their policy. They do not believe that this measure should be placed on the Statute Book, for if it is not placed on the Statute Book, it would fit in with the future Utopia of the United Party. I am sorry the hon. members for Houghton and Wynberg are not present here, for so much has been said lately about coalition. Recently I have noticed that the hon. members for Houghton and Wynberg are co-operating very well, and that the hon. member for Houghton looks on so approvingly <span class="col_2447-2448" refersTo="page_1241"/>when members on that side of the House speak. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Sir, the Opposition in South Africa is colonialistically orientated. The <i>Sunday Times</i> itself said this. After all, we know what their policy is; I may not discuss it here now, but as a result of the fact that they are colonialistically orientated and that they believe that they will keep the Black man down for all time, this Bill is against their principles, and they cannot agree to it. To them it makes no difference whether this levy is going to be greater or less, as I said a moment ago. Just as long as they can oppose it as a result of the fact that it does not fit into the pattern of their future political policy, they use it merely as a lever to indemnify their future political policy and to throw a spanner in the works in respect of our policy.</p>

<p>Sir, as far as we on this side of the House are concerned, this will also make a contribution to enable the Bantu Administration Boards as well to comply with their obligations properly. This Bill will now provide that, in the same way as in the case of the statutory boards in agriculture, levies will have to be paid here as well. The hon. member there referred to agriculture a moment ago. I just want to tell him that agriculture has been paying levies for years now. Nobody said anything about that. Why should levies not be paid in this context as well&#x003F; What is the difference&#x003F; The difference, as far as they are concerned, is that they do not refer, in the case of this Bill, to levies, but to tax.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Aliwal made a large number of statements one cannot agree with, but I just want to single out two which one could perhaps call &#x201C;pearls&#x201D;, economically speaking. Since we are dealing here with a tax, a levy on employers, I think it certainly is a &#x201C;pearl&#x201D; to say that it will increase the productivity of industries. The second statement that may be regarded as a &#x201C;pearl&#x201D; is the following: &#x201C;How then will it stimulate inflation&#x003F;&#x201D; Those two statements are &#x201C;pearls&#x201D; which we could definitely give the hon. the Minister of Finance for his serious consideration when he drafts his Budget.</p>

<p>The hon. members for Transkei and Kensington expounded the reasons for our opposition to this Bill so well that it is definitely not necessary for me to devote any time to this. I should rather like to state a more general approach in connection with the Act, but before I come to that I just want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister one question, to which I hope he will give me a reply. The hon. member for Kensington proved that under this legislation it will now be possible to charge R3,85 per month&#x2014;not only under this legislation, but together with the other levies that may be imposed. This of course works out at R46 per month. I admit that an amendment has been made which will mean that the maximum of R2,50 will not be reached soon.</p>

<p>As I said, I propose to deal with some general matters, but in particular I want to say that the United Party over the last few years, I believe, has shown conclusively how the Government&#x2019;s policies are placing a stranglehold on our economy and I believe that this measure furnishes another example of such pressure being applied to our economy. It is as well that we take note as these individual measures crop up, measures which do tighten that stranglehold on our economy, because otherwise one is left perhaps with generalizations. But the fact is that this is such a measure, as I hope to show in due course. I believe also it is another example of the Government clinging to policies which are outmoded, not to say dead. It is this type of measure, with the thinking behind it, which shows more and more that the National Party is a party of the past, and I believe this the voters are saying more loudly every day. But as I said, I did want to touch upon one question before I got there. That concerns the quality of the amenities which are now going to be provided by the Government.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington and others have shown that potentially the Government can take a great deal of extra money in tax as the result of this measure. We know from the hon. the Deputy Minister that he is going to take at least R23 million a year, which represents a considerable increase on what has been taken in the past. Bearing in mind that there have built up such large surpluses in the Bantu Services Levy Fund, surpluses which are available to deal with a massive extension of basic facilities, one can realize that the amount available for other amenities, other expenses, is very great indeed. What I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister is this: What is going to be the standard of the amenities which will be provided in the urban areas&#x003F; We know that there can be two standards. We know that Johannesburg City Council and some others established a higher standard of amenities. They were blamed for this at one time by the Government, but now it would seem, since the Government is going to take in enough tax to cover that extra amount, that the Government has come around to their point of view. But it is not clear. We have not had clarity. We do not in fact know how much of this money is going to be used on the aid centres, and perhaps for extra administration costs, properly so-called, and in other fields; we do not know how much will be left over for the amenities of which the Deputy Minister spoke. I therefore ask him in his reply&#x2014;and he will reply immediately after me&#x2014;to tell us what standard is going to be set now. Is it going to be the higher standard to which the hon. the Minister of Community Development at one time objected, or is it going to be the lower standard according to which some municipalities were supplying amenities&#x003F; The main ground of our opposition has been made clear, namely that the provision of all these moneys for these various purposes, called &#x201C;administration costs&#x201D; by the Deputy Minister, but in truth only partly administration costs, properly so-called, and to a large extent wider amenities, is to be borne by one section of the population, the employers, and in certain categories only, and not from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, from the general revenue of the country. Now, in weighing whether the Government&#x2019;s approach or our own is the more correct one here, I think it helps first to examine what is the nature of the amenities which will be provided.</p>

<p>Now we have it from the speech of the hon. the Deputy Minister, in his Second Reading introductory speech. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; you will note that administration thus includes everything that is necessary to ensure that the Bantu employee, whilst he sojourns in the White area, is a happy and contented person&#x2014;that he is not merely treated as a commodity but as a human being with human needs.</block>

<p>Then when he dealt with the detailed provisions, this is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; we cannot waive the need for providing for essential services such as a good water supply, sanitation services, electricity supply, roads&#x2014;including bus roads and termini&#x2014;clinics and health services, recreational facilities, cr&#x00E8;ches, community centres, libraries and, what is more, the maintenance of these services.</block>

<p>He says &#x201C;the whole spectrum&#x201D;. That is just the point. <span class="col_2451-2452" refersTo="page_1243"/>The whole spectrum of services for a vast community is under all normal conditions in all normal Western countries supplied by the community as a whole. It is either supplied, where appropriate, by the city revenues, or, if they are of a more general kind, by the country&#x2019;s revenues. But what do we find here&#x003F; We find here, and here only as far as I know, in the world, that such a general spectrum of amenities, to use the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s words, is to be foisted upon the shoulders of the most productive section of our community. One asks of the hon. the Deputy Minister: If this should be so in regard to the amenities of the Black people, should not logic dictate that this should be so for the amenities of the White people too&#x003F; Is it alleged that the White people working for employers are not performing a vital and valuable function&#x003F; Why then should there be this difference&#x003F; And so I say that the fact that this difference is drawn in this year of grace, in the seventies of the twentieth century, shows how outdated and outmoded is the approach of the Government. I say that they are clinging to things which are no longer tenable and that the public realizes this more and more. I must remind the hon. the Deputy Minister that it was said by one of the great Lord Salisburys that the most common mistake in politics was clinging to the carcases of dead policies. This is what the Government is doing in this measure, and this is what the Government is doing throughout so much of its Bantu legislation. These Bantu people are here to stay, they are in our cities on virtually an identical basis with any other section of the population. They like the city life, they like the Western way of life and it is absolutely dreaming to think that this would ever be reversed. Yet we are dealing with a measure which treats this huge section of our population and of our working population on an entirely different basis because of some absolutely outmoded ideas.</p>

<p>I said that this is one of the measures which we can pinpoint as applying pressure to the stranglehold which Government policies have on our economy. We have here in South Africa&#x2014;this was much discussed in the debate on the Part Appropriation Bill and I think in the No-Confidence Debate too&#x2014;the position that our companies are taxed at a rate which is among the highest in the world. There is the rate of taxation plus the loan levy to which they are subject and then on top of it, and as it were, concealed from the eye of the normal observer, we have impositions of this kind. The hon. member for Kensington has shown&#x2014;it is a matter of arithmetic too&#x2014;that here it is possible by virtue of this measure and others too, for the employer of Bantu labour to have to pay an additional R46 per year for every Bantu whom he has in his employ.</p>

<p>This is not an imposition which is taken into account when the rates of taxation among the nations are compared, but this is the sort of extra burden which any intending industrialist will examine when he is considering whether he will establish a factory in South Africa or whether he will extend an existing factory and so forth. No wonder, therefore, that this is having this debilitating effect upon our economy. If one adds to that the extra paper work involved for employers, businesses and companies in coping with the requirements of the Department of Bantu Administration, one realizes how with this red tape they further ensnare the intending industrialist and affect our economy and progress.</p>

<p>Let nobody be under the impression that our progress has been satisfactory. The figures for September, 1971, of the South African Reserve Bank make it absolutely clear that whatever our growth rate overall may have been, our growth rate per head of the population is now worse than Britain&#x2019;s and was the worst in a comparative table of 12 countries set out in those Reserve Bank figures. I think the figure was something in the region of 2,3 per cent per annum. This is entirely unacceptable but apparently acceptable to this Government.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>It is on this note that I want to conclude. Here then is a further and specific measure by the Government which is burdening our economy, which is discouraging investment here, which is discouraging the private investment of which the Government speaks so much. It is commonplace in this Chamber to hear the Government claiming great credit for any progress in our economy and thrusting out their chests. I think in the light of the figure of the 2,3 per cent growth rate <i>per capita</i> they have little right to do this, but they still claim for themselves the credit for any improvements thereon. However, when we get <span class="col_2453-2454" refersTo="page_1244"/>into a position as we are now where the economy is very sluggish and exports are bad, we are always told that it is now up to the private industrialist, the private enterprising man; it is his business to pull us out of this difficulty. Then we hear no suggestion that the Government is to blame; we hear only by implication that that man is not doing what he should be doing. So I say that that man to whom we all look to help us to get our economy where it should be, there is no encouragement in this measure. There is an appreciable increase in the taxation which he must carry for every Bantu employee, there is an extra burden, an increasing extra burden for him in this measure and for that reason too we must oppose this Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to start by referring to two important aspects which have come to the fore in the very prolonged discussion on this Bill dealing with administration costs. The first is that that side of this House has indicated unmistakably that they want a vast amount of Bantu labour, and, what is more, it must be a vast amount of cheap Bantu labour. They must be well-trained. They want the State to house them and to provide them with services. They want them to be integrated in the family context here in the White area. This is what they want. They are continually advocating this. But they are not concerned about where the money is to come from to house that vast amount of cheap labour here in the White area. Then they carry on, as they did during the discussion of this administrative Bill over the past few weeks, as all of us have seen, and they say that the Bantu may flood the White areas in this way and that it does not matter to them; and, in addition, that these Bantu should receive proprietary rights, which does not matter to them either. This is the first standpoint which these debates have indicated very typically.</p>

<p>In contrast to that, we say that we want here in the White areas happy labourers who, in the national context, are integrated with their people in the homelands; that the employee, the employer and the authorities should make a contribution towards creating those happy labour conditions in South Africa; that, in order to do so meaningfully, the Bantu worker should rather be accommodated in his homeland, where he and his family are integrated in the national and in the political context; and that as long as there are separate urban Bantu residential areas, they will be used as long as it is necessary for accommodating those who, for practical reasons, have to come and live here from time to time while they are working here. Therefore it will not necessarily be the same man in the same house or area, but as one becomes unproductive in the White area, he will return to his homeland, and another will then come and work here. I am giving the hon. member for Pinelands, who has just sat down, a reply which goes straight to the heart of the matter, because, as I have told him, our approach is that the Bantu comes here to work. If he comes here to work, he must have a house, because if he does not have a house, we will have the conditions we had under the United Party Government before 1948, conditions of chaos, <i>laissez-faire</i> and all those miseries. For that reason we have submitted this Bill to this House in order to request that the employer will make his rightful contribution to create conditions here where there will be happy labourers within the framework of the policy of multi-national development, where you will be able to provide properly for the administration, housing, services and, as I have said, &#x201C;the whole spectrum&#x201D;. One needs certain basic funds for that. But what happens then is what this House and the country outside has seen, namely that the Opposition kicks up a fuss about this matter. I charge them with this, and I say that we on this side of the House are very clear about the matter. Let hon. members opposite understand very well&#x2014; surely it must be clear&#x2014;that you cannot have a labourer in a White area if you cannot house or accommodate him. Let those hon. members now decide once and for all what they want in regard to this matter. They should do so all the more because they are the people who have a record in this country which proves that they ignored the simple truth that if you have a worker here he must have a house; and if he does not have a house, you have chaos like the Windermeres and the Cook&#x2019;s Bushes and similar conditions that they had here in South Africa. And in the Third Reading this morning, after a long discussion, the two hon. members opposite again advocated the things which they had advocated previously. I think this was really exposing the United Party in a way which simply astounds one. The money this House is being asked to vote at the Third Reading is required in order to establish a stable administration here in the White area. Let everyone in <span class="col_2455-2456" refersTo="page_1245"/>South Africa, including the farmers, housewives and employers, as well as hon. members opposite, know that this Bill and the funds provided by it are necessary so that an effective administration may be established which will not suffer from a chronic shortage of funds, and which will therefore not be restricted, not by unnecessary red tape either. This is our approach and our policy in regard to this matter. Surely it is simple and correct. But what has happened now&#x003F; What has happened here is almost unbelievable. In spite of the fact that this Bill was published on 24th December, 1971, for the information of the general public, and in spite of the fact that my Department and I held not one, but numerous discussions about this matter with all the responsible institutions concerned here, including the Federated Chamber of Commerce and Industries; the Handelsinstituut and others&#x2014;if I add the discussion in Cape Town, we have had five discussions&#x2014;hon. members opposite are still not satisfied. I am being very serious now, because I think it has become time that notice was taken of the reckless ambiguity and, I hope it is parliamentary if I say this, the gangster-like way in which the Opposition &#x2026;</p>

<p>Then I withdraw it, Mr. Speaker, Cognizance must then be taken of the reckless way in which the Opposition dealt with a measure such as this. If, viewed in retrospect, there has ever been a wise step, and I must say that we had many doubts whether it was wise, it was to determine the maximum of this amount at R2,50, knowing that for many years it will not be necessary to levy the full contribution of R2,50. The type of exploitation and discussion we have had in this House recently, and even the deathly element which entered this debate because of the attempts aimed solely at exploitation on the part of that side of the House, are the best proof that this type of thing should be laid before and discussed in this House as little as possible. What has happened&#x003F; I have here in my hand a few newspaper cuttings with headlines such as &#x201C;Workers face new tax&#x201D; in big letters. This was after the Bill had been published for general information. The truth of the matter is that the Bantu worker is not being taxed here at all and this therefore indicates the ambiguous way in which this matter is being presented.</p>

<p>With reference to this specific prominent front-page report, while it is an infamous lie, as this House also knows, that the worker pays nothing, except in exceptional cases where he works for himself and has his own undertaking and these are only a small percentage &#x2026;</p>

<p>Then they went further. It is almost unbelievable what is going on in the country now that that Opposition is running before the wind as they are doing. If ever there has been people who are going to have a hard fall, it is the Opposition. If this country can afford the sort of action by the Opposition that we have had in respect of this Bill, I say it deserves only the worst. In consequence of the discussion on this Bill and the way in which it has been presented, I want to make the charge against that Opposition that the irresponsible way in which they exploit ordinary administrative matters for political gain, is going to bring down something on this country and specifically on them which will be a great pity for South Africa. The sooner the public realizes how recklessly the Opposition is acting in this regard, the better. What did they say&#x003F; Listen to this. On 31st December, 1971, after these absolutely unprecedented false rumours had been sent into the country for political gain and in order to try to benefit that side, a leading article appeared in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> under the heading: &#x201C;Blueprint for economic suicide&#x201D;. This is in connection with just an ordinary administrative measure. I would not waste the time of this House by indicating this type of thing if I did not want to indicate at the same time how that Opposition unthinkingly, echoed this newspaper like parrots in this House in regard to that matter. The House must just listen how outrageous this article under the heading &#x201C;Blueprint for economic suicide&#x201D; is. After the matter had been discussed and the country knew what was happening here, this newspaper stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Botha is obviously anchoring for a position from which he would be able to present the bigger employer of African labour with the ultimatum of either paying his new tax or moving out to the Bantustan fringes to escape it.</block>

<p>Continuing, they said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The prospect must be that many firms will go under, simply because their profits have become so marginal already.</block>

<p>The impression is created that firms will go under in South Africa as a result of this administrative levy in respect of Bantu labour for which the approval of this House is being sought. They went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The pursuit of separate development needs to be backed by a super economy. That is hardly the state of the nation today. Glib calculations may project a book profit&#x2026;</block>

<p>As a result of this levy&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; of R100 million and more a year for Bantu administration should Mr. Botha&#x2019;s proposal go through.</block>

<p>Allow me to say in the final instance that against this background a very important thing happened in this debate yesterday and today. Initially I thought that it was really a lapse. The hon. member for Transkei referred here to a levy of R2,50 per week. This morning that hon. member went so far as to suggest that the levy would be R46 per month. I say that we have here an Opposition which, in its exploitation of simple administrative matters, is becoming a disgrace to South Africa.</p>

<heading>SERVICES RENDERED BY DEPARTMENT OF INFORMATION</heading>

<speech by="#smit">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move the following motion as it appears under my name on the Order Paper&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(1) expresses its sincere gratitude to the Government, the Department of Information and its officials for the excellent services which they are rendering with perseverance in putting South Africa&#x2019;s case; and</li>

<li>(2) again directs attention to the importance of the task of this Department to disseminate knowledge and understanding of South Africa both abroad and among our indigenous national groups.</li>

</ol>

<p>In doing this, I should like to make an appeal to hon. members on both sides of the House to maintain the discussion of this motion on a high level. I am doing this in the first place because frequently in the past discussions on this subject have been of a negative nature. I am also doing this because it concerns people, South Africans, who are fighting in the front lines for their country abroad. They deserve the gratitude of this highest assembly of the country and are people who are entitled not to have destructive criticism levelled at them in their quiet and dedicated labours, into which they put a great deal of energy. The Department of Information has just celebrated its 10th anniversary. These have been 10 years of great progress, and 10 years in which it has extended its activities over a large part of the world. Its activities in South Africa as well have been extended tremendously over the past 10 years. The results of its work cannot be measured in terms of rands and cents, in the form of revenue, but can only be determined in terms of attitudes which have improved, attitudes towards South Africa and also attitudes within South Africa. Although this criterion is not a general, everyday criterion, I want to say that we have every reason to congratulate this department on the extent to which it has succeeded in improving attitudes towards South Africa and also in causing reciprocal attitudes in our own country to improve. If one considers the establishment of this department, with its tremendous and comprehensive task, it is with surprise that one notes that it has a total of only 464 staff members. Of these only 200 are professional officers and 18 are technical officers, in other words, the people who actually have to perform this particular task. One feels then that one would like to make the best use of an occasion such as this to convey the deep-felt appreciation of this Parliament and of our country to these people who have this difficult and complicated task of stating South Africa&#x2019;s case in the outside world. During the past recess many of us had the opportunity of visiting various overseas countries and of making the personal acquaintance, during those visits, of the officials of the Department of Information and of becoming acquainted with their problems and with the particular circumstances under which they have to do their work. Sir, I do not think that anyone will contradict me when I say that theirs is one of the most <span class="col_2461-2462" refersTo="page_1248"/>difficult tasks imaginable for a South African to perform.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>You are dead right.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#smit">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says I am dead right; I am glad she agrees. Mr. Speaker, I want to go further and state that all of us who had the opportunity of making contact on an extensive scale with our officials of the Department of Information in overseas countries will agree that they are without exception people who are serving this country with the greatest dedication, and I want to congratulate the Minister of Information and his department on their choice of the men who are fighting for South Africa on the front lines there. In the past derogatory remarks have been made here, but I think that everyone will agree this morning that those men, who are quietly doing their work without inflating their own image, who are inspired by the motive of serving South Africa in spite of any set-backs they may experience, are truly one of the most dedicated groups of officials we have to serve this country. I want to congratulate the Department of Information on what it is achieving in a very wide sphere of its activities; with its wonderful publications of which almost 2 million appear monthly in 51 different forms. In the forefront is the prestige publication, South African <i>Panorama,</i> which has made a name for itself throughout most of the Western world, and for which there is a very great demand from various sources. I believe that this publication <i>Panorama</i> is an advertisement for South Africa, an advertisement which stimulates greater interest in South Africa, and which encourages people who are interested in South Africa to obtain other publications as well from the Department of Information. I want to congratulate and convey my gratitude to the department for the way in which it is stating South Africa&#x2019;s case in each particular country according to the circumstances in and the idiom of that country. Mr. Speaker, this requires long hours from people who have to convey information from this country to the local Press and organizations abroad, in the language and idiom of that country. I wonder whether all of us are always aware of what it requires in terms of man hours and concentration to present that image of South Africa in such an exceptional way. In particular I want to congratulate the Department of Information on the fact that its representatives, particularly in overseas countries, do not throw up their hands in despair and admit defeat when they receive set-backs, as often happens to them with the hostile newspapers which believe only the worst about South Africa and with other mass media which are not prepared to convey a positive or a balanced image of South Africa; that they, a handful of people, still see their way clear to conveying a positive image of South Africa there. Few of us have an understanding of how they set about their task; of how, through personal liaison, by building up personal relationships, they eventually succeed in getting through to organizations to whom it is important to convey the image of South Africa. Those of us who came into contact with them have the highest respect for the way in which they are succeeding in their task, and I think it is necessary that we inform this House that those men enjoy the respect of the people among whom they move, not only those people who are sympathetic towards South Africa, but also of those people who disagree with us in the strongest terms. It says a great deal for our men there that their personalities and the way in which they state South Africa s case is respected by all. I think that the degree of success we have achieved and the improvement in attitudes in recent years can be attributed to the quality of the men representing South Africa there.</p>

<p>The work of our Department of Information covers such a wide field that one can scarcely mention all of it, but one is impressed by the way in which our information officers overseas are of assistance in regard to exhibitions and important functions which are actually requested by other departments, such as the Department of Commerce and other organizations, but which our officials of the Department of Information, with their technical knowledge and skill, undertake. One is grateful that they are conveying South Africa s image in such a wonderful way. They ensure that our activities in many fields receive attention, but at the same time there is cognizance of the fact that living here in South Africa is a highly civilized nation. They see to it that our cultural activities are held in high esteem in the Western world, and they realize that the scenic beauty of South Africa is something which should not necessarily have an effect on us alone, but is also attractive to other people. One thinks here of the way in which our beautiful <span class="col_2463-2464" refersTo="page_1249"/>wild flowers have come into their own in overseas countries. I think that some of the best ambassadors South Africa has are our beautiful wild flowers. One thinks of the way in which they are doing justice to our South African art, and to other aspects of our South African way of life.</p>

<p>When one is expressing gratitude to these dedicated men, it is also necessary to bring the importance of this particular task of the Department of Information to the attention of the House again. Perhaps not all of us are all that well-informed about what the functions of this department comprise. You will probably forgive me, Mr. Speaker, if I also express ideas on this occasion which, I think, ought to receive the support of this House, in order to facilitate the task of the Department of Information. I am speaking as a person who takes an intense interest in the security of my country. I take an interest in all the spheres in which we have to maintain our security. I believe that, as we must have a Defence Force and a Police Force, so we must also have a Department of Information, for the Department of Information is in fact the front line of defence for our security and stability. I think that the extent to which this front line can succeed in its task, will be the extent to which the work of the other organizations which also have to look after the security of our country can be alleviated.</p>

<p>If one encounters criticism abroad and even within South Africa to the effect that the Department of Information is not doing enough, I want to dispute this and say that, with the manpower it has at its disposal, it is doing more than is humanly possible. But I want to add to that that one does in fact get the impression that it is frequently hampered by a lack of funds. We are living in times in which we must save, and in which all State Departments have to submit to the pruning shears, but here is a particular sphere in which I believe that we should not spare the necessary means which have to be utilized. I was very pleased to hear from the hon. member for Orange Grove last year during the discussion of the Information Vote that he also agreed that the visit of the hon. the Minister to various offices of his department abroad, which was then imminent, would be worthwhile if it achieved the necessary results, even if it were to cost R20 000. I am glad the hon. member agreed, and now I want to say to the hon. member that I hope he is also able to agree this morning that that visit by the Minister and his departmental heads to the various offices abroad more than justified the cost and the trouble. Those men who are skirmishing for South Africa in the front lines cannot perform their task in isolation. Inevitably they have to be thousands of miles away from our country. But if there is one type of man in the front lines who must be able to remain in the closest possible contact with what is happening in South Africa then it is these men from the Department of Information. That is why I believe that those of us who also had an opportunity of visiting those offices and staff members a few months after the hon. the Minister, realize what the visit from the Minister and his departmental heads was worth to them. But I also believe that it should be made possible for those men to pay more frequent personal visits to South Africa, and not only to return every three years on home leave in terms of the stereotype Public Service regulations. If funds are a problem, we must give our attention to this matter. These men who have to perform that task must be placed in a position to return home more frequently, even if it is only for a short visit, to breathe the atmosphere here, which fluctuates tremendously, themselves; but apart from that, the opportunity should also be there for the hon. the Minister and his chief officials and others to maintain annual and regular contact with these men. This is the only way in which we can strengthen their hands, the hands which have so frequently in the past been tied by people in this country. I think that the hands of those men, who are not interested in blowing their own trumpets, should be strengthened by making this close contact possible, for that is the nervous system of the work they have to do.</p>

<p>I also believe that the regular overseas visits of members of Parliament should continue and that it should be a special directive to members of Parliament to make contact with the officials of the Department of Information in overseas countries, and not only to make contact by going to bid them good morning, but by conducting long and penetrating conversations with them, because they need it. When I say this, I do not mean only members on the Government side, but also members on the Opposition side, as they have already done. Our men in overseas countries convey a balanced image of South Africa. They emphasize at all times that we are not a one-party state, as President Kaunda now wants <span class="col_2465-2466" refersTo="page_1250"/>to turn Zambia into, but that we are a democratic country where we have an Opposition and where we have freedom of expression, and that free discussions take place in our public Press in South Africa. That is why they should also be in contact with members of the Opposition to hear their standpoint as well, and they, too, I think, should avail themselves of that opportunity.</p>

<p>You learn quickly.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#smit">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says I learn quickly. I do not want to steer this debate to another level, but I want to tell her that I think she also learnt a good deal when she was overseas.</p>

<p>Another aspect I should like to emphasize, is the choice of guests of the department who come to this country. I think this matter receives a great deal of attention, for the people who were guests of the department in South Africa return to their own countries with at least a better understanding of our special situation. I think there are very few people who were here as guests and who returned to their own countries with a hostile impression.</p>

<p>In conclusion I should just like to say a few words about the latest branch or division of this department, i.e. the Press Liaison Division. When this division was established a few years ago, there was negative comment as well, but I am grateful to be able to say that it has already become clear at this stage that not only are they meeting an essential need today, but that they are doing their work with distinction. We have already had two Press conferences given by the Prime Minister, and according to the evidence of all journalists&#x2014;including those from abroad&#x2014;these were a brilliant success and compared very well with similar conferences elsewhere in the world. Apart from that there is something which we probably do not always realize, and that is that the staff of the Press Liaison Division are not only there to arrange these conferences, but that smaller Press conferences take place every day.</p>

<p>Unbeknown to us these people are doing the organizational work, frequently long before the time, necessary to ensure that important things which happen here go off smoothly. It is their task to make the necessary arrangements which have to be made in the case of important visits which are being paid, of which we shall shortly have another example. They have succeeded in building up relations with our local Press and also the foreign Press present here or who come here occasionally so that it is appreciated that there is a good liaison here between the authorities and the Press. I think few of us realize what this division of the department in fact means for ensuring, by means of good liaison, to convey South Africa&#x2019;s image to the wider world, in order to ensure that we are not seen, as is alleged in some hostile circles, as a dictatorial state in which we do not have freedom of expression. They are building up an understanding, and I want to advocate today that there should be understanding and more understanding for the great task which this Press Liaison Division is performing.</p>

<p>I do not want to take up any more time of the House. I therefore want to advocate that since we have such an opportunity we should bring the great and sacrificial work, but also the dedicated work which this department is performing for our country prominently to the attention of our people.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think we all listened attentively to the speech made by the hon. member for Stellenbosch. It is not necessary for us to repeat our well-known standpoint on the Department of Information, which is, firstly, that we are in favour of good, impartial information that will state South Africa s case well; secondly, that we are opposed to a one-sided and crude type of propaganda; thirdly, that we believe there should be greater co-ordination among the various Government departments in this regard; and fourthly, that we believe in South Africa&#x2019;s case and will support anything which strengthens that case.</p>

<p>I have said that I listened attentively to the speech made by the hon. member, but it seems to me as if the feeling in the country, and the feeling among prominent Nationalists as well, about the work being done by the department is perhaps not as strongly in favour as his was. Hon. members probably read in a recent edition of <i>Rapport</i>&#x2014;it was the edition of 20th February this year&#x2014;that Adv. Dawid de Villiers suggested that a new body should be established to further the Republic&#x2019;s case abroad. It is known that Adv. &#x201C;Lang&#x201D; Dawid de Villiers is a highly respected man in the circles of the party over there. What he says as general manager of Nasionale Pers is what the enormous Sanlam complex <span class="col_2467-2468" refersTo="page_1251"/>said the day before and what the hon. the Prime Minister and the party will say the next day. I therefore hope that we will hear something from the hon. the Minister of Information in this connection. [Interjections.] I do not know whether the hon. members are criticizing me now or Adv. De Villiers, but I shall now read what Adv. De Villiers said &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I quote (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What is also lacking is central coordination of the efforts of all, and those of the State Departments, particularly Foreign Affairs and Information, who have to do with the outside world. I have for a long time been pleading for a central bureau in which the resources may be pooled with a view to all the necessary research, collection of material and training of persons for conducting South Africa&#x2019;s struggle in the outside world. It must be an institute to which, for example, young diplomats, information representatives, even informal ambassadors, etc., may be sent for assistance and training.</block>

<p>I do not necessarily want to go as far as that, but I say that there must be greater co-ordination in this regard and more intensive training in regard to what we are able to present to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Furthermore, the hon. member for Stellenbosch pontificated in the grand manner, which he is so able to do, in praising, not so much the Government, and very rarely the Minister, as the members of the department itself. One could almost imagine him reading from an illuminated address. One could hear the Gothic vowels and consonants in what he was telling us. What an encomium, what a panegyric, what impeccable and unquestionable homage to his own Government! But it did seem to be a bit like a Hamlet without the prince, because I do not think I heard more than one passing sentence of thanks to the Minister himself for what he has been doing. I do not think there is much reason for thanking the Minister, and possibly the hon. member was right in not thanking him too much. But I must say that where he is, one might say, the first reserve for the post of the present hon. Minister, one would at least have expected him to say a few more kind words about the Minister himself. You see, Sir, the hon. member for Stellenbosch is reasonably &#x201C;verlig&#x201D;, while the hon. Minister for Information is unreasonably &#x201C;verkramp&#x201D;, as we all know. Why, he has been so &#x201C;verkramp&#x201D; that he even satisfies the hon. member for Waterberg. Possibly the hon. member for Stellenbosch was saying to himself: &#x201C;How can South Africa&#x2019;s case be put abroad by a Minister who is basically verkramp while I am more verlig&#x003F; How can the Minister actually, with his admitted conservative views, reflect the new so-called &#x201C;verligte&#x201D; thinking in the Nationalist Party&#x003F; How can he, the Minister, who is also Minister of Immigration and has not been too successful in persuading people from other countries to come to South Africa, persuade people of other countries to think otherwise of South Africa&#x003F; How is it possible that the hon. Minister, who was also a violent opponent in the past of television, a great proponent of the &#x201C;Broederbond&#x201D; type of education, and a close crony of the Hertzog-Jaap Marais faction, which has now disappeared from the House, represent Government policy better than I can&#x003F;&#x201D; I think the hon. member for Stellenbosch thinks, not without justification, that he could do that. Well, Sir, I therefore would like partly to interpret the frustrations and assist in the removal thereof from the hon. member for Stellenbosch, and mainly indicate the policy of the United Party and our view of his motion by moving the following amendment:</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute:</block>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;this House&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(1) expresses its desire that a proper understanding of South Africa abroad be achieved; and</li>

<li>(2) again directs attention to the importance of the task of the Department of Information, which is to disseminate accurate and balanced information about South Africa&#x201D;.</li>

</ol>

<p>Much of what is asked in this motion of the hon. member will be discussed and might with even greater profit have been discussed under the Vote of the hon. the <span class="col_2469-2470" refersTo="page_1252"/>Minister. However, as we are here to discuss this particular motion, I hope I shall be permitted to present a few thoughts on the matter.</p>

<p>First of all, I believe that despite the visit of the hon. the Minister abroad, a great deal of our propaganda overseas is by no means as effective as it could be and as it should be. I am glad to see that there is more subtlety in regard to a great deal of what is spread overseas in writing. I cannot judge too well from films and Press interviews, etc. It seems to me as if after all these years the advice contained in a document I have here, has been taken to heart by the Government. Hon. members opposite will not be surprised to know that it is a secret document and they will therefore know from what secret body it comes. More than 25 years ago this document spoke about the way that propaganda should be conducted and it said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">By ons sal die propaganda so fyntjies ingewerk moet word dat dit nie opgemerk word nie.</block>

<p>This is what this secret society, which shall for the present be nameless&#x2014;I shall name it in my motion this afternoon&#x2014;advised a long time ago and it seems to me as if the hon. the Minister is now taking that advice to heart. I looked up some of the material that is being spread abroad and it did seem to me as if it is sometimes over-subtle in its emphasis. I have here, for instance, something that is spread abroad, in Austria, with the name of <i>Heute Aus S&#x00FC;dafrika</i> and I find that one of the three topics in this publication trying to persuade Austria and Germany to take a more favourable view of South Africa, has the caption &#x201C;B&#x00FC;ffel adoptieren jungen Elefanten&#x201D;. Wonderful, a buffalo has adopted a young elephant! This article occupies one-third of this publication. The other two are about the increased export of South African fruit and about an art triennial in Johannesburg.</p>

<p>It is subtle, but it is so subtlety that I cannot quite understand of what use it is going to be. Perhaps the hon. the Minister can explain it to us. I have here another very subtle publication which is issued to France with the title &#x201C;<i>L&#x2019;Afrique du Sud d&#x2019;aujourd&#x2019;hui&#x201D;.</i> It contains an article with the title &#x201C;ou vont les Hirondelles&#x003F;&#x201D;&#x2014;Where do the swallows go&#x003F; He is telling the French about the birds, and next he will be telling them about the bees. After that France will know what South Africa can tell it about the birds and the bees. It is excellent, a very nice article, but I do not quite understand how this supreme subtlety is going to influence the rest of the world with regard to our point of view.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Stellenbosch spoke about the great success that has been achieved by the Government in regard to people who have been invited to South Africa at the taxpayer&#x2019;s expense. In some cases I believe good work was done, but I am a bit doubtful about the persuasive powers of the hon. the Minister, who must have seen some of the prominent people from abroad who came here. In <i>Elseviers,</i> the biggest magazine in Holland, of the 11th December, 1971, one reads of an interview granted by Senator Harm van Riel.</p>

<p>*Senator Van Riel is a Dutch Senator who came to South Africa and had interviews with leading members of the Department, and possibly with the hon. the Minister as well. On his return he granted <i>Elseviers</i> this particular interview. It amazes me to see all the things appearing in this, and I wonder how he was informed. I want to quote from this interview. Firstly, he says that he does not think guerilla warfare will succeed in South Africa because, <i>inter alia</i> (translation), &#x201C;all the dwelling-places of Africans (i.e. the Bantu) are built in such a way that no street is longer than 50 metres, and therefore directly open to guns. I had not thought that they had organized matters so well&#x201D;. I think this is nonsense. What did the hon. the Minister tell Senator Van Riel&#x003F; Of the Security Police he says (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They are perfectly organized. The Security Police are present everywhere via a network of paid informants. South Africa smacks gruesomely of the Orwellian system, with Prime Minister Vorster as Big Brother.</block>

<p>After all, we paid a pretty penny to bring Senator Van Riel to South Africa for him to say this on his return. I can quote further from this interview. He tells how a person is bade farewell at Jan Smuts Airport when he is deported from the country. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_2471-2472" refersTo="page_1253"/>If, as a foreigner, you pose a threat to the system, you are deported from the country ever so sweetly. A captain of police escorts you to the aircraft, but first you get some coffee and a cigar &#x2026;</block>

<p>A cigar as well; that is nice&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and a handshake from a general and then you must be on your way.</block>

<p>I think our well-known and famous university in Bloemfontein may also be interested in what Senator Van Riel said about them after his return from South Africa. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><i>Concerning student life</i>: In Bloemfontein student behaviour is severely restrained.</block>

<p>It is strictly controlled&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">However, if one goes into matters a little more deeply, it appears that the &#x201C;old-fashionedness&#x201D; of the Afrikaans universities is not so much related to the inner nature of the students, neither as regards their religious character nor as regards male/female relationships. As one of the professors told me, at his university the automobile is a very successful substitute in the dark for &#x201C;lits-ju-meaux&#x201D;.</block>

<p>That is a double bed.</p>

<p>I am just pointing out how incorrect the information in the <i>Time,</i> one might say, the <i>News Week</i> of America, is in this connection. So much for the propaganda and other methods abroad. But I want to tell the hon. the Minister that on the whole more good than bad is done in this connection. However, my big objection to this department and to the hon. the Minister is the way in which the Department of Information is used for the dissemination of one-sided propaganda among the Bantu in South Africa.</p>

<p>&#x2020;If hon. members want to see how lopsided this department is in regard to that, they need only look at the reply given to me on 7th February by the hon. the Minister in this House. I asked him about the set-up in his department. I could work out from the reply the number of officials dealing with South African propaganda and the number of officials dealing with propaganda abroad. We find that of the very top officials, 12 are stationed in South Africa and 10 abroad. That is understandable and I accept that you need more top officials in this country. But when you look at the next very high grade of official, namely the grade of chief information officer, &#x201C;hoofinligtingsbeampte&#x201D;, you find that there are 10 in South Africa and only 9 abroad. When you come to the next very high grade, namely the senior information officer, you find that there are 23 in South Africa and only 9 abroad. When you come to the ordinary information officers you find that there are 21 in South Africa and only 3 abroad. These do not necessarily indicate the exact numbers. It indicates the places where they are stationed. Let me rather put it this way: 23 places versus 3 for information officers in South Africa, 23 versus 9 places for senior information officers and so forth, as I have already indicated. This indicates a very lopsided state of affairs in this country. I can hardly see that there can be no complaints, as the hon. the Minister told me at one stage, about the work done by the information officers. We had from Chief Buthelezi a statement in the Press saying that he was being followed about by Government officials. I trust the hon. the Minister will be able to tell us that they were not people of the Department of information. The type of information he has been getting cannot be too good if one sees what has been happening at Owamboland. I wish to conclude by saying that although we would support any improvement in the work of the department, we feel that enough is not being done.</p>

<p><i>Afternoon Sitting</i></p>

<speech by="#van_zyl">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we listened this morning to a most excellent speech by the hon. member for Stellenbosch, who put his motion in a very positive, penetrating and constructive way. The hon. member also appealed to this House to keep it on a high level. I think the Department of Information is indeed one of our departments which has to keep South Africa on that level.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove entered this debate and I really thought he <span class="col_2473-2474" refersTo="page_1254"/>would keep the debate on a high level. I just want to quote one point which he mentioned. The hon. member had quite a lot to say about the officials of the Department of Bantu Affairs in particular. I just want to quote what the hon. member said in this House on 26th April last year. Referring to the hon. the Minister of Information he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I hope the hon. the Minister will soon explain through his 67 Bantu officers in the Bantu areas what exactly is going to happen now when requests are made for further independence for certain of the future independent states.</block>

<p>At that stage the hon. member was glad that there were so many officials&#x2014;that was what he wanted, but today he tries to disparage them.</p>

<p>You cannot understand sarcasm.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>Actually I pity this hon. member. My humane feelings come to the fore; I pity him for having had to endure years of frustration. Because he thought in 1948 that he was going to become head of the State Information Service, but he did not. It makes me recall what the former member for Waterberg said here one day when he had to speak after this hon. member. The hon. member for Waterberg then said that the hon. member for Orange Grove reminded him of what the angel said to Hagar, namely &#x201C;Thou shalt bear a son &#x2026; he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man&#x2019;s hand against him.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is an honour and I am very proud and glad to be able to second this motion by my hon. colleague. We have a department here with first-class officials and with one of the most competent men in South Africa, the hon. the Minister of Information, at its head. I wonder why this hon. member did not fefer to what the hon. the Minister achieved on his overseas tour. It is really unprecedented in history for one of our Ministers to have been able to have an interview with the Vice-President of the United States of America. What excellent work was done there! What good service South Africa was rendered! That is not mentioned by this hon. member, however. I do not want to enlarge on that any further, but we are glad to have such a Minister who is inspired by his task and that the competent officials of the department, in South Africa and abroad, are doing such good work.</p>

<p>My time is very short, unfortunately, as a result of the division we had after 12. Still, I just want to point out a few excellent services rendered by this department. My hon. colleague spoke of what was being done abroad. Now we know all that is being done there. Let us look for a moment at what is being done in South Africa. Every month this department distributes 1 800 000 copies of the 51 publications regularly published by the department. Twenty-eight of those publications are sent abroad, while 17 of these regular publications are meant for South Africa. Everything is done by this department to convey to the outside world the policy, not of the National Party, but of the Government of the day, of the State, of South Africa. I think the way in which it is being done and the extent to which they are succeeding is fantastic. It cannot be compared with anything else. We know, too, what the task of the Department of Information is in regard to the various peoples in South Africa. Their task is to convey information to the various population groups&#x2014;to the Bantu, the Coloured people, the Indians and, of course, the Whites. The good work is carried on abroad on various levels, for example, by means of personal contact with individuals, groups and societies. It is also done by means of regular publications, newspapers, magazines and television. These facts are just concealed. We know that all these services have to be rendered out of the budget of R6 700 000 which this department has available to it. Despite the small amount available for it, offices are kept up in 17 of the world&#x2019;s capitals and from those strongholds the good work is carried on. We also think of the guest programme in terms of which people are brought to South Africa from abroad. In this way there were 167 official guests and 553 visitors in South Africa on 31st March last year who were dealt with by this department. Under the care of the department those visitors received the necessary insight and guidance.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove just apologized. I pardon him, but I just want to refer to what he read out about what was said by one of the visitors to South Africa. I want to point out the way in which the hon. member read it out, that <span class="col_2475-2476" refersTo="page_1255"/>a visitor had said that he had been decently treated when he was deported from South Africa; he received a handshake, coffee, and so on. It galls the hon. member that South Africa can act in such a proper and decent way. I wonder what he expected. Should we have seized the man by the hair and dragged him to the aircraft with his feet trailing on the ground, or what&#x003F; South Africa, this department and its Minister know their duty and their manners and they know how to behave decently.</p>

<p>In respect of the Bantu in our country this department is performing a tremendous task. We see that there are several publications. We think, for example, of the <i>Bantu Education Journal</i> which is published in Pretoria every month. This journal, of which 30 000 copies are printed, is positive and to the advantage of our Bantu. No-one has ever complained about that journal and said that it was not a good journal. I want the hon. members who are going to follow me to say whether that journal or any other publication by this department is not good. We think of the monthly publication <i>Bantu,</i> of which 74 000 copies are printed. In this publication the policy of the Government is conveyed to the various Bantu groups. Excellent work is being done, and considering the limited staff, we can only say thank you for that. We think of the <i>Progress</i> series which is published. There are seven monthly periodicals which are published in Zulu, Xhosa, Tsonga, Venda, North and South Sotho and Tswana. They have a total circulation of more than 400 000 a month. Then there are also seven newspapers which are published regularly, and the series of films which are available to the Bantu. Then the hon. member comes along and says that one-sided propaganda is being made among the Bantu! No propaganda is being made. What propaganda can we make there&#x003F; After all, they do not have the vote to elect representatives in this House. I want to emphasize repeatedly today that only excellent work is being done by this department.</p>

<p>What is this department doing in respect of the other population group the Coloured people&#x003F; For them, too, there is a monthly with a circulation of 19 000, namely <i>Alpha.</i> This is just as excellent a piece of work. In this way we have the various newspapers as well. We think of the small journal Taak which is published in Afrikaans and English and which looks after the interests of the Coloured people and the Rehoboth citizens and manages their affairs. In this way there are several publications for the Coloured people as well. I am thinking of two other publications: <i>&#x2019;n Bedeling vir Vooruitgang van Rehoboth</i> and <i>Hulp vir die Vooruitgang van Rehoboth-burgers.</i> Those are very good publications. Those who have not read them yet should really get copies of them. We also think of the film series which was made for the Coloured people.</p>

<p>Then there is also the Indian group. What is being done for the Indians in South Africa&#x003F; There is the <i>Fiat Lux,</i> for example, a Durban monthly of which 12 600 copies are printed. At the moment more copies are being printed. This is a monthly for the Indians. It is a positive publication and it contains no one-sided propaganda or anything which is not to the advantage of South Africa. We also have a series of films which was completed in 1971, namely <i>Indian South Africans.</i> That is also a good film. We also think of the other publications which are issued. The good and positive side of this department is not mentioned by the Opposition, however. We can leave the hon. member for Orange Grove there, and we hope we are going to get positive contributions from other hon. members who are going to speak this afternoon.</p>

<p>There are a few more matters I wanted to mention and I want to refer to just one of them, namely the new <i>Quiz</i> which has been made available. Formerly the old <i>South African Quiz</i> was provided, which was a small book containing very little information. In its place we have now received <i>This is South Africa.</i> This is a splendid and excellent periodical which has now appeared. This periodical is very positive and contains only facts. If there is anything in this periodical which I am now holding which does not present South Africa in a positive light, or which can be criticized adversely by any Opposition member, I should like to know what it contains that can be criticized as being negative. This little book is a pleasure to handle and you can easily put it on your shelf. It will not easily get lost among your papers so that you have to look for it either.</p>

<p>Finally I want to say that South Africa is indeed fortunate in many respects. We have a beautiful country and a rich country as regards mineral resources and <span class="col_2477-2478" refersTo="page_1256"/>people. One must also have an Opposition, however, which adopts a positive attitude, an Opposition which is prepared to tell this department and this Minister, &#x201C;carry on your good work&#x201D; even if they do not want to say, &#x201C;Thank you for the good work you have done.&#x201D; It is a great privilege to me to support this motion.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is quite clear that it has become a recognized custom or a tactic in this House, on the part of the Government members, to have motions of this kind debated with the express purpose&#x2014;and I think it is a reasonable purpose&#x2014;of providing the Minister with an opportunity of making a public statement on the matters under discussion. I must confess that the habit has also grown with the years&#x2014;a habit in terms of which the Minister concerned generally puts himself in an impressive light and produces a lot of figures and suggests that all is well in the best of all possible worlds. It may be a very enjoyable exercise, but it does not really get us very far. The sad thing here is that no matter what hon. members on that side of the House or the hon. Minister may say on the subject of disseminating what the hon. member for Stellenbosch describes in his motion as knowledge and understanding in South Africa, the Minister and his department, I regret to say, are thoroughly ineffectual and wasting many opportunities in this field. Later on I would like to mention some of the opportunities of which they could make use. We on the Opposition benches feel that it is due without doubt to the fact that it is very difficult to defend many of the Government&#x2019;s domestic policies adequately overseas. They are difficult to explain or difficult to justify. This has had the result that with regard to our information services many of our overseas information offices have been adopting a defensive attitude in the presentation of the Government&#x2019;s case. I think this is unfortunate because it succeeds neither in bluffing nor convincing anyone in the end. I am now speaking of the department&#x2019;s dissemination of knowledge and understanding of South Africa abroad, not in our own country. Knowledge of course is one thing and understanding is quite another. Where facts are selectively chosen for propaganda purposes, and every Government in the world does it, and where they are set out in these little pamphlets and statistical tables, of course that is a good job of work. However, only half the job is being done. If understanding by people abroad is what we want, which is presumably the case and which the hon. member specifically mentioned, it can only come by generating a sympathetic approach to, and an acceptance of, the complexity of our problems. Our attempts to solve them necessitate an admission from time to time that we do not necessarily have all the answers. I would like to know from the hon. the Minister whether any of his officers overseas are free to suggest that we have problems with which we are struggling and which we are facing as courageously as we can &#x2026;</p>

<p>Are they&#x003F; Oh no, I am afraid that is not the impression I get. If we could do that, it would do us a great deal of good. The Department of information as presently constituted should, in the first place, devote a lot more time and thought to the anticipation of arguments that will be used against us by our enemies overseas. This is very seldom done as far as I can make out. A lot of the heat would be taken out of the attack against us if we could do this. I want to name one example. If after a general election people overseas were given the figures of the <i>per capita</i> vote obtained by different parties, and if samples of the local Press comments on the election results were published, it would help a lot. After the experiences that I have had, I cannot emphasize enough that this would bring home to those who are innately suspicious of our whole political process, firstly that South Africans are very much divided in their political thinking&#x2014;this is a good thing and not a bad thing&#x2014;secondly, that normal democratic voting practices do take place here&#x2014;an awful lot of people do not believe that&#x2014;and, thirdly &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>No, I think it would help to bring this to their attention. It is exactly what the hon. member for Stellenbosch has said. I agree with it. Thirdly, the world outside can be shown that our Press and our reporters are free to lobby for, or to condemn, whoever they choose. Unfortunately that is not how matters are always handled overseas. I do want to say that a really balanced picture <span class="col_2479-2480" refersTo="page_1257"/>is not very often given by our Department of Information. I think it is true to say that our Government&#x2019;s basic attitude in preparing and disseminating information about South Africa overseas is, firstly, that the Government is always right, secondly, that their intentions and their policies, especially in regard to race relations, are ethical, just and eminently fair and are in fact above reproach. Thirdly, they create, the impression that we are a country of exceptional peace and tranquility compared to everybody else. Very few people overseas accept these things. Well then, the question for us, not as parties, but as a country, is how the situation should be handled. Paradoxical as it may sound, people overseas would be a lot less likely to abuse us, a lot less breeding ground is likely to be created for agitation against us and there would be a lot less concern about us if they knew not merely slanted facts, but the real ones. It is a question of striking a balance. My second major point, arising out of what I have just said, is that we do not have a public relations system which is sufficiently sophisticated nor a staff of public relations experts with professional training in this field, however competent and good the present officers may be and even though they have had journalistic experience or whatever it may be. Our information offices overseas are not run on the most effective modern basis in terms of the situation in the world and they are not sufficiently effective to contend adequately with the power and the prestige of the public communications media we are faced with overseas. I think it is a great mistake to imagine that everyone in Britain or the United States, for instance, is totally ignorant of South African affairs. The hon. Minister must know this. A great number of people know a great many facts about us, but the general public in those countries is largely brainwashed by a consistently hostile Press. It makes it difficult for any ordinary citizen in countries like that to come to a balanced conclusion about us because they seldom if ever hear anything except the one side which is nearly always hostile. Putting the other side is our job. It is not only the job of the Minister and his department, but it is also the job of all of us who go overseas and pay visits there to be good ambassadors for our country. I did it last year, as hon. members know, for three months in the United States. I want to put to the House the admirable view, that was mentioned by the hon. member for Orange Grove, put forward by Adv. Dawid de Villiers, chairman of the United States &#x2014;South Africa Leadership Exchange Committee. He is a man of great experience in this field. He made a speech when he addressed the Potchefstroom Centre of International Political Study. I refer to the report that was published in <i>Rapport</i> of the 20th February this year. The hon. member is probably familiar with this report. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Adv. de Villiers het ges&#x00EA; daar is organisasies in die buiteland wat hulle in die buiteland voltyds daarop toel&#x00E9; om navorsing te doen oor Suid-Afrika. Die doel daarvan is om ons aan te val met feite wat in baie gevalle korrek en in sommige skeef voorgestel word. Die gevolg is dat daar van Suid-Afrika se kant behoorlik teruggeveg moet word.</block>

<p>I quite agree with him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Al hoe meer deeglike studie en navorsing van ons kant is nodig. Ons moet kyk na die metode van ons teenstanders, die tersaaklike feite, die ware toedrag van sake in die verskillende vakkundige velde wat bygehaal word.</block>

<p>Then he goes on and says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Maar wat nog ontbreek, is &#x2019;n sentrale koordinering van almal se pogings en di&#x00E9; van die Staatsdepartement wat by die stryd na buite betrokke is, veral Buitelandse Sake en Inligting.</block>

<p>Then he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ek bepleit lankal &#x2019;n sentrale buro waarin die kragte saamgesnoer kan word met die oog op alle nodige navorsing en versameling van materiaal en opleiding van mense vir die voer van Suid-Afrika se stryd na buite.</block>

<p>His final sentence is most important of all&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dit moet &#x2019;n instituut wees waarheen byvoorbeeld jong diplomate en inligting-verteenwoordigers en selfs informele ambassadeurs van Suid-Afrika, soos sportmanne ensovoorts, gestuur kan word vir hulp en toerusting op die terreine waarop hulle oorsee hul man namens Suid-Afrika kan staan.</block>

<p><span class="col_2481-2482" refersTo="page_1258"/>I entirely agree with what Advocate De Villiers said, and if it were at all necessary to underline that urgency of his proposals in that speech, let me quote very briefly from an interview which <i>Die Burger</i> had on February 18th of this year with Prof. Beekman from Holland, who has become senior lecturer in public administration at the University of Cape Town; he had just arrived to take up his post. The hon. the Minister may be familiar with this statement. Prof. Beekman said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die groot aantal mense wat verlede jaar om politieke redes aangehou is, het Suid-Afrika se saak in Nederland ontsettend skade berokken.</block>

<p>He then went on to talk about the Owambos.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. the Prime Minister for the first time last year gave two public Press conferences to journalists from South Africa and overseas. There were verbatim reports of these conferences. The hon. the Minister himself introduced the journalists. The verbatim reports of these conferences were issued by the Department of Information and, as the hon. the Minister knows, went everywhere overseas. This innovation is very much to be welcomed, Sir, but it is significant that Prof. Beekman&#x2019;s main difficulty in dealing with the propaganda against us in the Netherlands directly concerned people held under detention for political reasons, meaning, of course, those who were not brought to trial. But, Sir, what is one to do in an attempt to be a good ambassador overseas when one witnesses how the Government itself deals with this kind of issue&#x003F; No less a person than the hon. the Prime Minister at that Press conference, in response to a question, gave a reply which I can only describe in parliamentary terms as grossly inaccurate on the subject of people being held for political reasons. Sir, let me give you the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s reply. He was asked by a Mr. A. B. Wessels, who writes for one of the Afrikaans papers in this country, about people who had died while in detention and the fact that there had been a public outcry; his question was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Why, if the Security Police have nothing to hide, do you persist in refusing to appoint a judicial commission of inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the deaths and the methods used by the Security Police&#x003F;</block>

<p>Sir, what was the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s reply&#x003F;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You are well aware of the fact that if any person, whether in custody or not, dies unnaturally or under suspicious circumstances, the law prescribes that a judicial inquiry should be held.</block>

<p>That is a categorical statement, Sir, but with due respect, is it an accurate statement when the hon. the Prime Minister knows very well about a certain case that I handled here in this House a year ago&#x003F; I refer here to the Imam Haron, where the request for the appointment of a judicial commission was in fact refused, in spite of this law which the hon. the Prime Minister mentioned, and I would like to know what law it is which says that there shall be an automatic judicial review.</p>

The magistrate at that inquest, which was held in public and which was attended by the world&#x2019;s Press, said that death was partly due to this man&#x2019;s falling down stairs, but he could not account for the rest of the injuries on his body, which one of the State pathologists had said were consistent with blows that he had seen on the bodies of people who had died as the <span class="col_2483-2484" refersTo="page_1259"/>result of an assault. Sir, the point is that overseas this makes an appalling impression. I was challenged because of the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s statement at his Press conference and, having dealt with the case here in the House, I had no adequate answer, as I would have liked to have had.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to come back now to some of the Minister&#x2019;s officers. Early in October I went to the University of Vermont in Burlington. I went there, the Minister may be interested to know, at the invitation of a United States Rotary exchange student whom I met here, whose father is on the staff and who invited me to lecture at Vermont University. Sir, I read a paper on &#x201C;aspects of political, economic and social change in South Africa&#x201D;. Where I approved of Government policy, I said so. It was not a party-political speech at all. I approved of the Government&#x2019;s contact with African countries; I approved of the change in the sports policy, and I said so. I did everything I could to give an accurate picture of the political scene, subject, of course, to questions as to where we stood in our party on certain issues. Sir, what did I find when I got to this university&#x003F; I found that a senior information officer from our department&#x2019;s office in New York had been there two days before me and I was immediately faced with the local Press reports of his speech. The officer concerned, whose name I am not going to mention&#x2014;I will give it to the hon. the Minister later if he would like to have it&#x2014;indulged in a series of generalities which, clearly, carried no conviction at all, and the more&#x2019;s the pity, because I was questioned very closely on the accuracy of his address. I want to ask the hon. the Minister if he thinks that I felt particularly happy having to contradict some of these things when I was asked questions point-blank, when they held up this Press report, which is from the Burlington Free Press of 7th October, 1971, about what this man had said. He was asked to come and speak about South Africa; everybody there was willing to listen and he said, amongst other things&#x2014;</p>

[Interjection.] In fact, all bridges of communication between us and people of colour have virtually been cut off by this Government, as the hon. member knows, except in official circles. This officer, according to the newspaper report, made no mention of the unrest and mass arrests caused by apartheid, nor did he mention that many Whites in the country view the policy as unworkable. I would have thought that it would have been much more intelligent to have given the impression that there was a proper democratic dialogue on this subject. Then, Sir, he said that no one had ever been arrested for differing from the South African Government.</p>

<block name="quote">Blacks who work in White areas, mostly in menial jobs, must have passes and they have no right to leave their areas and neither do Whites have any rights in the Black or non-White areas.</block>

<p>Sir, what he omitted to say is that the Whites are not under the jurisdiction of the Transkei Legislative Assembly, although they live there, and this is not really a correct presentation of the facts. It suggests that all people have everything they want in their own corner of the country and that they are running their affairs, and that is not a correct presentation of the facts. Finally, Sir, he went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As for the anti-communist and terrorist laws, I deny that they are used to suppress opposition to the Government&#x2019;s policy.</block>

<p>Now listen to this, Sir&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If someone is arrested under the Act, it must be proved in an open court that he is engaged in communist activities or <span class="col_2485-2486" refersTo="page_1260"/>terrorism. This safeguards the people against suppression.</block>

<p>Then he went on to say that there was no more land to be bought for the African people because, he said, they had it all already. Well, I am told that there is still a million morgen of land to be bought.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Sir, it seems to me that the Department of Information fails to check sufficiently often with our major information officers overseas to see what their reaction is likely to be in the country in which they serve to certain things which are said and done here. I would like to know how often these officers are consulted personally by the Minister, rather than simply being given Government hand-outs as the basis of their work, which is often done under very difficult circumstances. The hon. member for Stellenbosch is quite right in saying that they should come here very much more often. The biggest fault, it seems to me, in public relations terms, is the inadequate &#x201C;feed-back&#x201D; by the Government and the Information Department in South Africa to the people responsible for our public relations overseas. You see, Sir, the South-West Africa crisis, the Dean&#x2019;s trial and the Timol case were shockingly handled overseas. Why do I say that&#x003F; Because of the Government&#x2019;s complete clampdown in the early stages on news about these matters, just when speculation and rumours were most unpleasant. How often are our information officers overseas asked for their views by the Minister and the Cabinet before a statement is made on any of these issues that are so vital&#x003F; Is there a hot line between the hon. the Minister and these members of his department&#x003F;</p>

<p>Well I am surprised at that. Why does not the Government actively do what the hon. member for Stellenbosch suggested, to encourage people from South Africa in all walks of life and of different opinions to go on speaking tours overseas&#x003F; It would be a tremendous encouragement and of great value to the country. Instead of expressing satisfaction, I think it would be more effective if we were to review the whole of our public relations system, as Advocate De Villiers proposed, bring it up to date and ensure that all the information disseminated is both accurate and balanced.</p>

<p>My last word is this. The salient fact of good public relations anywhere in any field is that all the facts of any case should be clearly and fearlessly presented and not merely half of the facts, as has been done up to the present. A balanced and open presentation of South Africa&#x2019;s political position is the surest way to undermine and subvert hostile criticism. But this is a lesson which this Government unfortunately does not seem willing to learn.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. REINECKE</person>:</from>

<p>&#x201C;The way it is being handled &#x201D; I want to say that the first place where our information is prejudiced and fails is to be found on the benches of those hon. members. Now the Opposition also has learned information officers and former newspaper editors in their midst, as we heard earlier today. I want to send this publication, the <i>South African Digest,</i> to the hon. member for Kensington. There it is. I want to send this publication, the <i>South African Panorama,</i> to the hon. member <span class="col_2487-2488" refersTo="page_1261"/>for Kensington as well. There it is. And I want to send this publication, <i>Australian Panorama,</i> to that hon. member and he must tell me which one is best. Then I also want to ask the hon. member for Kensington, who is going to speak after me: Sunday after Sunday we read in the <i>Sunday Times</i> about these matters which these two hon. members have just emphasized here. That hon. Minister of Information has opened the doors to all the newspapers and the Press media of the world to talk to our esteemed Prime Minister face to face. Now I want to give that hon. member for Kensington these minutes of the last Press conference of the hon. the Prime Minister. I want to ask the hon. member why the <i>Sunday Times</i> was not represented at that Press conference, where it could have confronted the Prime Minister with these matters which they are always talking about here and which the <i>Sunday Times</i> writes about every Sunday and which causes untold and irreparable damage to the South African image in the outside world. I shall send the hon. member for Kensington these minutes and I should very much like to hear his comment on them.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Stellenbosch has given a very high tone to the debate. I have a heartfelt need to refer, in the few minutes available to me, to a matter regarding information which I believe to be of great importance. Officially South Africa has many enemies today, or let me put it like this: officially we have very few friends, as the hon. member for Wynberg learned the hard way in the U.S.A. But potentially we have a very large and permanent group of friends in the outside world.</p>

<speech by="#reinecke">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. REINECKE</person>:</from>

<p>We have a growing number of permanent friends who have the courage of their convictions and are sufficiently informed to get up and take South Africa&#x2019;s part when the political taps are turned on against South Africa in their countries, and we have many examples of that, as the hon. the Minister can testify. Our information department is naturally small, and its officials are naturally few in number in relation to our other large State departments. Those officials cannot cope with the task of a comprehensive information effort on their own. It is really a front which is as wide as the front of our military preparedness in the Republic. Due to the factors I have mentioned our enemies may be numerous, largely perhaps as a result of the negative influence of elements in this Opposition and a part of the Opposition which is not on these benches today, who for the sake of attracting popular votes often do not appear to reflect about what they say in public. Since our enemies are numerous, the time has come for our people to make a total effort to assist the Ministry and the information effort. The time has come for the establishment of a large voluntary information citizen force. The assistance rendered to our Department of Information by the people is already formidable, but it can still be considerably increased to a total effort on every level where we certainly do not need the help of the hon. member for Orange Grove.</p>

<p>I want to mention examples of how the people are being drawn into this total information effort as a result of the stimulus provided by the Department of Information. The New Zealand women&#x2019;s cricket team is touring our country. Last Friday night the Minister of Sport entertained the New Zealand team as well as our Springbok team at a reception at Fernwood. We were there and hon. members on that side of the House were there as well. We listened with interest to the questions put by those New Zealand ladies, and not many of them were about cricket. For the most part they were sincere questions showing sincere interest in this country and its inhabitants and its various peoples. I was proud of the way in which our ladies of the Springbok team replied to questions of all kinds, from gold production to information on Bantu folklore, from agricultural problems to the fine arts, and I must take off my hat in appreciation of the way in which those young Springbok ladies conveyed the factual information about their native country to the New Zealanders in spontaneous conversation, without any political motives, in all sincerity. I am not interested in the political affinities of the individuals in the team. I am interested in and deeply appreciate the fact that those sportswomen helped the ladies of the New Zealand cricket team to come to an objective understanding of our country. Without being aware of it at all, perhaps, they helped to create new ambassadors with goodwill towards South Africa. This is an example for that hon. member who is sitting in the front bench of the Opposition. They shared in the total effort to take up the cudgels for the Republic as good voluntary <span class="col_2489-2490" refersTo="page_1262"/>information officers. Without dragging in politics and being politically obtrusive, we cannot but observe how our young people who take part in sport, whether on the level of athletics &#x2026; The hon. friend for Kensington can see in the <i>Panorama</i> which is lying in front of him how young Springbok athletes such as Denise van Wyk from my town, Verwoerdburg, are proudly carrying the message of green and gold over the world. The same goes for our rugby teams, which carry the green and gold to foreign countries.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I just want to remind my hon. friends of the fact that Brakpan was won by the National Party, not by the United Party. I was impressed by the eagerness of the young people of South Africa to assist spontaneously in this total information effort. Our young people realize the value of good friends all over the world, in view of the future years when they will be full-fledged citizens and leaders of this country. Our young people realize that they are living in a splendid country. They want to be armed with facts when they go overseas on holiday in group tours or on educational tours, or when they receive overseas visitors here. The young people of South Africa deserve the thanks of this House today for the way in which they spontaneously and honestly join forces with the Department of Information.</p>

<p>The domestic services of the Department of Information is the keystone upon which everything hinges, the source from which the objective information documents may be obtained which this hon. member for Wynberg, and the lawyer of whom she spoke as well, apparently, was so concerned about. Personally I am satisfied that our source of information which is available at the Department of Information is quite sufficient to make any further co-ordinating bodies unnecessary.</p>

<p>Finally, I also want to point out that our English-language newspapers, which are the most important medium, next to the English transmission of Radio South Africa, through which overseas visitors to this country must take cognizance of circumstances, have a task to fulfil in respect of spreading information. In the past few weeks I have found it interesting to read in the week-end supplements of our two English-language newspapers in Cape Town, the <i>Cape Times</i> and the <i>Argus.</i> I want to avail myself of the opportunity in this House to express my sincere thanks to the editors of the supplements of those newspapers for the way in which they give an objective view of South Africa and South African circumstances in those week-end supplements. This is journalism of a high standard and as a Nationalist I should like to tell the editors of those supplements&#x2014; irrespective of their political views, which are according to their own conscience&#x2014; that those week-end supplements are good work which is most certainly appreciated by every sincere White South African. With these thoughts I should very much like to endorse with all my heart the motion put by my colleague, the hon. member for Stellenbosch.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pretoria District was kind enough to send me over the February copy of <i>South African Panorama.</i> I will come back to that in a moment. In fact, it contains something which I propose to deal with anyway. Before I come to him I want to deal with an interjection which the hon. member for Stellenbosch made while my colleague, the hon. member for Wynberg, was speaking. You will recall, Sir, that she was making the point that one of the complaints from this side of the House is that the Department of Information does not try to carry across to the outside world that there is a brisk dialogue going on in this country. We realize that we have <span class="col_2491-2492" refersTo="page_1263"/>problems and I think it can be safely said that we are trying honestly to solve them. The hon. members on the Government side have one point of view; we assume that they believe implicitly in it. We have another point of view and we believe implicitly in ours. The point she was trying to make was that the Department of Information does not try to convey this picture to the outside world.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Stellenbosch, I am glad to say, again says &#x201C;that is wrong&#x201D;. When the hon. member for Wynberg was speaking he interjected and said: &#x201C;But that is what they are doing&#x201D;. I am surprised that he should take this point of view. You will recall, Sir, that during the Information Vote last year I raised this point and so did the hon. member for Orange Grove. And what was the only reply that we got from that side of the House&#x003F; We got it from the hon. member for Algoa. He laughed at the suggestion that anything to do with the Opposition should be sent abroad. He said &#x2014;and I quote from column 5285 of last year&#x2019;s Hansard&#x2014;talking about me&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The hon. member must not ask the department also to expound the policy of the United Party abroad. Who is interested in that&#x003F;</block>

<p>If you carry on and read what he said, he made it quite clear from the Government side that neither the hon. the Minister, who never contradicted him, nor anybody on that side was interested in carrying across to the outside world that there were other points of view in this country. It did not help any more than the sanctimonious approach such as we have had from the hon. member for Stellenbosch.</p>

<p>Yes, he threw it. I think he regards that as a type of courtesy.</p>

<p>Let me say immediately that the international sports festival we had here in Cape Town last November gave to the Department of Information, in my view, probably the best chance it has had in many, many years of putting across something about South Africa that is truly positive, the sort of thing that we agree with in this country, and which could only have met with acclaim from the rest of the world. Having said that, let me make it quite clear that, as far as the Department of Information is concerned, I believe it should be realistic in matters of communication with the outside world. It should, in catering for the type of taste in the outside world, which is something we want to cater for in putting our image across, have regard to the sort of matters that interest people and those that do not. The sort of thing that would not interest the outside world, would be the excuses&#x2014; I am sorry the hon. the Minister of Sport is not here; he was here a minute ago&#x2014;that we put out for holding what really amounted to multi-racial athletics in this country. We called it &#x201C;multi-national&#x201D; and all sorts of names. We tried to direct our approach to the fact that we were having &#x201C;multi-national South African&#x201D; games&#x2014;which were in fact multi-racial&#x2014;and that there were also athletes from other countries competing. Let us forget these apologies. Let us just consider the facts. We had a highly successful multi-racial, inter-national sports meeting. In projecting this to the world, we would after all only be projecting the facts of what happened. We would not be trying to hoodwink the world. We had a thoroughly successful multi-racial meeting. <span class="col_2493-2494" refersTo="page_1264"/>I think we should have tried to gauge what people in the outside world should know, and want to know about South Africa. My only criticism of this particular issue of <i>The South African Panorama</i> is that we have it thrust down our gullet that some of the sportsmen were Bantu, some White and some of other colours. This is not important. Perhaps we should have just cut down on the amount of ideological, highly charged racial writing and published rather more of this sort of picture that we see here.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>We should have been much more subtle, instead of trying to brazen it out telling the world that here at last we are having Black people from South Africa competing with White people from South Africa. Let them see it for themselves. Let us not try to thrust it down people&#x2019;s throats. We would have made a far better impact if we had simply handled things as they originated.</p>

<p>Much the same happens with the approach of <i>The South African Digest.</i> How often do we not see perfectly good pictures, which are self-explanatory anyway, and reports, marred by the fact that we keep on hanging racial tags to what we send overseas. People overseas quite frankly do not understand this approach and they are not particularly interested in it. I think we would make every impact we want to make if we simply let events and pictures speak for themselves.</p>

<p>I now want to speak more generally and come back to the motion. The compass of the Department of Information is very wide indeed and I must admit quite frankly that we have no complaint with the way in which the department carries out its duties. There are some things that we feel quite strong about; they have been voiced in this House before and we shall continue to voice them. The department divides its activities under four main headings, namely the interior division, the foreign division, the audio-visual and publications division, and the Press liaison division. As far as the activities of the interior division are concerned, we do hope to elicit in the course of this Session rather more information than we have had in the past about exactly what it does. I do not know if the hon. the Minister will tell me, but I think under this division come such things as information services in Bantu areas. Is that so&#x003F;</p>

<p>I thought that was so. The hon. member for Orange Grove has said that we do have some doubts as to exactly how this operates. Talking about putting across two sides of the picture, I was most surprised to discover that the head of one of our Bantustans did not know an elementary and most important fact of United Party policy when I spoke to him a few months ago. He did not know, for example, that our policy provides for home ownership in urban areas by the Bantu people. I think there is a bit of missionary work that could be done by that hon. Minister&#x2019;s department. He seems to be keen to put across his policy, but locally in our Black areas he does not seem very keen even to bring home the elementary aspects of United Party policy to the leaders there.</p>

We gave it our blessing, because we felt it was the right thing to do. As the hon. member for Stellenbosch has said, you cannot measure the results of these things in rands and cents, but in manifestation of a better or broader understanding of the task that we have ahead of us. We were told, before he left, that he would find in the course of his travels ways of improving our efforts abroad and he was told that he would come across many techniques of doing so. I trust that in the course of this debate we shall hear more about it. As far as the audio-visual section of the department is concerned, I must agree with the hon. member for Pretoria District that we do have a real talent for <span class="col_2495-2496" refersTo="page_1265"/>the projection of news and ideas through our publications. It is also common cause that our publications in this country achieve a very high standard. By the same token I think that documentary films produced in this country are of an exceptional standard. The tragedy here is that we tend to harness only a section of our talents. This point has been made before, but we see little change in the position. The hon. the Minister has told us in the past where leading people in his department come from. In almost all cases they come from one particular orientation, namely from one closely connected with the National Party or its Press. This is a tragedy because there is much to be said about South Africa and it can be said highly skillfully through the use of far more people from a wider background than the hon. the Minister seems to draw on.</p>

<p>Time is limited and I think there is little more that we can handle in the time allotted to us. But I do hope that the hon. the Minister will give us a chance now in this debate, before his Vote comes up for discussion, to hear from him what he discovered overseas. It would be fair to use this occasion which is in many ways a stage-managed occasion.</p>

<p>It would be most useful to us on this side of the House and to the country at large to know exactly what the hon. the Minister found out in the course of his travels. He can perhaps tell us a little more of what he has in mind as a result of what he has found out.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the limited amount of time available to me I should like to deal with four suggestions, what I regard as constructive suggestions, possibly attractive as well. It is true that even a constructive suggestion obviously implies some small measure of criticism, but for all that, it does not detract from the constructiveness of my intent. I hope that hon. members and the hon. the Minister will see my suggestions in that light.</p>

<p>There exists side by side with the Department of Information an organization known as the South Africa Foundation. This is a highly respectable foundation consisting of a large number of businessmen, private enterprises and private individuals who are extremely concerned about South Africa&#x2019;s image abroad and wish to make their contribution in a non-official way to the improvement of that image. About two or three days ago the South Africa Foundation held its annual general meeting and it was addressed by its President, Dr. P. E. Rousseau who, as the House knows, is a distinguished South African industrialist. He had a number of suggestions to make. He showed concern about the deteriorating image of South Africa. One of the things he said was that in order to improve South Africa&#x2019;s image&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; much will depend on how the outward policy develops during 1972, and on how far South Africa could continue to demonstrate at home among its own varied people the same friendly and co-operative spirit that it shows to visiting representatives of other nations, whatever continent they come from.</block>

<p>The report continues as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. Rousseau said that South Africa should do all in its power to consolidate and develop relations with France and other French-speaking countries. The roads to Africa and to the Common Market countries run, for part of the way, through Paris, he said.</block>

<p>This is a profound truth. Dr. Etienne Rousseau does not speak purely for himself; he is advised by his Foundation which itself has representatives and contacts throughout the world. This is his synopsis of what needs to be done. I should like to endorse this very strongly. There are in Africa some 44 states. Of these 21 are French-speaking. There are over 2 000 different languages and dialects in Africa and English and French are the only languages which constitute a sort of <i>lingua franca</i> with which the various African states may communicate with each other. If South Africa has ambitions in Africa&#x2014;ambitions of friendship, I imply&#x2014;if South Africa wishes to build bridges in Africa, it is most important that we should communicate with the French-speaking African states. By and large I would say they are the most friendly disposed to South Africa of the general run of African states. I would like to urge the hon. the Minister that his department, which is concerned with the propagation of information and, <span class="col_2497-2498" refersTo="page_1266"/>among other things, the preparing of the way to closer understanding between the states of Africa, should take advantage of the new techniques and methods of learning French, i.e. the new audio-visual facilities that are available. The hon. the Minister may then, when he comes back to the House in a year or two, be able to assure us that a large number of his officials are in fact able to converse in French, are able to understand French well and are generally proficient in French in order that the work of building bridges to Africa may proceed with the full help and co-operation of his department. I know for a fact that there are a few members of his department who are proficient in French, but I also know for a fact that there are not nearly enough of them. I hope that the hon. the Minister will pay attention to this matter, because it not only concerns Africa but also the Common Market, where French again is the <i>lingua franca.</i> It is most important to realize that many roads to understanding in other parts of the world do in fact lead through Paris, as Dr. Rousseau has said.</p>

<p>This leads me to my second proposal. The hon. the Minister may well ask, justifiably; &#x201C;Where am I to find the people to carry out this task&#x003F;&#x201D; It is in any event not very easy to find people of high quality, who could mix at any level of society and can go around the world and represent the best of South Africa&#x2019;s culture and its aspirations, without drawing too heavily on other branches of industry and activity in South Africa, which can ill afford to spare such people. I believe that the women of South Africa have a role to play here. There are many young women in South Africa, who are educated and often have a knowledge of French acquired at the universities, who could in fact he most usefully employed by the department. This department has unfilled posts abroad. No doubt the department will have to expand. Here is a rich field from which the hon. the Minister could draw, in order to fill gaps and build up his department to play the role we envisage for it.</p>

<p>A third suggestion is that the hon. the Minister should continue with his present policy, of which I approve, of as far as possible issuing publications abroad in the language of the country concerned. We have discussed this before and I will not go into detail, but I think it is certainly accepted by the hon. the Minister that the customs, the tastes and the manner of presentation of all kinds of literature vary from country to country. It is most important that, if the Department of information supplies basic facts from here, each mission abroad should have the freedom to interpret this information in the language, the manner and the idiom which is acceptable in the country in which the mission finds itself. This is a tendency which I see increasing and improving and we give the hon. the Minister our support in this regard. I have, like the hon. the Minister, recently been round a number of embassies and in my opinion there are still too many publications lying on the racks, unsuitable for local circulation. If one went behind the scenes of an embassy, into the storerooms, one used to find thousands of publications uncirculated. This is a tendency which I think is declining. I think it is no longer the case that so many publications are despatched in bulk to embassies in the wrong languages and with the wrong presentation and wrong sentiments and therefore unsuitable for local use. I believe that we have an improvement here and I hope the hon. the Minister will pursue this policy on the basis, I have suggested.</p>

<p>I would suggest, also, that the example afforded by a newspaper most of us receive, called the <i>German Tribune,</i> should be followed. This magazine is really a review of the Press and contains a selected collection of the best leaders and newspaper articles of the week in Germany. One of our best advertisements abroad as a democracy is the high quality and the controversial and free nature of our Press. It is not a very difficult task to select the best and most effective items from our Press and to put them together in the form in which they appear in <i>The Tribune</i> and to make this available to countries abroad. It is a quick r&#x00E9;sum&#x00E9; of what is going on here and of the controversies of the day. <i>The Tribune</i> is very lively reading because it is selective of quality and not selective of party. It is supported by the Government but produces everybody&#x2019;s point of view; it gives a most convincing image of democracy at work. I would like to suggest that the hon. the Minister give some thought to a publication of this kind.</p>

<p>Lastly, I would like to return to Dr. Etienne Rousseau, who has made another suggestion. This is of a more critical kind, <span class="col_2499-2500" refersTo="page_1267"/>but even constructive suggestions sometimes have a critical content. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All the actions taken in the name of State security, whether they be bannings, detention without trial or raids on people&#x2019;s homes and property, have created an unhappy image of our country. There are many people overseas who are prepared to take the worst view of these matters.</block>

<p>Whether we like it or not and whether actions in this country are justifield or not, it is a fact that there is nothing which gives South Africa such a bad image abroad at present, in the present climate of our times, as these bannings, arrests and detentions.</p>

<p>It is a fact and I am prepared to back the opinion of Dr. Etienne Rousseau as against the opinion of that hon. member in the comer. It is in fact so. There is no question that anybody who travels abroad or who lives abroad and sees the way these matters are reported, will be convinced that this image of South Africa is the most harmful, the most pernicious of all the images which are projected abroad about South Africa. I have no doubt whatsoever in my mind that this is so. What can we do about it&#x003F; I believe the task of Foreign Affairs, foreign relations and foreign information is not only an outward task. I believe that it is also an inward task. It does not only project abroad; it should work inwards. I believe that that hon. Minister&#x2019;s department, just like the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, must be concerned not only with the projection of what is best for South Africa abroad, but that it should also reflect inwards to the councils of State in this country and within those departments which take such decisions, the need to act with restraint, to act with care and to act with excessive observance, if necessary, of democratic principles. It is only in this way, if the department does its duty in the outward as well as the inward sense, and if it realizes that South Africa&#x2019;s good name depends not only on what it projects abroad but what it projects back into the organs of State in South Africa, that it will be doing its full duty, and that it will really be improving and protecting South Africa&#x2019;s name both at home and abroad.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF INFORMATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to start by expressing my gratitude to the hon. member for Stellenbosch, who moved the motion here this afternoon. I also want to thank him for the competent manner in which he illustrated it. Furthermore, I want to thank the hon. member for Sunnyside and the hon. member for Pretoria District for their contributions. It is good for one to talk about this department and what it involves, for although this department is not a big one, and although there are not large numbers of people on its staff, it is doing excellent work in presenting South Africa&#x2019;s image not only abroad, but also domestically in respect of the policy of the Government of the day, which is in fact the task of this department, a task which was originally entrusted to it by way of an announcement in the <i>Gazette.</i> I want to extend my sincere thanks to the hon. member for Stellenbosch for the fine manner in which he put the case and for the friendly quotations. He can speak from experience, because he has just returned from an interesting tour during which he saw how our information people quite often found themselves in the firing line while having to act in the interests of South Africa. Therefore I welcome this motion, and I should like to leave our own members at that. I must do this because my time is so limited and because I must turn my attention to the Opposition&#x2019;s standpoint in this regard. I want to start at once by saying that it is, of course, a tragedy in this Parliament that the hon. member for Orange Grove is always the obvious person to react first to this Department of Information. The problem of the hon. member for Orange Grove is that he simply cannot rise to the standard justified by a debate on this department. He does not have the ability to criticize positively; he does not have the ability to make a thorough study of his theme, and consequently he always lapses into the sewers of his own train of thought. I want to illustrate this to the hon. member</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Don&#x2019;t make any propaganda.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, we are not making any propaganda; not I, nor the department; the hon. member is absolutely <span class="col_2501-2502" refersTo="page_1268"/>wrong. We refuse to use the word &#x201C;propaganda&#x201D;. Sir, let me illustrate it. Every year we get roughly 100 guests, visitors from abroad. We bring these people here and we let them see South Africa. They have interviews with people on the Government side, with people on the Opposition side, and with any person to whom they want to speak. We give them a comprehensive, faithful, objective picture of South Africa. We allow them to sit here in this House and to listen to the debates being conducted. In fact, until a moment ago we had here two guests of my department, who walked out while the hon. member was speaking. They sat here listening this morning. These people gain a full impression of conditions in this country. Out of the approximately 100 we get every year, it is logical that one will occasionally find a person who comes here with preconceived ideas, who sums up the situation here, and who then goes back and perseveres in propagating those ideas against South Africa, this time with more fervour and zeal, for now they can say that they have first-hand information because they visited South Africa themselves. But 99 per cent of those people go back with a totally new outlook, with an altogether better understanding of South Africa, with a positive bias, even if it is only with this one understanding, i.e. that the problems of South Africa are much more complicated than they seemed to them while they were over there, 8 000 miles from here. I want to ask the hon. member for Orange Grove this question: Is it proper and reasonable of him to take the one negative case of Senator Van Riel&#x2014;we all know that it was a negative case&#x2014;and merely to quote what he said and nothing about the positive things that were said in regard to the whole matter&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>In that case, mention a few positive matters.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is precisely what I am going to do; the hon. member has walked right into the trap, for I have examples of that here with me. Sir, the hon. member quoted Senator Van Riel. I want to say at once that Senator Van Riel had interviews with people on our side and on the other side. For all I know he may also have had an interview with him, and for all I know he may have told Senator Van Riel that lot of nonsense. The hon. member referred to <i>Elseviers Weekblad.</i> Now I am going to quote from this same <i>Elseviers Weekblad,</i> for the very reason that it was his source. I am not going to quote what Senator Van Riel said, but what was said by Mr. D. N. van Rosmalen, the foreign editor-in-chief of that publication, the person who holds a very high position on the editorial staff of that publication. I have here three lengthy articles on South Africa, 85 per cent of which consists of positive comment on South Africa. It is difficult for me to select at random a suitable one I can read out here, but here is one example (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Xhosa set greater store by status and political power than they do by prosperity. And yet within a short time spectacular results have been achieved economically and socially. Soil erosion has been brought to a standstill; within a short time large-scale irrigation works and modernization in the sphere of agriculture have more than doubled the production of maize; animal husbandry has been improved, the milk production has been increased. Partly by way of credits and advice given by the &#x201C;Development Corporation&#x201D;. 640 business firms have been established, all of them owned by Bantu. Education is still the main concern of the Bantu Government.</block>

<p>This is a favourable, positive reaction to what we are doing for the Black man in the Transkei. But, since the hon. member is looking for quotations on the positive aspects, I want to read out another quotation. Here in my hand I have an article written by Mr. Guy Wright, the editor of a newspaper in San Francisco, the <i>San Francisco Examiner.</i></p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>He wrote here about South-West, and from the nature of the case South-West is a very important terrain to us, especially in America and in the international world. He wrote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Just staying alive in that cooked and desecrated country is an artificial act like living on the moon. Every drop of drinking water in the town of Luderitz is sea water desalted. When I was there a hospital and a college were nearing completion and another college was under way, these strictly for Blacks. There is no college <span class="col_2503-2504" refersTo="page_1269"/>for Whites in South-West Africa. The White-run Government has drilled 850 deep-water wells, built 488 dams, spent $13 million on drought relief and $32 million on land reform&#x2014;all for Blacks. If the U.N. takes over, who will provide these services&#x003F; My guess is Uncle Sam. The cost will be fantastic and the result won&#x2019;t be as good, because it will take us years to learn the tricks the South Africans already know.</block>

<p>Now, these are positive statements on South Africa. These are the results we achieve through our guest programmes. I want to mention another example, quite interesting one. In the course of the visit I paid to countries abroad last year, I was asked to address the International Institute in London, better known as Chatham House. I made a speech there, and this speech was recorded and published by my Department of Information in their brochure which appeared in London as well as New York. I ask any member to read that speech. I stated the South African policy and problems in full. I ask any person to read that speech and to point out to me one example of petty politicizing contained in it. This speech was prepared with one end in view, i.e. to put straight South Africa&#x2019;s image in the world outside. The speech was delivered. One of our guests who came here, was a member of Congress from America, Mr. Bob Sykes. Other members of Parliament also met him here, and he was so impressed with South Africa, and became so friendly with us, that after he had gone back, he spoke in the American Congress, and to render South Africa a service he used these words. I am quoting from the Hansard of the American Congress&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Speaker, the <i>South African Scope</i> of November/December contains a comprehensive statement on the Republic of South Africa, which tells much that is not known about the efforts of that fine country to obtain a better understanding with its neighbours. The article was written by Dr. Mulder, the South African Minister of Information. We will do well in the United States to try to understand the objectives and efforts of this nation which has been a constant and dedicated friend of the United States through all the years.</block>

<p>And then he went on to ask that this article be recorded in the Hansard of Congress, and the whole speech was recorded in that Hansard for every American to read. That is the kind of result one achieves.</p>

<p>I shall go even further, although time is marching on very rapidly. The hon. member said a few things about <i>Panorama.</i> He spoke in general, but in particular the hon. member for Kensington also referred to <i>Panorama.</i> Now, what are the facts in regard to <i>Panorama</i>&#x003F; We receive hundreds of letters on <i>Panorama.</i> I took one of them at random in order to take a quick look at the position, and I want to read it here. This letter was written by Mrs. Myronsturm, of Illinois, U.S.A., and is dated 20th February, 1972&#x2014;it is therefore quite recent&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I cannot tell you how much I enjoyed your <i>Panorama.</i> Of course the articles and the photography are superb, but the lay-out and the mixture of colour and black-and-white photos was so creative. My work happens to be that of personnel consultant and I handle more people in the broad field of communications than any other. I see top publications from all over the country, both internal and external, and I have never seen anything to equal yours.</block>

<p>This is the kind of language used by foreigners, not by U.P. supporters in South Africa. This is what foreigners are saying about South Africa&#x2019;s <i>Panorama.</i> Then she wrote in detail about technical aspects, which I do not want to read, and in commenting on a specific article entitled &#x201C;Around the Track&#x201D;, she said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This article really thrilled me. The whole page moves. The curve of your title and putting it on the bottom of the page is excellent. I have never seen this kind of thing done before. Both the front and back covers of your August/September issues were truly beautiful. I know I am speaking in superlatives, but I really appreciated seeing your work.</block>

<p>This is the language of foreigners. It seems to me as though these Biblical words are true, i.e. that strangers will enter the Kingdom long before the Children of Israel! These are only three. I could go on quoting such examples for another hour.</p>

<p>Now we have had the other interesting phenomenon here this afternoon. The hon. <span class="col_2505-2506" refersTo="page_1270"/>member said my propaganda, as he called it, or our information service, was too &#x201C;subtle&#x201D;; it dealt with little birds and such things and should have dealt with other aspects. Two other members in the same debate attacked me on the grounds that our information material was not subtle enough. Now I ask you, Sir, what do we want to achieve&#x003F; Let us be very realistic now. The hon. member for Kensington touched upon this matter once again. I want him to put forward specific arguments. It is no use making a general, unfounded statement and saying &#x201C;There are political racial tags attached to everything.&#x201D; I want to hear his specific arguments. The hon. member must point out to me the specific instance, mention to me the issue and its date and point out exactly where the &#x201C;political tag&#x201D; is to which he referred.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am waiting for it. If the hon. members are not equipped for being able to understand it, I quite appreciate their problem. Suppose one shows a film or writes a fine article on, let us say, the preservation of antiques in a country such as South Africa, the restoration of old buildings, or on some or other cultural activity of this nature. It is logical that this is not politicizing. But it automatically brings home to the reader, wherever he may be, the fact that we are dealing here with a highly civilized, stable and responsible country. After all, this kind of thing does not happen in other countries. In this way we bear the message, in this subtle way, but it is being borne. If the hon. member would only want to understand! But that is the problem with the hon. members. They only want to criticize and they never want to add something positive. I am referring to the hon. member for Orange Grove in particular.</p>

<p>Now I want to deal with the member for Wynberg. The hon. member for Wynberg&#x2019;s first objection to my department, especially as far as America is concerned, was that we were too much on the defensive; we were always defending. And now I know what the position is. The hon. member had a very interesting tour in America. She also had a number of very unpleasant experiences, which I did not wish her. I had hoped that these things would not happen to her. However, I shall prove to her that we knew much more about that situation. As far back as 1968 I gave instructions to the effect that it would be useless and a waste of time for my officials to address universities on university campuses in America. It is useless, as she has in fact experienced. These people do not want to know the truth. They do not want to hear one. They only want one there to humiliate and besmirch one. That is all. I told my people that we should not waste our time on making speeches on university campusses. The hon. member experienced this. Even she, with her views which are not identical to ours, could not even make herself fully heard there. They treated her in an ill-mannered and unseemly way. That I do not wish her. That is an experience we met with a long time ago already. Now the hon. member says that we are too much on the defensive. The hon. member should at least tell me where we are on the defensive. I like something specific.</p>

<p>I want to mention an example. When I was in America, I visited the <i>New York Times.</i> I had received an invitation, through our local information officer, to dine with the top eight people of the <i>New York Times.</i></p>

But in spite of their placing negative reports about us, our Director of Information in New York, Dr. Les de Villiers, complained and fought all the time and told them: When my Minister was here, you told him that in your news columns you would afford us an opportunity of stating our case objectively. He hammered in that point until they allowed him&#x2014;something which had never happened before&#x2014;to have an article placed under his own name in the <i>New York Times</i> on 3rd August, 1971, an article in which he stated South Africa&#x2019;s standpoint in full.

<p>Oh, well then, I have no objection. Even that is attributable to my good work and the work of my department, so much so that doors are also being opened to her now. There is no doubt about that. I could furnish more quotations, but that is not necessary. My time is getting short.</p>

<p>The hon. member&#x2019;s second problem was that this Government and its officials abroad never admitted that we made mistakes or could make them; they blindly defended everything that was being done, for they had to do so in an unshakeable manner. Just to prove how wrong the hon. member is, I want to quote specifically from the same speech to which I referred a moment ago, and which I myself as the responsible Minister, and not a departmental official, made in Chatham House. In that speech I used the following words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We in South Africa do not regard ourselves as being above criticism. As a matter of fact, we have made mistakes in the past and we will make mistakes in the future, because we are human and therefore fallible.</block>

<p>After that I set out my case. The hon. member referred to my officials. I myself adopted this attitude, because all of us as human beings on this side of the grave are permanently making mistakes and are fallible. On the other side of the grave, so we believe, it will be perfect.</p>

<p>The hon. member touched upon another situation. She referred to the situation in the Netherlands and the fact that it was impossible to get programmes on the Dutch television. Then she attacked me by saying that politically my programmes were not subtle enough, because they were supposedly so grossly propagandist that the Dutch turned them down. This is the exact opposite of the attack made by the hon. member for Orange Grove. But the Netherlands and Britain are the two countries, so I said last year already, in which we are up against a wall of resistance in regard to television. They simply do not want to present our television programmes under any circumstances. There is no way in which one can get them to be accepted. And if such a programme is accepted for broadcasting, as does happen sometimes in the United Kingdom by way of exception, it only serves as a stimulus for calling forth immediately afterwards two or three of the most sordid, negative programmes in the world so as to wipe out everything that has been established by the previous one. The B.B.C. has created an image of South Africa which it dare not allow to be changed in the minds of its listeners. For that reason it has to continue with this situation. This is also the case in the Netherlands. But let me state the position in respect of these very same films which are allegedly so unacceptable to the Netherlands, as against the position in America. I am giving here the views of a person who is in the know. He is Mr. Roger Cahaney, vice-chairman of the Association-Sterling Films in New York, the firm which has the contract for taking over in America the distribution of South African documentary films made by our department. What does he say according to the report&#x003F; I quote (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Over the past 12 months 33 million Americans, approximately one-sixth of the population of America, have seen South African films on television. That is not surprising, since 1 400 copies of 22 different films are circulating in various networks in this country at present.</block>

<p>These are the same films. In other words, the fault does not lie with the films, Sir. The fault definitely lies somewhere else, namely with the fact that that country is not prepared to do it.</p>

<p>In conclusion the hon. member also mentioned the matter of my senior officer in New York and his speech. Now I want to tell the hon. member that I was there, that I met the officers and know who they are. I should like to hear from the hon. member who the official is. I should like to have the report from her. Then I shall look into the matter. But let me state the position to her as follows: The first question is whether that report is an accurate version of what he said. In the second place, I must listen very closely to what was actually said. I should like to investigate the matter more fully. In the course of my debate we can discuss it again. However, I should like to look into it, for I am not prepared to condemn the official <span class="col_2509-2510" refersTo="page_1272"/>until I have had full access to the facts. The hon. member appreciates this.</p>

<p>Now I come to the hon. member for Kensington.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I did understand the hon. member&#x2019;s point. The point he makes is that we should only show those photographs of Whites and Blacks running against one another, and in no way should we bring home our concept that we are dealing here with multi-nationalism. That is the problem. This multi-national, international sports meeting was held so that the peoples of the world and the peoples of South Africa could compete, each of them on behalf of his own people. Nothing is wrong with that.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I did understand the speech. The hon. member is objecting because in the text we added, for instance, that a Bantu athlete had won, or that Tswana A had run against White B.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oliver">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>No mention is made of Tswanas.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, Sir, the fact remains that this is a basic difference between the two parties. They believe we are one multi-racial community; we believe we are a multi-national community in which various peoples are present. The same report that is printed here, could have been published on the Olympic Games; for instance, that the German champion So-and-so had won and that the French champion was second. In the same way we say, for instance, that the Tswana champion was first and the White champion was second, That is the same concept of multi-nationalism.</p>

<p>But now the hon. member also says that we do not tell the world outside that there is a dialogue between two parties, that there is a strong Opposition party with another standpoint, etc. I reject that charge with the contempt it deserves. In the first instance, I have already told you, Sir, that we are making a point of affording every overseas guest on a visit to South Africa an opportunity of speaking to members of the Government as well as members of the Opposition. There are numerous members opposite who have had such interviews. These afford the guests the fullest opportunity, whatever walk of life they may be from, to ask questions and to go back. But you know, Sir, what is surprising, what I have already experienced on a few occasions, is that when, after their visit in South Africa, those people come to me for the last time before they go home, they tell me that there are only two alternatives in South Africa as far as government is concerned. They say, &#x201C;We can see that the National Party&#x2019;s policy has a course and a direction. We have certain misgivings as to whether it can be carried through, etc., but if it does not succeed, the Progressive Party&#x2019;s policy is the only alternative. That can also succeed. But the United Party&#x2019;s policy is worth nothing. It is useless.&#x201D; How many people have not told me this! I want to illustrate it further. This was very interesting.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hickman">

<p>But you also tell them that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But surely the hon. member had the opportunity of stating their policy to these people, and it did not make any impression. In the course of the same talks in New York I was also asked what the policies of the various political parties were and how they wanted to solve the problem. I stated our policy to the best of my ability. To the best of my ability I stated the United Party&#x2019;s policy, as I know and understand it, honestly and straightforwardly. Then I stated the Progressive Party&#x2019;s policy. I had with me the English version of this yellow booklet of the United Party on their policy. I offered it to them <span class="col_2511-2512" refersTo="page_1273"/>and told them that I had a copy of the United Party&#x2019;s policy for them. They were welcome to have it and to study it as they pleased. Then they said, &#x201C;Oh, that is artificial; it can&#x2019;t work, and in any case, we are not interested.&#x201D; They gave it back to me. I have witnesses. This is true. They are not interested. That is the policy of the United Party which wants to form the alternative Government in South Africa.</p>

<p>Then we had the hon. member for Kensington who was groping about here. I was waiting for a positive suggestion, but we sat for a long time. He squirmed this way and that way. I was waiting for him to say something. Eventually he referred in a negative way to things which did not sell. And so he carried on. Eventually the case he actually wanted to put forward, came out into the open. It was the &#x201C;racial tags&#x201D;, which, according to him, were being attached to everything. We in South Africa must face the fact that we have various peoples here. It is not something to argue about. It is a basic fact which cannot be argued about, but which is to be accepted. It is a fact. Through this sports meeting we created the opportunity for each of those peoples to participate.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<p>Different race groups.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Race groups and peoples, my dear friend. If the hon. member wants to understand it, &#x201C;race&#x201D; is a much wider, more comprehensive concept, various Bantu peoples all belong to the same race. Is that clear to him&#x003F; But we are talking about multi-nationalism. There are various peoples and one cannot lump all the Bantu together because they are members of one race, just as little as one can lump together the Europeans because they are all members of one race. There are various peoples in Europe. Is the hon. member so stupid that he cannot understand this&#x003F; No, Sir, absolutely nothing positive emerged from that.</p>

<p>I also want to say a few words about the hon. member for Von Brandis. He gave me two positive suggestions, which I want to examine. In the first place, he mentioned the question of the French language. I want to concede at once that this is an important matter. We ourselves are also very much aware of the fact that in the future the languages of Africa will be English and French. These are the two languages in which there will have to be communication with Africa. For that reason we already attach much importance to French. A considerable number of my officials have already mastered French. Quite a number of them have an excellent knowledge of French and act as interpreters when French visitors come here. We shall pay attention to this specific suggestion, because I think it is a very important matter which we should pursue if it is at all possible.</p>

<p>The second matter the hon. member put to me, was the question of too many useless publications. They are lying on the shelves &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>No, the employment of women.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Oh, I want to say to the hon. member that it is always a good idea to employ women, especially in this sort of liaison work. We are in fact doing so on a very large scale. As hon. members will probably know, most of the information officers who accompany the visitors as guides, are usually women. If such guides are women, a double psychological advantage is already implied. I need not elaborate on that. Furthermore, numerous women have been appointed to senior positions in our department, and are doing excellent work. At the moment we have women information officers doing excellent work abroad. There has definitely been no decision against the employment of women. We choose women as they become available, but they are select people.</p>

<p>In regard to the publications, I want to ask the hon. member whether he can be more specific and state which publications and what he is opposed to. One would then be able to investigate the matter. The way he put it, however, was too vague and wide. I just want to tell him what the policy is at present. When it is a matter of a general statement of policy by the Government, we send the facts to the various countries. Our information officers in those countries are ready with the necessary knowledge, not only of the country and language in which they find themselves, but also of the idiom, climate and atmosphere prevailing in that country. The factual knowledge we send from here is then processed and published in the language, idiom and image of the country concerned. This has always been our objective. I want to mention a clear example, and anyone with some experience will grant me that one cannot possibly use the same presentation of a fact in Britain as one can <span class="col_2513-2514" refersTo="page_1274"/>in the United States of America. In America one must use an approach completely different from the one would use in Britain. In America the facts can be presented directly, because those people can reason and argue. In fact, they like doing so. In Britain one always has to make understatements, otherwise one exaggerates the matter. This is the spirit and character of people; this is how we got to know them and this is how we set to work. What is more, we respect these differences. This is why I find it so surprising when the hon. member talks about certain publications in that way, and I should like more information from him in that regard.</p>

<p>In conclusion, if there is still time, I want to discuss the statement made by the hon. member, namely that the Security Police in South Africa are prejudicing the image of our country abroad, and that it is my task to take up the matter with the authorities concerned. South Africa would like to have a good image abroad; that is obvious, but we dare not allow, as a result of the fact that we must present a good image abroad, us in South Africa to undermine law and order and the maintenance of authority. One cannot do this. In other words, if the hon. member expects me to allow lawlessness, disorderliness and communist agitation in South Africa and not to take any action because I am afraid that it might create a wrong impression abroad, he is making a big mistake. The hon. member may not have put it like that, but this is the extreme to which it could go. The fact of the matter is very clearly that one should act with discretion, which is what the Government is doing. We do not rush ahead helter-skelter with such a matter. If hon. members knew how some of these steps were considered before action was taken, they would be astounded, because nobody wants to prejudice our image abroad. However, if it is essential for the internal peace and security of South Africa, I do not apologize to the world. In that case I act and put my house in order. It is essential that South Africa should be put first. I expect hon. members opposite to support me when we take such action in this country in their interests and in ours.</p>

<p>I have dealt cursorily with the whole matter, and in the discussions on my Vote I should like to cross swords once again with the hon. member for Orange Grove in regard to his attack on my domestic information service. In regard to the Buthelezi case I shall not react now either, because I should like to know exactly what his attack was in this regard.</p>

<p>I do not know exactly what attack the hon. member is making, and would like to have the facts. Then I shall reply to it. At the end of his speech the hon. member also referred in passing to Ovambo, and I cannot reply to that now, because I do not know exactly what his attack was concerned with. Nor do I know what the hon. member has in mind. In conclusion I want to say in respect of the Department of Information that this department is the front line of South Africa&#x2019;s defence on the most distant outposts, and these people must stand in that firing-line and wage the struggle for South Africa. I returned from this visit abroad with the knowledge that we have inspired people on that front, not only people who are carrying out a task, because they have to, but also people who are inspired and begrudge themselves a minute&#x2019;s rest. They devote hours to their work and travel throughout the length and breadth of the world in order to present South Africa&#x2019;s case. They do not present South Africa&#x2019;s case half-heartedly or indifferently, but with conviction. They are fighters, and are fighting for South Africa. They are presenting our case with fervour and zeal. They are a group of inspired people, and I am grateful for having been able to be with them and sense that inspiration. In addition, I am grateful for the fact that I, on my part, was able to give those people direct guidance in regard to general conditions in South Africa. I am grateful for this motion and for the standard of the speeches. What is more, I am grateful for the positive suggestions from the Opposition side, but I know that the hon. member for Orange Grove is unable to rise to that level.</p>

<heading>INVESTIGATION OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN FILM INDUSTRY</heading>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move the motion standing in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_2515-2516" refersTo="page_1275"/>That this House requests the Government to take steps to investigate the South African film industry, with particular reference to&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) the overlapping and duplicating in the making of films by Government Departments and bodies which are directly or indirectly subsidized by public funds;</li>

<li>(b) the system of Government subsidies whereby an inferior type of film is encouraged;</li>

<li>(c) the wastage of public funds through unnecessary extravagance on the part of many bodies involved in the making of films; and</li>

<li>(d) the genuine problems of the industry in regard to, <i>inter alia,</i> excise and other taxes, censorship and unfair competition from Government and Government-sponsored filmmakers.</li>

</ol>

<p>There is a well-known saying that there is no business like show business. I did some investigation into the Government&#x2019;s role in the film industry in South Africa and I came to an additional conclusion, that not only is there no business like show business, but there is no business like funny business. When these two clash and are interlocked you find one of the craziest pictures yet in the history of this Nationalist Government. I trust that hon. members will agree, after having heard what I have to say about, firstly, the story of the great new Nationalist Hollywood-on-the-Aapies River; secondly, the story about distorted subsidies whereby subsidies are paid in respect of films which are much more than the actual total costs of the films themselves; and thirdly, the story about the censorship of films which has gone stark staring mad. I will also tell the story of the slowly unfolding plot of indoctrination and brainwashing of the people of South Africa by that side of the House. I believe that all this calls for an urgent investigation into the film industry at the highest level and on a much wider scale than the recent very limited Board of Trade and Industry inquiry published as report No. 1330.</p>

<p>I think there is general agreement in South Africa that our film industry must be developed and that to develope it does need support by the Government to a certain extent. It is the same argument that is used in support of any local industry in South Africa which has to face competition from overseas. The usual reasons are that it provides work for our own people, that it stimulates local growth, that it cuts down imports and all the other good arguments in favour of trying to stimulate and protect local industry. This principle is accepted in most European countries, e.g. France, West Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Switzerland, to name only a few. So have we too accepted that principle in this country. The touble is whether it is being applied correctly and if we are working along the right lines to achieve our aims. I believe that once we have accepted this principle, namely that our film industry must be supported, that the following main principles should apply. Firstly, as I have said, there should be financial support, whether through subsidies, import duties, quota systems, tax concessions or other means. I am by no means necessarily advocating all these means&#x2014;as the hon. the Deputy Minister will realize. I am mentioning them as schemes which have been mentioned. Secondly, I believe that free enterprise, free competition, in regard to our film industry must be encouraged by preventing too large monopolies and cartels from dominating the industry at the expense of the legitimate, independent producers, distributors, exhibitors and also at the expense often of the actors themselves. Thirdly, the following principle should apply, namely that free enterprise in the film industry in our country should be safeguarded against the greatest monopoly of all, the monopoly of the Government itself with its National Film Board, the SABC and the Department of Information, all of them making films of their own. The fourth principle that should apply, I believe, is that the censorship of our films should be a limited one; it should be intelligent; it should keep up with public opinion and not be behind that public opinion. Fifthly and finally, the film industry must on no account at all be misused by the Government as a deliberate instrument for indoctrination and brainwashing. I believe that in all five of these issues that I have mentioned, this Government has failed to a lesser or greater extent. Let me take each of them.</p>

<p>First of all, let us take this strange subsidy system that we have today. Knowing this Government, and knowing what it has done in order to support local enterprise, local industries, local agriculture in matters <span class="col_2517-2518" refersTo="page_1276"/>such as the Transportation Boards, the piling up of butter stocks and the selling of butter stocks, the export of our local meat, the throwing of millions of gallons of milk into the gutter, we know what kind of thing we can expect from this Government. But I say that what has happened in those instances, is also what is happening in the case of the whole subsidy system as it is at present.</p>

<p>Briefly, what happens&#x003F; A producer decides to make a film. He has his company, gets the actors, gets the script, gets the necessary studios and equipment and then produces that film at a cost of, say, R110 000. It might be his own money or it might have been advanced by the banks or by one of the big local film companies. He can recover that R110 000 which the film cost him in two ways. First of all, part of the box-office proceeds, a percentage usually, is repaid to him as a hire of his film by the distributor or the exhibitor. Secondly, an important source of income to him is the subsidy that he receives from the Government. In theory, of course, these are two good methods. But now I come to the strange way in which this subsidy is calculated. It matters little to the Government what the film costs, whether it is R110 000, whether it is R200 000, or whether it is R20 000. Their subsidy is paid only on what a film makes at the box-office, irrespective of what the production cost. The greater the box-office income&#x2014;in other words, the greater the profits on the film&#x2014;the greater is the subsidy. In other words, the less the producer needs as a subsidy to cover his costs, the greater is his subsidy. The less the subsidy he needs is, the more the subsidy is that he gets. This is the way it works. First of all, the film must have a gross box-office receipt of at least R50 000. From that moment on it gets a subsidy of 44 per cent of the gross box-office receipts all over the country at all the cinemas where it is shown. It is a complicated system. I do not want to go into all the details. I might mention, incidentally, that if the film is made 95 per cent in Afrikaans, the subsidy is not 44 per cent, but 55 per cent of the gross box-office receipts. The reason which is advanced&#x2014;and there are grounds for that reason&#x2014;is that the market for Afrikaans films, the potential number of viewers of Afrikaans films, is much smaller than for English films.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>But is that not true&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, there is validity in that, but I also say there is validity in the opposite contention, that an English film made in South Africa has to compete with English films all over the world; its competition is greater, while the market for the Afrikaans films is smaller. There are arguments on both sides. I merely mention the 44 per cent and the 55 per cent to indicate how the subsidy system works.</p>

<p>What happens now&#x003F; The film is made and meanwhile this producer has signed a contract with the distributors and the exhibitors for his film. These gentlemen, these organizations, are a rather closely-knit bunch and are dominated at the present moment largely by the Satbel, Sanlam-Ster interests in South Africa. They are using their mighty Sanlam empire at the moment to dominate that industry. I saw the other day that the Sanlam&#x2014;General Mining complex is as a conglomeration today second in South Africa only to the Anglo American Corporation. This shows how large and how important that whole complex is. It exercises, directly or indirectly, domination over Ster Films, over Inrybeleggings Beperk, over Kinekor, over the old African Theatres and over African Film Productions. Actually, they are associated. It is often said that Kinekor and Ster are not really associated and that they are differenct entities. I will subscribe to that fiction as I would to the fiction that Anglo American and De Beers are not the same, or the fiction that, say, <i>Die Transvaler</i> and <i>Die Burger</i> are not the same, or other fictions such as those, or that Tweedledum and Tweedledee are not the same. I am not criticizing these big combines here; I am merely pointing out the fact that the distribution and exhibiting facilities, and to a large extent the producing facilities, too&#x2014;because these big organizations also finance producers&#x2014;are concentrated in the hands of one big overall body. Those are the facts.</p>

<p>The next step is this, that this film costing R110 000, now goes on circuit. The tickets, nowadays, as all members of the public know, are pretty pricey; they are pretty high. Particularly if you have a virtual monopoly of the exhibition houses, you can push up your price. However, it seems to be the case today that the public is prepared to pay that high price and it is an ordinary law of the market economy that people are entitled to ask what the public is prepared to pay. However, I still <span class="col_2519-2520" refersTo="page_1277"/>do say and I do believe that prices are too high. This film, having cost R110 000, goes to the box-office, is sent throughout the country and it grosses, say, R325 000 at the box-office. This is not very unusual for a film made in this country. Questions to the hon. the Minister have shown that films in South Africa have grossed R440 000, R560 000, R666 000 and, in one instance during the past 10 years, R735 000. But let us take this figure of R325 000 for the picture that I have mentioned. The subsidy on that is 44 per cent, which is R130 000. Now you see the strange anomaly. Here this film producer is getting R130 000 in subsidies for a film which cost him only R110 000 to produce. What is more, he is getting between 20 per cent and 30 per cent of the gross of the R300 000, which is the price the exhibitor or the distributor pays him for the rent of that film. Therefore, a film costing R110 000 gets a subsidy of R130 000, it gets part of the box-office receipts of R100 000&#x2014;in other words, he makes R230 000, which is much more than 100 per cent. There is something wrong in that; because of those huge profits the taxpayers, who are paying the subsidies through the hon. the Minister sitting there, are paying more than half of it. This is not an imaginary case. I ask hon. members to look at the reply I had from the hon. the Minister, in which statistics about all the 46 films that received subsidies since 1st April, 1967, are set out, This is a particular case. I have it here: Subsidy&#x2014;R130 000; cost&#x2014;R109 000; box-office receipts&#x2014;R326 000.</p>

<p>There is something wrong in the system as it is at the present moment, despite the fact that I do believe that Government support is essential for our film industry. In the past five years 46 films have been made, and the total subsidy paid on them has amounted to close on R4 million. It was R3 677 000, money coming out of the taxpayer&#x2019;s pocket. This subsidy has been rising fast. It climbed from R270 000 in 1966 to R1 360 000 last year, a five-fold increase. This also has its dangers. Mushroom companies have arisen. People who can crank a handle, point a camera, switch on a light, buy a megaphone and buy a shirt with the word &#x201C;Director&#x201D; on the back, have been trying to make films. They flood a limited market. We must remember that the South African film market can only support&#x2014;so I have been told&#x2014;between 12 and 20 feature films per year, and by feature films I mean the long films. At the moment there are between 35 and 40 feature films planned or being made. There is going to be overproduction in this country very soon. A lot of little mushroom firms are going under, which may not be so bad. However, in going under, they are going to drag with them many capable, experienced, independent producers and fine, capable firms. On the other hand, one or two of the small fly-by-night companies, which are making trashy films, will indeed prosper. Let us make no mistake about it; some of the films being made in this country today by companies taking advantage of this system, are indeed of an extremely low quality. I have here <i>Rapport</i> of the 5th December, 1971. I shall only point out the headlines, which read&#x2014;</p>

<p>I know, and the hon. the Minister will probably tell us, that there has been a lot of backroom buzzing in the past year or so about the subsidy itself. I believe a circular was issued to companies in July last year and that there were meetings in November, December and one in January at the Sunnyside Park Hotel. I am not quite sure whether the January or November meeting was held at that hotel. Anyway, there have been meetings with the producers and exhibitors to try and iron out the problem with regard to the subsidy. I think most people would admit that there is something wrong and that something must, indeed, be done. I trust that the hon. the Minister&#x2014;In fact I almost challenge him&#x2014;will give some assurance this afternoon that a fair formula will be found to support our film industry, but not on the present basis.</p>

<p>I am not going to suggest what the new formula should be, but I do want to say that there are many suggestions which can be considered that are better than the present one. I say &#x201C;can be considered&#x201D; and am stating it no stronger than that. Firstly, the subsidy could be tied to the production costs of the film. That sounds logical. Those production costs must be strictly audited. Secondly, if it must be tied to the box-office receipts, either solely or additionally, then at least a limit could be placed on the amount paid as a percentage of the gross box-office receipts. In France, I believe, the limit is 5 per cent, although there are other advantages that <span class="col_2521-2522" refersTo="page_1278"/>French films do get. However, the producer gets only 5 per cent of the box-office receipts. Here the percentage is 44 per cent or 55 per cent and under certain circumstances it can rise to 75 per cent. A third method, that could be considered, would be low-interest loans to producers for the purchasing of equipment and the building of studios. This is done in France by the Centre National Cin&#x00E9;matographique. Fourthly, the local films could be exempted from the entertainment tax, where such entertainment tax still applies, as an anachronism. Fifthly, co-production could be encouraged. Co-production means that a big company from abroad, for example Columbia, 20th Century Fox or M.G.M., can enter into a partnership with one of our local South African companies, which can then produce a profitable film.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Let me ask the hon. member if <i>Dr. Zhivago</i> that wonderful film, could be made in Spain with the co-operation of local Spanish authorities and Spanish film companies, if <i>Waterloo</i> could in part be made in Russia and if <i>Quo Vadis</i> in Cinecitt&#x00E0; the cinema city outside Rome, why it is impossible for one of the big companies to come to South Africa and make a film here&#x003F; As a matter of fact, arrangements are already being made with a film company in Britain for this system of co-production. I give it as an example, but there is a nigger in the woodpile, and that is our censorship laws. I shall refer to that later on in my speech.</p>

<p>Sixthly, as a possibility, and a strong possibility, private enterprise should be allowed to tender for Government documentary films. They have the facilities and they are able to do it to a much larger extent than at present.</p>

<p>Seventhly, and on this I have an open mind in view of the Board of Trades, report, No. 1330, I still think that a small customs duty on imported films could be considered and used as part of the subsidy instead of forcing the taxpayer to carry the whole burden. These customs duties were removed a couple of years ago when some exhibitors&#x2014;I am thinking of Dr. Naas Coertze&#x2019;s company&#x2014;could not get films or had to pay very high prices for them. After these customs duties were removed, foreign films could come in on a large scale, but at that stage our local producers did suffer.</p>

<p>I now come to the next point. I have now dealt with the subsidy and I have put forward some ideas, which I am sure the hon. the Minister also has been thinking or should have been thinking of. I am coming next the unfair monopoly in the business itself, but do not wish to say too much about it as I have indicated the evils or the disadvantages associated with it. It has the ordinary disadvantage of every monopoly, namely that in this case stringent contracts can be forced by the distributor on the producer. It has the disadvantage that a film can be rented and kept on the shelf for a long period and it has the disadvantage that the number of performances which a film by an independent producer is given is cut down by the exhibitor. Furthermore, a film can be kept from the big circuit. These things have been happening, and it is unfortunate that it is so. I do not accuse these big companies of <i>mala fides</i> but I do believe they too can suffer from some of the evils of a monopoly and that it is indeed worth while investigating the matter again.</p>

<p>I come to another form of unfair competition and that is the competition of the biggest monopoly, the competition from the Government itself. Here I refer specifically to the huge National Film Board complex which they are erecting in Pretoria. I call this complex &#x201C;Hollywood-on-the-Aapies River&#x201D;.</p>

It is going to become the brain centre of much of the television films that are going to be made, of feature films for television, of nearly all the Government films and of a great deal of Government propaganda. It will be the central administrative <span class="col_2523-2524" refersTo="page_1279"/>building of this whole huge complex which, in competition with private enterprise &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>It is not an old story. These things have been happening during the past two years, breaking a promise made by this Government in 1963, namely that it would not, through the National Film Board, interfere with private enterprise. Can the hon. member answer that&#x003F; I am going to tell hon. members something about this huge complex. It will have facilities for the making, the processing, the printing and the distribution of films in South Africa. It will be suitable for colour reproductions as well as for black-and-white reproductions. It will be for films for cinemas and for films for television. Originally it was to have cost R2 million, but now it is already going to cost R3&#x00BD; million of the taxpayer&#x2019;s money. It will have sections of up to four storeys high, it will have 36 offices, it will have numerous studios and complexes and it will have what is known as a grid stage. A grid stage is a stage where you have the actors on the floor of the studio and above that an iron grid and above the grid you will have the electronically controlled cameras fights which can be lowered and lifted through that grid to film what is going on below.</p>

<p>It is a thing that costs hundreds of thousands of rands and which no ordinary producing company in this country can yet afford. I have photographs here of this huge complex; I can show it to hon. members; the hon. the Minister has seen it. It is amazing what is being done at the moment in that regard. Sir, why is all this being erected&#x003F; It is being erected for the purpose of competing directly or indirectly with private industry; of seeing that private industry will not be given a fair share of the films to be made for television in future. I can say that it will even be part of the brainwashing procedure of this Government. Sir, this National Film Board was created in 1963 with one purpose only, namely to channel the demand of Government departments for their own documentary films through this central body, with the idea that the NFB would make only a few films of its own; but it has grown and grown and it has entered more and more into competition with private enterprise. Of course, when the National Film Board was formed it had such very innocent and impartial members on its board as Dr. Piet Meyer and Prof. Weiss.</p>

<p>Sir, what is left for private enterprise after all that&#x003F; The National Film Board was started as a small organization. In 1966 its capital expenditure was only R15 000, and yet today, six years later, they are already planning a R3&#x00BD; million complex. In five years the expenditure of the National Film Board out of the Revenue Account has almost doubled, to close on R1 million a year. This hungry giant of his has to be fed and he is determined that it is going to be fed, and has consequently put the screw on all the other Government departments, demanding that they start making films to keep this big complex fed, irrespective of whether all those documentaries are necessary. &#x201C;If you do not have a film to make, think up something; if you cannot, just pay a yearly subscription to the National Film Board&#x201D;, as the Department of Bantu Education for some bery obscure reason is doing. Sir, the result of all this was that in the balance sheet the National Film Board would show a wonderful income, an income of close on R900 000 a year, but who was paying it&#x003F;&#x2014;Other Government departments making documentaries through the National Film Board. Were those documentaries in any way producing any income&#x003F; Sir, I put 36 questions to the hon. the Minister; up to now I have got 25 replies. In every question I asked, &#x201C;What income has there been from those films&#x003F;&#x201D; And in every case the reply has been &#x201C;None&#x201D;. Sir, I am not against some of these documentaries, or indeed, most of them; many are good. But I do not believe that private enterprise should be given a greater opportunity to tender for the making of the films.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I do not know whether all of them are good. For example, I do not know whether that Ditaba series, of which 118 were made&#x2014;the object of which was, as the hon. the Minister told me, &#x201C;To inform the Bantu in their own language of the development in their homelands&#x201D;&#x2014;was so wonderfully good. I do not think much is said in those films about Moddergat and about Stinkwater. Three of those films were made last year at a cost of R36 000. The hon. member asks me if I know whether they are good. I accept that most of them are good. Do you know, Sir, that the Department of Defence spent as much as R280 000 during the past four years on having films made by the National Film Board, most of them for training purposes&#x2014;fine purposes&#x2014;but I am sure private initiative could have made them as well.</p>

<p>&#x2020;There was one film made for the Department of Defence costing R9 729, and the hon. member can tell me whether it is a good film or whether it is worth the money. I can only judge from the title and the title is: &#x201C;The Patient&#x2019;s Toilet&#x201D;. Sir, the Department of Bantu Administration ordered 11 films costing R170 000. The Ministry of Transport spent R137 000; Water Affairs spent R130 000, and films costing another R83 000 are being made at the moment. All this money has been spent over the past four years. Sir, equipment costing R480 000 is to be installed in this N.F.B. building. It can print colour, black and white, 35 mm. and 16 mm. at 12 000 feet per hour. The extent to which the National Film Board is involved in film-making of its own is shown by the amount of raw film imported over the last three or four years&#x2014;3 319 000 m of raw film has been imported, 2 000 miles of raw film, for making films.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to refer now to the censorship system as we have it today. It is crazy, it is antiquated, it is out of step with world opinion. It is hampering our film industry by inhibiting the importation of the world&#x2019;s best films, hindering and hitting at distributors and exhibitors alike. Of the 10 best films listed by two overseas critics recently, only two have been chosen in South Africa. It is harming our film industry by making our own producers scared to make significant films. I have a book here, <i>Veronica,</i> by Joy Packer, the South African writer&#x2014;an excellent book. I dare any film producer to try to make a film out of that book. He would lose every cent that he put into it, because the Publications Board would turn it down immediately, even if it did approve of the book.</p>

<p>Censorship is harming our film industry by banning or mutilating South African films. The Minister of the Interior has had to hear appeals against cuts in films such as <i>Love Story, There&#x2019;s a Girl in my Soup</i> and the Afrikaans film <i>Breekpunt.</i> Actually, he had to hear 35 appeals, almost one a week, during the past year. But, Sir, there is one case which is really so ludicrous that I think I should point it out to the House&#x2014; the case of the film <i>Die Onwettige Huwelik.</i> This film was placed before the Publications Board and certain cuts were demanded. I spoke to some of the highly placed people in the film industry and I managed to find out what cuts were actually demanded before this film was allowed to be exhibited. Sir, I am now going to read to you what had to be cut from that film. This is a dialogue between a professor and a young man called Herbert&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Professor: Kyk. kom ons neem aan jy gaan eet nou weer saam met my.</block>

<block name="quote">Herbert: Ek sal niks kan eet op die oomblik nie, professor.</block>

<block name="quote">Professor: Ek s&#x00EA; mos jy moet dit net aanneem! Ek probeer vir jou &#x2019;n vergelyking uitwerk.</block>

<block name="quote">Herbert: O, net vergelykenderwyse&#x003F;</block>

<block name="quote">Professor: Neem nou aan ons eet by &#x2019;n restourant. Ons eet vleis, sop en poeding. Wat eet ons&#x003F;</block>

<block name="quote">Herbert: Ons eet vleis, sop en poeding.</block>

<block name="quote">Professor: Nou eet jy dit soos ons gewoonlik eet, sop, vleis en poeding, in daardie volgorde. Wat het jy dan in jou maag&#x003F;</block>

<block name="quote">Herbert: Sop, vleis en poeding.</block>

<block name="quote">Professor: Uitstekend! En nou maak ons andersom. Ons eet eers die poeding en dan die vleis en dan die sop. Wat het jy dan in jou maag&#x003F;</block>

<block name="quote">Herbert: Dieselfde kos, professor.</block>

<block name="quote">Professor: Dieselfde. Daar sal geen verskil wees nie&#x003F;</block>

<block name="quote">Herbert: Nee, geen verskil nie.</block>

<block name="quote">Professor: Absoluut geen verskil nie&#x003F; En dit raak niemand nie. &#x2019;n Mens kan per slot van sake met jou maag doen wat jy wil. Dis jou maag!</block>

<block name="quote">Herbert: So is dit, professor.</block>

<block name="quote">Professor: Presies. As iemand soos &#x2019;n dokter of so nou kom en vir jou s&#x00EA; dis beter om jou kos andersom te eet, wat sou jy s&#x00EA;&#x003F;</block>

<block name="quote">Herbert: Dit sou vir my nie saak maak as ek die poeding eerste eet nie.</block>

<block name="quote">Professor: Natuurlik nie. Dit doen jou geen kwaad aan nie en traak ook niemand nie.</block>

<block name="quote">Herbert: Nee, professor.</block>

<block name="quote">Professor: Dit sou natuurlik gemeen wees om die poeding te eet en dan die sop te laat staan. Begryp jy&#x003F;</block>

<block name="quote">Herbert: Nee, professor. Ek probeer, professor, maar ek volg u nie.</block>

<p>Now you are probably asking when I am coming to the point and what has been cut out. The answer is&#x2014;every single word Sir, I was given this script by the director himself. It speaks for itself. I have some excellent additional examples, but my time is running short. Perhaps I should mention one thing in connection with the same film <i>Onwettige Huwelik.</i> The chairman of the Publications Board, Mr. Jannie Kruger, was telephoned about it and over the telephone he told the director&#x2014;and the director told me what was said to him&#x2014;&#x201C;Hoe durf jy &#x2019;n film Onwettige Huwelik&#x2019; noem hier in Suid-Afrika&#x003F; Hier in Suid-Afrika is daar nie so iets soos &#x2019;n onwettige huwelik nie&#x201D;. There was a cut of a certain scene, an innocent small scene, and I hope to have it published in the Press, of a young man just putting his hand on a girl&#x2019;s knee for a moment. In writing&#x2014;and I am going to get it in writing&#x2014;Mr. Jannie <span class="col_2529-2530" refersTo="page_1282"/>Kruger states this: &#x201C;Julle moet daardie deel uitsny waar die seun sy hand onder die meisie se mini insteek&#x201D;. Sir, it sounds fantastic and unbelievable, but it is in writing and I will produce it at some time or other.</p>

<p>I shall have to leave out quite a lot of what I wanted to say, and will conclude by summarizing what I believe should be done about the whole matter. I have already indicated what can be done in regard to the subsidy. That is my first recommendation. Secondly the National Film Board must go back to its original purpose of being a channel mainly for the work of Government departments, an intermediary between Government departments and private producers. Thirdly, our whole censorship system must be entirely and thoroughly overhauled and I call on the producers in this country to seek to do away with that system for which they are partly responsible, of agreeing to appeal to the Minister. The time for that is past. I call on them from now on to try to go to the courts and not to the Minister. <i>Scope</i> beat the Publications Board time and time again; you will do so too. Fourthly I believe that one could think of having cinemas for adults only, or have films classified as they are in England, as X, U, or A films. One could furthermore consider the subsidy on films for Bantu, and giving them fair treatment. One could investigate some of the phoney casting agencies that exist. One could give greater assistance to the actors&#x2019; organizations and greater recognition and greater powers to them in regard to industrial conciliation.</p>

<p>Lastly, and most important of all, it is essential that there be an investigating commission with wide powers on which there will be representatives of the film industry in all its aspects, producers, distributors, exhibitors, actors, technicians, on which you will also have the film critics, on which you will have people with knowledge of literature and knowledge of art and knowledge of the technique of film making, on which you will have all the people who really have to do with the future of the film industry including the enlightened public. Only if you have that and give these people full powers to say what I have been trying to say in a very limited time today, will you have indeed what we all want to have, namely a viable film industry in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove has now wasted 42&#x00BD; minutes of this House&#x2019;s time with the biggest lot of nonsense imaginable. The hon. member puts one in mind of a farmyard chicken scratching round on a rubbish dump in the back, and when he unearths something he runs away, not looking whether anyone is following him. He just runs. If one now examines the wording of this motion which the hon. member has on the Order Paper, one could easily gain the erroneous impression that the hon. member is concerned about the film industry, but if one heard what he said this afternoon it is very clear that he has no contact whatsoever with the film industry. He came along here trying to score a cheap political advantage. He dished up a lot of unsavoury morsels and wasted the House&#x2019;s time. It is very clear that the hon. member&#x2019;s chief motive in moving this motion was to get round to the National Film Board and try to discredit the difficult and positive structural work the Film Board has done over the years. But we know the hon. member for Orange Grove. He is at his best when he can discredit and try to destroy positive South African institutions. Then he is at his best. The National Film Board was inaugurated by legislation passed by this Parliament in 1963 with the object (a) of co-ordinating the film activities of State Departments, (b) of making provision for the purchase, production and distribution of information service cinematograph films, (c) of making a contribution to the development of the film industry and (d) of purchasing, collecting and processing cinematograph films of archival value. Over the years since its inception this Film Board has done its work in a very calm and very positive way, and it has made a very good contribution to the co-ordination and expansion of the South African film industry. Any responsible person in this House and outside would only attest, with the utmost gratitude and appreciation, to the positive structural work done by the National Film Board in recent years. But it is clear that the hon. member for Orange Grove does not like the Film Board, because the hon. member has a friend and spiritual ally who does not like the Film Board. One can only understand the hon. member for Orange Grove and his argument today if one knows that he is acting here as the mouthpiece of a man who hates everything that is Afrikaans, and that he is acting as that man&#x2019;s spiritual ally. The man I am speaking of is Mr. Harry Jones, editor of the <i>S.A. Film Weekly,</i> and <span class="col_2531-2532" refersTo="page_1283"/>that gentleman is apparently the hon. member for Orange Grove&#x2019;s inspiration and his guide. Much of the material he used today was obtained from only one source, that gentleman. This man, as I said, does not like the Afrikaner. He does not like the Afrikaner&#x2019;s language or his church, he does not like the Afrikaner&#x2019;s culture and he does not like this Parliament either. You may well remember that on a previous occasion he was brought before a commission of this Parliament for contempt. In the 10th February, 1972-issue of his magazine this gentleman wrote an article entitled &#x201C;S.A. Film Industry Crisis&#x201D;, he begins his article with a quotation from a Roy Campbell poem. It will interest hon. members to listen to this. It reads&#x2014;</p>

The shrimps, the pumpkins and the turnips in the course of trumped-up religion and ideology have made war on every section of film business with the end result that the Public has been plundered of its right to know for itself. The film industry too has lost the right to run its undertakings in the widest public interest.</block>

<p>The contemptuous tone in this quotation should be very clear to hon. members of this House. The question arising in my mind is whether this gentleman should not again be confronted. He continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The crisis is grave. Since its inception the Publication Control Board whose members are generally elected from subscribers to a religious sect, has decided what is good for us to see. Fearing a confrontation with political authority, only the film industry voluntarily forwent a right of appeal to the courts against the decisions of the Publication Control Board.</block>

<p>It is clear to all of us that the language used here is that of the hon. member for Orange Grove. It is unmistakably his brand of language. The signs of mutual admiration are not excluded either. Our friend, Harry Jones, writes about the serious crisis in the film industry, but then he also points to the deliverer. He writes&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Some hope now remains. The Nationalist Party Government having failed to take timely official action has lost the initiative. Mr. Etienne Malan, M.P. (Orange Grove) has served notice on the Speaker of the House of his intention to raise a motion in the Assembly &#x2026; requesting an investigation which it is going to be exceedingly difficult for the Minister to wangle his way out of.</block>

<p>There we have the spiritual father, the source of this motion before us. From that it is also very clear that the hon. member is not personally concerned about the film industry.</p>

<p>The hon. member begins the wording of his motion by requesting an investigation into the film industry. It is obvious that from time to time problems will crop up in an industry such as the film industry where a great deal of artistic ability, technical knowledge and experience, are needed. This Government has already, on a previous occasion, had the film industry thoroughly investigated. A thorough investigation was instituted under the chairmanship of Dr. De Villiers. Whether a further investigation would have any value now, I doubt very strongly. Mr. John Greerson was also brought here from England in the early fifties to investigate the film industry. After that we had the interdepartmental committee under the chairmanship of Dr. J. L. de Villiers. This committee&#x2019;s report specifically resulted in a Film Board being established to deal with the wastage of money and technical manpower. Now the hon. member for Orange Grove speaks in the first part of his motion about overlapping and duplicating in <span class="col_2533-2534" refersTo="page_1284"/>the making of films. It is very difficult to understand how this hon. member specifically can speak of overlapping and duplicating in the making of films. When this board was instituted in 1963, he was the very person who opposed its establishment. He was the person who congratulated the Minister of Transport when the Department of Transport was not linked up with the Film Board. He was the person who reproached the Minister of Information for having entrusted his department&#x2019;s powers to the Film Board. He also wanted the Department of Information to continue making its own films. In other words, if he had his way there would have been much greater overlapping and duplicating than there is today. It is therefore very difficult to understand how that hon. member could have moved this part of the motion.</p>

<p>In addition the hon. member complains about the system of Government subsidies whereby an inferior type of film is encouraged. What the present system of subsidizing amounts to is that any full-length film comes into consideration for a subsidy after it has achieved a box-office revenue of R50 000. I understand that the bodies concerned are at present considering an increase in this amount. This is a very difficult matter. Even the hon. member, who is so clever, hesitated to introduce a proper system of subsidizing and to express some positive ideas about that. This system possibly does not give the right results. The existing system has contributed, nevertheless, to an unparalleled improvement in film making. He himself admitted that last year there were about 14 full-length films released, the production costs of which amounted to about R128 000 per film and for which there was an amount of R1344 000 in subsidies. According to the <i>South African Film Weekly</i>, there are also at present 36 full-length films in an advanced stage of production or due for release shortly. The present system of subsidizing has also resulted in their being more film-makers in South Africa today than in England. At present there are 22 makers of main feature films registered with the Department of Industries, while there are no less than 79 makers of other kinds of films registered with the Film Board. It is very clear from this data that the film industry in South Africa is definitely not experiencing a crisis as he and his friend would like to imply. On the contrary, this indicates that the film industry is flourishing. I nevertheless also think that close attention will have to be given to the system of subsidizing because the industry is continually expanding and the population increasing. There are also other aspects that deserve attention, such as the advent of television, which may well influence box-office revenue. There will consequently have to be a very thorough examination of this system of subsidizing.</p>

<p>The hon. member had a great deal to say about censorship. We have already spoken a great deal about the question of film censorship. It is difficult to find new arguments today in that connection. I was abroad recently and after what I saw there I thank the good Lord that I am living in a country like South Africa where we have a Publications Board. Without any further comment I want to read this hon. member a short extract from the magazine <i>To the Point.</i> Here the writer gives a very detailed description of the pornography in the film industry in a city like London, where there is also a measure of control. I quote the concluding paragraph&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This is partly the result of the &#x201C;permissiveness&#x201D; of so many opinion-makers, partly the result of the confusion of a law which was diluted in an attempt to prevent obscenity prosecutions against works of &#x201C;literary merit&#x201D;. The combination of weak attitudes and legal uncertainty has let the pornographers, some of them in very big business, edge forwards.</block>

<p>Sir, that is specifically what that hon. member is advocating&#x2014;no action must be taken, because works of literary merit will be adversely affected; we must not make our legislation so decisive; we must dilute it and tone it down slightly, so that more films could at least come in. That would be the result. I tell you, Sir, we must give this matter a little &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the previous hon. speaker told us that there is no crisis in the Film industry in South Africa. I believe that a person who tells us at this stage that there is no crisis would not, as the hon. member proved in his speech, be able to understand the positive recommendations of the hon. member for Orange Grove in this motion either. For that reason I am going to make no further response to what he said.</p>

<p>I believe the time has come for us to measure the South African film industry by certain standards. We must, for example, ask whether the South African film industry succeeds, in the first place, in giving a correct reflection of the South African way of life. Secondly, I believe we should also ask whether it portrays Afrikaans culture as it really is. I think we must also go further and actually ask whether at this stage it is engaged in a constructive and enriching process. Before hon. members opposite get the wrong end of the stick and try to attack me, accusing me of trying to be negative, I am going to acknowledge frankly that in South Africa we have already seen tremendous positive results from the locally made product. But the question is, and this is what really forms the gist of the problem, that we cannot close our eyes to a new tendency that has developed, whereby continually poorer efforts are appearing on the screen as the products of the South African film-makers. That is what the matter is all about, and that is why we are here, to see what we can do about this matter. This hon. House must realize that a crisis exists, that there is no absence of a crisis as stated by my hon. friend, who has just spoken.</p>

<p>Sir, I admit there are rays of hope, and let us now just quote someone like Jans Rautenbach. For example, I quote the following from the <i>Tydskrif vir Geesteswetenskap</i> (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But amongst these highlights were the others, so many of them who merely remained in the dark and only cause confusion amongst the public. There is no consistent quality. Every Afrikaans film is full of surprises. Either our standard slips back 20 years or else it compares with the imported product.</block>

<p>As an Afrikaans-speaking person I should also like to read you the following letter, which appeared recently in <i>Hoofstad,</i> from a fellow Anton van Zyl, who wrote as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This film &#x2026;</block>

<p>I am not going to mention the film&#x2019;s name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; is definitely a film that in no way redounds to the credit of the Afrikaner. It is a film that makes one feel ashamed.</block>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; because he thinks that film is of inferior quality. I want the hon. the Minister also to realize that there is more and more of a tendency for inferior films to be placed on the market. But the matter goes further than that. Not only are they being placed on the market, but they can also become financial successes, and that is where we must try and analyse the matter here today. Films are a means of communication whereby the character of a people can be exposed for everyone to see; in contrast to literature and poetry, for example, it makes visual contact with the soul and the way of life of a people. The image formed there extends much further than just to the existing situation contained in the specific film. Irrevocably that image is also linked up to the community that gives it birth. How many people today, when they go to view an American comedy, do so with the idea that it is simply going to be a lot of foolishness&#x003F; Such an image was built up in the initial years of the American film industry. Other <span class="col_2537-2538" refersTo="page_1286"/>people again like to see a British comedy, because they look for the delicate sense of humour. What is the image we are creating in South Africa&#x003F; We cannot take a neutral stand on this matter. Someone like Jans Rautenbach&#x2014;I understand his wife was almost a candidate in Oudtshoorn&#x2014;issued a character reference for the South African film. He said the following about it: &#x201C;A few jokes, a little bit of action, a little bit of a concert, a few pretty girls and quite a bit of rubbish&#x201D;. It hurts me when anyone has to say such a thing of a South African product, and that is why I feel that we must give attention to what the hon. member for Orange Grove said here. There is something wrong somewhere.</p>

<p>I want to confine myself to two legs of this motion. The first is the subsidy system, which definitely gives rise to more and more inferior films being made. However, the film industry must be encouraged. The second matter I want to mention has a bearing on the censorship system that is applied and the inexplicable and unrealistic actions of the Publications Board. Hon. members may now ask how we link up these two matters. The present norm, according to which subsidies are allocated, is that of the box office revenue. In other words, the public are appointed as judges of what is good or bad. That is all very well under normal circumstances, but what do we find, however&#x003F; The accusation we are making is that as a result of the sometimes unrealistic and inexplicable actions of the Publications Board, some of the best imported products are never shown in South Africa. That is the first point. The second point is that we also find that the so-called old classic films are re-released <i>ad nauseum,</i> and that the imported product that is screened is sometimes only a little better than the South African product. The problem that consequently crops up is that the ordinary person who goes to a cinema has virtually no choice. He just wants to see something new, becuase after all he has already seen <i>Gone with the Wind</i> and others. Sometimes artificial successes are achieved as a result of the manner of distribution. As a result of that the box office revenue is increased and the film qualifies for a subsidy because more than R50 000 has been collected. The price we pay for this, and this hon. members must accept, is not only the R1,3 million paid out in subsidies, but also the fact that this acts as an encouragement for the making of inferior films. Thereby our own way of life and our own culture are prejudiced. That is an aspect we must give attention to.</p>

<p>Let us look at the elements that fuse in the making of a film. In the first place there are the film-makers. What have we found recently&#x003F; Me find that more and more film-makers are coming to the fore who were unknown in the film industry a few years ago. What is their contribution&#x003F; In this connection I can quote, for example, what Mr. D. C. Dreyer, Secretary of the M.P.P.A. (the Motion Pictures Producer Association) said. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Personalities unheard of in the film industry have been scrambling on to the band wagon resulting in a production of what a main distributor described as &#x201C;third rate&#x201D;.</block>

<p>What is the pot of gold these people are looking for&#x003F; It is very clear that the purpose is to make as quick a profit as possible. That is why we have these people. As I have said, they are increasing in numbers. It is useless to level accusations at them. It is not their mistake. Anyone is prepared to make a fool of himself if there are financial benefits involved. I could also quote Mr. Jans Rautenbach when he said that there are some of these new fellows who acknowledge frankly that their films do not have much substance, but that they are nevertheless going to earn a lot of money. We must therefore accept that there are fortune-hunters amongst the filmmakers in South Africa, and the fact that the present subsidy system is an encouragement to them is as plain as a pikestaff.</p>

<p>Where was that hon. member when the hon. member for Orange Grove spoke, indicating with figures how much it costs those people to make a film and what they get out of it&#x003F; But let us look at the actors and the technicians. I want to say again that there are persons in South Africa&#x2014;I am thinking particularly of the Afrikaans actor Cobus Rossouw&#x2014;who have already made excellent contributions, but they are unfortunately being overshadowed. <span class="col_2539-2540" refersTo="page_1287"/>In this article from <i>Rapport</i> reference is made to the use of amateur players, typists, mechanics, family members, singers, picture story heroes, Springboks and animals, just because they look attractive or are well known. That is the problem. What is happening&#x003F; As Jans Rautenbach says, after a year or so that amateur is again sitting behind a typewriter.</p>

<p>The criticism the hon. member for Orange Grove expressed I now want to relate to the Film Board&#x2019;s activities. The private film-maker also has a problem, because even under normal circumstances the professional actor is productive for only four or five months. There is a period during which he is inactive and unproductive. Therefore it is particularly unfair that they get this competition from the National Film Board in respect of documentary films. It is not the fault of the actors, technicians or amateurs that they appear. The fault must be sought in the system. When we come to the scenarists we find out from them that a film must sometimes be tackled without there even being a scenarist. They say that they sometimes write as the filming goes along. If South Africa was good enough in the finer arts, to produce a Pierneef in painting and in literature poets such as Leipoldt and C. M. van den Heever and a writer such as Lawrence Greene, we can surely also produce scenarists of quality in South Africa. That is the question we are saddled with. One of the problems&#x2014;and this is where the Publications Board is implicated again&#x2014;is that in South Africa we are probably entering a period of cultural stagnation. The person who sits own to write a scenario is in an unenviable position because he knows that his inspired creative ability will perhaps never reach the screen. That is our big problem.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is very interesting that the hon. members opposite tried to make out a case today for the private film maker. In that connection I have something on my mind. I sometimes wonder how the hon. member for Orange Grove thinks, how his mind works. In a moment I shall say why I ask this question. I also wish to know something else. When the hon. the Prime Minister spoke about the committee of inquiry that must be appointed to investigate certain organizations, he said we must see what their &#x201C;insides&#x201D; look like. I do not mean this in a derogatory sense, but I would like to see what that hon. member&#x2019;s insides looks like. I should like to see what it looks like inside a man who can come to light with so many negative statements every time he has a turn to speak in this House. So much for that. I also said I should like to know how his mind works. In 1963 that hon. member was not the one to intercede for the private film industry. Do hon. members know what he said at the time&#x003F;</p>

<p>This means, as it were, &#x201C;leave them alone&#x201D;. He also said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I believe that if the existing film companies are allowed to compete freely with one another &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is all they must do&#x2014;compete freely to have certain kinds of films made and the industry will then flourish.</p>

<p>All they need, in addition, is a sympathetic Minister of Finance. To what does that refer&#x003F; It refers to the subsidy system. &#x201C;Leave them; let them compete amongst themselves; let new mushroom companies spring up&#x201D;, mushroom companies to which he referred today, because that is competition, after all. The greater the number of companies, the greater the competition, is that not true&#x003F; According to the hon. member, apart from competition they only need the sympathetic ear of the Minister of Finance, because then they would also have the subsidy system behind them which would let the industry flourish beautifully. Today we hear quite a different story. [Interjections.] Today the subsidy system is being condemned from the very start. Now there is not a single good feature in the whole subsidy system.</p>

<p>In the first leg of his motion the hon. member also said that we must look at the overlapping, but he did not speak about overlapping today. In 1963 he justified <span class="col_2541-2542" refersTo="page_1288"/>overlapping. At the time of the 1963 Act on the establishment of the Film Board he said that the Railways were being left with their service. He said it was a good thing that the other services were being co-ordinated in the Film Board but that the Railways should be left out of it. He said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

I shall, however, mention only one example from &#x201C;a whole long list&#x201D; indicating how certain films are being given preference. After all, we know of all the examples he quoted. In the previous discussion he took part in, in connection with the Department of Information, he quoted one of the grossest examples one could possibly select from the lot of fine, positive things that could have been selected.

In so doing one could string out a whole series of factors. He did not tell us who should judge whether a film is bad or not.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. A. CRUYWAGEN</person>:</from>

<p>Very well, let us trust the newspaper critics. The hon. member for Durban Central says that very few good films come to South Africa. He says that we have to look at the rubbish because there is actually a scarcity of good films. I made a note here of what the hon. member for Durban Central said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the poor attempts, but the best of the products are not screened.</block>

<p>This refers to the imported product. Let us look at the judgments of the newspaper critics. Some of the newspapers allocate a star-rating to the films that are screened&#x2014; those which obtain five stars are outstanding films, etc. If hon. members want to have a look they will see that we get many films that are highly recommended and which we can therefore go and see. Then the hon. member simply makes an oblique reference to our never seeing the best products that can be screened.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove then made a passing reference to the position of the purely Afrikaans film which, according to him, is being benefited by a 55 per cent subsidy. He says that will still do, but that we must remember that the English film competes with all the imported films and must wage a tremendous struggle against them, and that we should therefore also take a special look at the English films. Is the Afrikaans film not in an even worse position&#x003F; Must the Afrikaans film not only compete against all the imported films, but also against the English films&#x003F; Must we not rather give more consideration to the purely Afrikaans film&#x003F; As the hon. member for Algoa said &#x201C;Speak of something Afrikaans, of businesses that are Afrikaans-orientated and now operate in the film market, and it is something that is odious&#x201D;. In earlier days when there was hardly an Afrikaans film in existence and there was hardly a single company handling films, that hon. member did not open his mouth about it. Then the others were free to scoop off the cream and they could have the pick of the grazing. When the Afrikaner comes on to the scene we always <span class="col_2543-2544" refersTo="page_1289"/>have that fuss and the casting of suspicion which that hon. member is engaged in. The hon. member even referred to the chairman of the Film Board as &#x201C;simply a teacher&#x201D;. In his time he learnt a short lesson from a Mr. van Rensburg. I am sorry that Mr. van Rensburg could not have been his teacher for a longer period.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Central referred to the fact that a film could be a powerful means of communication. He said it made contact with the soul of the community.</p>

<p>Yes, with the soul of the community. That was what the hon. member said. He referred to a film&#x2019;s &#x201C;exceptional convincingness&#x201D;. That is true. If it is true that films reach to the very soul with their messages, must they simply run wild without there being very strict control exercised over them&#x003F; Since they recognize the power of films, do those hon. members want us to slacken the control. The control must go to the dogs. Then there is also scornful reference to control as &#x201C;censorship&#x201D;. Hon. members must remember that the term &#x201C;censorship&#x201D; leaves a different taste in the mouth. It surely refers to iron-fisted regulation; it is surely something that differs from &#x201C;control&#x201D;. On the occasion of 18th November, when he addressed a meeting, the hon. the Minister of the Interior said:</p>

<block name="quote">May I be permitted to reiterate here, as I said earlier this year, that the control over undesirable material, which we have been implementing in South Africa since 1963, is something that is different to the summary and blunt impression of final condemnation without the right of higher appeal created by the word &#x201C;censorship&#x201D;. Here it is a process of consideration and decision which distinguishes itself from censorship in that a prejudiced party who disputes the decision of the Board can lodge an appeal with the Supreme Court and with the Minister of the Interior.</block>

<p>But throughout, when it comes to a discussion of this matter, reference is made to &#x201C;censorship&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I now want to come back to the hon. member for Orange Grove. He is one of the advocates for the rowdy minority in South Africa who want discipline and proper control cleared out of the way. While we still firmly advocate moral norms, they simply want them broken down. We want to tell the hon. member that we shall increasingly call upon the silent majority in South Africa, those who also still advocate decent standards in the film industry and in whatever may be employed for people&#x2019;s entertainment. We shall call them up to oppose those who want to break down the good and decent norms. They say that that must be cleared out of the way, but they do not say how. It is simply finished completely. We in South Africa are in the position that a lot of rubbish is loaded off onto us and also made locally. We on this side of the House, and by far the majority of the population of South Africa, are grateful that we do still have this control over films. An irresponsible appeal was also made to film makers not to take any notice of the Board of Control. It was said that they should not appeal to the Minister, but that they should go straight to court.</p>

<p>He merely condemns, and he simply eliminates those positive and good aspects of the subsidy system that are being investigated at present. After all, nothing positive counts as far as the hon. gentleman is concerned; only the negative aspects are hammered in. We know what the hon. member&#x2019;s attitude to the Film Board was from the beginning. Hon. members may go and read the speech he made in 1963. It is no different to any speech the hon. member has made or is still making these days in this House. We must also look at the good work done by the Film Board throughout the years, even though it is the institution to which he mockingly refers as &#x201C;Hollywood on the Aapies River&#x201D;, while it is miles from the Aapies River. Just as that building is miles from the Aapies River, the hon. member is always miles off the mark with the matters he comes along to present here. They also have made positive contributions and one must praise their positive achievements in all the branches of their work. We must not only condemn in a negative sense. The hon. member for Durban Central at least furnished criticism at a higher level. One listens with pleasure to that kind of criticism, but one would rather not pay any attention to the kind of criticism that comes from the hon. member for Orange Grove, because it is so exaggerated and so overemphasizes certain points that one feels one could rather leave it at that and form one&#x2019;s own opinion about these matters.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is a great pity that the hon. member who has just sat down devoted so much of his speech to a personal attack upon the hon. member for Orange Grove. The hon. member for Orange Grove made out a case for an investigation into the film industry, which he substantiated by numerous solid facts. In making a plea for an investigation, he finds himself allied to a large number of significant voices which are asking for a revision of the subsidy payments and various other matters in regard to the film industry. My time does not allow me to take it further than that.</p>

<p>This debate, not unnaturally, has been concerned almost entirely with films for adults; not that it has been specifically said, but this has in fact been the position. We are so absorbed at the present time and for some time past, with films for adults that we have completely overlooked a very important section of our film-going public, namely the young children of our country. I believe the time has come that films should be made specially for young children so that they can be shown to them. I want to make a plea in this sense to the hon. the Minister this afternoon. If we want to see how necessary such an approach is and how necessary it is to have films specially made for young children, we only have to ask ourselves this question &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>We only have to ask ourselves the question: Which of us with young children up to the age of 12 or thereabouts does not try to keep them from going to the matinees of our cinemas as long as we can manage it&#x003F; I believe the answer is that there is practically not one of us, with the exception of cases where good films are shown, who does not try and keep his children from developing this habit and going regularly to the cinema. This should not be so, because good films provide tremendous entertainment for children and they have a right to entertainment as we have, and good films can be tremendously stimulating for children. It can become a valuable experience for children, and this has been proved time and again. In regard to books, we do take the trouble to have books specially made for children. In regard to the radio, we take trouble to have radio programmes specially for children. However, <span class="col_2547-2548" refersTo="page_1291"/>in regard to films, year after year the sort of films that adults may go to see in the evening get dished up for our children in the afternoon. This is not good enough, because children need very special films. They particularly like films in which children appear. They need films with strong, clear stories, because with children one cannot moralize unduly, or one cannot attempt to preach to them unduly, since they very soon tire of that. This does not mean that children have strong values&#x2014;indeed, they have a very strong moral sense, and they want to see that justice is done in their films. I do not think one must get one&#x2019;s perspective wrong here. I said I believe that we mostly try to keep our children away from matinees for as long as possible. I do believe that our censors probably prevent many harmful films being shown to our children. I know that I along with others, when I was a child, went to matinees from time to time and I believe that we have survived them. However, I do think that where films are specially made for children, they can be a real experience and they can be thoroughly enriching, which certainly the ordinary run of film which we would see, was not. It is for this that I am pleading. There are important organizations which feel strongly about this. One that I know of is the National Council of Women, a council which is, very rightly, concerned for the future of our children.</p>

<p>Who is to produce these films&#x003F; Must it be the Film Board, or private enterprise&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>I would think that it should primarily be left to private enterprise. I would like to come to that aspect later on. Why is it that nothing has been done so far in this regard&#x003F; I think it is primarily because of economics. It has not paid the film producers, it has not paid the film distributors, and it has not paid those who owned theatre chains. Therefore I think we ourselves should immediately do two things. We should immediately resolve that we must direct our minds to this whole question and not allow it to continue, and then we must put on our thinking caps to decide what best should be done.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister very rightly asked who should be concerned with making these films. First of all, I would say at once, we certainly should think of producing films in South Africa which have a South African background. South African characters and South African stories. In that regard I am not very familiar myself with the strength of our film industry, but I would hope that it is strong enough, with help from the Government, to produce the necessary films. This certainly has been the pattern followed elsewhere and I would think that this would be the right pattern. I may say that experience has shown that when you are producing films for children, the essential criterion is that they should have first-rate entertainment value. This is the essential feature, and I believe that persons in the film industry would be the best judges of what that is. If there was any fear that they might produce unsuitable films, then naturally there are ways to control it, firstly perhaps by means of denying a subsidy for such a film and, secondly, there could of course be censorship, if you like, to ensure that nothing harmful was exhibited. A big part must clearly be played by our own film industry in producing these films. So far as I know, they have not yet truly directed their minds to this question at all. There may have been an isolated film made, but I think very few. I am thinking here especially of feature films as well as the smaller films. There may have been certain films made, but I think very few, or one would have seen or heard of them, having children of one&#x2019;s own, and one would have noted that they clearly were specially made for children and that they were good and interesting for children. Sir, because our film industry is young, it would clearly need a subsidy or some financial help from the Government in order to be able to make the films pay; I think that cannot be denied. There is already provision, of course, for subsidies for films which are made, and the system could simply be adapted in order to encourage the right type for children.</p>

<p>Sir, the second source of our films could be imported films, and I think it would be very wrong to close our doors to good imported films. I know in fact that in Britain for 25 years now a special effort has been directed by the Children&#x2019;s Film Foundation there a body constituted from all the elements in the film industry&#x2014;to produce films specially for children. It has <span class="col_2549-2550" refersTo="page_1292"/>considerable experience of this and it has produced a big library of films. It has at present 100 feature films available&#x2014;that is to say, films which run for approximately an hour. I think that we certainly should not deny our children the privilege of seeing films made in this way which have passed the test of time and which have passed all the tests of acceptability. Obviously here, too, certain financial help will be needed. It could perhaps be some form of remission of the film tax. This would clearly make it more possible for these films to be shown. Entertainment tax would probably not often be charged upon films seen by children, because the price would normally be under 50 cents. Here I am thinking particularly of the Cape Province. But where the entertainment tax does apply, it should certainly be reduced to make these films possible.</p>

<p>Sir, I would like to say also in regard to the achievements of this Film Foundation that they have been so successful that children in Great Britain have been flocking to these films at a time when very often adult films are not drawing people to the same extent. I may mention that in Britain they are screened in 700 cinemas, which is approximately half the number of cinemas showing films in England. In addition, the movement as a whole is going from strength to strength. I may mention, Sir, that the weekly audience of such films is approximately 350 000, which is a very substantial number. Much more could be said in regard to this point. I am satisfied merely to have, in this debate, drawn this point to the attention of the hon. the Minister. My plea to him is this: Let our minds be directed to this whole question. It is the whole area which I believe we have neglected, I think perhaps because we have been concerned with other things. I believe it is time we no longer neglect it and give young children of this country the enriching experience of films especially made for children.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>In the approximately 15 minutes at my disposal, I want to confine myself to that part of the motion by the hon. member for Orange Grove which relates specifically to the Department of Industries, namely (b) &#x201C;the system of Government subsidies whereby an inferior type of film is encouraged&#x201D;. I want to say at once that what I cannot understand about the hon. member&#x2019;s speech, is that he had a subject here on which we could have conducted a peaceful, calm and very useful discussion today, but what did the hon. member do&#x003F; In the first place, he couched his motion in these terms: the system of subsidies already stands condemned; there is no need to discuss that; and then he presented his motion, which one would like to discuss in a peaceful atmosphere, in such a way that he deliberately irritated every member in this House&#x2014;at any rate, on this side of the House; furthermore, he phrased it in clearly premeditated derogatory slogans, written down by him merely to be read out and apparently calculated not to deal with a problem here, but to make headlines in some or other newspaper.</p>

<p>Let us look at this question of subsidies. The hon. member suggested certain things which may be considered here&#x2014;financing, co-production, and a few others. I want to tell him that these are things which have already been considered. As far as I can remember, he also spoke about Bantu films. In that respect, too, so much progress has been made that it will soon be possible to submit proposals to the Government. In his motion the hon. member calls for an investigation. Sir, we have no objection to that. I can prove to him chapter and verse&#x2014;I have everything here&#x2014;how, since this subsidy system was introduced in 1957 and has been administered by the Department of Commerce and Industries, it has been subjected to continual study and how new adjustments have repeatedly been made, as the hon. member will know, in order to meet the needs which arose as the system developed. I may tell him, as has already been said here by another hon. member, that at the moment this same subsidy system is being investigated by the Board of Trade and Industries on the instructions of the Minister of Economic Affairs.</p>

<p>I said so.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Well, that is the position. In other words, we on the Government side are not saying that we have something perfect here. Work is being done on something which is possibly better than what we have today. But, Sir, let us agree&#x2014;this was clear from the speeches of hon. members opposite, including <span class="col_2551-2552" refersTo="page_1293"/>that of the hon. member for Orange Grove&#x2014;that the South African film industry needs State aid. In other words, we need not argue about the question why State aid is necessary. There is unanimity on that. There are good arguments, but I leave the matter at that; hon. members opposite accept it. As far as I could gather from their speeches, the hon. members opposite find one shortcoming, i.e. that the State aid being granted should not be of such a nature that it promotes inferior films. We are unanimous on that. It is the aim of this side of this House as well, and I think the hon. members know that. I want to quote examples of how attempts have been made over the years virtually to withdraw the subsidy from inferior films. I have with me the statistics which indicate this. I can mention examples of how special steps have been taken to encourage the South African industry to make use of overseas talent and concessions in respect of financial assistance have been made in that regard. The hon. member is aware of that, but we have one problem, namely that when we want to distinguish between the inferior film and the good film in respect of subsidization or whatever form of financial assistance, there has to be selection on the basis of merit. This is the position at present, and it is the position which the hon. member for Orange Grove and other hon. members opposite have condemned. As the system is working at present, one has a few other provisions in practice, but in effect that selection is in the hands of the public of South Africa. If the hon. member had said that this first R50 000, which was introduced as long ago as 1964, was too small an amount to qualify for a subsidy, I would have said at once that I thought the hon. member had a point, because this was introduced as long ago as 1964, and serious consideration may be given to the question of whether it is not too low. But the hon. member came forward and argued conversely. He said we should consider what we were doing, and quoted statistics in order to try to substantiate that false argument&#x2014; I do not mean he acted falsely, but I say it was a false argument&#x2014;that we help the film which is a success, i.e. the film which practically pays for itself, and do not help the film which is a failure, and that is wrong. But this is precisely what we want to do. The selection is in the hands of the public and they indicate to us whether that subsidy should be paid after the first R50 000. If it does not reach that R50 000, it receives no subsidy. Then the hon. member may argue that this R50 000 is too little. But at this stage our arbiter is the public, and apparently the hon. members opposite do not want this. What do they want&#x003F; Do they want something like the Publications Control Board, or a censorship board or selection board&#x003F;</p>

<p>The subsidy must be partly to cover the production costs.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The cost is the decisive factor at the moment&#x003F; It was linked to production costs and I think to a certain extent it is still linked to production costs at the moment. But, in any case, there was a link with production costs in the past. Then it was found that it was not working properly because production costs are variable and can very early be manipulated. They can be manipulated, and the hon. member must concede that. In other words, we are doing here what the hon. members of the Opposition advocate so often in this House in respect of so many other matters, where the education, or lack of education, of the community is concerned. They advocated it when they kicked up such a fuss here against the Censorship Board and bodies of that nature. We say the public must judge, and if the public&#x2019;s judgment is such that one gives the inferior film all the benefits of this subsidy, and the good film does not receive the benefits of the subsidy, it is not the task of the Opposition to try to criticize the subsidy. Then the Opposition&#x2019;s task would be to educate the public. They have always been the people who have appealed to public opinion. We are dealing with an industrial matter here, and in all industry it is an economic law that public opinion determines the success of a product. It is a law which applies in every field where one thinks in terms of economic activities.</p>

<p>Specific films&#x003F; What is our aim&#x003F; We want to establish a strong, sound film industry. What is happening at the moment is that when the profits, as the hon. member stated, are larger and the earnings are larger than the expenditure incurred, because the judge, i.e. the public, liked the production so much, we are in fact, by the way in which the subsidy is paid, stimulating that specific undertaking which achieved that success, to continue expanding strongly and soundly. This is what we are achieving. We shall be very happy when we reach the stage where we can say that the film industry of South Africa is so firmly established and sound that we can take away the subsidy. It will be a very happy day. But are you now going to discriminate against people in respect of this subsidy because, according to the judgment of the public, they are doing better and achieving more success than the next man&#x003F; Must one discriminate against them for that reason&#x003F; And this is in fact what the hon. member for Orange Grove advocated. The matter cannot be tackled in that way. Surely that is not the right way of doing things.

<p>Have we not for years had the experience in the local film industry, which after all, and unfortunately so, caters for 1,3 per cent of the demand, of some very bad pictures that have been shown, some pictures which have been to the discredit of an industry in this country&#x003F; Does it not also lead to the possibility of the very permissiveness which is being frowned upon, some subtle form of permissive type of film stories being placed before the public&#x003F; Many of them do pass the censors because they are within certain limits. Would not the industry play up to perhaps a peculiar sense of humour of the public which might be to the detriment of the industry, which has been responsible for some very bad pictures which have been shown over the last few years&#x003F; It has also been admitted by the hon. member for Germiston that this subsidy system is not really effective and that it should really be changed some way or another&#x003F;</p>

<p>However, let me deal with paragraph (a) of the motion of the hon. member for Orange Grove and draw the attention of the hon. the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs to the report by the Board of Trade and Industry on the investigation into the motion picture industry, report No. 1330. There it is said that the board took the trouble to interview some of the most important producers and exhibitors in the country in order to get some proper appreciation of what is taking place. We find that in paragraph 55 they say this:</p>

<block name="quote">Producers and distributors as well as the Federation of Film Societies of South and Central Africa expressed the opinion that the production by the National Film <span class="col_2555-2556" refersTo="page_1295"/>Board of films for Government departments has a harmful effect on the film industry and that the State competes with the private sector.</block>

<p>They go on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In South Africa, however, the private sector is virtually debarred from this source of employment.</block>

<p>They say this because they talk of the Government being an important provider of employment for the motion picture industry, especially as far as documentary and educational films are concerned. Then they go on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An important producer expressed the opinion that this action on the part of the Government has slowed down the development of the industry considerably.</block>

<p>That fully justifies the complaint and the point of view of the hon. member for Orange Grove that &#x201C;overlapping and duplicating in the making of films by Government Departments and bodies which are directly or indirectly subsidized by public funds&#x201D; needs some form of investigation if you are to promote the film industry at all and to build up this percentage of its meeting the demand in this country to a greater extent than 1,3 per cent, which is a very low and, I think, innocuous contribution at this stage. We can take many other forms of cultural activity in this country which have through the years by insisting on the best form of display or the best performances, been able over the time, despite difficulties, to build up to a very high and successful standard in this country. In their case subsidies have been provided in the initial stage. Here you have these two difficulties. The one is the competition of the National Film Board and the other is the system of subsidy which, in my opinion, is misdirected and ill established.</p>

<p>Let me go further. Is the Censorship Board really doing its job satisfactorily&#x003F; The decision in regard to the films which they permit to be exhibited, as well as the films which they do not permit to be exhibited, only applies to the question of public showing and nothing else. I leave the rest to the hon. the Minister to work out, but that is as far as they go; they go no further than that. They deal only with the question of public showing. I should like the hon. the Minister who deals with this particular department, to give us some opinion as to what happens beyond that limitation. Is he satisfied with the situation as he finds it existing in the country today and is that the form of censorship, with much of which we disagree because of the manner in which it is applied and the method which is used, the most satisfactory form&#x003F;</p>

<p>May I go further and say that an investigation is also required into the motivations of the Publications Board. I think, for instance, that it would be important in the general interest of producers and distributors and entrepreneurs in this country that the board, when it censors a picture by either excising portions of it or banning it, should motivate its reasons for doing so. Will that not be sound guide-posts in connection with the industry in this country so that in the case of the assistance which we obtain from overseas it will be known what type of film may be shown here&#x003F; It will also be an encouragement to bring the best pictures into this country and also to the very people who are producing films and helping to build an industry in this country. Surely that is an important factor. Why should the Publications Board act completely by itself and give no reason if it does not wish to&#x003F; Surely there are other people who can think on the subject and who can contribute towards the value of the reasons that the board may have in banning or interfering with the production or exhibition of a picture. Those are factors which I think one can well bear in mind. The Publications Board has objected, for instance, to legal representatives of an exhibitor or importer being present. They have resented any form of opinion from anyone else but their own. I think&#x2014;I am sure this is what the public think&#x2014;that the attitude of the Publications Board is very high-handed and not conducive to the promotion of a film industry in this country, nor does it encourage it. This is borne out by the type of film they allow to come into the country and the fact that some of the most beautiful films with a high standard of production have never been permitted to be shown in this country.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, today, indeed this afternoon, this very hour, must have been a very great occasion. The hon. member for Algoa referred to an article which appeared in the <i>South African Film Weekly.</i> We ascertained from that article that it was announced on 10th February that today would be a great and important occasion, for the hon. member for Orange Grove was going to make a great attack on the Government on the subject which he introduced here, and that this would be the opportunity for private initiative in the film industry to have all their problems solved. The expectation was that after the hon. member for Orange Grove had demonstrated, remonstrated and declaimed here in this House, as we have come to expect from him, the walls of Jericho would collapse. Sir, you have been here the whole afternoon and therefore heard what happened here. I am afraid that the friends of the hon. member who inspired him to introduce this motion will be very disappointed at the use he made of information he received from the various departments, including my own. If I think how many manhours were required from various departments to furnish the hon. member with information for this motion, and what he did with it, I must say that I think he should take the officials into consideration.</p>

<p>I think he can also, if he is so concerned about savings, bring about a major saving by not asking unnecessary questions.</p>

<p>The motion asks for an inquiry into the matters mentioned here. There are four different points. It has become clear to the hon. member at this stage that an inquiry such as he is requesting, is in no way necessary, because the facts are known to the various departments that deal with this matter. The motion he introduced was really a <i>pot-pourri</i> motion, a motion affecting different Ministries and under whose revenue vote he could probably have raised most of these matters to advantage. But he chose to raise these matters by way of a motion, which he has every right to do. It must, however, have become clear to him that the inquiry he requested, is in no way necessary, because there is no substance to the case he made out for such an inquiry. The main attack, so it seems to me, was concentrated on the subsidy system, which actually falls under another hon. Minister. I think my hon. colleague, the Deputy Minister, furnished an adequate and convincing reply to the objections made by the hon. member for Orange Grove. The hon. member for Durban Central also blamed the subsidy system for the poor quality of the films which are being manufactured in South Africa. The hon. member for Pinelands and the hon. member for Jeppes also advocated a change in the subsidy system. Hon. members were informed this afternoon that such an inquiry is already in progress, that it represents a regular, permanent study of this problem since the subsidy was introduced. I think this ought to satisfy the hon. member, as well as the film industry in this country.</p>

<p>But the problem we have with the hon. Opposition is that they blow hot and cold. Just take, for example, the speech made by the hon. member for Pinelands. Which one of us could have any objection to what the hon. member said here this afternoon&#x003F; He pleaded for good films for children which you could freely send your child to see. How else can one have good, wholesome films for children, even for adults, but that the film should first be manufactured, that one should subsequently view it and then that one should remove from it anything which one regards as offensive&#x003F; In other words, there must be a form of control or censure, call it what you will, but it cannot be exhibited without control. In other words, the hon. member was pleading for a form of censure. The hon. member for Orange Grove said in his speech&#x2014;I wrote it down here&#x2014;&#x201C;censorship hampers the film industry&#x201D;. That is what he said. Now I ask you, Sir, how is one able to reconcile these two extremes&#x003F; I think my hon. friend from Germiston hit the nail on the head when he said that this side of the House stands, however unpopular it may be to say this, for the retention of the values we have learnt to know in this country. I know the hon. member said by way of an interjection that that is what he stands for as well. But I ask him not only to stand for that; he must also do something to protect and to maintain those values. Otherwise we will make no progress in this country. I therefore want to say that the particulars before us and the arguments <span class="col_2559-2560" refersTo="page_1297"/>put forward by the hon. members on the opposite side do not prove that there is a need for such an inquiry, and I most certainly do not support such a suggestion. If I also take into consideration that my hon. colleague, the Deputy Minister, dealt comprehensively with this matter of the subsidy and pointed out how complicated that system was, and if I further take into consideration that hon. members on the opposite side all stated that the subsidy system should be changed, I must add to that that not one of them said how it should be changed to the satisfaction of the State, the public, which wants a better quality film, the journalist, who is in the privileged position of being able to exercise criticism, and also to the satisfaction of the film manufacturers. The hon. Opposition wants those answers from the Government. I can tell you that this matter is receiving the necessary attention, although it is not the responsibility of my department. But if there is a solution, this side of the House will offer that solution. Then hon. members can again, as they are now doing, proceed to criticize it.</p>

<p>I want to return to my department and the attacks which were made on the National Film Board, whose estimates are the responsibility of my department. In the first place I want to say that I have serious objections to the fact that the hon. member for Orange Grove felt himself called upon to refer to the manager of the National Film Board, Mr. Jan Botha, so derogatorily in this House.</p>

<p>It is the privilege of the hon. member to raise the actions of any official in this House and criticize the results of his work. That is what we are here for, but I think it is very unworthy of the hon. member to have made such snide remarks about Mr. Botha. I leave this matter at that.</p>

<p>I said that I want to take a closer look at the Film Board in the light of the accusation the hon. member made this afternoon. My friends on this side have already referred to that. We all know that the Film Board was established to coordinate the requirements of State Departments in the manufacture of motion pictures in an attempt to eliminate duplication and waste. We are all aware of that. The hon. member for Orange Grove also referred to it, but I want to ask him why he only referred to the co-ordination achieved by the Film Board, and why he did not also refer to the fact that the Film Board also has the function of manufacturing films&#x003F; Was this deliberate or did it suit him to omit to take this into account in the course of his argument&#x003F; He made an attack, and the purport of the attack was that the Film Board is doing work which it should not be doing. It is manufacturing films and competing with the private sector. That was the purport of his attack. He conveniently omitted to mention that in terms of the Act which established the Film Board, the Board was instructed very specifically to manufacture certain films as well. That the hon. member did not mention, and I want to return to this point again in a moment. Apart from co-ordinating the State&#x2019;s requirements the Film Board has the specific task, in terms of the objectives laid down in the Act, of manufacturing films for the State and for statutory bodies. In other words, it must not only co-ordinate the requirements, it must also manufacture. The hon. member referred to the then Deputy Minister, Mr. Viljoen, who introduced the legislation, and he said, &#x201C;Minister Marais Viljoen said that the Film Board will not compete with the private sector&#x201D;. He is quite correct, for Mr. Viljoen did say that. But now I want to tell the hon. member what the Minister said in addition to that. He said that the annual requirements of the State in regard to films was calculated to be an eventual 200, of which the Film Board itself could manufacture 80, and 120 could be allocated to the industry. In other <span class="col_2561-2562" refersTo="page_1298"/>words, there was no undertaking given by Mr. Marais Viljoen that the Film Board would not manufacture any films. It is specifically stated in the Act that it should manufacture those films, but that it should not manufacture all the films, and that it should also channelize work to the private industry. That is what Minister Marais Viljoen said, and it is still the position today.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Could the hon. the Minister tell me what percentage was channelized to the private industry last year&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I have the particulars here and I shall gladly furnish them to the hon. member. The target set at the time by Minister Marais Viljoen has not yet even been achieved today. The total requisition from all State Departments has never amounted to more than 115 films per year.</p>

<p>Now I should like to come to the aspect raised by the hon. member. He asked what percentage is being manufactured by the Film Board and what percentage by the private sector. I want to discuss this point in quite some detail with the hon. member. I maintain that the Film Board has continued faithfully, in accordance with the instructions given to it in terms of the Act by which it was established, to manufacture certain films itself but that it has never competed for contracts with other private organizations, and it has indeed channelized a considerable percentage of that work to the industry. The hon. member asked me what the amounts are, and I want to furnish certain particulars. In 1965-&#x2019;66 the amount of work done by the trade amounted to R146 262, which represents 23 per cent of the total work undertaken. In 1966-&#x2019;67 the trade received work to the value of R210 363 from the Film Board, which amounts to 26 per cent. In 1967&#x2019;68 work to the amount of R269 855 was channelized to the trade, which represents a percentage of 27 per cent. In 1968-&#x2019;69 this amount was R381 443, equivalent to 33 per cent. In 1969-&#x2019;70 it was R435 816, 35 per cent of the total. In 1970-&#x2019;71 it was R466 595, the equivalent of 33 per cent of the total. In other words, I can say in general that the Film Board has, in the year in which it has existed, channelized approximately 30 per cent to 33 per cent of the work to the private sector, to a total amount of R1,91 million. Hon members are complaining now that the Film Board is venturing into the domain of private enterprise. Hon. members forget however that the Film Board was established for a specific purpose and that it has a task to perform. That task must be performed in accordance with the Act by which it was established. In terms of that Act it is provided, <i>inter alia,</i> that it must perform its functions according to this pattern I have just presented to you. Let us make no mistake about this&#x2014;the Film Board will itself continue, as in the past, to undertake a certain percentage of the work it receives from State bodies, because that is after all its main source of revenue. It must receive that revenue to be able to function properly. I want to emphasize&#x2014; and my time will not allow me to go into details&#x2014;that the Film Board also has far wider and far more functions than just this function we have now been arguing about. If competition from the Film Board, even the limited competition I have now sketched to hon. members, can be so deadly to the private sector, how does the hon. member for Orange Grove explain that when the Film Board was established there were only a few film manufacturers in the country and that today the names of 79 firms appear on the tender lists of the Film Board&#x003F; Surely that means that they have grown, in spite of this competition. Or have they perhaps grown as a result of the work they received from the Film Board&#x003F; It seems to me that the hon. member conveniently forgets those particulars, and that he merely generalizes. An hon. member said here that the hon. member had spoken in general terms, which was quite correct. I just want to add a codicil to that and say that not only does the hon. member suffer from a predilection to speak in general terms, he frequently utters hollow phrases.</p>

<p>I still want to elaborate briefly on a few other achievements of the Film Board. I have already emphasized that the Film Board not only has the function of coordinating the requirements of the State, in part manufacturing films itself and for <span class="col_2563-2564" refersTo="page_1299"/>the rest to channelize work to the private enterprise, but that it also has other functions. It struck me that hon. members on the opposite side said nothing about the quality of the films made by the Film Board. There was no criticism in that regard&#x2014;the hon. member for Durban Central was the only one who referred to that in passing&#x2014;and I therefore take it that the quality of the films made by the Film Board is to the satisfaction of the hon. Opposition. Since 1966 the activities of the State have in this way been transferred through the Film Board to no less than 45 million viewers. This is no mean achievement. This is an achievement which, in my opinion, justifies in every respect the establishment of the National Film Board and the expenditure in this regard. One of the hon. members&#x2014;I think it was the hon. member for Durban Central&#x2014;also mentioned the training of people in the film industry. He was referring more specifically, I think, to actors and actresses, but I want to say that the Film Board has also in this field achieved a great deal in that it has in conjunction with the Pretoria College for Advanced Technical Education, established a training course for film technicians, a course which it is still presenting, through which a great deal of work is being produced in favour of not only the Film Board but also the entire film industry in South Africa. This is something we should be grateful to these people for. But of course we hear no mention of that.</p>

<p>I should like to raise another point, also in regard to which nothing was said. As a matter of fact, I almost think that one of the hon. members on this side of the House just mentioned it. This is that the Film Board is performing a herculean task in collecting films of historic value, restoring them and making them available for exhibition and preservation. That is one of the salutory functions of the Film Board. I have here a long list of what has been done. However, my time does not allow me to go into this in detail.</p>

<p>I want to deal with another serious objection raised by the hon. member. He referred to this Film Board building and scornfully called it Hollywood-on-the-Aapies River. I want to task the hon. member whether he realizes that the Film Board has, since its inception, always conducted its activities in two rented buildings which were situated at a considerable distance from each other, buildings which were not equipped for this kind of work because one needs completely specialized buildings where laboratory work can also be done. In spite of these circumstances they achieved the results they did in fact achieve. That building to which the hon. member referred was already planned in 1966, as I said in a reply to a question put by him. The expenditure in regard to it, the planning in regard to it, as the hon. member knows, because he put the question and received the replies, was properly checked in advance by my department and again by the Treasury, and was properly appropriated by this Parliament. The hon. member referred to the cost of the building and said that it was going to cost so much more than had originally been estimated. I asked the hon. member what building, which was planned in 1966, would today still cost the same to build as it would have done when it had been planned. This is surely a natural phenomenon which all of us are acquainted with and which all of us accept, except that hon. member who now sees, in the case of the Film Board building, an opportunity to belittle this matter. The Film Board is receiving a fine, efficient and functional complex in the area in which it is at present active, a complex which will enable it to continue the good work it is doing in the interests of South Africa, in the implementation of the task entrusted to it, and will enable it to continue to implement these functions entrusted to it by legislation faithfully.</p>

<p>The other problems in regard to the film industry the hon. member can leave to this side of the House. This Government will find the solutions to those problems, and we shall try to assist this industry.</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Deputy Minister in one of his speeches gave us certain limited details about the operation of the aid centres under the existing legislation. He referred to the fact that approximately 36 000 people had already been referred to these aid centres. If my figures were taken down correctly, approximately 2 910 had been discharged thereafter, 3 671 cases had been withdrawn, while in about 27 800 cases they had been sentenced. He described this as a success factor of 25 per cent. We would be very glad if the hon. the Minister would elaborate how he sees the system working now, more particularly whether he expects that it will be necessary to detain or hold over the people that are being referred to those centres while their cases are being considered. We have been fortunate enough to have seen the memorandum which he has produced. We are very grateful for that. In that memorandum the hon. the Minister refers to certain procedures which one can see will mean that people will have to be kept while their cases are being investigated. We would appreciate it if the hon. the Minister would tell us in greater detail how he sees the system working now.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, before replying to the hon. member, I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;thereunder&#x201D; in line 4, page 7, up to and including &#x201C;Gazette&#x201D; in line 6.</block>

<p>As I indicated in my Second Reading speech, the ideal is for a 24-hour service to be established as soon as possible for the aid centres. Accordingly I hope that the passing of this Bill by the House of Assembly will expedite the achievement of that ideal. Perhaps it would be best for me to read to the hon. member from a report by the manager of the aid centre which was established at the beginning of this year in Carr Street in Johannesburg. The verbatim report of the manager of the aid centre for the period 3rd to 6th January, 1972, reads as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As soon as the particulars of a detainee have been taken down by the police the case is taken directly to the Clerk of the Court, who reports for duty at 7 a.m., together with all other members of the staff, for the case to be registered. As soon as the case has been entered in the court register, it is handed to the team of investigators from the aid centre. As soon as the investigation has been completed, that is to say, when the illegal presence of the person under arrest has been ascertained and confirmed beyond any doubt, by means and with the aid of the existing State, municipal and location records, the case is ready to be brought before the court for trial.</block>

<p>May I say at once that hon. members will understand that this is one of the most important reasons why we were obliged to locate the aid centres as near as possible to an ordinary Bantu Commissioner&#x2019;s court for the proper functioning of these aid centres, otherwise you find yourself with transport problems which can become very difficult if you have many cases at an aid centre or at a Commissioner&#x2019;s court, as is in fact the case in regard to these technical offences; then you do not only have the transport problem, but the costs in connection with that transport as well. The report reads (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Guided by the established factual history of the person under arrest and the recommendation of the aid centres, the charge is then summarily withdrawn by the prosecutor and the accused is set free immediately after the ordinary police formalities have been completed, or the <span class="col_2567-2568" refersTo="page_1301"/>case is referred to the Bantu Affairs Commissioners&#x2019; courts at Carr Street by the legal officer attached to the aid centres, to be tried the next day. It should be mentioned here that every individual who leaves the court at the aid centre is provided with protecting documents which contain full particulars of what he has to do to legalize his presence in the area, and, in addition, everything is explained to such a person in detail at the aid centre.</block>

<block name="quote">The following condensed exposition of the activities of the aid centre reflects the measure of success which has already been achieved.</block>

<p>At this stage I just want to tell hon. members&#x2014;I think it will interest them&#x2014;that the new aid centre at Carr Street in Johannesburg was opened on 3rd January, 1972. At that time there were 51 detainees. Twelve cases were withdrawn on the recommendation of the aid centre, i.e. 23,53 per cent; 39 cases were referred to the Bantu Affairs Commissioner&#x2019;s court for trial. On 13th January the total number of detainees was 114; no fewer than 71 cases were withdrawn by the aid centre; in other words, the success factor at that stage was 62,28 per cent. On 18th January, 1972, the total number of detainees was 156; 105 cases were withdrawn and the success factor, in other words, the percentage of cases that were withdrawn, was 67,31 per cent. In this way the number increased to 216 on 24th January, 1972; 110 of these cases were withdrawn, and on 26th January, 1972, there were 283 detainees; 131 of these cases were withdrawn, which represented 56,2 per cent. At the end of the month, on 28th January, the number of cases withdrawn was once again 61,62 per cent. It is also interesting to note that for the first three days the position at the Carr Street aid centre in Johannesburg was as follows: On 3rd January, the total number of detainees was 51; 14 cases were withdrawn on the recommendation of the centre; no one was cautioned and discharged on that day; 37 criminal cases were referred to the Bantu Affairs Commissioner&#x2019;s court for further trial. On 4th January the total number of detainees was 151; 55 cases were withdrawn; there were 96 criminal cases. On 5th January there were 163 detainees; 21 cases were withdrawn; 36 detainees were cautioned and discharged and 106 were referred to the Bantu Affairs Commissioner&#x2019;s court. On 6th January there were 145 detainees; 18 cases were withdrawn; 36 detainees were cautioned and discharged and 91 were referred to the Commissioner&#x2019;s court. It seems, therefore, that an exceptional measure of success is being achieved with this procedure which I described to the hon. member.</p>

<p>I just want to put two more small points in this connection. The first is that it is very gratifying to see what a large number of technical offenders among the Bantu report of their own accord at all these aid centres which have now been established, without the intervention of any person or body. Secondly, I want to point out to hon. members that at all these aid centres, and at the Carr Street aid centre in particular, the percentage of cases dealt with every day is very high, for the simple reason that the system according to which information in respect of reference books can be obtained from the central reference bureau in Pretoria has been perfected to such a degree that it functions very efficiently. I have personally visited it more than once. Information in respect of reference books of an almost incredible number of Bantu can be obtained from the central reference bureau in Pretoria in a very short time, which has made it possible to deal with such a large number of cases every day. But that is for the present. I want to emphasize that the system is only at its initial stage; that it will continue to expand and that we hope it will develop in a very positive way. We shall endeavour in that process to have a 24-hour service in regard to this matter functioning as soon as it is practicable, all factors considered. That is the reply to the question put to me by the hon. member.</p>

<p>No, not special hostels. As I have already explained, it must be understood that these aid centres are not intended as places for the detention of these people. If a case which comes to the aid centres cannot be disposed of during that day, then the necessary arrangements can be made for the Bantu concerned to be housed for the night&#x2014;because in those cases it will only be for one night&#x2014;in a Bantu hostel in the vicinity.</p>

<p>*I emphasize again that the idea is to dispose of these cases during the day as far as possible. If there are any indications that the technical offender is really a problem case, then overnight facilities can be arranged at the police office&#x2014;at the nearest police office in the case of Johannesburg, or at Benoni, etc. These are the arrangements which have been made in this respect, but actually I would rather not have added this last information because I do not want to create the impression for one moment that there need be any cases in the last category. If it is an ordinary technical offence the necessary arrangements can be made for the person to be housed in a hostel for that night.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I would like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister one or two questions. Can he tell me what happens to a man who refuses to take the work offered to him at an aid centre; what happens to him then&#x003F; Does he get arrested on the spot, or can he take his chance and walk out of the aid centre and then perhaps be arrested or not arrested, as luck would have it&#x003F; That is one important question I would like to ask him. The other question is whether any discretion whatever is given to the officials at the aid centre to allow people to remain in their present employment, without sending them back to the homelands, where they have to come in again as contract workers when they are already in employment, albeit illegally, in terms of this sort of technical arrangement. This is a very important question, Sir, because I know that in Johannesburg there are thousands of Africans who are working who are actually, technically speaking, illegally there, but they are in employment and they are doing a valuable job producing for the country and earning money for their families. If those people are arrested at the present stage, they either pay a fine, in which case they go free again, or they go to gaol. But what is going to happen to those people now at an aid centre&#x003F; Presumably they will not be allowed to pay fines at an aid centre. Is there any way in which an aid centre official, knowing that the man or woman is actually in employment, and is accommodated and knowing that the employer could give such a man or woman a good record, could ratify the situation and use his discretion, where the Chief Bantu Commissioner could use his discretion to allow that person to remain in employment, or are these people going to be sent back to the homelands and made to apply for permission to come in again as contract workers&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>I wonder if the hon. the Deputy Minister could also tell us what happens in the case of the persons who are cautioned and whose cases are withdrawn. This deals with the first part of the provisions of the clause, i.e. the right which is granted for cases to be withdrawn. As I see it, the persons are still in the position afterwards that they do not have sufficient references; in other words, he still does not have a permit to work and the aid which he receives merely consists of not being prosecuted. With reference to the figures given to us by the Deputy Minister during the Second Reading, we had the case in which 27 000 were in fact sentenced. To what extent were they assisted afterwards&#x003F; I am talking about the 27 000 out of the 36 000. Were they given further assistance in obtaining employment or being repatriated to the areas they came from&#x003F; Then there is the case, in particular, of the persons who were cautioned or whose cases were withdrawn. What happens to them after that&#x003F; Are they not the persons who merely escape the sentence, but are in fact repatriated directly afterwards so that they can apply for permits again&#x003F; Thirdly, I just want to point out that according to the figures given by the Deputy Minister during the Second Reading there are approximately 2 000 who do not fall into either of these categories. Is one now to accept that they are the persons who were neither placed in employment nor sentenced, while the cases were not withdrawn either, but who were either transferred to another place or repatriated, as it is put in the clause, to their last place of residence as soon as possible, as a result of the fact that you do not have a place of detention&#x003F;</p>

<p>May I start with the hon. member for Durban Central&#x003F; He is quite right in respect of his third question. Those people are dealt with in the way suggested by the hon. member. In respect of his second question it is obvious that some of the technical offenders are placed in employment while others naturally cannot be if there is no employment, and those people are then helped to find employment in another district or in the homeland. I have said before in reply to the hon. member for Houghton that the intention here is not at all to send people off to farms, for example, against their will. But if there is really no work in an area, no stone must be left unturned to accommodate those Bantu at the best and most suitable place where there is in fact work for them. I shall point out to the hon. member for Houghton in a moment that there is one thing we must understand very well; I referred to it in my reply to the Third Reading debate the other day, and the hon. members must please understand it, and this is that it is not only a question of work which is involved here. Two things are involved, namely work and housing. These are the two things which are very important, and they must always be most carefully considered by the aid centre, and I hope the hon. members on the other side are with me in this regard because if we thoroughly understand this basic fact on both sides of the House many things will disappear like mist before the morning sun and many unnecessary things which are flung across the floor of the House will disappear with them. In White South Africa you cannot take work as your only criterion as far as a Bantu is concerned. You cannot do it for a White and you do it for no other race; so why should you do it in respect of a Bantu&#x003F; Two things are absolutely essential. If employment is provided there must be housing as well, otherwise you will have chaos on your hands. So that is the reply to the second question put by the hon. member for Durban Central.</p>

<p>The first question put by the hon. member, which is really closely bound up with the third one, which I dealt with very quickly, was about the 27 000 Bantu who were dealt with in the way he indicated. It is precisely in respect of them that the aid centre has a most important function, namely to give those people temporary documents to enable them at least to make the necessary arrangements there to find their way in the area in which they are. I hope I have now explained the three questions put by the hon. member.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but let me put it to hon. members this way: It is precisely that category of Bantu which provides one of the reasons for the existence of the aid centres. If that category of Bantu cannot be helped at the aid centres at all they will only be picked up again a day or a week later. We have statistics available to us which point to the fact that this category of Bantu constitutes a very high percentage of the number of technical offenders who are continually appearing before the courts. The aim of the aid centres is precisely to channel those people away so that they need not land in court or in gaol. Therefore I emphasize that the first requirement in respect of these 27 000 people is that they be provided with temporary documents; secondly, that they are indeed cases for the aid centres in order to ensure that they are properly accommodated in a legal way so that the number who would have appeared in court tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, next week and the week after if the aid centres had not been there will not appear in court again. Is that clear now&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton asked me what would happen if a Bantu should refuse to accept work offered to him. That is what I meant when I said earlier on that an official at the head of an aid centre would have to possess very great wisdom. Such an official must be a person who is intent on maintaining good relations and rendering assistance. If a Bantu arrives at the aid centre as a result of a technical offence and he refuses to accept the work offered to him the first and obvious step would be to take drastic action against that Bantu. That would be the normal and correct way of acting, in terms of the law as well. If the official at the head of the aid centre really wants to render assistance he will be very patient with such a Bantu and he will find out why he does not want to accept the work. His problem will be to solve the Bantu&#x2019;s problem. This, in my opinion, is the ideal of the aid centre. I think the hon. member will readily agree <span class="col_2573-2574" refersTo="page_1304"/>with me that if the official has been very patient and has done everything in his power and a Bantu is still recalcitrant and refuses to accept work, then the hon. member must have no illusions about it, because then there is not the least doubt about it that the ordinary laws on influx control will come into force in the proper way and that Bantu will accordingly have to appear in court. Then that Bantu will be dealt with. In such a case I should not be prepared to condone the conduct of such a Bantu at all. I hope the hon. member would not be prepared to condone it in such a case. If we were to condone that we would be going very far and that is not the intention here at all.</p>

<p>That is what the aid centre is there for. While I am on this issue, may I just remind that hon. member that, while we are without question, and hon. members must realize it, very sincere about the implementation of these aid centres, the influx control measures still stand. The aid centre must not be looked upon as a centre of condonation. I hope the hon. member agrees with me in that respect.</p>

<p>With regard to the hon. member&#x2019;s second question. I have already replied to it in part. In the case mentioned by the hon. member, such a Bantu would be referred to a labour bureau.

<p>No. If there is a vacancy, if there is a need for a Bantu in a specific, prescribed area and if the Bantu&#x2019;s reference book can be put in order by the aid centre, why should such a Bantu be referred out&#x003F; That will not be the case, and that is why I have said that I have already replied to the hon. member in part, except that even if there is a vacancy, even if that Bantu is employed illegally in that vacancy and even if that Bantu&#x2019;s reference book can be put in order by the aid centre and by the Commissioner&#x2019;s court, if there is no suitable housing for such a Bantu, it becomes impossible for the aid centre to assist that Bantu because there must be housing. That Bantu must be housed, otherwise he might have a job but he will be upon the street. I hope the hon. member is satisfied with that reply, and I think with that I have replied to all the questions which have been put to me.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in regard to the point that the hon. the Deputy Minister was dealing with, I would like to know whether the following is correct. If a male Bantu was in a job in Cape Town and had housing here, but he in fact did not get the necessary permission to be here, in other words he had come down in, let us say, ignorance; if he is picked up and taken to an aid centre, the intention is that he will in fact be handled by the aid centre in the first instance and then he will be sent to the labour bureau. Then he would be allowed to have his papers put in order for that job, and in that place of residence. That is the first point I would like to make.</p>

<p>That could happen, provided that the labour bureau is in a

 position to rectify that Bantu reference book while that Bantu is

 in that prescribed area of the Western Cape at the Cape Peninsula.

 The hon. member must understand, as I have already explained, that the influx control measures still stand. The labour bureau, as well as the aid centre, will have to operate within that framework, because otherwise the hon. member will understand that a funnel will be opened up whereby Bantu can just come from the Bantu homelands through the aid centre and be drawn into these areas. That is certainly <span class="col_2575-2576" refersTo="page_1305"/>not the intention at all, and that will not be done via the aid centres. The officers of the aid centre will of course look very closely at these cases so as not to allow the aid centre being used in such a way that a Bantu from, let us say, the Transkei area can come to the Peninsula illegally, knowing that there is an aid centre and that he will be placed in a job via the aid centre and via the labour bureau. We shall have to look at that sort of situation very carefully, because the intention is not to open up a channel whereby Bantu can be drawn into prescribed areas in that way. I hope that is clear.</p>

<p>Then there is the last point I would like to make in this connection, and I am very glad that the hon. member for Pinelands has put this question. I am not going to dwell on it now, but I hope that there will be an opportunity in some other debate when we can discuss this more fully, because I have something to say about it. I am specifically referring to the question of the Cape Peninsula and the Western Cape, where the Government has a very definite policy, namely that the Bantu in this area be replaced by Coloureds. The reason why I refer to this in this context is that it must be understood that with specific reference to the Cape Peninsula and to the Western Cape, this policy is being implemented. For that reason it is much more difficult for a Bantu to find his way in employment in the Western Cape than in other parts of the country because of the implementation of this policy. Therefore, the aid centres in the Western Cape, and in the Cape Peninsula specifically, must be viewed against the background of the implementation of this policy and will therefore differ from an aid centre in Johannesburg or in Pretoria or in Benoni or in the other areas where you have no Coloureds and where this policy of replacement of Bantu by Coloureds is not being implemented.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Bill now empowers the hon. the Minister to appoint the chairman of the Land Tenure Board himself. The chairman of the Agricultural Credit Board will not automatically become chairman of the Land Tenure Board as well. There must definitely be very sound reasons why the hon. gentleman wants to make this change. During the Second Reading of this Bill we said that we agreed with him for several reasons. The main reason is that we should like to see that the chairman of the Land Tenure Board is a person who is fully acquainted with the purchase of land, particularly for State purposes because in recent times certain things have happened which, to my mind, have quite rightly roused the suspicions of many people in this country.</p>

<p>I want to refer to the report of the commission of inquiry into the so-called Agliotti case. It has been stated quite clearly in the report of this commission that the advice the hon. the Minister received in that respect was not sound. If it was the chairman of the Agricultural Credit Board who advised the Minister in the past, it is correct that the hon. the Minister should now have somebody of his own choice who is properly informed. As I have said, evidence was submitted to that commission which I think came as a great shock in this respect not only to this House but also to South Africa. It was quite clear to us that the chairman of the Board was not even prepared &#x2026;</p>

<p>With respect, Mr. Speaker, there must certainly be very sound reasons for doing so if the hon. gentleman is no longer in a position automatically to accept the chairman of the Agricultural Credit Board as the chairman of the Land Tenure Board. I think one of the major reasons is that the hon. gentleman has not been given the proper advice in the past.</p>

<p>I cannot allow the hon. member to go into that matter.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>I am pleased with your ruling, Sir, and I am not prepared to go into this matter any further. I nevertheless want to tell the hon. the Deputy Minister that we agree with him that he should have this choice for the simple reason that we do not want things of this nature to happen again. We should also like to tell the hon. the Deputy Minister that hon. members on this side of the House will from time to time keep a close watch on the actions of this person whom he chooses now to become the chairman of the Land Tenure Board precisely because we hope and we ask that things like that do not happen again. To my mind this Land Tenure Board is certainly one of the most important statutory bodies this Parliament has been able to establish. An enormous responsibility will therefore rest upon the hon. the Deputy Minister to see to it that this person who becomes the chairman of this Board will be a very responsible person. Over and above that he must also be a person who will be prepared to take his fellow-members on the Land Tenure Board into his confidence in the proper way because there is evidence that members of the Land Tenure Board have in the past not been kept informed the way they should have been. The hon. the Deputy Minister must also see to it that he is at all times being kept fully informed by the person he is going to appoint of all land transactions which may take place. In section 3 of the Land Tenure Act, which is being amended by this Bill, it is stated quite clearly that it is the duty of the Land Tenure Board to advise the hon. the Minister in regard to land transactions. The chairman of this Board is the most important person on that Board, and we do not want to hear of any cases where files have not even been made available to and scrutinized by the other members of the Land Tenure Board. We therefore want to say to the hon. the Deputy Minister that we hope that the choice he is going to make in future will be a good one and that we want to congratulate him in anticipation on the person he is going to appoint because it will be a person who is going to assist him in all respects in this important function so that nothing will happen in future that will rouse the suspicions of either South Africa or this House.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Newton Park has quite rightly emphasized the importance of the position not only of this board, but especially of the chairman of this board. I think we were all made more aware of the person&#x2019;s importance whose office is here being changed, when the events of the Agliotti scandal drew him to our attention. That is why it is very important to have a look, at this stage, at the changes that are being made in the appointment, the manner of appointment and in the tenure of office of the officials who will have to advise the Minister in respect of land transactions. Let us be quite clear and say that that is the only function of the Land Tenure Board, namely to advise the Minister.</p>

<p>One deals here with a very important office in this regard. One deals here with a change in the law as regards the chairman of this board, a change which has been hailed outside this House by <i>Die Burger,</i> which is in fact one of the mouthpieces of this Government, as one of the measures which was intended to deal with the Agliotti scandal. Let me say that the amendment in this Bill will help a little in a small way to deal with a minor aspect of a tiny part of a major calamity, which is the Agliotti scandal. It does appear that this amendment is hailed by the Government Press as being the remedy which is going to cure the ills which caused the Agliotti scandal. They could only have got the information from the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department. This measure does not go far enough; but it would appear at this stage that this is all the Government is prepared to do.</p>

<p>In this regard certain questions were asked on Friday of the hon. the Minister of Police by the hon. member for Simonstown about the investigation into the Agliotti matter.</p>

<p>There were many deficiencies; but what I want to say right at the beginning, is that we welcome the changes that are being made in this Bill. We feel they are necessary. Our experience in the past has been that it is necessary that the chairman of this board should be subject to some more surveillance than he has been subjected to in the past. I merely mentioned the Agliotti affair as an example of what can happen under the old order of things. But I do want to mention that it could happen in the new order of things, because all he has to do is advise. But the hon. the Deputy Minister has forgotten that it can happen in any event, even under the new deal in terms of this Bill. Has he thought about it&#x003F; Has he appreciated that the real cause of the Agliotti affair was that the Minister gave <i>carte blanche</i> and delegated his powers absolutely under a power of attorney to the Secretary and deputy secretary of the department. He washed his hands of everything that happened.</p>

<p>This is a welcome change; it is a nice little scratch on the surface. But I want to ask the hon. the Minister when he replies to tell us why it was, if it was not because of Agliotti and this monstrous affair, that he introduced this at all. In the second place, I should like to know whether he does not agree with me that it does not go far enough and that he should in fact do something more about his responsibility and not just about the advice that he gets from officials and all the things that might have happened. This is what the public is concerned with. That is what we are here to deal with. The public is concerned that something be done to remedy that. This apparently is what the Government is prepared to do but it is not enough. Will the hon. the Minister tell this House that he is going to do something about the delegation of the powers of the Minister of Agriculture to expropriate land in the public interest&#x003F; Is he going to do something about that&#x003F; Is this all that he is going to do&#x003F; If he is not going to do something <span class="col_2581-2582" refersTo="page_1308"/>more, this small change which, although welcomed, really means nothing whatsoever. If the hon. the Minister won&#x2019;t indicate that the Government is prepared to do something more, then the public is entitled to assume that this is all that the Government is prepared to do. All it is prepared to do is to have some more surveillance over the officer of the State who is to advise the Minister about land transactions but is not prepared to ensure that the Agliotti case can never happen again.

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Durban North is certainly very gifted to be able to say very piously that he is glad about this and welcomes this amendment, but then goes on and refers, quite by chance of course, to the Agliotti affair. Every time he gets dragged into this discussion by the hair. During the Second Reading and in the course of the Committee Stage it was said that, on account of the changing land values in our country, it is impossible to have the chairman of an Agricultural Credit Board serving as the chairman of the Land Tenure Board as well. It has become a specialized job today to be able to judge the price of land in Namaqualand compared to a sugar farm in Natal or urban land. It is necessary for this person to have made a close study of matters of this nature. I can give the hon. member and the hon. member for Newton Park the assurance that the experience we had was not a pleasant one. This is, amongst other things, one of the reasons for this amendment. There will still have to be delegation. Hon. members ask what the powers of the Minister are and whether he does not delegate too much of his powers. Do hon. members think that we will allow what happened in the past to happen again&#x003F; Do we want to go through this hell again&#x003F; Is it necessary to rake up a matter while the very purpose of this legislation is to eliminate that type of phenomenon&#x003F;</p>

Let the court then decide. It is simply impossible to satisfy everybody. When the State makes purchases the seller expects that there has to be an enormous amount of money at stake. We will only allow realistic valuations to apply in future. Members of the Opposition have come to see us and said: &#x201C;Your valuation of that person&#x2019;s land is too low.&#x201D; We are not going to adopt a sympathetic attitude in future at all.

<p>In every case. In the past there was some disruption we had to take into consideration. I do not see only this one transaction which the hon. member has mentioned <i>ad nauseam</i><b><i>.</i></b> I am thinking of the hundreds of transactions which have to be concluded every month in which, for example, you have to compel a person to leave his farm because a dam has to be built there. People have spread gossip about what happens at some of these places where we have paid a person <span class="col_2583-2584" refersTo="page_1309"/>20 per cent for inconvenience because we have uprooted him from an area in which he and his ancestors have lived all their lives. To this person we have to say that a specific area of 1 000 morgen will have to come under water and that we will have to buy him out and resettle him in another area or that he will have to find himself a place somewhere else to stay. Hon. members pretend that we adopt an unsympathetic attitude towards people like that. Just look at the criticism that is being levelled at us. People spread gossip about a thing like that, but I say again that I am grateful towards the Opposition when they say that they welcome this measure. I also want to thank the hon. member for Newton Park who expressed the hope that we will be successful in carrying out the task of this department.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to come back to the speech of the hon. member for False Bay. I am sorry to see that he is not in the House at the moment. I warned him I would be coming back to this Bill. In the course of the hon. member&#x2019;s speech he gave notice of an amendment he wanted to move in the Committee Stage. I do not want to quote the entire amendment. What it amounts to is that there is certain agricultural land which at present is under the control of local authorities and falls outside the compass of this legislation. I feel that this proposed amendment of the hon. member&#x2014;I am glad to see that the hon. member is now in the House&#x2014;cannot be accepted, in the first place, because this in actual fact means an extension of the Act. In his amendment the hon. member asks for more powers for the Minister to control other land. His speech specifically dealt with agricultural land in Paarl. I made a few enquiries about these farms and found out certain things.</p>

<speech by="#deacon">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. D. DEACON</person>:</from>

<p>From several people farming there. While I was carrying out the investigation my thoughts centred on what had now actually happened to this policy of more farmers having to leave the land; what had happened to the principle embodied in the Act, i.e. that uneconomic units could no longer be retained. I can tell you that the farms in Paarl are at present economic units. One forgets, however, that those farms are doubly taxed. They pay divisional council as well as municipal rates. My information is that there are several farms where ten times as much is paid in tax as the ordinary farmer in the Paarl district pays. Then there are also other factors that count there. There is the labour factor in Paarl that makes it difficult for the farmers. Those farmers cannot keep the labour on the farms. Their labourers must go and live in the Coloured area, and that is acceptable if those people can work during the day. Another difficulty that crops up there is that there are water restrictions and they can only employ spray-irrigation at night. Coloureds are not allowed to walk around there at night without carrying their permits. Temporary permits were issued, but the farmers do not know when those permits are going to be withdrawn.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, I feel that this is going to be very hard on those people, in view of the fact that some farms have already been subdivided and the people who have subdivided their farms have had the advantage of receiving a good price for their ground. Although those farms are economic today, can anybody give a guarantee that they will remain economic in time to come&#x003F; What will then happen if, because of the double tax that they pay, they become uneconomic&#x003F; But in the first place, I feel that the amendment proposed by the hon. member for George cannot be accepted because it widens the scope of this Bill, and it is widening the scope of the Bill simply because it asks for extra powers for the Minister. I would ask him very sincerely not to move this at this stage, because I believe that the Paarl Municipality and the Cape Provincial Council are quite capable of handling this matter themselves.</p>

<p>*Mr. Speaker, I shall leave that matter there. When the debate was

 adjourned the other evening, I was proving the difficulties in connection with the implementation of this amendment to the House and to the hon. the Deputy Minister. I gave warning <span class="col_2585-2586" refersTo="page_1310"/>that incorrect decisions could be made and I mentioned one instance in which this was, in fact, done. I gave warning that further restrictions on the availability of development land and on our urban areas and holiday resorts would further increase the already exaggerated prices of plots and that this would lead to further inflationary trends. I demonstrated that although we had different levels of government&#x2014;local, provincial and central&#x2014;this legislation works from the top to the bottom and not the other way around. Here I advocated the interests of the individual in the lower levels of government. Sir, I want to state very clearly that this side of the House agrees that there must be control over the subdivision of our land into uneconomic units. This is something that no one who has a love of his nation or his fatherland would like to see. At the same time no one wants to obstruct the natural development of our country. As we see it, thousands of morgen of agricultural land will have to be relinquished in the next 25 years for urban and factory development, etc. New cities will have to be built and agriculture will have to adapt to new and intensive methods. What is necessary is not a restricting Act such as the Bill we have before us today, but what is necessary is legislation that anticipates the future and makes provision for the proper planning of the whole surface area of the Republic of South Africa and South-West Africa, legislation that will give our young people faith in the future, that will spur them on and give them the necessary driving force to furnish the extra productivity that is so necessary for the hard road of the last quarter of this century. If this legislation is passed without the powers and the functions of the local authorities and the provinces being placed clearly in perspective, I feel terribly sorry for the Minister, because I feel and I believe that the local authorities and the provinces can be used to take that load off his shoulders. I feel it is very necessary that they play a stronger role in the control of our land. The Minister and his department must plan the future use of our soil, and not interfere with every subdivision that is made in the Republic of South Africa and South-West Africa. I feel their work embraces the broader aspects of territorial planning. As the Act now reads and is implemented, everything proceeds from the Minister and his department downwards through the provinces to the local bodies and then to the individual. As I picture it, a town or a divisional council or a province knows much more of what goes on in its area than any department, which undertakes the broader aspects of planning, can know. I hope the Minister will tell the House very clearly what the powers of the local government and the provincial government will be in terms of this legislation. If we continue with the previous implementation, we are going to have additional amendments before us and we are going to encounter further difficulties. As I have said, we feel that there must be control, but not in its present form.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Albany mentioned a few points that were also mentioned by previous speakers on the Opposition side, but most of the points were replied to by hon. members on this side of the House. I just want to point out a few of them. The first is that it is never the Government&#x2019;s intention to try to be popular with a certain group, because I think a good government must be able to tell a person that one cannot sub-divide a property, however unpopular this may be. A good government does not endeavour, as the hon. member puts it, to shift the work off on to this department, that local authority, that divisional authority or whatever the case may be. A good government is one that has the courage of its convictions and can tell a person that the cutting up of agricultural land is wrong, and hon. members have never yet been able to get it into their heads that we are speaking here of agricultural land. Since we are spending millions of rands on the one hand to consolidate agricultural land into economic units, do you want the province, on the other hand, to be able to cut up land to its heart&#x2019;s content into 25 morgen plots&#x003F; That is surely ridiculous. However unpopular I may prove to be as a result of this measure, I shall <b>know that eventually</b> the farmer will be satisfied because he asked, via his organization, various committees and all the churches in our country, that this sub-division process must be stopped because it is creating uneconomic <b>units</b> where people are dying of misery. Somebody must do the job and I am not one bit afraid of the results. But now hon. members come along with all kinds of arguments.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I replied to that question last week, when I think the hon. member for Walmer was not present. [Interjections.] Yes, he was sent out. Our idea is that we want to have a man and his wife and three children living on more or less an economic unit, having a net income of R4 000. It may vary from R3 000 to R4 000, but then his house and water, etc., are all paid for.</p>

<p>*The time is past when we thought that a man engaged in agriculture must continually tighten his belt and live below the breadline.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Albany now asks why the Department of Agricultural Technical Services is doing this work, and why it should not be done by the Provinces or the municipalities&#x003F; The people come to us and ask &#x201C;What is the carrying capacity of this veld&#x201D;&#x003F; Do they want a municipality to decide about that&#x003F; It is surely a technical department, the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, which determines that in the Graaff-Reinet area the carrying capacity is 2&#x00BD; morgen per sheep, and that is an economic unit. One can stretch the R4 000 a year, but in 10 or 15 years time R4 000 is perhaps no longer an economic unit. I am being honest, but we must have a norm after all. We must after all more or less have an idea where we want to go. It is no use letting a person sit on a piece of land where his net income is R500 and then still, by way of agricultural credit, be assisting with loans to place that person on a sound footing.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, to obtain information the hon. member for Newton Park asked a whole lot of questions. He asked why there are restrictions on the boundaries of municipalities. I think the hon. member for Mooi River also asked that question. How many farmers are there not today who are dissatisfied because a municipality extended its boundaries to its heart&#x2019;s content. This happened the other day in Bronkhorstspruit. I myself have had the experience of a municipality wanting more tax and therefore extending its boundaries. The municipality sent a letter to a farmer, who lives adjacent to the town, in which they said that their boundaries now extend so far from the town. That specific farmer pays R714 in tax, while there is no sewerage and he obtains nothing from the municipality. He must pay that tax for the privilege of being situated adjacent to the town. Is that cricket&#x003F; Now hon. members come along and say we are taking away certain rights from those people, but the farmer is asking for it! In this clause we are merely stating that if the municipality wants to extend its boundaries, it must obtain permission for that from the Minister of Agriculture. We are not taking anything away. The hon. member says&#x2014;and this is announced with capital letters in the Press&#x2014; that in future the farmer may no longer lease land. It is surely stated here expressly: a registered lease that applies for longer than 10 years and up to 99 years. We know that farmers evade the Act in this way. Without a contract a farmer can still lease land for a very long time. For a period of nine years and eleven months it is still just as it was in the past, i.e. that the hon. member or I can go and lease any neighbour&#x2019;s land without any obstacles. Only when he registers that land can this not happen. Why does the hon. member then want to create the impression that the farmers may no longer lease land&#x003F;</p>

<p>I agree with the amendment of the hon. member for False Bay as far

 as Paarl is concerned. We are not taking away any privileges. It aims at facilitating the functioning of this legislation. The hon. member will explain this in the Committe Stage and therefore it is not necessary for me to devote any more time to it at the moment.</p>

<p>I have here correspondence in connection with the matter which the hon. member for Mooi River mentioned. I do not want to argue with the hon. member about this matter. Hon. members say that we are slowing down the establishment of new residential areas. The hon. member for Mooi River said that everyone must live in multilevel buildings. We are surely not stupid. We know that within the next 32 years South Africa&#x2019;s population will total 50 million. We must of necessity cut up areas and establish new townships. What is wrong with suggesting that we establish a steering committee&#x003F; As far as that is concerned, <span class="col_2589-2590" refersTo="page_1312"/>the Province of Natal is an example. It is not necessary for me to quote the correspondence the hon. member had about Boston. In that correspondence the province itself said they could not allow plots to be established at will without sewerage, streets or order. Therefore we suggest establishing a steering committee. If there is a need for chalets or holiday farms in Mooi River, as the hon. member put it, the steering committee can determine that that specific area of Mooi River be withdrawn from agricultural use for all time and cut up for the magnate who wants a five morgen stand where he can go horseriding and fishing on week-ends. We can then do this in that ordered way. We do not want a tattered patchwork affair throughout the country, with everyone cutting pieces off at will. If possible we want no delay; we just want orderliness.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Newton Park asked for an amendment to the title of this Bill as far as agricultural land is concerned.</p>

<p>Yes, as far as the use of agricultural land is concerned. There is, <i>inter alia,</i> the pollution aspect. The hon. member for South Coast moved a motion here about pollution. I asked the hon. member whether he wanted us to allow a person to establish a feed lot for 1 000 cattle on the banks of the Vaal River, with the water and rubbish from those cattle running freely into the Vaal River. If that person says he will be able to make it an economic unit by way of sub-division and that it is his purpose to do so, must we not have a stipulation as regards the effluent of this piece of land&#x003F; As the hon. member for South Coast proposed, there must be orderliness.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the Water Act may control it, but we could inform that person in good time when he wants to sub-divide under those conditions. Under the Divisional Council system there is control over the building of houses in the Cape Province. If I want to erect a Bantu house, a residence or a drinking trough, I must obtain approval and permission from the Divisional Council. In the Transvaal I can build to my heart&#x2019;s content. I can build just as I want to, a skew or crooked structure, or right up against the highways used by travellers. There is no orderliness with respect to the erection of buildings. We are trying to correct this situation.</p>

<p>For the information of hon. members, I should just like to furnish the following figures and then conclude. The hon. members think this is a tremendous problem. Hon. members can understand that after the introduction of this legislation we were overrun by people who wanted to subdivide. We received 1 246 applications for subdivision. Many of these applications were doubtful ones. Of the total of applications, 628 were approved, 385 rejected and 137 petered out of their own accord. In the cases that petered out, the applicants knew they were taking chances. At the moment there are still 96 that have not been dealt with. We only received 35 applications for appeal. Nine of those appeals were upheld and 26 rejected. If hon. members could only have seen what cases we rejected on appeal. We told the people they must wait until we came along with the steering committee, which would more neatly draw up the areas where we could erect the various structures, i.e. as the hon. member for Mooi River requested.</p>

<p>As far as the other matters are concerned, it is not necessary for me to go into that, because the hon. member for Kroonstad, the hon. member for False Bay and several members on this side of the House have replied fully to the arguments of hon. members on the other side of the House, and I give them 10 marks out of 10 for that.</p>

I saw in a report recently that a large consignment of meat exported from South-West Africa was rejected abroad.

I think it not only prejudiced the good name of South-West Africa&#x2019;s meat exporters, but also that of the rest of the Republic. I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister will give us a reply to this.

<p>Mr. Speaker, the meat to which the hon. member refers is meat that was infected with a particular kind of germ which was fortunately local to that area alone and had no effect on the Republic&#x2019;s meat.

<p>They were sufficient, but according to the information at my disposal one could apply the hygiene measures very strictly and the germ could still not be discovered.

<p>In terms of Government policy the function of setting apart and reserving separate beaches for the various population groups is vested in the provincial and local authorities concerned. In order to enable those authorities to execute this function efficiently, a few amendments to the Sea-Shore Act, 1935, and the Reservation of Separate Amenities Act, 1953, are necessary. The necessary amendments have been embodied in the Bill at present before you.</p>

<p>The Reservation of Separate Amenities Act makes provision for setting apart or <span class="col_2595-2596" refersTo="page_1315"/>reserving any public premises or any portion of such premises for the exclusive use of persons belonging to a particular race or class. In terms of section 2 any person who is in charge of or has control of any public premises may so set apart or reserve such premises. Premises may include any portion of the sea-shore or the sea. In terms of this Act, the authority who determines by what group or race any particular premises are to be used may be the owner or lessee of the premises or a person who has control of such premises <i>ex officio</i> or otherwise.</p>

<p>The Sea-Shore Act in turn provides that the State President is the owner of the seashore and the sea within the territorial waters of the Republic. It authorizes the Minister of Agriculture to grant certain rights in respect of the sea-shore and the sea, subject to the provisions of the Act. In terms of this Act the Minister may also authorize a divisional council, municipality or other local authority to make regulations in regard to, <i>inter alia,</i> the use of the sea-shore and bathing in the sea situated within or adjoining its area of jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The two Acts concerned, as they stand, do not provide explicitly that a local authority which has been authorized to make regulations concerning the use of the seashore and bathing in the sea shall, in fact, be deemed competent to set apart particular parts of the sea-shore or the sea for particular races or classes of persons. This matter is being rectified in the amending Bill.</p>

<p>Firstly, it is being provided that the executive committee of the province concerned shall for the purposes of the Reservation of Separate Amenities Act be deemed to be the person who is in charge of or has control of the sea-shore and the sea. Secondly, it is being provided that an executive committee may by notice in the <i>Official Gazette</i> declare that a particular local authority has that control of a particular part of the sea-shore and sea situated within or adjoining its area of jurisdiction. On the strength of such a declaration the local authority concerned will have the power to set apart or to reserve separate beaches within the boundaries of the particular area.</p>

<p>The amendment to the Sea-Shore Act as such mainly concerns the power to make regulations concerning, <i>inter alia,</i> the use of the sea-shore and bathing in the sea and the implementation of such regulations. As things are, the Minister of Agriculture may make such regulations. He may also authorize a local authority to make such regulations in respect of a part of the sea-shore or the sea situated within or adjoining the area of jurisdiction of the local authority. However, the Act does not empower the Minister to authorize provincial authorities to make such regulations. Section 11 is being supplemented so as to empower the Minister to delegate his powers to make and to enforce such regulations also to the executive committee of the province concerned.</p>

<p>In addition the penal provision concerning the contravention of the sea-shore regulations is being supplemented. When the Act was passed in 1935 provision was made for a fine of only R50. This penalty is now being increased to a fine not exceeding R200 or a period of imprisonment not exceeding one year.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this measure, as introduced by the hon. the Deputy Minister, brings to an end an unhappy series of events in regard to the implementation of the Separate Amenities Act. These events took place, not necessarily under his portfolio, where he is in charge of the control of the land; but one is reminded that this Bill is now bringing to an end the summary discharge or overlooking of the Heunis Commission, so far as the Cape is concerned, because, according to its report, the provincial authorities should have been enabled to do exactly what they are now empowered to do. Then followed the unfortunate Torlage Commission, which achieved nothing, and by which the Central Government attempted to demarcate separate areas for separate amenities. Now the Deputy Minister says that this Bill is being introduced because the power must be with the provinces where it belongs. We agree with him wholeheartedly, and we will support this measure, by which he is giving that power to the provinces unequivocally to deal with the provision of separate amenities.</p>

<p>But, Sir, this Bill goes further. I am rather disappointed that the hon. the Minister has not dealt with other matters. However, it may be that he is charged only with the control of the land and not with certain of the matters that are incidental thereto. This Bill deals with the sea as well as the sea-shore, the sea-shore being between the highwater and the lowwater mark. The sea and the sea-bed extends out <span class="col_2597-2598" refersTo="page_1316"/>to the border of what is known as our territorial waters, namely six nautical miles seawards, and is now covered and dealt with under this particular Bill. I believe that representations have been made to the hon. the Minister by the provinces concerned that certain powers under section 10 of the Sea-Shore Act should be&#x2014;and they can now be under this Bill&#x2014;delegated to the provinces. I refer to section 10 of the Act, in terms of which the powers which now can be delegated are not only those which deal with the use of that shore but also the &#x201C;removal of any material from the seashore and the sea&#x201D;, &#x201C;the prevention or the regulation of the depositing or the discharging upon the sea-shore or in the sea of offal, rubbish or anything liable to be a nuisance or danger to health&#x201D;, and &#x201C;the control&#x201D;, the very necessary control, &#x201C;of the sea-shore&#x201D;. Here one thinks of the vandalism resulting in the removal of bait, oysters and sea growth, matters over which the Departments of Nature Conservation of the provinces are very anxious to have control. I trust that the hon. the Deputy Minister, in dealing with the powers which are now to be given in terms of section 10, will assure us that he is not merely concerned with separate amenities, but also with other matters which could well be handled by the provinces. As I have said, I am disappointed that there was no mention of this particular aspect, which I know it is a matter of concern to the provinces.</p>

<p>The next point I want to come to is this: I think it is an empty hope of the Deputy Minister if he believes that the delegation of these powers to the provinces in regard to separate amenities will enable them to carry out all the measures that are necessary to provide those separate amenities. The hon. the Deputy Minister must bear in mind that adjacent to the sea-shore are vast areas&#x2014;I understand this applies to the whole of the Natal coast and certainly a great deal of the West Coast of the Cape Province&#x2014;of what is known as the Admiralty Reserve. This is an area which varies in depth from 100 ft. to 400 ft. between the highwater mark and the land in private ownership. You will remember, Sir, that the origin of this was in the days of the old sailing vessels. The flotsam and jetsam washed ashore as a result of shipwreck, for instance, would belong to the State, to the old Cape Colony Government or to the Government of Natal. For that reason ownership or control was retained by the State. It is no good, in terms of this Bill, giving the power to control the sea-shore, which extends up to the highwater mark, if that power is not also extended to control what is known as the Admiralty Reserve on these two coastlines. This is perhaps a matter which we can discuss further in the Committe Stage.</p>

<p>There is a third aspect of the provision of separate amenities, and that is the question of funds. Again, this is not within this Deputy Minister&#x2019;s portfolio, nor his responsibility, but if these are to be effective, then funds will have to be made available through the Treasury to the provinces in order for them to do what the hon. the Deputy Minister expects them to do under this particular Bill. There is a further difficulty which arises and I point this out because this Bill is not in itself going to solve the problems which are faced in various parts of the country. This problem is in regard to the adjoining land other than Admiralty land, which has been defined as a group area and has no relation to the present use of the sea-shore and the land immediately abutting on the sea-shore. There are the vast areas provided for in the Bantu Trust and Land Act of 1936, and the hon. the Deputy Minister knows that that land does not fall under the control of the provinces at all. We are now giving some form of control of the sea-shore; the Act does apply to the sea-shore which is adjacent to Bantu Trust land. There again difficulties arise regarding the provision of adequate amenities. The Minister is handing over this task to the provinces, but provision is not being made for control where it is necessary.</p>

<p>Finally, Sir, I want to say a few words in regard to this penalty. It is unfortunate that this penalty should have been related solely to the purpose of this Bill, according to the hon. the Deputy Minister, namely to contraventions of separate amenities regulations. I wonder whether the hon. the Deputy Minister has been correctly briefed in the presentation of this measure, because I believe that that penalty is justified only when it comes to the preservation of the sea life within the sea, and on the bottom of the sea, which will now be controlled by the provincial authorities under their delegated power. I think the idea of imposing penalties of this magnitude merely for a transgression of what might be a demarcation of separate amenities on the beach would be repulsive to the public. I trust therefore, that the hon. the Deputy <span class="col_2599-2600" refersTo="page_1317"/>Minister will realize, if he has in mind solely the utilization of this Bill to deal with separate amenities, that there can be no justification for the excessive increase in the proposed penalties.</p>

<p>Sir, so far as the principle of this measure is concerned, that is to say, that there will be a delegation of powers to the provincial authorities to control the seashore within the provinces, we will support this measure and vote for the Second Reading.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. D. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I am pleased to learn from the hon. member for Green Point that the Opposition is not going to oppose this measure. The hon. member said he was disappointed that certain aspects were not being covered by this Bill at the moment. He referred, <i>inter alia,</i> also to the cleaning of beaches, etc., but I do not believe the local authorities which exercise control over beaches at the moment, have any doubt as to whether or not the cleaning of beaches is within their duties and powers. The hon. member also referred to the possibility of making funds available in order to really implement the content of the measure. I agree with him that funds are very important, but the hon. member himself said that it did not come within the jurisdiction of the hon. the Deputy Minister, and we believe that the necessary attention will be given to that along other channels.</p>

<p>The essence of this Bill, as it stands, is simply the matter of rectifying powers already being exercised by local authorities, i.e. to make regulations for the control of certain parts of the sea-shore and their use; or of swimming and bathing in the sea by certain race groups. This is a power which is already being exercised by city councils, but since this power has not been entrusted to them explicitly in law, and since they have not been empowered to do so, the position is simply being rectified in this measure. I am pleased the Opposition has also seen its way clear to support this measure, one which probably is contentious too.</p>

<p>Sir, I am pleased this Bill is before this House today, because in my opinion it recognizes the fact that the standards of living of the non-Whites continue to rise and that he is being enabled to an increasing extent to visit our beaches and to participate in the recreation facilities there. Because of the higher standards of living the non-Whites will attain in future as a result of their increased salaries, and because of the improved means of transport at their disposal, either private or public means of transport, the non-Whites will become more and more able to go out and look for recreation over weekends, and one of the places they would like to visit for recreation, would be the beach. It is important that there should be no confusion in the minds of people as to what part of the beach they may visit and what part they may not visit; where they will give offence and where they will not give offence. I think the fact that local authorities are being empowered legally to draw the boundaries, will contribute much towards ensuring racial peace and harmony in our country.</p>

<p>Sir, we are pleased about the progress the non-Whites are making with regard to their standards of living. We are pleased about the increasing opportunities they have to visit these areas, but in the interests of everybody living in this country, we should also like to ensure that they will use the freedoms and opportunities in an orderly fashion. We should always bear in mind that we should not give offence to each other. We do not begrudge the non-Whites their part of the beach which they will have the right to visit and where they can relax. Therefore, Sir, I support this measure and, furthermore, I trust, since these powers are being given to local authorities as well as to provincial authorities which may be obliged to zone or designate beaches, that the Government will receive the wholehearted co-operation of the local authorities and the provincial authorities so as to implement this measure to the advantage of all.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I cannot, I presume, discuss the principle involved in the Separate Amenities Act, and therefore I cannot go very far in my criticism of this amending Bill. But I must tell the hon. member who has just sat down that the sentiment that he has uttered that the pay-packets of Africans will eventually increase to such an extent that they will be able to enjoy week-ends by the sea is rather wishful thinking, not so much from the pay point of view, but from the point of view of the amenities which are being set aside for Africans to enjoy the sea-shores of South Africa. If what has been done in the Cape Province up to now by the Government is any indication of what is to happen in <span class="col_2601-2602" refersTo="page_1318"/>the future to those areas which have not yet been demarcated for the different racial groups, I do not hold out very much hope for many week-end resorts to which Africans will be able to go. As far as this is concerned, Sir, I think there is no point in opposing this Second Reading, because it is simply delegating authority from the Central Government to the provinces. What exactly this is going to mean in terms of practical application to the Coloured people in the Cape Province, for instance, one will have to wait to see.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Well, I am not sure of that. I agree that the local authorities are probably a little more conversant with the needs of the areas than the Central Government and therefore I, too, am not opposing the principle of taking the authority from the Central Government and handing it to the provinces. I am, of course, opposed to the whole basic principle of setting aside these amenities in the way in which it has been done in the past. If one surveys the whole scene in the Cape Peninsula, one finds that it is a disgraceful scene of discrimination because hardly any decent or accessible beaches, for instance, have been set aside for the Coloured people. On the whole of the Atlantic side there is, I understand, only one project, and that is near Mamre, despite the fact that there are thousands of Coloured people who would want to use the Atlantic Ocean for recreational facilities. As for the other side of the Peninsula, people who have been moved from Simonstown and elsewhere under the Group Areas Act have to travel for many miles and make expensive journeys before they can reach our sea-shores. Indeed, this is one of the burning sources of grievance amongst the Coloured people in the Cape. One has only to read the pronouncements made by members of the Coloured Representative Council about the dangerous and inaccessible beaches which have been allocated to the Coloured people in the Western Province to realize how exasperated they are at the obvious unfairness of the allocation of the sea-shore for bathing facilities. They complain that only the inaccessible or dangerous beaches have been allocated to them. Whether the province is going to be able to reallocate remains to be seen; it remains to be seen whether the province is going to take its courage into its hands and take down some of the notices that we see despoiling the beaches along False Bay and elsewhere&#x2014;little notices that say that only <i>bona fide</i> domestic servants in this area are able to use what is always a small portion of a beach&#x2014;but I am hopeful that the local authorities will at least be a little more sympathetic to the needs of the Coloured ratepayers than the central authority has been up to now. I want to make it quite clear that I am in no way agreeing with the principle embodied in the Main Act when I do not oppose the Second Reading of this amending Bill.</p>

<p>It is indeed a pity that on this occasion we again had to have the hon. member for Houghton&#x2019;s nagging. If one were to ask her whether she agreed to us giving Muizenberg or Sea Point to those of her people she lodges such pleas for, I wonder whether she would say &#x201C;yes&#x201D;. I am glad to hear that hon. members opposite support this amendment. But it is also regrettable to read in their Press that in public they have already objected and tried to whip up feelings. The hon. member for Green Point said here a while ago that he supported this legislation, but in the <i>Cape Argus</i> he again launched an attack on even this amendment that is now being recommended. I shall quote what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Murray said that as the beach apartheid policy was evidently impossible to implement and because it could cause resentment and difficulty between the different sections, the Government had decided to push the responsibility on to the local authorities.</block>

<p>Oh, Sir, the man is surely talking nonsense and he knows it. After

 all, the Central Government is responsible for the policy and its implementation, and the Central Government is willing to accept the responsibility of passing this legislation with its amendments and implementing it. To now make this ridiculous accusation that the Government no longer sees its way clear to carrying this legislation through and implementing it successfully, I consider to be the talk of a child and not of an adult person such as the hon. member for Green Point. I say that I am glad to hear that the Opposition supports this legislation, but it also strikes me again that two hon. members on that side, and this is <span class="col_2603-2604" refersTo="page_1319"/>typical of their two-chair policy, again disagreed with each other recently in Simonstown as far as this legislation is concerned.

<p>It is a pity. Then I should also like to say that the hon. member for South Coast is in favour of the legislation. He gave warning that if segregation was not implemented on our beaches, this could give rise to severe dispute, and five of his M.P.C.&#x2019;s in Natal clashed with him about that. What does this legislation envisage&#x003F; [Interjections.] The Opposition must not cry about it now. They get hurt if one talks the truth, and now they are crying again. What does this legislation envisage&#x003F; Firstly the more efficient implementation of this Act, as laid down in 1953 and now amended, by local authorities that are now being declared authorized to set aside specific parts of the sea or sea-shore for certain groups. It is clear, after all, that many divisional councils, particularly in the Cape, have control over certain coastal areas. It is surely clear that the executive committees can and will delegate powers to the local authorities, always under the supervision of the provincial administration, of course, which in turn must carry out the policy of the Central Government. We are now giving them the power and the authority to make regulations. In all fields the executive committees do have the authority, in any case, to delegate powers to local authorities, and this also applies in respect of the allocation of separate beach facilities. In addition we can also say that this legislation also gives the State the power to compel the executive committees and the local authorities to make regulations, because it is important that the policy established by the Central Government shall be implemented on a countrywide scale. Because problems cropped up we have this amendment. The electorate which brought this Government into power, and has kept it in power for so many years, expects this policy to be implemented, because the voter would like to have his own beach area&#x2014;I am speaking of the White voter&#x2014; but he also wants to give the non-Whites their beach facilities. I have here before me a map that indicates where, <i>inter alia,</i> the beach areas for the Coloureds are on the Cape West coast. I counted them and there are already 15 beach areas reserved for the Coloureds. One of the reasons why the amendment is being introduced here is that the voter expects the policy for which he voted to be implemented. That is why the State is now assuming the power of also telling local authorities via the Administration that they would like this policy implemented.</p>

<p>The complex of existing legislation has essentially been

 transformed for the efficient exercising by the provincial councils of the function of the allocation and setting aside of separate beach facilities for the various population groups. That is why the Cape Provincial Administration is, as far as I know, in favour of this amendment which, for the purposes of the allocation of separate beach resorts, invests the Administrator with authority to determine what sea areas will be allocated for the Whites, the Coloureds, the Bantu and the Indians. Included in this is also the control over the sea-shore and the sea below the highwater mark. As matters stand at present, local authorities have no control or supervision over that part of the sea or the sea-shore. I think this legislation is very clear and the amendment speaks for itself. I want to say again that I am glad the hon. Opposition is going to vote for it, but it is a pity that they speak out against it so frequently.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Worcester began his speech, which he probably prepared some time ago, in a manner that reminded me of his predecessor and made me think he thought we were going to oppose this Bill, whereas in fact we support it. He started off by saying that this was going to give more power to the Central Government, and ended up by welcoming the delegation of powers to the provinces. It was rather a confused speech. One mistake the hon. member made was with regard to what he said concerning the hon. members for Yeoville and Simonstown. If he had read the reports correctly and had obtained the full text of what had been said, he would have seen that there was really no difference of opinion at all and that it had nothing to do with this Bill whatsoever. It had nothing to do with beach apartheid, but it concerned buses. So the hon. member <span class="col_2605-2606" refersTo="page_1320"/>should really go into matters more carefully.</p>

<p>I want to come to the hon. member for Houghton, who has suddenly left. I think she has left to have a cup of tea. She referred in rather a sneering manner to the facilities that are provided by local authorities. I want to tell the hon. member that our local authorities do make attempts to provide adequate facilities. I want to tell her that originally the Cape Town City Council, for instance, wished to obtain Woodstock Beach and Granger Bay for the Coloured people, but that their efforts were overruled for certain reasons. Granger Bay was, of course, taken over as a naval base, which made that impossible. I would also like to tell the hon. member that in my constituency, which has 150 miles of sea coast, we have provided very adequate beaches for our non-Whites because the local authorities have co-operated with the province and with the people in the area. I may mention one small area in Port Alfred where there were difficulties about beach amenities. With the assistance of the province, we in fact spent R22 500 in expropriating 11 morgen of sea-side where the ownership went down to the beach, to provide a lovely beach for the Coloureds and the Bantu. This beach is very popular with them and is used by non-Whites from a very wide area. I think that the hon. member should try to assist with the provision of these amenities, rather than speak scathingly of them.</p>

<p>I want to support the hon. member for Green Point&#x2019;s plea to the Deputy Minister of Agriculture, namely that the powers he may delegate in terms of section 10 of the Act be extended. I do not want to go into this too much at the present time, because I am dealing at present with the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs about the destruction of marine life in certain areas in my constituency. The Cape Province has a very efficient nature conservation department. They can control all nature up to high-water mark, but there it stops. We have a number of people in South Africa today who have no respect whatsoever for ourl marine life and who are destroying it systematically from one end of the coast to the other. I believe that if the Minister would delegate the power to control the marine life in the inter-tidal zone and the sea-shore as such, it would go a long way towards preserving nature along our coast.</p>

<p>We would like the hon. the Deputy Minister to delegate the powers given by section 10 (1) (c) to the provinces. There is a perpetual conflict of opinion in this regard. Nobody knows who controls what. The result is that many people get away with absolute murder along our coasts. The angling clubs do their best to preserve our marine life and the department of nature conservation does its best. The limited number of fishery officers have vast areas to cover and do not only deal with the marine life in the inter-tidal zone and therefore it is impossible for them to carry out their task along our coast. I would like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister to consider this as a very important factor and to deal with his colleague in the other department in order to find out whether the control of the sea-shore cannot also be delegated to the provinces to whom they belong, and to whom this is also an important factor for the future of South Africa.</p>

<p>I shall have to find out about the delegation of the powers to the provinces, if I understand the hon. member correctly. Then the hon. member for Green Point asked about the Admiralty Reserves. All the Admiralty Reserves are still State-owned land. They are not being transferred to the provinces. Admiralty lands still remain the property of the State, and there is no delegation.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member asked about 3antu land. He is quite correct, Bantu <span class="col_2607-2608" refersTo="page_1321"/>land is excluded from this amendment. As far as the hon. member&#x2019;s question about the fine is concerned, I may just say that these regulations do not relate to marine life only, but they also relate to pollution and the removal of material. The maximum fine is R200 and one month&#x2019;s imprisonment. This matter was discussed with the provinces and the local authorities. In the Committee Stage I shall go into certain of these aspects in more detail.</p>

<p>I am glad that the hon. member for Odendaalsrus and the hon. member for Worcester adopted that standpoint. It amazes me that the hon. member for Houghton asked questions and then left. Now I do not know to whom I am to reply, but in her absence I shall read a letter the Minister of Indian Affairs received from the Executive Committee of the Indian Council.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Houghton said that it is a disgrace to see the area where the Coloureds must swim and she said that she was not very happy about the whole thing. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For a long time past the Council has been making urgent representations to the authorities to demarcate beaches for Indians and to provide the necessary facilities in order to cope with the growing popular demand for beach facilities by the Indian community.

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The 22 properties, which are all situated in the Division of George, and of which the description is given in the Schedule of the Bill, belong to numerous persons who do not have title deeds. This situation has arisen because of the fact that in most cases the registered owners died years ago and over the years the heirs have failed to take formal transfer of their rightful undivided share or shares or to pass deeds of partition transfer. In some cases the heir is already the fourth generation of the original owner.</p>

<p>The size of the individual properties varies from 1,7 ha to 1 272 ha and, as far as could be ascertained, more than 600 heirs are already involved in one case. In many cases estates are also involved in respect of the heirs. In addition, there has been an interchanging sale of shares, so that outsiders have obtained shares in some of the properties. The numerous estates, heirs and other successors and assigns who have over the years, become implicated in this matter, makes the division of transfer of the properties even more complicated.</p>

<p>Because of the uncertainty in respect of ownership, the land cannot be utilized to the best advantage of those who are entitled thereto. Because of their situation, certain portions are particularly suitable for recreation purposes or the establishment of townships. However, the uncertainty in respect of ownership, hampers such development. Large units which are held in undivided shares and which are suitable for farming, are rendered unusable because of unplanned occupation.</p>

<p>On several occasions heirs or other assignees have tried to

 conclude a division agreement by means of private negotiations.

 However, the number of interested parties involved, prevents any such private negotiation from succeeding. The small area of certain portions in respect of which a joining owner could take transfer by means of subdivision, and the requirements of the Deeds Registries Act that deeds should follow the order of their relative causes, would also result in the costs in regard to obtaining ownership, exceeding the value of the particular portion.</p>

<p>The situation is deteriorating progressively as a result of the increase in the number of persons entitled to shares in the land. At this stage fractional portions such as 1/704th share are already involved.</p>

<p>Since it is still possible at present to ascertain with reasonable certainty which <span class="col_2609-2610" refersTo="page_1322"/>persons have claim to particular pieces of land, the authorities have decided to introduce legislation in order to resolve the matter. Therefore the Bill before you makes provision for the establishment of a committee consisting of three members with the power to divide the properties in question and to transfer the portion or portions directly to the persons entitled thereto. Furthermore, in certain cases where it is not feasible or desirable to transfer a particular portion or portions, the committee is authorized to sell those portions and to distribute the proceeds, after the costs have been deducted, among the persons entitled thereto.</p>

<p>The first task of the Land Division Committee will be to ascertain who the persons are who are entitled to a share in particular properties and to what share in those properties each person is entitled. Where a portion of land which, because of its natural condition or for any other reason deemed sufficient by the committee, shall not be allocated to claimants and therefore has to be sold in order to pay the net proceeds to the person entitled thereto, the Minister shall determine the conditions of sale. In a few cases mortgages are involved, and in such cases the mortgage debt will be covered from the proceeds of the sale after which the balance will be paid to the person entitled thereto.</p>

<p>Because of the fact that there are cases where two or more persons have shares in two or more adjoining properties, provision is being made that such adjoining properties, where the committee deems it expedient for the purposes of the division and allocation, may be regarded as a single property and a single portion of the joint pieces of land may be allocated to each of the interested parties. The single piece of land will then represent such a person&#x2019;s share in the two or more pieces of land.</p>

<p>All expenditure incurred by the committee in regard to the division, allocation and transfer of the land, will be paid by the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure, on a recoverable basis in fact, from funds appropriated by Parliament for the purpose. In other words, each claimant will have to pay his rightful share of the costs incurred to the said department, for payment into the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Transfer will not take place before the costs have been paid. The division and transfer of the land in terms of the proposed measure, are exempted from transfer fees, stamp duties and office fees. Taking into account the private rights involved in this matter, the Bill has been treated as a hybrid measure. In other words, the intention to introduce the Bill was announced in advance by means of the <i>Gazette</i> and local newspapers. Interested parties whose names and addresses it was possible to obtain, were also informed of this intention by registered post. The Bill as such was open to perusal at the offices of the magistrate at George, the Divisional Council at George and with the Cape Provincial Secretary. No objections were received from any interested persons.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this really is a very interesting piece of legislation, submitted here by the hon. the Deputy Minister. In fact, I think it is unique. It is seldom or never that this type of legislation appears. The hon. the Deputy Minister explained to us what has been done and said that interested parties, if they had any objection to the legislation, had an opportunity of expressing such objections at the right place and in the right way. This Bill provides for a special committee to be appointed in order to ensure that equitable division takes place and where the assets are sold, any person who may still have a form of ownership, will in fact receive his or her rightful share. Furthermore, it is interesting to find that if one combines this land, it is a considerable area in the vicinity of George being cultivated and inhabited in this way today by many people One wants to express the hope that when this Land Division Committee carries out its task, it will ensure that nobody will suffer any damage in this respect. Although it was a good idea to place the advertisement in the local newspaper and in the <i>Gazette,</i> one must realize that there are often many people who do not see this type of thing and who are totally unaware of the decisions taken. Therefore I say that this Land Division Committee will have a very heavy responsibility to ensure that nobody suffers damage in this regard. It is a pity legislation of this kind could not be referred to a Select Committee, because I think one would then have been able to give satisfaction to all parties in all respects. Of course, there is a particular procedure which must be followed, and because nobody has raised any serious objection, one can expect that there will be no serious misgivings about this legislation either. Therefore we on this <span class="col_2611-2612" refersTo="page_1323"/>side of the House support the passing of the Second Reading of this Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, by speaking now, I am in fact doing something

 unusual, because this Bill is something which affects one of my colleagues. However, this is a matter which affects my constituency very intimately, and because, from the first day, I was concerned with the plans to establish something which culminated in the form in which we have it before this hon. House today, I have really risen only to make three points. Firstly, I want to express my thanks for the goodwill with which the department concerned and my colleagues approached this problem. In the second place, I want to say I believe the steps being envisaged here, will lead to tremendous development in the area where these two farms are situated. It is the position that if the conditions prevailing at present, were to continue, they would stand in the way of development. I am aware that certain persons living on this land are full of energy and initiative and are searching for only the slightest opportunity to give expression to their excessive energy and plans, but who are frustrated and baulked by the re-restricted measures existing at present. Therefore I hope that, if this masure makes it possible to create new circumstances, there will be new progress and development in that part of the district as there has been in recent years in agriculture and in other spheres in that district.</p>

<p>In the third place, I merely want to say that one of these pieces of land is situated in the vicinity of the lakes between George and Knysna, which, seen from various points of view, amongst others from the point of view of tourism, is probably one of South Africa&#x2019;s greatest assets. What we are actually doing here, is to render a further contribution to make it possible for that asset situated between George and Knysna to be developed further in the interests of the whole country, because it is something unique in South Africa. Let me add that in my opinion there are few parts of the world which have anything more beautiful than this. I want to thank my colleagues for the steps they have taken. Since I have been concerned with this matter from the beginning, together with the hon. member for False Bay, who also gave much assistance in formulating a plan according to which we could find a practical solution, I want to give this measure my full support.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Newton Park said that we had

 perhaps not advertised this Bill sufficiently. In my Second Reading speech I told the hon. member that we had also sent registered letters to those owners whom we were able to trace. We did not receive a single objection from that source. If, however, within five days after the Second Reading, we receive any objection submitted by the Secretary to the House of Assembly, a Select Committee could still be appointed.</p>

<p>I am pleased that the hon. the Minister of Defence, whose constituency this is, participated in this discussion. When he took me there to see the situation, I thought it was an impossible task. Seen in the light of the assistance from the hon. member for False Bay, the Minister of Defence and other members of his department, I agree with the hon. member for Newton Park that it is a unique matter. There are a number of similar cases in our country. If this one succeeds and the owners are satisfied, we may extend it to other areas as well.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The Bill contains mainly three types of amendments. In the first place, a number of minor amendments are proposed in order to overhaul the principal Act. Some of these have become necessary in order to bring the provisions of the principal Act into line with the position in practice. Others are intended to eliminate flaws and to bring the provisions concerned into line with other similar provisions in the principal Act. No new principles are involved.</p>

<p>Secondly, a number of amendments are proposed in regard to companies which act <span class="col_2613-2614" refersTo="page_1324"/>as commission agents or brokers. The registration of a company as a commission agent is done in the name of the company. In relevant cases the Act is also applicable to the employees of a commission agent and, since the definition of &#x201C;employee&#x201D; includes a director of the company, to the directors as well. However, this is not the case where an application for registration or renewal of registration as a commission agent may be refused by the Secretary for Agricultural Economics and Marketing by virtue of the provision in section 6 (i) (g) of the principal Act, namely where, and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the applicant has been convicted of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty.</block>

<p>For the sake of more effective control it is necessary that specific provision be made in respect of the position of the director of a company which has been registered as a commission agent.</p>

<p>The third group of amendments relate to the way in which unclaimed moneys due to principals in respect of perishable agricultural produce sold on their behalf, are to be disposed of.</p>

<p>At present section 93 of the Administration of Estates Act applies, which provides that all persons carrying on business in the Republic shall each year prepare and publish in the <i>Government Gazette</i> statements of moneys which are not their property and have remained unclaimed for a period of five years or more by the rightful owners. After a further three months, the moneys still remaining unclaimed are paid into the guardians&#x2019; fund concerned; in the case of Bantu, into the Bantu Trust Fund.</p>

<p>Because all unclaimed moneys continue to be a charge against the security which a commission agent is obliged to furnish, the accumulation of unclaimed moneys may materially prejudice the position of claimants against the security when the commission agent terminates his business owing to financial problems or his registration is withdrawn. Accordingly it is deemed advisable to make special provision in the principal Act to oblige commission agents to pay over such moneys after six months to the Secretary for Agricultural Economics and Marketing, who will then advertise the matter in the <i>Government Gazette</i> and pay all unclaimed amounts into the guardians&#x2019; fund.</p>

<p>In conclusion I should like to emphasize that not only has there been thorough consultation with all the interested parties such as organized agriculture, the Institute of Marketing Agents of South Africa, and the Institute of Market Masters, but that specific requests have also been received for certain flaws to be eliminated.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as hon. members opposite will find, when legislation which is aimed at protecting the interests of the farmer is submitted to us, this side of this House is prepared to support them. This legislation is an example of where we are prepared to protect the interests of the farmer. The hon. the Minister explained to us that clause 3 in particular is designed to take action against a broker or commission agent who is not a company and who forms a company and then neglects to protect the financial interests of the farmer. The last amendment to which the Minister paid attention, i.e. in regard to the accumulation of money, is a definite step in this legislation to provide clearly how the farmer may obtain that money and what will happen to it if he does not claim it.</p>

<p>I am surprised, however, that the hon. the Deputy Minister did not explain clause 12 to us. Perhaps I did not hear properly. I refer particularly to paragraph (b), in terms of which regulations may now also be made in respect of places which normally are not under the control of a market master. We should like to know from the hon. the Minister what the object of this is. Is it the intention that regulations may now also be made for example for supermarkets where vegetables and perishable produce are sold&#x003F; Is this why the Deputy Minister wants this power&#x003F; We should just like to know the reasons for that. For the rest we have no objection to the legislation and shall support the Second Reading.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I welcome this legislation because it affords us better control over our marketing system. We are aware that our marketing system is slowly but surely being replaced by direct sales of produce. But the existing marketing system still forms a very important part of the way in which the farmer&#x2019;s produce reaches the consumer.</p>

<p>I take it that this statutory amendment is part of the recommendations of the Marketing Committee which was recently appointed to give advice in connection with municipal markets.</p>

<p><span class="col_2615-2616" refersTo="page_1325"/>I am also interested in clause 12, the same clause in respect of which the hon. member for Newton Park put a question. I should like to know from the Minister what exactly is meant by the control of concerns other than the markets. I was merely wondering whether it included, for example, agencies of control boards which may market at other places under the supervision of the municipal markets.</p>

<p>We welcome this better control, especially over the unclaimed moneys, because it places the position beyond all doubt.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Newton Park was correct in referring to supermarkets. The existing provisions of the Act are applicable to markets within a municipal area. But then we get the case&#x2014;and I think with this I am at the same time&#x2014;replying to the hon. member for Humansdorp where a man sends his product to a firm which does not have this system, or which is outside a controlled market area, a supermarket which works with a cash register. Provision is made for these specific cases, and they are not involved here. The organizations also pointed out that a great deal of the marketing is done through firms which do not have the same bookkeeping system as a municipal market.</p>

<p>In regard to the control boards which market through municipal markets, I want to say that municipal markets are subject to these regulations in terms of this Act. Therefore this measure is applicable to them. But if a control board such as the Potato Board sells directly to a supermarket, the amendment is designed to accommodate that as well.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Hon. members are aware that the Dairy Industry Act (No. 30 of 1961) was amended last year in order to make provision for the sale of yellow margarine in the Republic.</p>

<p>As a result of representations received from South-West Africa<b>&#x2014;</b><i>inter alia,</i> from the South-West Africa Dairy Board&#x2014;the Government has decided to allow the sale of yellow margarine in this territory as well.</p>

<p>In order to implement this decision, it is necessary suitably to amend the Act concerned as well as the Dairy Industry Control Ordinance, 1962 (No. 29 of 1962) of the territory.</p>

<p>The present legal position is that the manufacture, importation or sale of yellow margarine is prohibited in the territory. Neither the Minister nor the South-West Africa Dairy Board has any authority to make exceptions to this prohibition.</p>

<p>With this Bill it is accordingly proposed to extend the legislation applicable to the Republic in respect of margarine, to South-West Africa. The powers which the South-West Africa Dairy Board had over white margarine, are also being withdrawn by this.</p>

<p>The purpose of this Act is therefore to accommodate the manufacture and importation of margarine in the territory in the present control system of the Republic.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it would be strange if the manufacture of margarine were allowed in the Republic but not in South-West Africa. Therefore we shall not oppose the principle contained in this legislation. Furthermore, I was interested to hear that representations had been made by the South-West Africa Dairy Board and that this change was then effected. Strangely enough, when the change was effected here in the Republic, the Dairy Board was not really approached and it was not consulted about the manufacture of yellow margarine. The hon. the Deputy Minister will remember that the chairman, and especially Mr. Albert Basson, objected strongly because he had not been consulted and because they knew nothing of the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s proposed plan. Now we have a welcome change in approach here. In this connection the Dairy Board has in fact been approached. But in regard to the manufacture of margarine there are very interesting developments these days. We have heard that the public of South Africa are entitled to obtain margarine because so many of them cannot afford butter. Just recently we have found that <span class="col_2617-2618" refersTo="page_1326"/>yellow margarine costs approximately the same as imported New Zealand butter. In other words, we find that the opportunity the housewife had of obtaining the cheaper product, has now been completely removed. We therefore expect that, when the hon. the Deputy Minister makes this Act applicable to South-West Africa, he will watch this new development very carefully. Sir, the attitude of this side of the House is very clear, namely that the original, natural product should be protected at all times, and the best way of protecting the natural product, namely butter, is of course to make its price competitive with that of margarine.</p>

<p>The attitude of this side of the House is very clear, i.e. that if the price of butter is to be made competitive with that of margarine, it will be necessary to subsidize the consumer price. If it is necessary to increase the subsidy beyond the R5,7 million being spent today, the hon. the Deputy Minister will find that hon. members on this side are prepared to support such a step. It is not our policy to benefit one sector at the expense of another. It is our policy to protect the dairy industry in South Africa. We have absolutely nothing against the oil-seed producers in South Africa. We think they fulfil as important a role in this country, but if there is something which goes against the grain of dairy farmers of South Africa, it is that a product appears on the market which is an attempt to imitate his product, while his own product cannot be placed in a competitive position. But because it would be wrong&#x2014;and this is consistent with the attitude we adopted last year&#x2014;to allow the production of yellow margarine in the Republic and not in South-West Africa, we on this side of the House support the Second Reading.</p>

The hon. member who has just spoken, never wants to adopt a standpoint when I ask him whether we should increase the quotas for yellow margarine, but he always criticizes us. When I ask him whether we should import mutton at a low price, he remains absolutely silent; he does not reply, because if he says &#x201C;yes&#x201D;, he is caught. The hon. member asked why the Dairy Board had been consulted in this regard. The situation is completely different here. What would have been the use of consulting the Dairy Board last year&#x003F; We knew they would say &#x201C;no&#x201D;; let us be honest. The Dairy Board has now come forward of its own free will and has said: &#x201C;The manufacture of margarine is prohibited in a country which has a shortage of butter, which produced a surplus in the past, but South-West Africa is dependent on imported butter.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Why then does the hon. member continue pleading&#x003F; Here he wants to protect the cream producers. He is terribly fond of them. He wants to protect the cream producers, but he is not committing himself completely. You are talking here only to have it recorded in Hansard, but outside you tell the consumer to look at the price. You said a moment ago that the price of margarine was equal to that of New Zealand butter, but surely you know that is not the case. Surely you know that the price of yellow margarine, as announced by the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs, is considerably lower than the price of New Zealand butter, which has in fact been sold at a loss now. I explained the matter to the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District. He castigated the Dairy Board, and those people are very bitter about what he said here about them, and it is still our people, the so-called farmers, who control the Dairy Board. I told you explicitly that that butter had been loaded onto the ship at the time we announced yellow margarine and the consumption dropped by 38 per cent. But is it such a terrible scandal or &#x201C;muddle&#x201D; if one sees that the quantity which has been imported and the quantity which has been exported are both as much as we consume in two weeks&#x003F; Now the hon. member says the export loss should have been given to the domestic consumer. It is 2 cents per pound which you could have granted for two weeks. Please be realistic. We have reached the stage today where anything is seized upon in order to make political capital. But with whom are you scoring any success with this sort of thing&#x003F; Definitely not with the farmers, because not one of them has received a cent less.

The hon. member is aware that the Dairy Board said last year that they wanted the price of butter fat to be increased, but you agreed that the man working in the creamery, the transporter, in fact everyone, should get a bigger salary, and then the price increased to 54 cents a pound, in spite of a Government subsidy of R5,6 million. I now want to ask the hon. member whether he would like us to increase this subsidy on butter&#x003F; Look, we may not reduce the producer&#x2019;s price now, but someone must lose, because he wants to provide butter cheaply now. Must we increase the subsidy on butter&#x003F; You said we should protect the producer. All we can do is to pay a larger subsidy on the price of butter.

She wants to buy shoe polish and instead she buys margarine. This is a psychological system, and they will come back with a proposal&#x2014;I am not saying it is final, but they are considering it of their own accord&#x2014;to say that margarine should be free for all, and then the novelty of yellow margarine will wear off.

<p>In order not to deprive certain persons who have been practising in the territory as veterinarians for years but who do not have sufficient qualifications, of their livelihood, it has been decided to afford them special protection in terms of clause 4. The names of the persons concerned may be found in the Schedule to this Bill.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Veterinary Board requested to be invested with special powers as laid down in clause 5, in order to act where persons are unable to continue practising as veterinarians on account of mental or physical disabilities. Similar measures have already been laid down for medical practitioners and dentists, so that no new principles are involved here.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>By way of preface I want to point out that the various provisions of this Bill are aimed at effecting adjustments and corrections to laws. Furthermore, it includes the addition of further matters to the legislative powers of homeland governments. In fact, this Bill contains no principles deviating from the principles embodied in previously adopted legislation, and consequently I trust that the House as a whole will see its way clear to accepting this Bill in its present form without any hesitation.</p>

<p>The various provisions of the Bill have already been explained in an explanatory memorandum tabled here, but for the information of hon. members I nevertheless want to add briefly some further comment on the Bill.</p>

<p><i>Clauses</i> 1 <i>and</i> 2:</p>

<p>The pre-Union marriage laws in the provinces of Natal and the Transvaal provide that a Bantu female, irrespective of her age, may not enter into a marriage without the consent of her father or guardian. The said pre-Union laws will remain in force in respect of Bantu in terms of section 39 of the Marriage Act, 1961 (Act No. 25 of 1961), until they are repealed by the State President.</p>

<p>The provision to which I referred, is the only provision of the pre-Union laws which, at the request of the Bantu authorities <span class="col_2623-2624" refersTo="page_1329"/>concerned&#x2014;and here I want to repeat, at the request of the Bantu authorities concerned&#x2014;is still to be retained, and it is proposed to incorporate the said provisions in the Bantu Administration Act in order that the relevant pre-Union laws may then be repealed simultaneously with the commencement of the proposed section 22<i>ter.</i></p>

<p>It is also provided that the Minister or a person authorized by him or a court of competent jurisdiction may grant this consent if, for some reason or other, a Bantu female who is of age is unable to obtain such consent from her father or guardian, or if such consent is unreasonably withheld by him.</p>

<p>If the relevant pre-Union laws are repealed, the object of section 2 (4) of the Bantu Administration Act, 1927, will fall away. Clause 1 makes provision for the repeal thereof.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 3:</p>

<p>This clause seeks to include in the released area those farms mentioned here so that the South African Bantu Trust may legally purchase them, and to authorize the expenditure involved in such purchase.</p>

<p><i>Clause 4:</i></p>

<p>This clause provides that the word &#x201C;Bantu&#x201D; shall be construed as &#x201C;Native&#x201D; in the territory of South-West Africa, where it is not applicable, but where it appears in laws and documents and in the references to certain official titles and otherwise which are applicable in the said territories.</p>

<p><i>Clauses</i> 5, 6 <i>and</i> 7 (1) (a):</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, this is a further development in accordance with the policy of this Government by which Bantu nations are given an increasing role in the handling of their own affairs on their road to self-determination.</p>

<p>While the Transkei Government is tackling their task with enthusiasm and would like even greater control over the affairs of their country, these clauses and that dealing with road carrier transportation comply with their wishes.</p>

<p>In Clauses 5, 6 and 7 (1) (a) it is proposed to extend the legislative powers of the Transkei Legislative Assembly to include the establishment, disestablishment, administration and control of prisons for Bantu persons in the districts of the Transkei excluding the White areas in the districts of Port St. Johns and Matatiele.</p>

<p>Provision is also made for the recognition of prisons, the control and administration of which has been assigned to the Government of the Transkei as well as prisons established by Transkeian authorities, as prisons for the purpose of laws of the Republic relating to prisons. This is necessary as the Bill also provides for the transfer, with the approval of the Minister of Prisons of the Republic and the Minister concerned of the Transkei, of Bantu serving sentences of imprisonment between prisons of the Republic and of the Transkei. This in turn is necessary to keep the administration of prisons in the Republic as a whole, flexible and is not to be viewed as an extradition arrangement as it only relates to persons already serving prison sentences.</p>

<p>The Minister of Prisons of the Republic is being empowered to assign the control and administration of existing prisons in the Transkeian districts mentioned earlier, to the Transkeian Government to be controlled and administered as prisons for Bantu persons.</p>

<p>As it is necessary for the Republican authorities to maintain prisons in the Transkei, for instance for non-Bantu and other persons not belonging to the Transkei, it is also provided that the authorities of the Republic retain powers over such prisons.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 7 (1) (b), (c) <i>and</i> (2):</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the legislative power of the Transkei Legislative Assembly is being further extended to include motor carrier transportation in the districts of the Transkei, excluding the White areas of Matatiele and Port St. Johns, and in order to transfer such power completely, it is provided that there shall be no appeal to the National Transport Commission in terms of Section 6 (2) of the Motor Carrier Transportation Act, 1930. To make it possible for the Transkeian authorities to review even the existing position, it is provided that any existing certificate or exemption shall not continue to be valid after a transitionary period.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 8:</p>

<p>*This clause seeks to give effect to requests received from the governments concerned <span class="col_2625-2626" refersTo="page_1330"/>for the names of their territories to be altered. These requests came from their side.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 9:</p>

<p>This clause seeks to effect certain improvements and additions to the list of matters over which the Legislative Council in South-West Africa shall have jurisdiction. This does not comprise anything new, and in the main it brings the list into line with the position in the Republic.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 10:</p>

<p>This clause provides that any property, both movable and immovable, which belongs to the State, Provincial Administrations and the Administration of the Territory of South-West Africa may, after the necessary consultation with the parties concerned, be transferred to Bantu public bodies.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 11:</p>

<p>This clause seeks to provide that the Secretary for Bantu Administration and Development and the Secretary for Social Welfare and Pensions, respectively, may delegate their powers and duties in terms of the Bantu Authorities&#x2019; Service Pensions Act, 1971 (Act No. 6 of 1971), to officers both in the public service and outside their departments; this provision is essential since the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions is administering the Act on behalf of the Department of Bantu Administration and Development.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 12:</p>

<p>The object of this clause is the &#x201C;establishment of public holidays&#x201D; as an additional matter in regard to which legislative assemblies established in terms of the Bantu Homelands Constitution Act, 1971, shall have legislative powers.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 13:</p>

<p>This clause only contains the short title and dates of commencement.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Bill deals with several subjects. It starts with marriage laws and then it moves on to land matters, prisons, motor carrier transport in the Transkei, constitutional matters in South-West Africa, the transfer of land to Bantu bodies, the delegation of powers of senior and junior officials and finally, as the hon. the Minister has said, it ends up with holidays, which everybody will need by the time we have got through this Bill.</p>

<p>We have no objection to the first clause which deals with the removal of Bantu Affairs Commissioners as marriage officers.</p>

<p>As far as clause 2 is concerned we have an objection. This clause prohibits civil marriages by African Bantu females in the Transvaal and Natal unless they have the consent of their guardians. If a guardain refuses to give his consent and if the Minister considers his act unreasonable, he can give permission to marry. The Bantu woman is also entitled to go to court to seek permission of a Judge. The reason for this prohibition as the Minister has said is a request from the Bantu authorities in those two provinces. In the Cape we are more enlightened and we say that by all means the people who want to and still believe in their customs can stick to them. However, if the custom is not strong enough to bind the members of the tribe to it, we must not enforce it by passing a law. The Common Law of the country should prevail. I repeat if groups of people wish to respect their own customs or law they must do so without embarrassing others who do not wish to abide by those antiquated customs and we must not pass a law to be observed by all. What is the position with regard to a Bantu woman in the Native law in Natal and in the Transvaal, although I am not quite sure about that&#x003F; She remains a minor all her life and she is under perpetual tutelage. In the Transkei, in the Cape she becomes a major like any other woman at the age of 21. No customary union in any part of the country is recognized as a union or as a marriage unless the father or guardian of the girl consents to the marriage. The consent is a prerequisite and without it there is no customary union. In the Cape the civil law also applies to all those who wish to marry by civil law and by Christian rites. If the Bantu authorities in Natal and the Transvaal wish to apply their customs to civil marriages as well, it is their indaba in their own homelands. I object to their forcing this custom on others living in Natal or the Transvaal, but outside the homelands. If this clause, as I read it, is passed it will mean that no Bantu or African <span class="col_2627-2628" refersTo="page_1331"/>woman can marry in the Transvaal or Natal without the consent of a guardian. Why should these Bantu authorities in the Transvaal stop for instance Transkeian citizens who happen to be living in the Transvaal from marrying without their guardian&#x2019;s consent&#x003F; Why should they stop others who have become detribalized from marrying because of an old and antiquated custom&#x003F; Of course, the woman who is denied can apply to court, but why should she be put to that considerable expense and delay&#x003F; By Native custom, if a guardian will not give his consent the woman of course can ignore it by merely going to live with her lover. Then she becomes what is known as a &#x201C;dikazi&#x201D;. Her father can then sue for damages for the seduction of his daughter, but moneywise it is much better for him to collect a dowry. In the end he will probably give his consent to the marriage so that he can claim the dowry. But what happens where the parties want a civil marriage&#x003F; If the guardian will not give his consent, it will merely mean that they will be living in sin and the children will grow up as little bastards. In these days of the permissive society it should be our aim to make marriage easier and not more difficult for these people. Even in Natal where a female becomes emancipated on application to a Bantu Commissioner&#x2014;he gives her a special certificate of emancipation&#x2014;she will still not be able to marry because of the retention of this law in which the legal status of a woman is ignored. No matter what her status may be or what age she has attained, she will still have to obtain permission from her guardian who may be a cousin far removed and who has no real interest in her except for her dowry. She would have either to get his consent or be compelled to go to a Judge or to make special application to the Minister. I think it is wrong to keep the African bound to his old custom where he has left his homeland. Even in his homeland his way of life has completely changed from what it was even 25 years ago. The discipline of the Bantu was based in the kraal head and he expected and was given respect by all the inmates of that kraal. But this discipline has broken down because the authority of the kraal head is slipping for the simple reason that for economic reasons the African is compelled to leave his kraal site to go elsewhere to make a living.</p>

<p>The old order was changing, the new was replacing the old in Shakespeare&#x2019;s time and I submit it has gone on and on. It is always changing. We, the White people, have accepted the changes. We do not abide by the old customs of our ancestors in Holland or Germany or Britain. We have changed with the times. Economic necessities have forced changes on us and they have also forced changes on the African. We must recognize and appreciate that his customs, perhaps regrettably so, are changing too. For those who wish to abide by the customs, I say, let them do so by all means. Jews have their laws. They do not all abide by them, but we do not pass a law compelling them to do so. If parents desire a customary marriage, let them have it and as other religions do, they can have it in addition to the civil marriage if their children desire such a marriage. The civil marriage has consequences in law which do not follow customary union. If two mature people wish to follow these consequences for themselves and for their children, I submit that they are entitled to do so. As I have said, we are opposed to clause 2.</p>

<p>In connection with clause 3, I should like to say that this is not the first time that the department has been guilty of this type of error, namely of buying land where it is not entitled to do so. Although we will approve of the clause, we ask that more care be taken in future because the purchase of land by the Trust may adversely affect neighbouring owners and their rights should be respected in terms of the law.</p>

<p>Clause 4 merely deals with the change in designation and we appreciate that in South-West Africa the word &#x201C;Native&#x201D; must be used instead of the word &#x201C;Bantu&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Clause 8 merely seeks to change the spelling of the names Ovamboland and Kawangoland. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister why the &#x201C;w&#x201D; is substituted for the &#x201C;v&#x201D; in both &#x201C;Owambo&#x201D; and &#x201C;Kawango&#x201D;. There is probably a very good reason for it. It is probably because of the Native way of spelling these names. I do not know, but I have no doubt that the hon. the Minister will be able to give us the reason.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry, it is only the spelling of &#x201C;Owambo&#x201D; that is changed.</p>

<p><span class="col_2629-2630" refersTo="page_1332"/>I now come to clauses 5, 6, 7 and 9. Clauses 5, 6 and 7 deal with the Constitution of the Transkei, giving that Government wider jurisdiction and clause 9 empowers the Government to give further powers to the Native authorities in South-West Africa. I want to ask some questions about the application of these laws, but first I want to state our attitude with regard to the extension of political power to the Native or African authorities. I do not know why it is, but there still seems to be some doubt about our policy with regard to the political development of the Bantu in the homelands. Because we are opposed to the Government&#x2019;s Bantustan policy, against the ultimate aim of giving ultimate sovereign independence, does not mean that we are opposed to the granting of more power to their authorities to control their own affairs. In fact we made it quite clear that it is our policy to establish communal councils giving them powers to control their own affairs. We have made our position quite clear. We stand for the economic development of the Reserves to the fullest extent and have continued to attack the Government for not developing them fast enough pointing out that under Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s policy of prohibiting the use of White capital and initiative, he was stifling development in the Reserves which were becoming a drag on the economy of the rest of the country. At last, and in keeping with the changes of thinking by members on the other side, they are changing their policy. The Government is slowly taking over our policies in this regard too. They are now inviting White capital in the reserves. With regard to political development it should be well-known by now that under our race federation policy we promised constitutional development for the Reserves right up to and beyond provincial council standards, but in an ordered manner. In 1937 Genl. Smuts promised that the old Bunga in the Transkei and the Native Representative Council would be given more powers. Unfortunately he was not allowed to put his policy into effect. We have often expressed our concern over the tardy economic development. Now with regard to political development the Transkei is obviously better fitted than the other Reserves, both in South Africa and in South-West Africa, for the granting of more powers to manage its own affairs. We have agreed to extensions of their powers except where the extension has had the character or had been in character with the Government&#x2019;s declared policy of granting eventual sovereign independence. If any amendment to a constitution of any of the authorities comes before us in this House, our consideration is first whether it is in accordance with our policy of granting them powers for self-government to control their own affairs or if it is in line for a constitutional change to bring about independence. The amendments proposed in this Bill before us fall into the first category and we will therefore not oppose them. However, that does not mean that if we were governing, that we would necessarily give all these powers now proposed. We are by no means satisfied that the South-West African authorities have reached the stage where they can be entrusted to manage and administer all the affairs which it is now proposed to hand over to these authorities. By passing this Bill these powers will be handed over to any of these authorities no matter what their state of development is. We say that as far as South-West Africa is concerned there is a balancing or controlling factor in that the State President still has the right of veto and can in fact legislate for the area, a right which he has lost in certain respects in the Transkei. In the Committee Stage we shall deal with these proposals in detail and voice our misgivings in certain respects.</p>

<p>As far as clause 6 is concerned, I see that it provides for the transfer of prisoners from the Republic to the Transkei and <i>vice versa.</i> I want to ask the Minister whether only Transkeians will be transferred to the Transkei and will non-Transkeians only be transferred from the Transkei to prisons in the Republic. Will any non-Transkeian be transferred to the Transkei to get vocational training in prisons there&#x003F; I understand that at the new gaol at Umzimkulu, which I visited recently, there are facilities for giving training for builders, carpenters, and so on, in the building trade and I want to know if it is meant to transfer Bantu from the Republic who are not Transkeian citizens to a goal like that to teach them the various trades. If a Transkeian is permanently resident outside and is enjoying section 10 rights, and if he is gaoled and is sent to a prison in the Transkei, will he return to his home at the end of his sentence or will he be discharged and left in the Transkei&#x003F;</p>

<p>Clause 7 deals with motor carrier transportation <span class="col_2631-2632" refersTo="page_1333"/>and I want to know what will happen to a carrier based in Matatiele and Port St. Johns. Where will he get exemptions&#x003F; Will he be allowed to operate in the Transkei and will the Transkeian authorities be permitted to issue certificates or exemptions entitling operators in the Transkei to operate outside the Transkei&#x003F; Let us take the example of the delivery of household effects by a Transkeian carrier, with exemption in the Transkei, from Umtata to Pretoria. Will he be allowed to do so or will he have to get an additional certificate of exemption from the authorities in the Republic&#x003F; If he will not be allowed to operate elsewhere, will the Transkeian Government then in fact be able to prohibit traffic by haulers passing through the Transkei say from the Cape to Natal, or will carriers with certificates issued in the Republic automatically be allowed to pass through the Transkei&#x003F;</p>

<p>Then there is the question of holidays. I would like to know what the position is in regard to holidays. These holidays will be in substitution for holidays in the Republic. The different authorities will be able to grant holidays with the concurrence of the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development in substitution for public holidays established by or in terms of the public holidays Act. I want to know what is meant by &#x201C;substitution&#x201D;. Does it mean that the holidays would have to be on the same days as holidays in the Republic&#x003F; For example, will the authorities have to have a holiday on the 31st May, the 10th October and the 16th December, or can they have their holidays on dates which they choose as long as they do not have more holidays than are recognized in the Republic&#x003F; This is important, because if all these homeland governments are going to be given permission to have their own holidays, I think we have 12 holidays recognized in the Republic, the eight Bantu authorities envisaged will all have their own 12 holidays, making the total 96 holidays for the different homelands on different days in addition to our 12 holidays in the Republic. Although they obviously cannot legislate to make holidays in the Republic outside of the homelands, if they declare certain days to be their national days for each homeland, their citizens who are living and working in the Republic will no doubt wish to recognize those days as well wherever they are working. We might find our economy here hampered by a multitude of holidays being recognized or celebrated by the different people of the different homelands.</p>

<p>There is nothing in the principle of this Bill to which we are opposed. In the Committee Stage we will certainly have a lot of criticisms to offer and we will want much more information, but at this stage we will not oppose the Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. D. K. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I listened attentively to the hon. member for Transkei, particularly because he, as we know, is the chief spokesman of the Opposition on matters concerning the Bantu groups in South Africa. In my speech I also want to refer to certain matters which the hon. member touched upon.</p>

<p>I want to begin by referring to clause 2, to which he expressed his opposition. In the discussion of this clause it became very apparent again what the difference between the National Party and the United Party is in regard to the handling of Bantu affairs. With the march of political events in South Africa, particularly in the times in which we are living, we will again indicate, much more clearly, the difference in approach and standpoint. It was interesting to see the reaction of the hon. member to the request from Bantu leaders in regard to their approach to marriage and the matters arising out of that.</p>

<p>The first important fact which the hon. member should take into consideration is that this clause, as it stands here, was inserted at the request of the Bantu themselves. Now one must concede that it is those Bantu who for various reasons want to accept and retain their own traditional way of life. The hon. member was actually emphasizing the other standpoint, i.e. that one should rather maintain the attitude of the other Bantu who no longer adhere so closely to their tribal traditions.</p>

<p>First I want to make a few general remarks about the standpoint of the National Party. In this clause the National Party is again recognizing the Bantu way of life, and in particular this one aspect, i.e. the recognition of Bantu law, regardless of how vaguely one has to state it at this stage. I must say that the National Party is displaying a much better knowledge of the traditional Bantu way of life here than the hon. Opposition, because one cannot deal with these matters in South Africa in a thorough, accurate and careful way if one <span class="col_2633-2634" refersTo="page_1334"/>does not have a very thorough knowledge of the traditional living patterns of the Bantu. If you want to create an orderly community in Bantu society, particularly after their contact with the Western way of life, you cannot get away from the fact that these people have particular norms according to which they have been living for many centuries. I can represent the difference between the National Party and the United Party symbolically by comparing it to a person travelling along a narrow road verging on a precipice. The United Party is trying to move as closely as possible to that precipice, while the National Party wants to stay as far away from it as it can. Therefore we are far more conservative in our approach than they are. That is why I think that we will survive the dangers, whereas they will plunge over the side of that precipice. I have said that in dealing with this matter we take very thorough cognizance of the existing norms in the living pattern of the Bantu. But in addition to that we also take very thorough cognizance of what influence the Western way of life has had on the Bantu. We have been admitting that all these years. We recognize that there has been a process of acculturation and cultural influence. We admit that there has been a change in the way of life of the Bantu. This influence on Bantu society came particularly from people who did not have expert knowledge of the Bantu and who were really imperialistic in their dealings with them. If we consider the history of the previous century, with the influences of the British Government in particular, then we note that these people deliberately wanted simply to force the Western way of life upon Bantu society, and that is quite simply as far as hon. members of the Opposition go, but one must go further and then one sees that there was a reaction on the part of the Bantu in respect of this so-called forced cultural influence on the part of the Whites. The hon. members of the Opposition have never really gone into that reaction.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pyper">

<p>What do you mean by &#x201C;forced&#x201D;&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. D. K. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>&#x201C;Forced&#x201D; means that you deliberately, without taking into consideration the living patterns of the Bantu, simply want to force the laws of the Whites and growth as you find it in the White society upon these people, and this is followed by a specific reaction. If you consider the history of the rest of Africa, where the physical influence of the Whites has virtually disappeared, you note that it elicited a reaction and that even in the so-called modern society of today they fall back to the old basic norms. You cannot control that phenomenon. Sir, this specific clause is also extremely important in the way of life of modern Bantu communities, and in this I see the desire on the part of responsible Bantu leaders for stability not only for the Bantu in the homelands, but also for those Bantu who, owing to circumstances, have to go to the so-called White areas where the circumstances are able to detach them much more easily from the Bantu living pattern. The problems which result from the disintegration of family life are in fact derived from the approach one adopts to marriage. If you consider the traditional laws of the Bantu and the values and significance of family life, you will note that you find a permanent unity in the family life among the Bantu, whether it is the smaller family unit or the larger family unit. The hon. member referred to the so-called kraal communities. Responsible Bantu leaders realize that if there is no stability in marriage, there is going to be a disintegration of family life. Sir, I find it so interesting that the National Party has gained world renown as the group of people, the so-called White people, who simply have no time whatsoever for the Black people; that we are supposedly the people who are purposefully intent on the destruction of the Blacks, while this debate is a clear indication that it is in fact this side of the House which wants to bring about stabilization in the Bantu communities in this modern world. If the way in which two persons are joined in marriage is not such that it can bring about stability in family life, then one has all the consequences of a disintegration of family life, and I am afraid that hon. members of the Opposition do not take these things into consideration, for if there is stability, where it is accepted that an elder person can furnish better guidance, it is of assistance in the educational task in respect of family life.</p>

<p>The hon. member went on to say that the responsibility of the guardian could be retained in the homelands; it does not make any difference, but if the Bantu come to the White areas, then it should fall away. But, Sir, surely it does not work as <span class="col_2635-2636" refersTo="page_1335"/>simply as that; if you are grown up and you have certain things which give you stability in society, then it does not mean that you should abandon all those things when you drive across a border. I cannot regard that as a responsible argument.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. D. K. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, these Bantu leaders who asked for this particular clause, do in fact want stability in their family life, but now the hon. member wants to detach the younger Bantu who want to venture into&#x2014;or plunge into, whichever way one wants to regard it &#x2014;married life from those basic ties, the ties which bound them and which did in fact bring them stability in their family life, the moment they cross over the border. I wish the hon. member would go and take a look at certain research which has been done in regard to the influence of large concentrations of Bantu youths on Bantu family life where the people have detached themselves from the traditional way of life of the Bantu. It is precisely there where one found future tsotsi&#x2019;s and all that kind of thing developing. Hon. members must realize that since we are, even in the White areas, already beginning to experience major youth problems in the large urban complexes of modern life, it is going to have a far greater aftereffect on the Bantu if we thoughtlessly detach them from their traditional pattern of living and bring them into contact with these family disintegrative elements, and that hon. member is contributing to the disintegration of family life, because he went further and pointed out <i>inter alia,</i> after he had referred to Shakespeare, that a change is taking place in the Western communities which he mentioned; in other words, that certain old norms have simply been rejected there. But, Sir, this is the very danger in human societies if you see change differently to growth; you must not see a change in cultural communities as a change in the basic principles which had a normative effect on that community, you must see it as growth, but as growth which is still being nourished by the basic principles which in former times gave substance and character and order to that specific community. The hon. member is making a grave error in thinking that change always means a change in the principles. He must realize that change actually means a process of growth of certain fundamental concepts.</p>

<p>The hon. member then went on to say that we are moving into the age of the so-called permissive society. That is very true, Mr. Speaker, the same applies to Western man, whom the hon. member presents as the civilized norm. What I am really concerned about today, even in the case of the Whites, is that we are accepting the so-called permissive society as something which simply had to come and that all we can do is adapt ourselves to it. But, Sir, if you have to proceed with that attitude, what is the condition of the major urban complexes going to be in 100 or 200 years&#x2019; time if you are simply going to accept that people have become permissive, and that you have to go along with this trend&#x003F; Surely that would be an impossible situation. What is the Opposition saying in that way to the responsible Bantu leader&#x003F; They are saying to him: &#x201C;Go ahead and detach yourself; we are living in a permissive world, where norms do not count any more; simply go on until we reach a situation of total promiscuity or totalagamy. I think that is a very irresponsible standpoint.</p>

<p>If it means verkramptheid if one wants to maintain certain norms in society, then the hon. member will simply have to see it in that way, but he made the statement&#x2014;I do not want to quote him incorrectly&#x2014;that modern society has become more permissive, and on those grounds one must not bind a couple, when they are going to get married, to the old rules and regulations. Sir, I think that is an irresponsible statement. [Interjection.] That is my point; to intend getting married is the prelude to a family life, and in family life one wants stability; one does not want disintegration. We can discuss this matter again. If I understand the hon. member incorrectly; I shall go back and read his speech and we can discuss this matter again in the Committee <span class="col_2637-2638" refersTo="page_1336"/>Stage. I just want to say that I cannot agree with the hon. member at all. I hope that I did not understand him incorrectly, but I think that his standpoint in respect of this important matter will eventually lead to a situation of promiscuity and agamy.</p>

<p>As far as clause 3 is concerned, where we are dealing with consolidation, I just want to say that problems could perhaps arise, but the main point here is that we want to consolidate the Bantu areas.</p>

<p>As far as clause 9 is concerned, the insertion of the expression &#x201C;culture&#x201D;, we realize the need for having stability in the living pattern of these people as well, and that one must also accept the totality of the life of that person. What is important here is that this change is also being effected at the request of the Bantu themselves, and this proves that there is continual dialogue with the Bantu leaders by this side of the House.</p>

<p>I want to dwell in particular on clause 12, i.e. the establishments, with the concurrence of the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, of public holidays in substitution for public holidays established by or in terms of the Public Holidays Act. I want to say that I have concentrated particularly on this clause, for this is also of fundamental importance to me in reviewing the way in which the National Party and the United Party deal with the Bantu peoples. I then went back and read up as thoroughly as I could the debates relating to Act No. 5 of 1952, particularly in order to ascertain what the arguments of the United Party were at the time. Now, it is not clear to me today precisely what the standpoint in regard to principle of the United Party in regard to this matter is. I could not get it clear in my mind whether the hon. member for Transkei is satisfied that the Bantu peoples, at their request, with the concurrence of the Minister, should nevertheless be given certain public holidays. I do not know whether he mentioned this, but it is not clear to me. But I want to say that on the basis of their solution to the population problems of South Africa they may not vote for this clause. In the light of your treatment of the population problems of South Africa you may in principle not vote for this clause because you do not see South Africa as the National Party sees it.</p>

<p>We also see it as it is, and realize that it consists of different ethnic groups. You see it differently, as one integrated ethnic community with certain small communities within it. In other words, the United Party may not in principle vote for clause 12, for implied in this clause is that the National Party is establishing through it all the conditions and all the ideals and all the emotion a nation associates with a holiday, and is saying to the various Bantu nations: We will help you in your growth to nationhood and independence and we are already giving you these things which bind a nation together emotionally, which make it powerful and strong and which gives it certain specific ideals on which its members may base their lives. Therefore I hope that the next speaker is going to adopt a very clear standpoint on this matter. I think that this clause in particular is true to the standpoint of the National Party, and I hope that the various Bantu nations will consider this, that they will consider their own national history and that they will make the best of this for their nation as it at present and also for the future.</p>

<p>It was interesting to hear the hon. member for Rissik talking

 about a permissive society because as far as we on this side of the House can divine what will probably happen if clause 2 as it stands becomes law&#x003F; It seems that the position will be that more and more African people in Natal and in the Transvaal will not be able to marry. Now we all know what the alternative to that will be. They will simply live with each other, and as my colleague the hon. member for Transkei said earlier, what we will have will be more and more illegitimate births arising from more and more associations out of wedlock. That hon. member was quite right when he said that nothing illustrated the divergence of opinion between that side of the House and this side more than perhaps this particular clause 2. Sir, we are above all realists and we realize that quite apart from the tribal societies we have in this country we have firmly established urban Black communities. The fact that these communities have not been wrought into cohesive political units does not mean that <span class="col_2639-2640" refersTo="page_1337"/>they do not exist. What we have to deal with here are people, perhaps third or fourth generation Bantu people, who are as much urban dwellers as that hon. member and I, and perhaps they could be even more urbanized than some of us. The hon. member for Rissik completely misunderstood the argument of the hon. member for Transkei. It seems either as though he was not following him, or that he prepared his speech in advance, so that he was not prepared to deal with any of the arguments advanced by the hon. member for Transkei. Instead he came with something out of the White Paper which said that this clause was introduced at the specific request of Bantu leaders. I ask immediately: which Bantu leaders&#x003F; He means tribal leaders, for I am quite sure that he will not be able to bring me one single urban Bantu leader, a man of authority, who will be prepared to subscribe to this clause. Furthermore, he went on to suggest that because the Government was prepared to come with legislation such as this, the Government was far more appreciative of Bantu rights and customs than we on this side of the House are. Sir, this again is not so. We must realize that we are dealing with two completely different societies. The one is a rural, tribal society and the other is a completely urbanized society. If the hon. member were to listen instead of talking to his verkrampte colleague, he might even learn something about it.</p>

<p>In this matter we are the realists. We realize above all that one

 cannot force customs on people, particularly old customs on a modern society, by way of laws. Now we all appreciate what the hon. the Deputy Minister had in mind when he came forward with this legislation in this form, but I am quite certain that by the time we have finished with this debate he will want to amend clause 2 at least because it is patent nonsense the way it is drafted. I hope the hon. the Minister himself will come into this debate and tell us why they came to approach things from this particular point of view. Clause 2 as it stands simply says that a marriage officer shall not in the province of Natal or the Transvaal solemnize a marriage to which a Bantu female who is of age is a party, unless the father or legal guardian, in terms of Bantu law and custom, has granted written consent to such marriage and such consent has been furnished to the marriage officer. The hon. member for Rissik has told us that this clause was introduced at the instance of the Bantu Tribal Authorities in Natal and the Transvaal. I want to ask him, and I want to ask the hon. the Minister right away, why does he then seek to apply it to Bantu people who do not come from the Transvaal and Natal but who just happen to be residing in those provinces&#x003F; This is nonsense. It could apply to a Xhosa, in other words somebody from the Transkei or Ciskei, just because she happens to be living in Natal or the Transvaal. The Transkeian Government, for instance, has not asked for any such legislation. That Government, indeed, is impowered to pass a law such as this anyway. We all know that in the Transkei there cannot be a customary union without this type of consent. Therefore why seek to try to impose this on Transkei women in places such as the Transvaal&#x003F; What makes even greater nonsense of it is the fact that this law can be evaded so easily. At the moment an adult African women living in a place such as Vereeniging would not be able to marry without the consent of her parent or guardian. What does she have to do to remedy this situation&#x003F; All she has to do is to go across the Transvaal border, to Parys in the Orange Free State, and she can get married there with impunity. The law then does not apply to her. Then we are going to have the ridiculous situation that a place such as Parys could become the Black Gretna Green of South Africa.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>We would much rather see that it is made easier for African or Bantu adult people to marry, not hander. If we made it harder for them they will live together with the attendant evil consequences. Our approach is to do the exact opposite. I trust that we will therefore not hear any more pontificating from members on that side of the House about the permissive society because this clause can lead straight to that. The hon. member for Rissik also had quite a lot to say about the public holiday provisions of the Bill. He did not read the Bill carefully because <span class="col_2641-2642" refersTo="page_1338"/>he only referred to the public holidays mentioned in clause 12. These are public holidays for Bantu homelands within the Republic other than the Transkei, which is dealt with separately. As we all know that question is before a Select Committee at the moment. Had he looked at the Bill a little more carefully he would have seen that a similar provision appears in clause 9, where it is included among the powers to be given to the Legislative Councils of South-West Africa. If one takes the embryo Bantustans of South Africa&#x2014;there are eight of them&#x2014;and the areas of South-West Africa which are capable of receiving local government or legislative councils&#x2014;there are six of them&#x2014;you will see that this makes a total of 14. These states will be able to have public holidays of their own. He asked us what our attitude in regard to this is going to be. But before he asks us for our attitude, and he will hear it later on, I should like to ask him, or the hon. the Deputy Minister, to tell us when he replies, what this all means. If one looks at clause 12 one sees that it provides for the establishment, with the concurrence of the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, of public holidays in substitution for public holidays established by or in terms of the Public Holidays Act of 1952. Does that mean that these homeland governments will be able to establish holidays in place of say, Christmas Day&#x003F; After all, that is a public holiday of ours. Would it be possible for them to abolish Republic Day in the Bantu homelands and establish their own holidays&#x003F; Could they, say, establish Chaka Day in substitution for our Day of the Covenant&#x003F; I see the hon. member nods his head. I take it that by that he means that this is possible; it means yes. The hon. the Minister is not saying anything. We have something like 12 public holidays in the Republic. This legislation seems to be aimed at making it possible for 14 Bantu homelands to have their own public holidays. Well, a bit of mental arithmetic shows us that we can in theory have something like 168 different public holidays throughout what we know now as the Republic and South-West Africa.</p>

<p>No, we do not legislate for the whole of Africa. We legislate for

 South Africa and South-West Africa. That is our job. That hon.

 gentleman knows it as well as I do. Of course, this is taking things to a ridiculous extent, But I want to say to him in all seriousness that if it is true that these Bantu homelands will have the power to have their own private public holidays, each homeland choosing its national days, there can be serious disruption in this country. It probably would not matter all that much if Kavango in the far north of South-West Africa had a few public holidays of its own, but I can quite see that if the Transkei, for instance, or Tswanaland were to have a half-a-dozen public holidays separate from ours, the citizens of these places would not be all that keen on coming to work at their places of employment in the Republic. I am quite sure that if they had a major day such as Chaka Day, they would want to celebrate it where ever they were, even though legally they were not entitled to celebrate it. By much the same token, what would be the position in such places as the Transkei&#x003F; Supposing the Transkei were to opt for three or four public holidays of its own and in the course of this abolish, say, the Day of the Covenant and Republic Day. We all know that the Transkei relies very heavily on the White people there to run its affairs. Without them, the Transkei, it is common cause, would come to a halt. Are the White people of the Transkei then going to be deprived of their Day of the Covenant and Republic Day, or do they have to take the local holidays as well as the Republic holidays&#x003F; Before the hon. member for Rissik gets a reply from us, we want some details from that side of the House. I trust we shall get them when the hon. the Deputy Minister replies to the Second Reading debate It is very necessary before we go over to the Committee State.</p>

<speech by="#oliver">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>That hon. member need not worry about that. We have a long row to

 hoe; we have the Committee Stage ahead of us, we have the Third Reading Stage, and the Bill has to go to the Senate. Therefore, the hon. member need not fear. We have plenty of opportunities to answer.</p>

<p>I now want to turn to clause 9 of the Bill, which seeks to add certain provisions to the schedule to the Development of self-government for Native Nations in <span class="col_2643-2644" refersTo="page_1339"/>South-West Africa Act of 1968. As you will recall, we opposed this Act when it came before the House, because we believed that this Government was taking the wrong course in bringing forward this particular type of legislation. Just by way of review, we believed we could not subscribe to the radical approach adopted by the hon. the Minister in developing the native nations of South-West Africa on these lines. We believed in a far more conservative approach and still believe in it. As my colleague from the Transkei has said, this does not mean that we do not believe in the speedy advancement&#x2014;as speedy as possible&#x2014;of the Bantu towards local self-government.</p>

<p>While we do not propose to oppose this second reading, I think we should pause for a moment at some of the provisions of clause 9. As we know, there are two legislative councils in operation in South-West Africa at the moment, namely those of Ovamboland or Owambo, as the new name will be in terms of this legislation, and Okavangoland, or Kavango, as it will be called. Then we are going to see a legislative council established in the Eastern Caprivi. Apart from that, the Development of Self-government for Native Nations in South-West Africa Act provides that legislative councils can be formed in &#x201C;Damaraland, Hereroland, Kaokoland and such other land or areas as may be recognized by the State President by proclamation.&#x201D; It is difficult to debate the situation as it applies in Owambo. We all know that it is fairly remote. It is several years since I was there. Likewise the little we know about the Eastern Caprivi suggests that it is a fairly backward country and that considerable thought should be given to it before it is granted anything approaching the sort of powers envisaged in this Bill.</p>

<p>We do know quite a lot about the position in Kavango. It is a comparatively small territory of only 54 000 people and, when one looks at the type of powers this Bill seeks to grant to its legislative council, one wonders whether this Government is really going about things in the proper way. Kavango is, after all, a a poor country, which has very little agriculture, and almost no industry, and which is very backward in almost all respects. At the moment there are only five matriculants in this territory. Many of us on this side of the House, and especially those who have recently been to Kavango, have grave doubts &#x2014;from what we saw anyway&#x2014;whether the people of Kavango are skilled and sophisticated enough even to run a school committee properly, let alone a responsible government. We doubt whether they have the talent for it. We know that they are a backward people. They are river-dwellers who, indeed, do not even seem to be terribly anxious to take more and more powers. Until now these people have been content to live fairly quiet lives. They haven&#x2019;t thought to aim at any sort of sophisticated government and I believe we should be very careful in the sort of thing that we should foist on them politically. Obviously this political situation has to change and the question that we must ask ourselves, particularly now that this type of legislation is before us, is what sort of change should be brought about and how it should be brought about. Our approach has always been to start at the beginning and to try to build up a sound economy or an economy as sound as can be managed, to build up agriculture and to build up industry to the optimum extent. We also feel that an infrastructure should be built up and that we should promote education. We are not suggesting that these things should be done to the exclusion of political advancement. What we do believe is that they and political advancement can run parallel and in sympathy with one another. Where we differ from the Nationalist Government is that we see the Nationalist Government as aiming to create a political superstructure above what is in many cases, and especially in the case of Kavango, an almost complete economic vacuum. This Bill is simply perpetuating the process. It is thickening the political superstructure while the vacuum remains. That is how we see the situation and we believe that in taking this line this Government is simply going further and further away from reality. I want to stress once again, as the hon. member for Transkei has done, that we are clearly not against political development, but that we believe in doing it in stages.</p>

<p>There is one safeguard that remains, as far as the Bantu areas of South-West Africa are concerned, i.e. that the State President still retains fairly wide powers as far as legislation by the legislative councils is concerned. We trust that the hon. the Minister will keep a very close watch on the situation. All laws must have the assent of the State President, who also has powers <span class="col_2645-2646" refersTo="page_1340"/>to repeal or amend them by proclamation. I think it would be fair for us to suggest from this side of the House that for a long time to come, certainly for the foreseeable future, in places such as Kavango it will not be possible to let these people go it alone.</p>

<p>In dealing with South-West Africa and with the matters mentioned in clause 9, one must bear in mind that these powers are taken by the legislative councils. But that is not all. It is possible in terms of the Development of Self-government for Native Nations in South-West Africa Act, for these powers to be given by proclamation to tribal authorities and to regional authorities. With the knowledge that we do have of the situation in South-West Africa and the comparative backwardness of so many of the people there, I would like to suggest to the Government that they be extremely cautious about conveying any of these powers to such bodies. Of course we are not talking of all the powers. If one looks at item 20K of the Schedule to the Act, inserted by clause 9 (e) of the Bill, one sees that it deals with a silly thing like the registration and control of dogs. It is obvious that anybody would be able to see to that.</p>

<p>But, Sir, what else is contained in this clause&#x003F; We have such things as fish and game preservation, the conservation of flora and fauna, control over intoxicating liquor, the appointment, powers, duties and functions of justices of the peace and commissioners of oath, the protection of life, persons and property, land settlement, registration of deeds and surveys. There are such things as the regulation and control of road traffic, including the licensing and control of vehicles and the drivers of vehicles. One pauses immediately, and this is something we shall want to know in the Committee Stage, on the question whether licences granted to motor vehicle drivers in places such as Kavango in terms of Kavango Legislative Council laws, will be recognized elsewhere in South-West Africa or, indeed, in the Republic. Will drivers of motor vehicles registered under Kavango laws and according to their local standards, such as they are, be welcome to drive with those licences in Cape Town on our freeways, or in the traffic of Johannesburg&#x003F; These matters we shall want to know. I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister is prepared to give us replies to these points now. In this territory&#x2014;I stress again&#x2014;they have no more than five matriculants to handle any aspect of government. If the Government is going to proceed with giving more and more powers to the legislative councils, what we shall see is that, in effect, more and more power will be given to the officials of the Department of Bantu Administration. They obviously will have to act in the vacuum that has been created through the backwardness of the local people. Surely, it would be much better for all of us if the Government were to go just a little more slowly in these matters instead of thickening the political superstructure about which I spoke earlier. Instead of concentrating on purely political matters, would it not be better if the Government were to try to tackle first things first and not try to put political clothes on economic skeletons&#x003F;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in regard to the arguments put forward by the Opposition on this matter, I want to emphasize once again that we on this side and they on that side approach the question of the development of the Bantu in Bantu areas from completely different angles. Today, contradictions once again emerged on the opposite side. I want to emphasize that it is very clear to me that the Opposition does not argue in fundamental terms on this matter. The only person who thinks and argues in fundamental terms on the rights of the Bantu, the political rights in particular but also the economic rights, is the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, who unfortunately is not present here today. He is the only member I have come across on that side who thinks in fundamental terms and views this problem of the rights of the Bantu in Southern Africa and in the Republic of South Africa in its true perspective.</p>

<p>We have been warned by the hon. member for Kensington that we should not proceed too rapidly, but not an hour ago the hon. member for Transkei told us that they, the United Party, are in favour of development taking place more rapidly. He did not, like that hon. member, refer specifically to the Kavangos, but it is very clear that those hon. members are not unanimous in regard to what they want in the various areas. If one wanted to go further and to argue about this matter of granting people rights, then it is of course clear to us all, and it is a known fact, that the United Party does not have a clear <span class="col_2647-2648" refersTo="page_1341"/>policy on this matter. The hon. member for Kensington said that the Kavangos can scarcely manage a school committee. One can understand why hon. members on that side are not clear in regard to this matter. They are not honest in their approach that we are dealing here with people who have certain basic rights and that we may not withhold certain basic rights from them. Opposed to this we have the honesty of this side of the House that says that everything we demand for ourselves we do not want to begrudge to others.</p>

<p>Our standpoint can withstand the test on moral and all other grounds. Hon. members on that side say that the Bantu will be represented here by eight persons for an interim period: I do not know how long this interim period will last; it was only the other day that it became an interim period; at first it was permanently, as we understood. In any case, it is very clear that what are involved here are basic approaches. I can just give hon. members on that side the assurance, without going into this matter in too great detail, that we are engaged in leading and supporting each one of these nations. These people are being guided by the Minister as the responsible Minister and by the officials who are there to overcome the problems of the modern state in all its facets and the problems of administration. If one is not going to do this, in what way would these people receive what was rightly theirs&#x003F; The hon. member referred to the Kavangos; he said it was a small place, but then he did not mention its extent, he mentioned the size of its population. In what way, under a United Party government, will the Ovambos or the Kavangos be given a say, no matter how elementary, in the government of the country&#x003F; The hon. member referred to item 20K of clause 9 (e), which deals with the registration and control of dogs. In other words, he implied that the Ovambos and the Okavangos might be able to do that, but that they could scarcely maintain and manage a school committee. I want to make it very clear that each one of these nations is being given officials who support them. Their council members, who are elected and established as leaders, are supported, guided and instructed by these officials in this democratic system. If one does not confront them with these problems as far as their own affairs are concerned, then I feel that we are going to create frustration and dissatisfaction, and then we could not justify ourselves either in the eyes of the world or in our own eyes.</p>

<p>So much for the more general issues. Let us now come to the specific points in regard to which there were complaints. There the same kind of thing emerges. Hon. members on that side discussed the institution of marriage and asked why an urban Bantu woman who has become detribalized should obtain the consent of her parent or guardian in order to be married and why we do not allow her, in this modern, enlightened world, to fend for herself&#x003F; Do hon. members not realize that they are undermining discipline by allowing all these liberties&#x003F; The reason why the clause is in the Bill was that it is at present part of the Act. We are not going to do away with it without consultation. It was not in fact applicable in the Free State and Cape areas, but it was written into an Act late in the previous century. We were not simply going to change the existing position until such time as we had consulted these people. There was proper consultation in Natal and also throughout the Transvaal.</p>

They feel that that clause should be retained; that it should not fall away. We are dealing here with Bantu affairs, with Bantu customs. As they develop further politically, is it not right that they should themselves decide about their future&#x003F; Why should there be a different Act for them in a White area than in their own area&#x003F; Why should we undermine their morals and customs, while their leaders attach great value to these&#x003F; We as Whites must not imagine that everything which may appear to be in our interests, is also in the interests of the Bantu.</p>

<p>Yes, the Act will be applicable in the Transvaal. It will therefore be applicable to Transkei citizens there. If they want to come to the Transkei and get married there, then they are not subject to it, but the vast majority of the Bantu peoples in the Transvaal&#x2014; the Tswanas, the North Sothos and the Shangaans, etc.&#x2014;would very much like to have this clause in the Act, and that is why it has been included again in the Bill. I am not going to argue the merits of the case with those hon. members on the opposite side. There could be 110 different opinions about this. The fact of the matter is that it is a Bantu institution and tradition which they want respected; they want to retain it in this Act; they do not want it to fall away. I think it is for them to decide on this.</p>

<p>Sir, these Bantu councils also have representation now in the different Authorities. When these enquiries were made, they did not yet have representation there. What is of importance to us is that the leaders of the Bantu nations adopted this resolution. It was stated comprehensively to them, and they decided accordingly. I think it is fair to accept that these people can decide for themselves, as they develop further, whether or not they want to proceed with this.</p>

<p>If they go there then they are subject to the law which is applicable there.

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, we did not consult the urban Bantu. We consulted the Executive Councils of the various areas; we consulted the Territorial Authorities; they held tribal meetings at which an opinion in this regard was expressed. These are the people who have the political say there and who are the elected leaders of the Bantu. They also liaise with their people in the urban Bantu areas. If the people in the urban Bantu areas who have a say through their elected leaders there, want to change the Act, then they can come to us and say that they want the Act changed. But we must leave it to them to say that they would like to have it changed; we must not force anything upon them which they do not want.</p>

<p>Sir, I think I have to content myself with that. It is no use trying to argue the merits of this Bantu custom, whether it is right or wrong. As far as they are concerned, it is right; it is their custom and that is why they have the say as far as this matter is concerned.</p>

<p>There were also questions in regard to the word Owambo, which is spelt with a &#x201C;w&#x201D;. I just want to mention to you that Owambo with a &#x201C;w&#x201D; according to the spelling of the Ovambos refers to the country, and Ovambo with a &#x201C;v&#x201D; refers to the person as an Ovambo. Therefore an inhabitant of Owambo with a &#x201C;w&#x201D; is Ovambo with a &#x201C;v&#x201D;. I hope it is clear now. That is actually how those people pronounce it.</p>

<p>Other matters mentioned were <i>inter alia</i> the transfer of prisoners. I just want to say that provision is being made here for that because it may happen that there are Transkeian citizens in prison in the Republic, and a prison in the Transkei is for example not fully occupied. Then provision could perhaps be made for them to be transferred. But you also have other cases, and that is why the clause is so flexible. There may be a prisoner in a Transkeian prison who needs certain medical services and whom we want to transfer because he needs specialized medical services. Because this may be necessary, provision is being made for prisoners to be transferred. But I cannot see it happening very easily that a non-Transkeian citizen will be transferred to a prison in the Transkei. Those prisons are there principally for Transkeian <span class="col_2651-2652" refersTo="page_1343"/>citizens. I think that answers the questions put in regard to this matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Transkei asked whether, if a person had served his term of imprisonment in a prison, and he had committed an offence in Johannesburg, whether we would release him in the Transkei. As the hon. member knows, prisoners are usually released at the place where they were arrested. I think that if it is practicable this type of thing will be taken into consideration. If a prisoner in the Transkei, for example, has to be released there, although he was arrested in Johannesburg, and he prefers to stay there, this will probably be allowed.</p>

<p>As far as transportation is concerned, i.e. to transfer the powers under the Motor carrier Transportation Act of 1941 to the Transkeian Government, a question was asked whether a person from outside may now drive through the Transkei without interference. I just want to say that unfortunately it is the case that a permit will have to be issued. A person transporting furniture from Durban to Umtata will have to obtain a permit to cross the Transkeian border. The reverse is also true for people coming from the Transkei. There will therefore be a degree of administrative work attached to this, but that is unavoidable. The position is that when crossing the borders special permits will have to be obtained on both sides.</p>

<p>Clause 12 deals with the question of holidays, and concerning this the hon. member for Kensington indulged in considerable speculation. He worked out that there could possibly be 168 holidays within the Republic of South Africa and he said that it would cause chaos. This may theoretically be true, but basically it is important, as far as we are concerned, that each one of these Bantu nations, each with its own tradition and history, will have the right to establish their own holidays which have value to them, and that they are not being prescribed to by the Whites as to what holidays they should have. This will happen in consultation with the Minister. It is obvious that such important holidays as Christmas and Good Friday will not easily be replaced. We do not expect these people to do anything like that, but if they want to celebrate their own heroes day, for example like Chaka Day, then why not&#x003F; Must we now say to those people that they may not honour their heroes, only we can do that&#x003F; It is obvious that we are going all the way with these people and we are not going to say to them they must simply fall into line with us. The practical application is that Zululand holidays are applicable there, and the Transkeian holidays are applicable in the Transkei and the Ovambos in Owambo. If they leave those places they are in the Republic of South Africa and then the Republican holidays will apply to them. In South Africa today we have Italians, French, Germans and Orientals, and there are quite a number of them, and each have their own holidays. Surely it is obvious that each cannot be given his own holiday. There are also religious holidays, and each could not want to insist on his own holiday.</p>

<p>Since the hon. the Deputy Minister has now explained to us in regard to the clause on marriage that everything which applies in the Bantu areas should also apply in the urban areas, will the holidays which apply in the homelands also apply in the urban areas with regard to each separate ethnic group.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is a foolish question. It is very clear that these holidays are confined to the borders of every area. [Interjections.] The Marriage Act is an old White Act. I shall not go into this matter any further, because it is really not necessary.</p>

<p>Then, the hon. member for Kensington is very concerned about a person who received a driver&#x2019;s licence in a Bantu area being let loose on the roads. I can only tell him once again that the standards of those people are completely in line with the standards and the requirements laid down by the Republic Government and the Provincial Administrations. We have the case in the Transkei where those people lay down their standards in accordance with those of the Cape Provincial Administration. The idea is not that these people can take out licences at random. We have proper control through the officials who are giving guidance. I can give the hon. gentleman the assurance that if he cannot get a licence here, he need not hope to get one in Owambo. Therefore there are no prospects for him to that side either. Where we are in all honesty trying to give these people certain rights, the hon. member may think that we are giving these people rights too rapidly, but in practice the process is actually rather slow. White <span class="col_2653-2654" refersTo="page_1344"/>officials are busy training people so that they can do these things for themselves as quickly as possible. Standards are, however, being laid down and these are in accordance with the standards which apply in the Republic. I do not think the hon. gentlemen need concern themselves unnecessarily about that.</p>

<p>I think I have with this replied to all the questions and problems of the hon. members. They say that they will go into these matters further during the Committee Stage, and this is therefore all I wish to say at this juncture.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Just before saying a few words about the contents of this Bill, I want to point out that the more important of the amendments we wish to effect to the South-West Africa Ordinance in question, are consequent upon representations made by the Association of Mining Companies of South-West Africa, which in South-West Africa plays a role similar to that of the Chamber of Mines of South Africa. In this regard the practical implementation of the present ordinance, which was passed as recently as 1968, has brought to light certain shortcomings which have a hampering effect on mining development in South-West Africa and which must be removed as a matter of urgent importance. Since one always finds conflicting interests emerging in the mining industry, i.e. those of the prospector or mine-owner on the one hand and those of the land owner on the other hand, we have, as far as this Bill is concerned, not only consulted with the Association of Mining Companies of South-West Africa, to which I referred a moment ago, but also made the original draft Bill available to the South-West African Agricultural Union and discussed it with them. The result was that the Bill was suitably polished, and that we, by pursuing a middle course between the conflicting interests, framed somewhat amended provisions which ought to satisfy both mining and farming interests in that territory.</p>

<p>Apart from the few improvements that have to be effected in order to promote mining development in South-West Africa, we also want to avail ourselves of this opportunity to effect a few essential changes and to amend a number of existing provisions which are causing the Department of Mines a great deal of unnecessary work, as well as unnecessary expense. To explain the Bill in somewhat greater detail, I want to start by referring to clause 1, in which important amendments are being effected to two existing definitions in the Ordinance in question. As far as the definition of the concept &#x201C;accessory works&#x201D; is concerned, the position is that prospectors and mine-owners are permitted in terms of the Ordinance, subject to the comprehensive provisions which force them to pay compensation to land owners, to establish on the land to which they hold prospecting or mining rights, &#x201C;accessory works&#x201D; such as mining installations, buildings, etc., which are incidental to their operations. However, the present definition contains a deficiency in that it does not include, for instance, administrative offices which the larger mining enterprises usually have to erect on their mines. All that is being done now, is to extend the scope of the definition in order that all buildings and structures which are required for prospecting and mining purposes, or which are incidental to prospecting and mining operations, may be included in this definition. As I have already indicated, compensation is payable by prospectors and mine-owners when the surface of the land is used <i>inter alia</i> for such purposes.</p>

<p>In regard to the extension of the definition of the concept &#x201C;prospecting&#x201D;, I just want to explain, apart from pointing out that this will bring the definition into line with the corresponding definition in the Republic&#x2019;s Mining Rights Act of 1967, that the proposed change is aimed at facilitating matters for prospectors and the Department if the former merely want to undertake a geophysical survey on land in South-West Africa in order to determine whether such land holds any possibilities which will justify an application for an exclusive prospecting right. Naturally, such a concession will not exempt <span class="col_2655-2656" refersTo="page_1345"/>prospectors from their common-law obligation to make the necessary arrangements with land owners before private land is entered on for the purposes of such surveys.</p>

<p>In order to explain further the motive for the change to the definition in question, I may just mention by way of example that the whole of South-West Africa has been closed for public prospecting for source material&#x2014;uranium and thorium &#x2014;and that it would almost create an impossible position if mining companies first had to obtain from me as the Minister an exclusive prospecting grant in respect of a particular area prior to their being allowed to carry out geophysical surveys for the specific purpose of prospecting for the radio-active minerals in question. As hon members know, physical prospecting by way of drilling, etc., requires at present considerable capital expenditure, and in order to limit as far as possible the major risk involved in prospecting it has already become a common practice amongst the larger companies first to explore large areas by way of geophysical surveys for the purpose of locating promising anomalies where physical prospecting may then be concentrated. In terms of the amended definition prospectors will first have to obtain some suitable prospecting authorization under the Ordinance when they want to proceed to physical prospecting, such as drilling, etc.</p>

<p>On clause 2 of the Bill there is only one less important matter about which something need to be said, namely the proposed substitution of subsection (7) of section 17 by a new subsection. In this regard I just want to explain that in terms of the subsection concerned it is required that when a particular piece of land is withdrawn from the pegging of claims in favour of an applicant so that he may undertake or continue to undertake prospecting work without being disturbed, particulars in that regard should not only be posted up at the office of the mining commissioner, but also be published in the <i>Gazette.</i> Other sections of the Ordinance require similar action to be taken when prospecting or mining rights are granted. Previously it was a requirement that such particulars had to be published in the <i>Official Gazette</i> of South-West Africa, since numerous South-West Africans were subscribers to this <i>Gazette.</i> The requirement that publication of the particulars shall now be effected in the <i>Gazette,</i> is consequent upon the fact that at the time of the re-arrangement of matters relating to South-West Africa it was found necessary to substitute, in general, words such as &#x201C;Official Gazette&#x201D;, &#x201C;administration&#x201D;, etc., by such expressions as were used in the Republic&#x2019;s legislation. However, very few people in that territory are subscribers to the <i>Gazette</i>&#x2014;we do not take this amiss of them&#x2014;and the numerous notices which, because of the present provisions, have to be published in the <i>Gazette,</i> are causing my department a great deal of unnecessary work and expense. The publication of such notices in the <i>Gazette</i> is not a requirement in the Republic, for people prefer to obtain their information from the local mining commissioner, who, in addition, usually provides guidance concerning the relevant statutory provisions. Therefore we are now dispensing with the requirement of having to publish notices of this particular nature in the <i>Gazette,</i> but we are retaining the requirement that notices with the necessary particulars are still to be posted up at the office of the mining commissioner in Windhoek, which is visited by prospectors and company representatives all the time.</p>

<p>Hon. members will notice that in subsequent clauses of the Bill similar amendments are also being effected to other sections of the Ordinance, and it is for that reason that I deemed it fit to furnish an explanation in regard to the change in question.</p>

<p>To come to the most important changes effected to the Ordinance, I want to deal jointly with clauses 3, 4, 6 and 7. In regard to these clauses it is necessary to bear in mind that, unlike the position obtaining in the Republic, the right to prospect for and the mining and disposal of minerals on all land in South-West Africa&#x2014;excluding land situated in the Native areas&#x2014;are vested in the State, and that private owners of land in that territory are consequently not consulted prior to prospecting or mining rights to their land being granted. That has always been the position. Because of this fundamental principle the mineral legislation of South-West Africa is a great deal less complicated than that which is in force in the Republic, and up to the present this system has been working quite satisfactorily.</p>

<p>The previous South-West Africa Ordinance of 1954 contained wide provisions in order to force prospectors and mine-owners <span class="col_2657-2658" refersTo="page_1346"/>to pay compensation for the use of land, damage, etc., to private land owners, but there were many complaints on the part of such owners because, <i>inter alia,</i> it often happened that the parties concerned had not come to an arrangement on the amount of the compensation due. The present 1968 Ordinance contains similar, wide provisions for the payment of compensation to owners of private land, but owing to the complaints which arose under the previous Ordinance, it was decided to proceed in the present Ordinance to inserting in several sections provisions prohibiting any holder of prospecting or mining rights from carrying out operations on private land, unless he had first entered into a written agreement with the owner of the land in question as to the conditions subject to which such owner shall be compensated in terms of sections 67 of the Ordinance. Provisions to this effect are contained in sections 28, 43, 60 (4) and 61 (6) (f), which are being substituted by clause 3, 4, 6 (c) and 7 (c), respectively.</p>

<p>The provisions in question were well-intentioned, but experience has since shown not only that these provisions are impracticable, but also that&#x2014;if they were to be left intact&#x2014;they would seriously hamper rapid mining development in that territory. The position is simply that, apart from the fact that at times it is simply impossible to trace land owners, cases are often found where land owners do not want to cooperate or deliberately employ so many delaying tactics that operations simply cannot get under way. I am sorry to have to add that companies which cannot afford to postpone their operations for a long time, are sometimes exploited as well, in the sense that in certain cases they find it cheaper to pay excessive compensation to a land owner than to let their paid employees be idle and then to pay interest on their available capital on top of it. I have also been informed that there have been a number of cases where land owners, far from finding a basis for co-operation in consultation with holders of prospecting or mining rights, threatened to go to court for an interdict which would prohibit such operations on their land. Now I want to say at once, and I also want to emphasize it, that both my department and I believe that the fault&#x2014;i.e. when the parties are unable to succeed in coming to terms so that a formal agreement may be entered into&#x2014;should not always be sought with the land owner. From time to time one also finds that there are wilful prospectors and mineral developers, and we must face the fact that prospecting and mining operations may not only create problems for progressive farmers, but also hamper and disrupt their farming operations seriously. In the full realization that continued farming development in South-West Africa is also of cardinal importance to the population of the territory, my department could not see its way clear to complying with the representations made by the mining interests in the territory to the effect that because provision already exists in the Ordinance for the payment of compensation to land owners, all references to written agreements whereby the amount of compensation, etc., is determined, should be deleted from the Ordinance. However, the present state of affairs, which is both unsound and unpracticable, may not be permitted to continue, for all of us know what mining has meant and still means to the development of South Africa; furthermore, we all know that our rapid industrial growth has virtually been built up around our mining industry. What is more, considerable and widely spread mineralization is found in South-West Africa, and it is our duty to see to it that these important assets are exploited in the interests of the various population groups in the territory&#x2014;exploitation which will at the same time stimulate industrial development, farming and the establishment of an infrastructure.</p>

<p>As I indicated at the beginning of my speech, we can achieve these things by pursuing a middle course between these conflicting interests and without pushing aside farming interests in the territory. What we are doing now in the four clauses to which I have already referred, is to substitute the present provisions, which require a written agreement with a land owner before prospecting or mining operations may be undertaken on private land, by provisions which will empower the mining commissioner&#x2014;he is always a senior officer with many years&#x2019; experience&#x2014;also to authorize on private land, by way of a permit, the performance of prospecting or mining operations, as the case may be, if the land owner cannot be traced, or if it is proved to his satisfaction that the holder of the prospecting or mine rights has made real efforts to come to an agreement with the land owner but that, for reasons which the mining commissioner finds to be acceptable &#x2014;such as excessive claims by the land owner&#x2014;the parties could not succeed in <span class="col_2659-2660" refersTo="page_1347"/>coming to terms. However, a land owner will be allowed to put his case before the mining commissioner grants power to such a person, and if the fault obviously lies with the prospective prospector or developer, it will be possible simply to refuse the permit. Furthermore, I want to emphasize here at once that if any of the parties is dissatisfied with the mining commissioner&#x2019;s decision, it will still be possible for him to turn to the board of adjudication, to which reference is made in section 68 of the Ordinance. Hon. members will notice that the latter section is being amended by clause 10 of the Bill, but I shall say something about this matter later on. I believe that members on both sides of the House will agree with me that the amendments I have just mentioned, will still permit justice to be done to land owners without prospecting and mining being hampered or delayed unnecessarily.</p>

<p>Clause 5 of the Bill does not require a lengthy explanation. Here I just want to say that section 50 of the Ordinance empowers the mining commissioner to authorize a prospector or mine-owner to use the surface of specific pieces of land for purposes incidental to prospecting or mining. However, here we have another provision to the effect that in respect of private land the mining commissioner may only grant authorization if a written agreement has already been entered into with the land owner as to the conditions subject to which the owner of the land shall be compensated. Prospecting or mining operations are already in progress here, and extensive changes to the section are not deemed to be essential. All that is being done, is to extend the scope of this section to a certain extent in order that the mining commissioner may also grant the necessary authorization if the board of adjudication, referred to in section 68, has settled a dispute between the parties in so far as the use of the surface of the land for such purposes is concerned. In such a case the parties are bound by the decision of the board, and a written agreement between the parties need not necessarily follow.</p>

<p>I have already dealt with clauses 6 and 7, and next I just want to refer very briefly to clauses 8 and 9. As far as clause 8 is concerned, the position is that section 64 of the Ordinance prohibits the transfer, leasing, etc., of claims or mining areas in the Rehoboth <i>Gebiet</i> or on land set aside for Coloured persons, except with the consent of the Minister of Mines, who may also lay down conditions. For the sake of uniformity the relevant provisions are now being extended to include claims and mining areas in the Bantu areas, so that mere speculators and other undesirable elements may be kept out. The words &#x201C;Native reserve&#x201D; are used because this is a defined term, and in cases where it is deemed necessary or desirable, the Department of Bantu Administration and Development will be consulted prior to decisions being taken on applications for transfer, and so forth. What we have in mind here, is more specifically claims and mining areas which were obtained from my department prior to control&#x2014;as far as base minerals in the Bantu areas are concerned&#x2014;having passed to Bantu Administration in terms of the present Ordinance. That was, I think, in 1968. In this regard I may just mention, for the sake of completeness, that certain more important prospecting rights and mining rights obtained in the Republic from my department may also be transferred only with the consent of the Minister of Mines, even if they are situated on Bantu land.</p>

<p>As regards clause 9, I just want to mention that owing to an oversight in regard to wording, the provisions of section 65 of the Ordinance are inconsistent with what is provided elsewhere in the Ordinance. Apart from this, it also contains redundant provisions. The proposed amendment which, unlike the position at present, also refers to a mine owner, is not of much importance, but it is nevertheless essential in order that the present inconsistency may be removed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I must pause for a while at the next

 clause&#x2014;clause 10&#x2014;for here we propose a number of minor yet important amendments which relate to the other important changes already dealt with. Section 68, which we seek to amend here, contains provisions to the effect that disputes between prospectors or mine owners on the one hand and owners of private land on the other hand, may be submitted for arbitration to the board of adjudication, to which reference is made in that section. The extensive provisions contained in this section, serve a useful purpose, for the decision of the board is binding on the conflicting parties, and the machinery that has been established, ensures that justice will be done to both parties without there <span class="col_2661-2662" refersTo="page_1348"/>being any need for them to embark upon a court case with its attendant high expenses. However, the section has certain deficiencies restricting its effectiveness.</p>

<p>In the first place, subsection (2) of this section provides that the board shall consist of the magistrate of the district, who shall be chairman, and two officers of the Department of Mines appointed by the Minister of Mines. These provisions not only have the effect that, whenever a dispute is submitted, I as the Minister first have to appoint two members to the board which will function in that particular case, but are not quite fair to farmers either, as the board&#x2014;apart from the chairman&#x2014;may only include two persons with specialized knowledge of mining matters, and not a person with specialized knowledge of agricultural matters. Consequently amended provisions are being envisaged, provisions in which it is provided that the board shall in all cases consist of the magistrate of the district&#x2014;who shall be chairman&#x2014;the chief inspector of mines for South-West Africa and the chief extension officer of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services for the area in which the land in question is situated.</p>

<p>A second provision that detracts from the effectiveness of this section, is the one contained in subsection (4), which provides that if the chairman should differ from the other two members of the board with regard to a decision of the board, the board shall be reconstituted and the inquiry begun <i>de novo</i> before all the members of the reconstituted board. This was an unnecessary and, perhaps, also an unjustified provision, but now the deletion of the relevant part of subsection (4) is necessary in any case because of the improvement which is being effected to subsection (2), and it is therefore more specifically a consequent amendment. The same applied to the deletion of subsection (6) of the section.</p>

<p>Finally, it is necessary for me just to refer very briefly to clause 11. As hon. members will recall, the Republic&#x2019;s Mines and Works Act of 1956 was amended in the course of the previous session&#x2014;consequent upon representations made by Iscor&#x2014;to make it possible for a mine or works to be exempted from the prohibition in terms of which females are not allowed to perform shift work as operators, etc., at night. Similar exemption may already be granted under our factory legislation, and exemption may be granted conditionally. Such provisions may also come in handy in South-West Africa at some stage or other, and, in the interests of uniformity, clause 11 of the Bill therefore seeks to effect to the Ordinance amendments similar to those already effected to the Mines and Works Act. J want to assure hon. members that any exemption of this particular nature will also be granted with circumspection in South-West Africa and will also be subject to conditions just as strict as those which I laid down in respect of Iscor.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as we are dealing here with South-West Africa. I have

 gone somewhat out of my way to explain the objects of the Bill as fully as practicable. I think I have said enough to prevent possible misunderstanding, and that I have made it clear that in this Bill our object is more specifically to remove shortcomings restricting the rapid mining development in the territory and complicating the speedy settlement of disputes between conflicting interests.</p>
