<p>Revenue Vote No. 4.&#x2014;&#x201C;Prime Minister&#x201D;, R5 720 000 (contd.):</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I rise to raise three matters with the hon. the Prime Minister, firstly the Agliotti scandal, in the second place, the investigation into the investigator of that scandal, Gen. Bester, and in the third place, the payment by the State of the costs of the hon. the Minister of Community Development. I had occasion to raise this Agliotti scandal during the Second Reading of the Budget debate and the hon. the Minister &#x2026;</p>

<p>The scandal&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, this certainly is a scandal. This is the biggest scandal in the history of this Government. Is that not so&#x003F; [Interjections.] I do not know whether I am wrong; I say: &#x201C;Up to the present this is the biggest scandal.&#x201D; Hon. members must tell me whether I am wrong.</p>

<p>&#x2020; Mr. Chairman, when I raised this matter, the hon. the Prime Minister invited me to raise the matter during his Vote, and I do so now. I accept his invitation. I want to say that this has been the concern of the hon. the Prime Minister ever since this matter first began. He was the person who in fact appointed the commission of inquiry into this matter. This he did as a result, <i>inter alia,</i> of the &#x201C;skinderstories&#x201D; and the gossip which were going around in the Boksburg constituency, on his own evidence. According to the Minister of Police, it was he, the Prime Minister, who set up the Police inquiry about September of 1970. That inquiry is still going on. Now, 18 months later, it is not expected to be concluded until June. In the course of his investigation this ugly scandal has suddenly become &#x201C;a delicate matter&#x201D;, in fact a &#x201C;very delicate matter&#x201D;, according to the hon. the Minister of Police. Perhaps the hon. the Prime Minister can tell us why it has become delicate.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_police">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POLICE</person>:</from>

<p>It is not the Agliotti affair, but the investigation which is delicate.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Oh, the investigation has become delicate&#x003F; Why has it become delicate&#x003F; It is &#x201C;very delicate&#x201D; according to the hon. the Minister, and &#x201C;delicate&#x201D; according to the Commissioner of Police. Now we are told that the investigations are not going to be completed until June of this year. The hon. the Minister cannot tell us; perhaps the hon. the Prime Minister can tell us which Minister is in fact in charge of the Agliotti inquiry. Sir, I think we are entitled to ask this question, not only because the hon. the Prime Minister first initiated the Police inquiry&#x2014;he ordered it, according to the Minister of Police&#x2014;but also because of the strange events which have occurred since then.</p>

<p>The strangest event is that event where Gen. Danie Bester, the Deputy Commissioner of Police and the investigator into the Agliotti matter, was investigated behind his back by the Police in respect of a statement he is alleged to have made, that there was interference by the Government in his investigation into the Agliotti scandal. The Commissioner himself conducted this investigation. He even asked a witness for a sworn statement himself. One can only believe that this investigation into Gen. Bester took place either as a result of a sworn statement being placed before him, or on the instruction of someone else. The only people, as I have said before, who could have done this can be the hon. the Prime Minister or the Minister of Police. It was not the Minister of Police; that much we know, because he knew nothing about it.</p>

<p>There are three very unusual things which strike one immediately. In the first place, when this is investigated, Gen. Bester is not told; in the second place, the Commissioner wanted sworn statements. This was not a departmental inquiry; there is provision for that. It was also not a criminal charge. As I have said, even a common thief is confronted with a charge, and the matter is then investigated. The most unusual thing of all is that that Minister of Police did not know that this was going on. It was as a result of my raising this matter that the hon. the Prime Minister invited me to raise it on his Vote. The question I put to him then he did not answer. I now ask him again: Would it be possible that he, as the Minister of Police, <span class="col_5227-5228" refersTo="page_1077"/>would not know that an investigation was being conducted into the Deputy Commissioner of Police by the Commissioner himself, requiring sworn statements about what he said&#x003F; The only explanation is either that this Minister of Police should be sacked for allowing this to happen without his knowing anything about it, or that he did not know anything about it because the hon. the Prime Minister himself ordered that inquiry.</p>

<p>Why are you so excited&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I am not excited. What I want to say is this: When we want to talk about this matter and when we raise the matter in the Budget debate, what happens&#x003F; The hon. the Minister of Police does not answer; he puts in the hon. member for Prinshof. Why the hon. member for Prinshof&#x003F; It seems that the hon. member for Prinshof knows a lot more about this than the hon. the Minister of Police, because in the <i>Transvaler</i> on Monday, 20th March, this year, a report appeared of a speech made by the hon. member for Prinshof. He was asked a question about the Agliotti matter, and he said it was a &#x201C;pluimpie in die hoed&#x201D;, a feather in the cap of the Government, and so on. This sort of thing, he said, happens in other countries and it is not always followed up; here it is being followed up. Then he said the most significant thing&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Toe die Eerste Minister, mnr. Vorster, verneem het van die moontlike oneerlikheid met die aankoop van die grond van Agliotti, het hy onmiddellik &#x2019;n kommissie van ondersoek gelas.</block>

<p>Then he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Eintlik was hy te vinnig, want anders kon meer getuienis dalk beskikbaar gewees het vir die kommissie wat nou die saak ondersoek.</block>

<p>That must mean the &#x201C;polisie-ondersoek&#x201D;. What does that mean, and what does he know about it&#x003F; And why should this &#x201C;eintlik&#x201D; have happened&#x003F; Surely that is enough to make people wonder. Sir, what is going on in this Agliotti case&#x003F; Having regard to the nature of the allegation which was being investigated, can one wonder that <i>Hoofstad</i> in a leading article on Friday, 25th February, 1972, after the Brakpan disaster for the Nationalist Party, wrote what they wrote&#x003F; I have not got time to read it all out, but I will pass it along to the hon. the Prime Minister if he wants it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister of Transport has got it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Apparently the hon. the Minister of Transport has got it. What they say, Sir, is that there are people within the Nationalist Party who are helping themselves to grow bigger and richer through their positions. Surely, Sir, that is going to be investigated, too. But do not say that these are &#x201C;skinderstories van die Sappe&#x201D;. This appeared in <i>Hoofstad.</i></p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Prime Minister what it is that causes this investigation to be so delayed. Surely it is very important, on the Prime Minister&#x2019;s own statement of his attitude towards this sort of thing. Is this no more important than whether Albert Hertzog said that R50 million was going to be spent on BOSS&#x003F; Is it not more important to the country and the integrity of the Government&#x003F; But what does he do about this&#x003F; Nothing, Sir, It has been going on for 18 months and he is going to allow it to go on until June. Why until June&#x003F; Why cannot this matter be brought to a head&#x003F; What is involved; who is involved&#x003F;</p>

<p>Sir, I raise those questions in regard to these two matters because they warrant answers which we have not had, and I believe that the hon. the Prime Minister is the only one who can give us the answers.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of the payment by the State of the costs of the hon. the Minister of Community Development. This was obviously a Cabinet decision. According to the hon. the Minister of Justice, these costs were paid by the State because the Cabinet accepts that when the Minister of Community Development uttered this defamation he acted in the course and scope of his position as a Cabinet Minister, and on that basis the State decided to pay his costs. But that is not the case of the hon. the Minister of Community Development. In the offending article which gave rise to this action the hon. the Minister of Community Development said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is no war between these two bodies.</block>

<p>Meaning the Government and the City Council of Pretoria&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_5229-5230" refersTo="page_1078"/>It is between him and me. I will not hide behind the Government. He can hide behind whoever he wants.</block>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. REINECKE</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, if the hon. member for Durban North stands up we see an Agliotti standing up. We are tired of Agliotti and of him. The hon. the Minister of Police gave an explanation of the matter here, and the hon. member and I both listened to it. I was satisfied by the hon. the Minister, and I think that hon. member is again just sinking to the usual level the Opposition sinks to when they cannot get any further with their case.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to come back briefly to the speech of the hon. member for Hillbrow yesterday afternoon. I want to point out that the idiom and the content of the speech of the hon. member for Hillbrow was as close to that of the Progressive Party as it could possibly get. What the hon. member had to say about the &#x201C;wage gap&#x201D;, about the gap between the pensions of Whites and non-Whites, appears almost verbatim in a letter I received this week from the Young Progressives here in Cape Town. There is virtually no difference between what he said here last night and what the Young Progressives said.</p>

<p>What does the Minister of the Interior say&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#reinecke">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. REINECKE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Hillbrow is the last person to accuse the State, as he did last night in his speech, of playing an ever greater part in the commercial sector. As an intimate authority on the Anglo-American Corporation, such as that hon. member is, he ought to know better than to say the kind of thing he said yesterday afternoon in his speech here. Sir, he speaks of growing socialism. Surely that is what he and his party are continually asking for&#x2014;a welfare state. He is the last hon. member to speak about that. The hon. member speaks in disparaging terms of control boards. Sir, what control boards did he mean&#x003F; What was the hon. member referring to so scornfully&#x003F; A characteristic of the hon. member&#x2019;s speech yesterday was that it was simply a lumping together of a lot of generalizations, a kind of emotional defence. Sir, this is not the hon. member we know. We ask ourselves whether the slaps he got from the <i>Sunday Times</i> about his &#x201C;White backlash&#x201D; speech so unnerved him that he has not yet regained his self-confidence. As former crown prince of the United Party and former political prophet, the fact that his own newspaper and his own party&#x2014;both his parties&#x2014;discredited him must have been a bitter pill for him to swallow. I really advise the hon. member for Hillbrow to stand up and walk across to his rightful bench&#x2014;the seat next to the hon. member for Houghton. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I should very much like to come back to the Vote under discussion and to a matter very dear to my heart, i.e. State security and our Prime Minister&#x2019;s role in it. Sir, when the circle round the old Transvaal Republic was closed by Rhodes and Jameson, the spiritual forefathers of the United Party and of the hon. member for Houghton&#x2019;s party &#x2026; [Interjections.] &#x2026;</p>

<p>President Paul Kruger did not come along with lamentations, dirges and federation plans. He saw through them. He said at the time that the foreigners did not want the right to vote, they wanted his country. When he saw his country was being threatened, what did President Paul Kruger do&#x003F; In good time he prepared his country militarily to defend it against whatever odds; he steeled his people to resist. Sir, what is the position in this country today&#x003F; The communists&#x2014;the yellow communists from the East and the red communists from the Kremlin&#x2014;have their eyes mercilessly fixed on Africa, particularly Southern Africa, and specifically South Africa. What is more, the communists are not concerned about any Whites in this country, whether United Party, National Party of Progressive Party men, whether English, Afrikaans or German-speaking. The communists are not concerned about integration or non-integration. So, Sir, they want this country, its riches and its open spaces for their masses which they cannot accommodate. International Communism wants this strategic sea-route around the Cape, because in the coming conflict between themselves and the West control of this strategic sea-route is going to be of decisive importance. For what other reason do we ever so often have reports of Russian submarines and warships sailing here round the Cape of Good Hope&#x003F; That, Sir, is the harsh reality facing the Republic, and the United Party men are too blind to see that they are continually playing into the hands of those powers. [Interjections.] Sir, my Afrikaner people, who have now for a long time walked the path of prosperity, who have <span class="col_5231-5232" refersTo="page_1079"/>begun to yield before the economic onslaught so that they are building up a grievance vote for the United Party, have begun to forget how to notice how this communist octopus is curling its tentacles round Southern Africa; how to notice that within the foreseeable future the communists, upon completion of the Tanzam railway line, would bring heavy weapons, i.e. artillery and tanks, up to the banks of the Zambezi, close to Katima Mulilo; but then, dramatically and suddenly under our very noses, near Potgietersrus, on a quiet Good Friday just the other day, a passenger train was hurled off a railway bridge and dozens of innocent Bantu were flung to their deaths. Sir, further attempts at sabotage are taking place in our midst, directly and indirectly. There are terrorist trials in progress in our country in which the Police are bringing diabolical aspects to light. [Interjections.] Sir, all at once my people dug in their heels and were joined by every responsible person in this country, including the law-abiding Bantu. The red warning lights are flashing everywhere. This is not merely a case of more shock reports about our brave policemen who died in the Caprivi in a dastardly fashion. Everyone on a train or in an aircraft is now continually anxious, wondering whether it is not going to happen again. Everyone realizes that the red saboteur is now in our midst; he is no longer far away. Now the urgent warnings of our hon. Prime Minister and our hon. Minister of Police have come strongly to the fore in recent months and years. All at once this whole picture is fully and clearly before our people. What is the picture&#x003F; This Government is prepared for what is now happening. State security and the safety of the country are at this moment the Republic&#x2019;s top priority. All at once, while that hon. member, the prophet who was silenced, was sitting and mumbling, it was brought home to the people that the red saboteurs are here, and the time for cheap political games by anti-National elements, such as those of that party, is past, because this people is tired of it.

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Were it not for the serious aspect of what the hon. member for Pretoria District has just said, I would have treated him and what he has said with complete contempt. His attempts to smear this side of the House and this party in regard to their loyalty towards the security of South Africa is a disgrace which we reject with the contempt which it deserves. But what is important is that this hon. member raised this afternoon the dangers facing South Africa, dangers which we on this side of the House recognize, and in the combating of which we play our full part, and towards the fighting of which we are dedicated, and in the physical combating of which our sons are playing their part. These dangers are dangers facing all of South Africa and in fighting them, all South Africans are taking part&#x2014;all South Africans, and not just Nationalists as that hon. member implied. I repeat&#x2014;not just Nationalists, but all loyal and patriotic South Africans. And the man under whom they have to fight, the man who is responsible for our security, is the hon. the Minister of Defence.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask a question&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I am not prepared to answer any questions in a ten-minute speech. The hon. the Minister of Defence is the Minister responsible for maintaining the dedication of our youth in the fight against Communism. He is the Minister responsible for the <i>esprit de corps,</i> the morale and the loyalty of our troops, in the defence of our fatherland against assault from outside. Yet how does he maintain that morale and that dedication of spirit&#x003F; By getting up in this House last week and accusing anyone who does not speak the one language of being an &#x201C;Afrikaner-hater&#x201D; and not a good South African&#x003F; What was the test he applied&#x003F; He said that any person who did not speak Afrikaans in this House was an &#x201C;Afrikaner-hater&#x201D;. But he went further and he said that any person who could speak Afrikaans and did not, was an even worse &#x201C;Afrikaner-hater&#x201D;. In other words, he places as the test of patriotism and of South Africanism the language which you speak.</p>

<p><span class="col_5233-5234" refersTo="page_1080"/>Sir, I am not prepared to let the hon. the Prime Minister get away with his pious appeal yesterday for unity. He is the Prime Minister of South Africa and his Minister responsible for our security has, I believe, done South Africa a grave disservice. We have the Prime Minister&#x2019;s pious word : &#x201C;I am pure.&#x201D; He challenges us on this, that and the other, and then he goes back twenty years to find a speech to prove that this side of the House has &#x201C;Afrikanerhaters&#x201D; and is not truly South African. We can all do that. I have a speech here, signed, a message which says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As Afrikaner in murg en been het ek een onuitwisbare ideaal en dit is die bou van &#x2019;n verenigde Suid-Afrikaanse nasie, bestaande uit sowel Afrikaans- as Engels-sprekendes. Ek is oortuig daarvan dat ons hierdie ideaal kan gebruik met die volgende beleid, wat die beleid van die Verenigde Party is, en dit is die beleid wat ek beloof om te ondersteun.</block>

<p>That is by a member of the Cabinet, Mr. Blaar Coetzee, and was signed by him&#x2014; and this was after the speech which the hon. the Prime Minister quoted. We can also prove anything this way. But what I believe is significant in this debate on unity, is the fact that whilst this side of the House has reacted strongly to the allegations, we have not retaliated in kind. That is the test of South Africanism. We have been angered, and I want to say to the hon. the Prime Minister that many of us have been embittered and we have been hurt not only in this House, but throughout South Africa. We have been hurt by what has been said. We remember broken meetings, broken up when Nationalist Party organizers have screamed : &#x201C;Praat Afrikaans; ons wil nie die rooitaal hier h&#x00EA; nie.&#x201D; Under this Prime Minister we know of circulars that have gone out to public servants, instructions to them, that they may not write an internal letter in English in their departments. The hon. the Minister of Finance, when I raised the matter, said that he had gone into it and it was correct and he has instructed that it be withdrawn. [Interjections.] It was in the Department of Customs and Excise, and I have the actual instruction, written by the Secretary of the department, and it stands in Hansard. The Minister had to have that instruction withdrawn. Where do we get with this sort of accusation&#x003F;</p>

<p>I want to say that the Nationalist Party has no monopoly on feelings. It is not only their feelings that can be hurt. They are not the only people who are sensitive, neither has any language group a monopoly of being hurt or not being hurt. When things are said in this House as they have been said by the Government recently, then I want the hon. the Prime Minister to know that people are deeply and bitterly hurt. I want to say to him that it is the United Party and not the Nationalist Party which has fought jingoism in South Africa. It was the United Party which fought the Dominion Party. It was the United Party which fought that Dominion Party, a party which later supported the Government on race policies. It was the United Party which fought the Federal Party in Natal, the party which wanted to secede from South Africa. Where is there any member on that side of the House that fought against it&#x003F; [Interjections.] No, the hon. the Chief Whip can get up and make a speech later; I will then reply to it. Mr. Chairman, it is this side of the House, this party, the United Party, who in the past taught people who were jingoes. Admittedly there were racialists on both sides&#x2014;but it was the United Party which has taken that out of our national life, and out of our politics. We had jingoes, of course we did; and what caused it&#x003F; The bitterness, the extremism of the Nationalist Party. Mr. Chairman, steadily and responsibly we have fought against extremism. We have fought in the United Party, Mr. Chairman, until there was no iota left.</p>

<p>*We were the ones, Mr. Chairman, we in this party, who had to fight English-speaking people in order to make good South Africans of them. [Interiections.] What makes us feel bitter, Mr. Chairman, and I want to conclude with this, is that the years of work, of persuasion, to destroy jingoism and racism between White and White, are undone here within a few hours, a few hours of acrimonious, short-sighted and vindictive speeches. I demand, and we demand, that the Prime Minister repudiate the Minister of Defence as well as the other Ministers who spoke in that vein, in the interests of South Africa. It is not enough to make appeals &#x2026; [Time expired.]</p>

<p>But the hon. member is merely throwing up a smokescreen. We have already debated this matter across the floor of this House. If he thinks that I should speak to my colleague here because he said things which that hon. member says he said, then he is making a mistake. I listened to what the hon. the Minister was saying, and by way of interjection I indicated my point of view on it in no uncertain terms. If the hon. member for Durban Point&#x2014;and this he must understand very clearly now&#x2014; thinks that we are to be content with listening from Monday to Saturday to how things which are sacred and dear to us are disparaged and despised, then he is making a mistake.</p>

What was it that my friend the hon. the Minister of Defence condemned&#x003F; My friend condemned the attitude of people who have the chance, who have the opportunity and who have the intelligence to know or speak the other person&#x2019;s language, but who, in his opinion, have so much contempt for it that they do not consider it worthwhile to do so. That is what my friend&#x2019;s case was. However, since the hon. member for Durban Point raised this matter once again, and since the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is back now &#x2026;</p>

<p>The hon. member need not be so excited about it. By no means did I say that he had been called away intentionally. I told the hon. member for Durban Point that I wondered, since he was actually angry with you and now wanted to take it out on me, whether you did not perhaps think that he wanted to attack you. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout need not be so sensitive, for I have not yet finished with him. There is still a good deal we have to discuss in this regard. But since the hon. member for Durban Point has once again raised this matter and has again made insinuations against this side of the House, I want to ask what we actually have before us now. We have a statement of fact to the effect that what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout says is true.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Durban North has put this question to me. The hon. member has not only been a member of this House for many years, but is also a senior member of the Bar. To my surprise, referring to the Bester incident firstly, on Sunday before last I had to read the big black headlines: &#x201C;Mitchell names Vorster&#x201D; on the front page of the <i>Sunday Times.</i> The hon. member did not, as one would have expected from a senior member of this House, ask me across the floor of this House by way of a question or otherwise whether I knew anything of this matter at all. Without any iota of evidence, the hon. member ran along to the <i>Sunday Times</i> and made this accusation against me.</p>

Now he comes along and he repeats that accusation, in spite of the statement by the Commissioner of Police that I had nothing to do with this whatsoever.

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, you did not ask a question; you made this accusation across the floor of the House. You made it in the <i>Sunday Times</i> and later on you also made it across the floor of the House. What was the position as I gathered from the explanation of the hon. the Minister of Justice&#x003F; A certain rumour came to the ears of the Commissioner of Police. It was not only a rumour about Gen. Bester, but also a rumour about the Government in regard to the investigations into the Agliotti affair. The Commissioner of Police has told us that he saw it as his duty to have it investigated immediately. I, for one, am very pleased that the Commissioner of Police did see it as his duty. I would have been disappointed if he did not see it as his duty to have it investigated immediately. What is there then to say further about the matter&#x003F;</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But, Mr. Chairman, the Commissioner of Police has told us that he would have investigated the matter himself. He was seized of the matter himself. He deputed a brigadier to go and investigate this matter, because, as I have already said, I can readily understand it. It is not only a question of General Bester, but it is an imputation against the Government.</p>

<p>Sir, it was a question of the same day and the same morning. What more does the hon. member want in this regard now&#x003F; I would not know. What is more, I do not care whether or not he is satisfied with the explanation; but what does matter to me, is that I shall be glad if in his search for publicity the hon. member would not drag me into this matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member now wants to make propaganda out of the Agliotti affair once again. In that case we may as well restate the facts in that regard across the floor of this House for the umpteenth time. The facts of the matter were that that land had been purchased through the instrumentality of an official on the valuation of two geologists and what could be deduced from the surrounding circumstances. I think it is fair to have been able to deduce that the land was in fact worth much more than that price. Furthermore, there was evidence by people who held that view. The moment it became known that that price had been paid for the land&#x2014;and I reported that here to this House&#x2014;the hon. member for Boksburg brought certain matters to my notice.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Gossip.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, Sir, they were not gossip. They were of such a nature that I took notice of them, and I most certainly do not take any notice of the hon. member for Durban North. I took the necessary steps in that regard. I did not merely speak about it, but hon. members will remember very well that I said I would have this matter investigated and that I did go further than that. Because a contract had been drawn up, I said that even if it would be necessary to annul that contract by way of an Act of Parliament, I would do so, immediately. What more does the hon. member want from me now&#x003F; But I did not merely leave it at that either. I appointed a commissioner to investigate that matter. I even stepped in by having advocates with specialised knowledge appointed while the investigations were in progress already, because I wanted the best evidence to be put forward in regard to this matter. I want to tell hon. members now that if I had not appointed those advocates, the possibility would by no means have been ruled out that the commissioner <span class="col_5243-5244" refersTo="page_1085"/>would have found that the price paid for that land was a fair one. That would not have been ruled out. Because I wanted to make absolutely sure that nothing would go wrong in this regard, I had senior as well as junior advocates appointed, persons with a knowledge of the expropriation of land, and they entered the case. I know I am quite justified in saying that it was as a result of their intervention that the case took the course it did, and that R5 million came back to the State. But what further steps did I take&#x003F; If there are people who want to make propaganda out of this, they are free to do so; if that is the case, there is nothing I can do about it. All I know is that this Government and I personally did the correct thing at all times.</p>

<p>What further steps did I as the responsible Prime Minister take&#x003F; I immediately gave instructions that the report of that commissioner be sent to the Attorney-General. Because it was fair to deduce that an offence had been committed somewhere, I instructed the Police to look into this matter. What more can I do&#x003F; I want to know this now. The Police did not merely leave the matter at that. Who decides on prosecutions in this country&#x003F; Every now and then I gain the impression that if that hon. member had to become Minister of Justice, he would interfere with prosecutions. I gained this impression as a result of certain statements made by him to the effect that he would interfere. It has always been the practice in South Africa&#x2014;and may it always remain the practice&#x2014;that the prerogative to decide whether there should be prosecutions rests with the Attorney-General.</p>

That is what happened in the United Party&#x2019;s time, but I am leaving it at that. I say: The Attorney-General decides what prosecutions are to take place and what prosecutions are not to take place. I brought the records of the case to the notice of the Attorney-General. The Police have been instructed to investigate the matter from beginning to end. It is not merely the Police on the one side and the Attorney-General on the other side; after all, I told the hon. member that two officials from the office of the Attorney-General are cooperating with the Police in this regard. What more do hon. members want now&#x003F; After all, it is the Attorney-General who has all the information at his disposal, to whom information is made available by those two officials from time to time, and who has to decide whether or not a prosecution is to be instituted. It is he who has to say: &#x201C;I have enough evidence now,&#x201D; or: &#x201C;I do not have enough evidence yet to charge a person.&#x201D; [Interjections.] The Heller case went on for years.</p>

Does he now expect the Attorney-General simply <span class="col_5245-5246" refersTo="page_1086"/>to charge people without having the evidence which he may bring against them&#x003F; Now I want to know this from the hon. member: I tell him now that the Police have been instructed to investigate the case as far as it is possible to do so, and that the case is in the hands of the Attorney-General. Is the hon. member making an insinuation, not only against the Minister and against me, but also against the Attorney-General and the Police who are investigating the case, that the Minister, the Attorney-General, the Police and I have laid a plot to the effect that this case should not be brought to finality&#x003F; I now ask the hon. member, since he dragged me into this matter, not to leave it at insinuations.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister and the hon. the Minister of Police have only themselves to blame for the various adverse inferences which have been drawn not only by this side of the House but by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own Press organs arising out of the Agliotti affair. What has the hon. gentleman told us today&#x003F; What precisely has he told us&#x003F; Absolutely nothing that we did not know before he stood up&#x2014;nothing at all. What has he said&#x003F; He said that there was an unpleasant rumour; that the Head of the Police acted on that rumour, and that that is all there is to the matter. Let me ask the hon. gentleman a few questions, seeing that he was not prepared to tell us the facts of the matter when he had the opportunity to do so a few moments ago. I would like to ask the hon. the Prime Minister whether he was aware of this rumour before the Commissioner of Police took action&#x003F;</p>

<p><span class="col_5247-5248" refersTo="page_1087"/>He has not told us. What did he tell us&#x003F; What was his answer&#x003F; Did he, or did he not, know it&#x003F; You see the sort of thing that we are up against here, Sir. The hon. the Prime Minister did not know of this rumour. What was the rumour&#x003F; Let us forget for a moment that nobody on this side of the House had ever heard of the rumour; no Pressman in the country had heard of this rumour; nobody that I know of had ever heard of this rumour, but it existed apparently. Sir, can you imagine a more serious rumour than the one that is alleged to have been spread; can you imagine a more serious rumour than the allegation that the Government was placing restrictions upon the investigation of this case&#x003F; We asked the hon. the Minister of Police the other day, but he declined to say anything about it. We now ask the hon. the Prime Minister: What were the restrictions alleged to have been placed on the investigation&#x003F; You see, Sir, the hon. gentleman is very good at putting questions to us, but when he is in a corner he gazes at the ceiling. He will not answer that question either. That is question No. 2. Let us deal with questions instead of jokes for a change. The hon. gentleman will not tell us what the alleged restrictions were.</p>

<p>Sir, let us deal with the hon. the Prime Minister a stage further. I do not believe that you could find a more serious allegation than the allegation that the Government placed some hindrance or other upon the investigating officers in this case. That is the allegation that the hon. the Minister of Police says was being bandied about. What steps have been taken against the source of that rumour&#x003F; We have asked the Minister of Police on a number of occasions whether the investigation was based upon a sworn statement and, if so, who made it; and we have asked him further, in view of the seriousness&#x2014;and I emphasize this&#x2014;of the rumour which is alleged to have been spread, what steps have been taken against the persons who brought that information now that we know it was false. It is difficult to conceive of a more serious allegation against any Government, and yet we are to understand apparently, on the facts as known to us at the present time, that nothing whatever has been done in that regard. The hon. the Prime Minister cannot complain, if we are to continue with the present situation where he refuses point-blank to give either this House or the country the facts&#x2014;and the same applies to the hon. the Minister of Police&#x2014;if people begin to draw their own conclusions.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; the sort of conclusions that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own Press has begun to draw already and which were referred to by the hon. member for Durban North. Sir, this is not an everyday occurrence. It is one of the greatest frauds ever perpetrated in this country, if the facts as established by the commission of inquiry are subsequently proved to be correct. Having been left in the dark as to the facts, as we have been once again, let us come to the question of the investigation, that is to say, the investigation which we hope will lead to a prosecution. The hon. the Prime Minister has given us no reason for the delay in this matter. We hear that it is delicate. I cannot imagine why it is delicate, but we are not told; we are just told that it is delicate. The hon. the Prime Minister stands up proudly and says that he should take great credit because he appointed advocates on the commission of inquiry who knew what they were doing. I should have thought that that would be the most elementary precaution to take. Sir, where else do you have a Police investigation into a set of facts where most of the facts are already in black and white as the result of a lengthy inquiry by a commission&#x003F; You know, Sir, one has only to read the evidence which was given before that commission of inquiry to come to the conclusion that there is already a <i>prima facie</i> case of fraud established on the facts of that inquiry alone. What additional facts are needed to found a prosecution&#x003F; If there are additional facts, why are they not available&#x003F;</p>

<p>After all, Sir, who are the persons involved&#x003F; They are either civil servants or members of statutory boards appointed by this Government. Those, principally, are the persons concerned. Is the hon. the Prime Minister saying to me and to the House that from those sources no information is available upon which a prosecution can be brought&#x003F; Sir, this matter has been left by the hon. <span class="col_5249-5250" refersTo="page_1088"/>the Prime Minister in a thoroughly unsatisfactory state, and since the hon. gentleman is constantly exhorting us to have some deeds and not just to be satisfied with words, this is something which the hon. the Prime Minister ought to reply to himself.</p>

<p>Then there is another point. In regard to the investigation into Gen. Bester, the hon. the Minister of Police told us the other day that that investigation was not yet concluded and that he was not yet satisfied with the findings in that regard. Why has that investigation not been concluded&#x003F; We are led to understand that it is now accepted by everybody&#x2014;indeed, it was accepted by Gen. Joubert from the beginning&#x2014;that the allegations against Gen. Bester were unfounded and a lot of nonsense. Having got two sworn statements, both from the suspect, Gen. Bester, and from the newspaperman concerned that this was a lot of nonsense, why is the hon. the Minister of Police now prepared to say that that investigation is not yet complete&#x003F; What still remains to be investigated&#x003F;</p>

<p>Sir, this is the very thing that we suspect and that the country suspects: Keep it quiet long enough and the people will forget about it. That is the attitude, Sir.

<p>Let me come to some of the other matters which have been raised. I want to deal in the few moments that are left to me with this question of national unity. Sir, one of the most tragic things, when one thinks about the debate that has taken place in the last week, is that that debate did not arise out of a heated atmosphere in this Chamber.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to follow the same path that hon. member followed. In connection with the Agliotti matter I want to content myself with what the hon. the Minister said, i.e. that he must wait a little; he will get his reply. I do not know what more the hon. member wants. That is surely enough. But I want to come back to what the hon. member for Hillbrow said yesterday and partly to what the hon. member for Parktown said in his Little Budget speech. What these two members had to say in successive debates is in my estimation, very dangerous because this matter has the very closest bearing on <span class="col_5251-5252" refersTo="page_1089"/>South Africa&#x2019;s economic development and the confidence the outside world has in capital investment in South Africa, and the closest bearing on our Bantustan policy.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parktown said in his Little Budget speech that the Government must come back to earth, and he mentioned a whole string of aspects we must put a stop to. For example, the Government must stop interfering in private initiative. But yesterday the hon. member for Hillbrow came along and stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This is precisely our charge. That is what is happening. The Government is usurping more and more economic power. We have more and more controls. That kind of control to anybody else in the world would suggest Socialism. That is why some of our industrialists and top businessmen are throwing their hands up in despair and are saying: Let us return to the free market mechanism in South Africa.</block>

<p>And then he states&#x2014;&#x201C;So we have Socialism in this country. It is an established fact.&#x201D; I cannot imagine anything more dangerous and more irresponsible at this juncture, particularly at this juncture, than what the hon. member for Hillbrow had to say. Let me point out to the hon. member that at the moment there are two big economic super states in the world, Soviet Russia and the U.S.A. According to projections, from the year 1980 to the year 2000 Japan will become the international super-economic state. Let us look at what is happening in Japan. There they state&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Even in the beginning &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is after the humiliation of Japan by the bomb attack on Hiroshima toward the end of the Second World War.</p>

<block name="quote">Even in the beginning Government direction and intervention were very skilful. In effect the Japanese were using government control as a method of getting monopoly, gains and other bargaining advances. According to the <i>London Economist</i> Japan has the most sophisticated and most closely controlled economic system in the world.</block>

<p>Let us look at what they say in <i>Time.</i> I have it here. This is the &#x201C;Time Essay&#x201D; of 14th February, 1972. What does <i>Time</i> have to say&#x003F; It states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United States is universally recognized as the capital of Capitalism, the land of free markets and the home of resourceful entrepreneurs. Americans have done much to strengthen the two pillars of free enterprise, private ownership and unfettered competition. Only in the United States are airlines, radio, television networks, the telephone system, power companies and other major industries owned primarily by private individuals. Japan is a corporate State in which Government and industry are so closely interrelated that it is difficult to tell which segment is in control. Half of France&#x2019;s motor industry is owned by the State; 35 per cent of Italy&#x2019;s industrial production is State-controlled. Now, recently, free enterprise in the United States has been under very heavy pressure, not so much from the new Left or the critics as from some of the system&#x2019;s primary defenders, namely the Republican Party and private businessmen. By ordering controls, Nixon made one of the boldest encroachments so far on the free enterprise system. Nixon&#x2019;s new economic policy is in fact only the latest and most dramatic in a series of events that challenged the principle of free enterprise. In business the role of the government in the United States is fast growing larger as saviour, subsidizer, owner, regulator and decision-maker.</block>

<p>Now, Mr. Chairman, these members come along one after another&#x2014;and we must pay attention to that&#x2014;and they gradually drag it in. Every year they come along here and make just a slight allegation that this country is on the road towards Socialism, that here in South Africa free initiative is taboo. They allege that with a series of control measures this Government is killing private initiative in South Africa. I want to allege that to make such a statement is irresponsible.</p>

<p>I shall continue with the above quotation&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government will increasingly exert its great power in three ways &#x2026;</block>

<p>Firstly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; Washington&#x2014;will involve itself more and more as a goal-setter, a rules-maker for business, largely because many business leaders want it to do so.</block>

<p>Secondly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; The Government will become a sterner policeman of private enterprise. Washington is stepping up its regulatory efforts.</block>

<p>Thirdly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government is likely to continue some form of surveillance over wages and prices.</block>

<p>Unlike other countries of the world, any entrepreneur, any man having the capital, knowledge and experience can come to South Africa, and here he is free to exploit his knowledge, experience and capital. Those hon. members have never said that. I blame them, Mr. Chairman, for dragging in elements such as the Agliotti mess in a debate of this calibre. I am so sick and tired of Agliotti that the less I hear about it the better.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, here in South Africa, from a total expenditure of R3 604 million on local fixed investment in 1971, our public corporations had a meagre amount of R320 million in capital. Contrary to what the hon. member said yesterday, i.e. that only 46 per cent of investment belongs to the private sector, my findings in this connection are that the private sector&#x2019;s share amounts to R1 986 million.</p>

<p>Every year hon. members come along here and want to know what the public corporations are receiving. Year after year they sit here and say that the Railways must be handed over to public initiative. They have advocated this year after year; now for the first time they have stopped doing so. This is not the way an Opposition acts. Two super states, the one totally communist controlled, and the other one, America, where the Government, as I have quoted, is gaining ever greater control. Japan is a co-operative State in which one cannot separate the parts played by the Government and private initiative. Here is South Africa with its remarkable and unique circumstances, a country where any man can come and invest capital. We are the complete and perfect blend of the concept of Capitalism and Socialism. This is in consequence of the National Party because it is manned by the Afrikaner, who is completely attuned to the blending of Capitalism and Socialism.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I can&#x2019;t reply to the hon. member for Carletonville in detail as I have other matters to raise, but I do want to say that it is a very extraordinary capitalistic country where over 40 per cent of the gainfully employed White people are in direct or indirect State employment. Not even in Mr. Wilson&#x2019;s socialist England was the number of people in State employ anything as high. I leave the hon. member at that. I must say I am grateful to him for one thing, namely that he has diverted the debate from what <span class="col_5255-5256" refersTo="page_1091"/>was going to be a repeat performance of previous days of this &#x201C;rassehaat&#x201D; and &#x201C;boerehaat&#x201D; business we have had over the last few days. I want to say that I have seldom witnessed a more unappetizing spectacle. I wonder if any single member in this House on either side, has given a thought to what the 17 million citizens of this country who are not White are thinking about this very unappetizing spectacle. Quite clearly this is old ganging-up business, the national unity of the White people for the purpose, of course, of coping with the Black, Coloured and Brown majority in this country. Because of Oudtshoorn, and thank Heaven it is nearly over now&#x2014;so that with a little luck we won&#x2019;t have any more of this&#x2014;the Government has gone back to beating the old tribal drum in order to try to get a few more votes. I do not think it is going to work. I am sure it is not going to work amongst the younger voters, and I am not even sure that it is going to work among the older voters. Only today I received in the post a letter containing two torn-up National Party membership cards. The accompanying card read: &#x201C;We hope that many thousands will take the same step.&#x201D; Torn-up cards, this is what these people think about the debate that has taken place in this House.</p>

<p>I want to raise other matters with the hon. the Prime Minister. First of all, it was a pleasant change to hear him protesting about people making accusations against him without a shred of evidence, because when that gentleman was Minister of Justice and of Police he did not have the slightest compunction in locking up hundreds of people without any evidence and keeping them in detention without trial for months on end. It is therefore a pleasant change to know that he believes that there should really be evidence against people before accusations are made. I would say that it is time, for example, that he told the country and this House something about what is going on in Owambo. I raised this matter during the no-confidence debate and have had nothing at all from the hon. the Prime Minister We have had statements made by Dr. Waldheim but nothing from the hon. the Prime Minister. Does he not think it is time that he took the country into his confidence and gave us some information about what is happening in Owambo&#x003F; What we do know is that many people have been locked up without trial in Owambo as well and that at the present time something like 83 people are locked up under Proclamation R17 and that, in all, over 200 people have been taken and put in detention without trial in Owambo. I think he owes some explanation to this country as to what is happening in Owambo.</p>

<p>Then I would like to ask the hon. the Prime Minister when this vendetta against Nusas is likely to cease. At the present stage practically every single member of the executive of Nusas over the past two years has either had his passport snatched from him without good reason or had his or her application for a passport refused. I believe this is blatant intimidation of young students in South Africa, and not only of young English-speaking students, but also of Afrikaans-speaking students at Afrikaans-medium universities who are now beginning to show an interest in contact across the colour line with the students at other universities. I would like to know whether the hon. the Prime Minister does not think that this is holding in contempt the Select Committee that he called to be set up to investigate the affairs of Nusas. Even before that Committee has completed its investigations, even before it has reported, punitive measures have been taken against executive members of Nusas. I do not believe that you can divorce the individual members who are running Nusas, those who are in the leadership category, from the organization itself.</p>

<p>The third question on which, I hope, we will get some answers from the hon. the Prime Minister, is whether he would like to tell us what is happening to his famous outward policy about which we have heard so much over the last two or three years Has he made any progress at all&#x003F; We heard a great deal about what the hon. the Prime Minister was going to do as far as the other African states are concerned.</p>

<p>It is more than the hon. the Prime Minister has managed to do, despite all his big talk. We in fact were admitted for one reason only and that is because our record for fighting against race discrimination is wellknown. Let me tell hon. members that every one of those states and indeed, every one of the 40-odd independent Black states in Africa are dead against apartheid, even those countries which economically are bound to us, our immediate neighbours. They are against apartheid. Unless this country is prepared to make some concessions in the racial field, dialogue will begin and end at square one. We will not get any further at all. I also think it is time that hon. members realize that Black African states do not demand the hand over of White South Africa to Blacks. What they do demand is the removal of race discrimination and they demand equal opportunities for their own brethren. This is a question of human value. That is all it is. Whether we like it or not, they do identify themselves with the fate of the Black people in this country and their lack of opportunity. I think it is a scandalous situation that in the year 1972, when there are something like 43 independent states in Africa including ourselves, we have exactly four diplomatic missions: In Rhodesia, in Malawi, in Angola and in Portuguese East Africa. In the others we have not so much as a consul-general, not so much as a <i>charg&#x00E9; d&#x2019;affaires.</i> I think this is an unbelievable situation that South Africa, the most Westernized, the most industrialized and by far the most important country in the whole of the continent of Africa does not have any connections. Hon. members should start asking themselves why. It is not what I say, it is what the Government does. That is what the young hon. member for Waterkloof does not realize. What I say does not mean anything, does not carry any weight. I have no power and I am well aware of that. My views are wellknown and those are acceptable, but I have no power. But the Government does have the power. Dialogue will not mean a thing&#x2014;I can tell the hon. the Prime Minister this right now. There are many who would like dialogue.</p>

<p>I may tell her here out of the back bench that as long as there is an Afrikaner people in South Africa and as long as it will have a voice in this House and as long as she will have the privilege of sitting in this House, she will have to listen to this language, because it is a living reality and because it is linked up with the fundamental interests of people. Those interests will be discussed in this House whether she likes it or not.</p>

<p>I get the impression that the United Party tries to make great play of the question of national unity and that they are actually trying to outbid the National Party in the emphasis they place on national unity. I may say at the outset that there are a few aspects about which we do not argue at all. We do not argue at all about the question of loyalty to South Africa and a common patriotism. I accept the patriotism of my English-speaking fellow-citizen in South Africa who is loyal to the Republic of South Africa. We do not differ on the question that if South Africa were attacked by aggressors and if it became necessary to defend South Africa&#x2014;there is no difference of opinion on that&#x2014;the young Afrikaner boy and the young English-speaking boy will stand side by side in the Caprivi Strip or wherever the interests of South Africa.</p>

<p>Neither do we argue about the cultural and national plurality in South Africa. I take it that the Opposition accepts this plurality in South Africa, but I am not so sure that they are able to follow through all its implications to the end. Neither do we argue about the necessity of bilingualism. We do not argue about that necessity, but we differ in our view on what national unity means in practice. That is where the difference of opinion comes in, and I shall try to indicate it in a few words.</p>

<p>Even though it may be familiar ground, I want to start off by nevertheless referring to the standpoint as it was put on the part of the National Party by my Leader, Adv. Vorster, our Prime Minister. He explained this matter from various angles, various angles which are fundamentally part of the same view. Then may I refer to a facet of this matter which is of the utmost importance to us. I want to point out to hon. members the emphasis he placed on a matter which in actual fact is an irritation to many people, and that is the question of Afrikaner unity. The hon. the Prime Minister did not hesitate to speak about Afrikaner unity, because he knows its significance in our set-up in South Africa. On 6th July, 1968, he stated this matter very clearly at Upington when he said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This unity, I want to tell you today, must be preserved by you and by me, and I, as Leader of the Party, must see to it that that unity is preserved under all circumstances.</block>

<p>He went on to say that he would not allow anyone to upset that unity within the ranks of Afrikanerdom again. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to make it very clear here today that for the people who are not prepared to accept that unity, the people who do not believe in it, there is no place or room within the National Party.</block>

<p>This is clear, unequivocal language and we do not hide it under chairs or tables. We believe that Afrikaner unity is important &#x2026;</p>

<p>I do not think you are able to prescribe to me on Afrikanership I say it is the standpoint of the National Party that it does not have eyes for Afrikaner unity only but that it realizes how important Afrikaner unity is to South Africa and to our Afrikaner people. That is not all that the Prime Minister said. He also spoke about the question of co-operation. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to make it very clear that I am in favour of co-operation, provided that I am accepted as an Afrikaner with all the implications it has.</block>

<p>And then I can prove, furthermore, that he gave a practical demonstration of it when he spoke in Grahamstown at the laying of the foundation stone of the 1820 Settlers Monument. Then he gave living, concrete proof of the respect in which he holds his English-speaking fellow-citizen in South Africa, while at the same time declaring where he personally belonged culturally, i.e. as an Afrikaner. He thinks and speaks from that basis. But in that capacity he can also show respect to those who speak a different language in South Africa. Now, in contrast to the Leader of the Opposition, who says that on the National Party side we are seeking national unity only because of a motive of fear&#x2014;this was said in his speech last Thursday&#x2014;the Prime Minister said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Today I believe they understand each other better than at any time since 1820, not because, as some are wont to say, outside circumstances are forcing them to stand together, but I sincerely believe because they want to stand together. They want to stand together for the simple reason that they belong to the same soil because both have taken root, and they want to grow and not to die.</block>

<p>That is our view, Sir. May I just mention the following little incident&#x003F; When I was fighting an election in Waterberg, I had the Herstigtes opposing me. Opposing me I had Mr. Jaap Marais, with his party&#x2019;s demand that there should eventually be only one official language in South Africa. At a meeting someone asked me in English&#x2014;apparently one of his supporters, however strange this may be&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Why can Britain have one official language, and that is English&#x003F; And why can Holland have one official language, and that is Dutch&#x003F;</block>

<p>In this way he mentioned quite a number of examples. Then he asked&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And why cannot we in South Africa have only one official language, and that is Afrikaans&#x003F;</block>

<p>&#x2020;He asked me why the Afrikaner does not have the guts to claim this right and to demand one official language, and that is Afrikaans. I told the gentleman, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you teach me something about Afrikanerdom. Don&#x2019;t you try to be a better Afrikaner than I am.&#x201D; I told him this party, the Nationalist Party, promised to the English-speaking person to safeguard and guarantee his cultural and language rights in South Africa. We are going to do that, and we are doing it.</p>

<p>*Sir, this is because the Afrikaner knows &#x2014;he knows this from his history&#x2014;what it means when the rights of others are interfered with. After all, he has personal experience of this. That is what the previous Prime Minister, Dr. Verwoerd, called to mind when he said the following on 18th September, 1958 (Hansard, column 4152)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We, who have had experience of the oppression of our language and who know what resistance such treatment evokes, would be the last to deny another man his language rights. Indeed, we know that the development of a united nation in South Africa, as well as the promotion of peace and happiness in the Republic of South Africa, will have to be based on the absolute recognition of the two languages and the equal treatment of these two languages, without the slightest suggestion of any discrimination.</block>

<p>Sir, if I have the time, I want to ask something. I do not want to be presumptuous from the back bench, but I do want to ask with the necessary humility what the Leader of the Opposition understands by his &#x201C;one nation&#x201D;. I read in <i>Die Burger</i> of 6th March, 1970, that when the Leader of the Opposition spoke at Keetmanshoop, he said that the South African nation could not continue to be half Boer, half British. He said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_5263-5264" refersTo="page_1095"/>If the White man wants to maintain himself&#x2014;and we say &#x201C;Hear, hear!&#x201D; if he wants to maintain himself&#x2014;the most important requirement is that a united South African nation should be built up. That is why national unity is of the greatest importance.</block>

<p>But now we ask, what is the meaning of that concept of &#x201C;national unity&#x201D;&#x003F; Now listen what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This evening I am telling the South African nation &#x2026;</block>

<p>And it is not always clear to me what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition understands by that, because sometimes he says it is the Whites, and then again he speaks of 21 million. He is not very certain. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You cannot continue as half Boer, half British. The destructive and tiring conflict of the past should not be extended, because the problems and dangers of the future call for unity.</block>

<p>This is now a very simple question: If we are not to be half Boer and half British, what must we be in this South African set-up&#x003F; [Time expired.]</p>

I hope that that will satisfy all the members on the other side as to what their attitude should be towards us, and that we will stop hearing this nonsense about the United Party not being loyal and patriotic. Very interesting in his address was also the part where he dealt with &#x201C;Afrikaner-eenheid&#x201D;. We must deduce from what he said that an Afrikaner is only regarded as an Afrikaner if he belongs to the Nationalist Party. [Interjections.] Yes, that is what he said.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>He just said so. Then he went on to say that the Nationalist Party guarantees the cultural and language rights of the English-speaking section. It was very interesting to hear him use those words, because those were the very words over which Gen. Hertzog left the Nationalist Party in Bloemfontein, in November, 1940. He insisted that they write into their Constitution a guarantee for the political rights of the English-speaking section too, and that side of the House refused to do so; that is why Gen. Hertzog left. The hon. member also referred to the attitude of the hon. the Prime Minister towards the English-speaking section. This debate has revolved around the hatred of the English-speaking people and the United Party for the Nationalists. That is the debate that was started here. If we are to talk about national unity, I appeal to everybody in this House to look at this side of the House and see the composition of the United Party, and then look at that side of the House and see the composition of that party. Then they can say which party seems more likely to have national unity as its policy. I should like to remind the hon. member who has just spoken that the Minister of Defence complained that there were haters of the Afrikaner in this party. He named them, and what was the basis of his judgment&#x003F; It was that they did not speak Afrikaans in this House. Then he went further and said that if they can speak Afrikaans and do not do so, their crime is a bigger one and their hatred is the greater. The hon. the Minister is unfortunately not here at the moment; I wanted to put a question to him. I do not remember him ever having made a speech in English in this House until he became a Minister, whereas I and other members, in the second session after we came to Parliament, made speeches in Afrikaans. I see the Minister of Sport looking at me in surprise. Has he made a speech in Afrikaans in this House&#x003F;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>He is the best example of an Afrikaner-hater, if you must use the definition of the Minister of Defence. In any case, Sir, I should like to get back to the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister&#x2019;s troubles do not come singly; they are falling upon him fast. The latest is a demand for independence from the Transkei. The Prime Minister <span class="col_5265-5266" refersTo="page_1096"/>should welcome a request of this nature because he invited the leaders of the Africans in the reserves to approach him and discuss independence with him. He said his door was open at all times. But I do not think he welcomed the present request, in the form in which it was put to him. Sir, he seemed to be on a pretty good wicket before, because the only homeland which could aspire to independence was the Transkei, and the Chief Minister of the Transkei had made it quite clear to his own party that he would not ask for independence because, he said, you could not have meaningful independence until the state was viable. The Prime Minister was able to assure his critics here and abroad of his <i>bona fides,</i> by truly stating that he was prepared to negotiate and to carry out his promise to give independence to the reserves, but that the Bantu preferred to stay as they were.</p>

<p>But now, Sir, the climate has changed and there seems to be a chilly wind blowing over the Nationalist Party. No longer are the non-White supporters of the Government speaking about separate development as they used to do, in the pretence that it satisfied their ideals and their wants. Now that they are installed as leaders of their separate groups they are more outspoken, without fear of intimidation or of being accused of being Leftists or instigators.</p>

<p>The Government has long had difficulties with Chief Buthelezi, and it is no secret that they would have preferred another leader for the Zulus. Recently we have read of criticism from other sources, for instance, from Chief Mangope of the Tswanas, last month when the Minister of Police was in his area. Still later, the Shangaan head, Chief Ntsanwise, at the opening of his Assembly, spoke in similar vein.</p>

<p>*By the way, I want to say that I was surprised to see that the Government had sent the hon. the Minister of Health to open that Assembly. They would not dare to send him as their representative to a White Assembly : why should he be forced upon the poor Shangaans&#x003F;</p>

That criticism is, I think, an excellent reflection of what all communities are now thinking of this policy. There is uncertainty amongst the Coloureds, including Coloured supporters of self-determination. We saw the statement of Mr. Swartz after his congress at Port Elizabeth, that his people were not satisfied. We saw the correction this morning, a statement from the Minister of Coloured Affairs, that Mr. Swartz says that he and his party still agree with the Government&#x2019;s policy and that they accept it. The Ministers are going to try to satisfy him with statements before the next sitting of his council.

The Prime Minister will probably get up and say that he has given them the assurance before.

<p>You can tell me after I have sat down. There is uncertainty amongst the White industrialists in the city and on the part of the Black man, not only in the cities, but also in the reserves. Last week the gauntlet was thrown down by Chief Kaizer, for so long the champion of separate development, and also of the Afrikaner against the Hugheses and the Mitchells whose ancestors, he claims, were the land grabbers. What is this complaint now against the Government&#x003F; It concerns land. When the Transkei Constitution was passed in 1963 and when the Bantu Homelands Constitution was passed last year in this House, we, the United Party, warned that it was folly to set the homelands on an independent course before finalizing their boundaries. Those constitutional measures allow for alteration of the boundaries by the State President, and it was obvious, before the Transkei Constitution was discussed in this House, that there were going to be squabbles about land, because the year before, in 1962, two resolutions were introduced in the Transkei Territorial Authority, calling upon the Government to transfer the neighbouring White-owned districts to the Transkei.

<p>I do not want to respond to the speech the hon. member has just made. I leave him in the hands of the hon. the Prime Minister. However, I just want to refer to one reference he made in connection with national unity when he mentioned the name of the late Gen. Hertzog. In 1933, when coalition took place, the late Gen. Hertzog was under the impression that together with the late Gen. Smuts he had probably brought about the greatest national unity in South Africa that any leader ever could. In 1939 &#x2014;and that the hon. member forgot to mention&#x2014;when the break came between the late Gen. Hertzog and the late Gen. Smuts, it was Gen. Hertzog who said: &#x201C;There sit the traitors, the people who stabbed me in the back.&#x201D; [Interjections.] Sir, what happened in 1940&#x003F; The thoughts I want to express here also have a bearing on national unity, but they also have a bearing on race relations in South Africa, because race relations in South Africa again have an effect on White relations in South Africa. During the Second Reading debate on the Appropriation Bill an hon. member of this side gave the United Party well-intentioned advice. That advice was that the United Party should think again about its non-White policy. Sir, that is not the United Party&#x2019;s problem. The United Party&#x2019;s problem is specifically that it thinks too often, because every time it thinks, there is a new policy on the way. However, I want to say something to the United Party&#x2019;s credit, i.e. that every time they come to light with a new policy, it contains one principle which is unassailable; it is a principle they carry through in every policy they present to the people, and that principle is one of giving the non-Whites of South Africa a bigger share in the administration of the country. I say that I am stating this to the United Party&#x2019;s credit. They remain consistent as far as this particular principle is concerned; they just wrap it up in new wool every time in order to hide it or for a reason I cannot fathom. But what happened as far back as 1954&#x003F; The United Party does not like the past, but I am now going to quote what they said in 1954, not to the detriment of the United Party, but for its benefit. I am quoting it for its benefit to illustrate the statement I made, i.e. that as far back as 1954 this was a continuous thread in the United Partys&#x2019; trend of thought with each policy declaration. After their central congress, where they discussed their non-White policy, a policy <span class="col_5269-5270" refersTo="page_1098"/>document was issued by the United Party in connection with the decision taken at that congress. Section 1 (b) of their Native policy read as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The party acknowledges that the Natives must be trained to develop democratic responsibility and that as they move in the direction of the standards of Western civilization their acceptance of a greater share in the administration of the country will become essential for the maintenance of harmony between the races.</block>

<p>In other words, the United Party proceeds from the standpoint that its policy determines the harmony of the races. Now, with its present policy&#x2014;we must now simply make a projection on the basis of what the policy is at present&#x2014;the United Party gave effect to this principle by their non-White representation in Parliament&#x2014;Coloureds by Coloureds, and Bantu and Indians by Whites. I say they are giving effect to this decision they took in 1954, and I think hon. members will be grateful if I give them the credit for remaining faithful to this principle. That representation, given to the non-Whites in Parliament, is not all the administration of the country entails. The Public Service is a very important aspect of the country&#x2019;s administration, the administration in which they want to give the non-Whites a greater share together with the Whites in Parliament. This also accords with the United Party&#x2019;s policy, which they have already announced here, and I want to mention two aspects of that. Firstly: the United Party is not opposed to the fact of a White person working in the same job situation under a non-White person. The United Party has not yet expressed itself as being opposed to that; on the contrary, it accepts the fact that non-Whites can achieve promotion posts where Whites will work under their authority.</p>

<p>If that is not the case, they need not interrupt me. In that case they may stand up and say it is not so. The second aspect is that it is the United Party&#x2019;s policy that the non-Whites may sell their labour on the markets that are the best for them. Is that so, or is it not&#x003F;</p>

<p>With this share in the country&#x2019;s administration which the United Party wants to give to the non-Whites, this part they want to hide, they cannot stop the non-Whites if they decide for themselves and say the Public Service is the best market in which they want to sell their labour. This accords with the policy of the United Party. [Interjections.] The other day the hon. member waxed lyrical here about the policy of the United Party, but that was when he was still under the impression that he is an angel. I want to tell him that the other day the hon. Leader of the House was making a joke; he did not really mean that he is an angel. I say the other leg of the United Party&#x2019;s policy&#x2014;i.e. that they want to bring non-Whites into the House of Assembly&#x2014;seen in the light of their policy in respect of national administration, will be the first step, the interim period, the starting point, as far as it affects Parliament. From that starting point there will subsequently be negotiations. This present number of non-White representatives is the proposal the United Party makes, but from that point they are going to negotiate with the non-Whites, and when they have negotiated and completed their consultations, at the level they have created here for consultations, they will hold a referendum in which they will say either that there are enough of these representatives or that their numbers must be increased. And now I ask the United Party this: If the White electorate has expressed its opinion, and the White electorate does not agree to the non-White representation being augmented, or that the Bantu should be represented by Bantu, are they so na&#x00EF;ve as to think that in the Public Service, where by that time non-Whites will already be occupying influential positions and numerically be in the majority, the non-Whites will come along and say: Thank you very much for this referendum you have held; we are satisfied and we acquiesce&#x003F; No less a person than the leader of the United Party said in 1959 that numbers would decide South Africa&#x2019;s future; leadership will be determined by numbers.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just sat down, has made certain statements in regard to our labour policy. I have no hesitation, Sir, in saying that every allegation he made with <span class="col_5271-5272" refersTo="page_1099"/>regard to our labour policy is wrong. [Interjections.] There were other things as well. I say that he was doing this mischievously, because no member on that side, no member of this House, can be so ignorant as to what our policy is. I say he did this on purpose. Why he is doing this now, I do not know, for it is too late to get it to Oudtshoorn. [Interjections.] He is quite right when he says that we are consistent in our acceptance of the principle of representation in this House for all groups. In that respect he is quite correct. We stand by that; we do not jump about as the Nationalist Party has done over the years. Who have altered their policy more with regard to representation in this House than the Nationalist Party&#x003F; I want to say something about this a little later on when I am talking to the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Sir, when I was dealing with the request for independence which we see has now come from the Transkei, I pointed out that it should be obvious&#x2014;it was obvious&#x2014;to this House that the land matter would be come a squabble because of the two resolutions passed the year before by the Territorial Authority of the Transkei asking for certain land and districts adjoining the Transkei to be added to the Transkei.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, when the Constitution was submitted to that Authority for approval first, before it was submitted to us, they raised this matter and asked that the whole district of Matatiele be included in the area which was to come under the jurisdiction of the Transkei. They were advised by senior officials&#x2014;and that was confirmed by Mr. De Wet Nel, who was then a Minister in this House&#x2014;that this was a matter for negotiation. They accepted the Constitution on that understanding. They should have been told then&#x2014;and the Constitution should have made it quite clear&#x2014;where the boundaries of the Transkei were to be. Sir, it is no use being wise after the event; we warned the Government beforehand that this would happen.</p>

<p>Chief Kaiser Matanzima has made several claims for more land, and has stated what areas he wants. We remember well the clash which occurred with the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration at Umtata on this very issue. Subsequently Chief Matanzima said that he would not ask for independence until the land claim had been settled. He made this claim on purpose, I feel, in order to put the Government on the spot. For, Sir, the moral justification for it&#x2019;s policy&#x2014;the deprivation of fundamental rights of citizenship in the Republic in exchange for those rights in the reserves, in the independent homelands&#x2014;disappears and is no longer valid if the homelands do not become independent.</p>

<p>The Chief Minister knows this only too well. I say that he is now holding this Government to ransom. The Leader of the Opposition in the Transkei, Mr. Guzana, has disclosed the terms of a resolution which the Chief has put to this Government. The Chief has not denied it; all he said was, according to the newspaper reports, that it was confidential. But the fact is that if we have it now it must have come to the Government. The Prime Minister can tell us whether he received this request or not. This is what he is supposed to have said, and this is what is called the &#x201C;ultimatum&#x201D; by Chief Kaiser Matanzima:</p>

<block name="quote">We do not see our way to ever requesting a declaration of independence if part of our land still remains in the Republic and we shall oppose any endorsement out of our people from the cities if sufficient land as claimed is not provided before then. To us this is fundamental to our acceptance of the policy of separate development as against a multiracial society in South Africa. Should the Republican Government refuse to meet our request, we shall be reluctantly compelled to abandon this policy and to join our brethren in the cities in championing a reversal to a multiracial Parliament in Cape Town on the basis of &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D; in order to share equally with the Whites the wealth of our common country, South Africa.</block>

<p>There are two points of interest in this so-called ultimatum. The one is that they will join forces with their brethren in the cities in championing a reversal of the policy of separate development. It is a clear statement that the Bantu, the Transkeians in the cities do not accept this policy, although we have been led to believe before that they did. The second is that they would then want representation in this House, and meaningful representation. Quite clearly, he intended to put the Prime Minister on the spot. He said that unless the Prime Minister meets him on this question of land good relations will deteriorate. He has now put the ball right in the court of the Prime Minister by submitting <span class="col_5273-5274" refersTo="page_1100"/>a resolution in his Assembly for the Transkeian Government to consider the advisability of requesting the Republican Government to grant independence to the Transkei including the districts of Elliot, Maclear, Mount Gurrie, Matatiele, Umzimkulu and Port St. Johns.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister has frequently stated that his policy is one of self-determination. If the Bantu now decide not to take independence on the terms offered by the Prime Minister, what happens then&#x003F; Does self-determination only mean the determination of the Whites or does it include Blacks as well&#x003F; This is becoming important now that the leaders of these people are more articulate and outspoken as to what they think self-determination means.</p>

<p>Generally, the problems raised by them are land matters. Chief Buthelezi said that he has a nowhere country and he too wants to know where the boundaries of his land are to be. Chief Ntsanwise tells us of the unsatisfactory boundary dispute he is having with the Government.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister is reported to have said last year that some of the Reserves would become independent within four years, that is before 1975. There is not much time left for that and instead of relations between the governments in the Reserves and our Government becoming better they are becoming more strained. As they become more strained we become more worried about something else, namely what the future relations will be with other Stales. In an interview with <i>To the Point,</i> the hon. the Prime Minister said that the separate Bantu states can align themselves with Moscow or Peking, that he cannot stop them. He would advise them against it, but he could not stop them if they were to go that way. But we know that the hon. the Minister of Defence has said something different. In addressing a meeting before the election in April. 1970, at Newcastle, he said that the United Party candidate was telling voters that independent Bantustans would negotiate with communist countries and form alliances with hem. He then said: &#x201C;This will never he allowed to happen.&#x201D; This question was raised last night by the hon. member for Hillbrow. The Prime Minister has spoken since then and I am surprised that he did not reply to the request from the hon. member for Hillbrow and explain what exactly the position is. We cannot have a Cabinet divided on this issue, especially if we have on record that the hon. the Minister of Defence admitted in this House that he was a party to a deception by the late Dr. Verwoerd in regard to the Coloured people, when he promised them that they would keep their Coloured vote, that they would never lose their representation in this House. Yet he knew, he was Minister of Coloured Affairs at that time, that Dr. Verwoerd intended all the time to take away that vote. There is a difference of opinion in the Cabinet. The Prime Minister has told us one thing and the Minister of Defence has told the electorate another thing. Who is right, and what is the position&#x003F; Will they be allowed to go their way&#x003F; No one can claim at the moment that the relations between this Government and the Transkeian Government are good. It is quite possible, in the fit of pique, that one of these Governments could, to show its hostility towards this Government and its resentment of the policies of the Government of the Republic, form some alliance with a foreign State. We want to know now before we go any further, what the position is and what the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s attitude is in respect of the question of independence. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, before I reply to the important matters raised here by the hon. member for Transkei, I want, just in passing, to reply to two matters, the one to which the hon. member for Hillbrow referred and the other to which I was unable to reply last night because the hon. member for Parktown asked to be excused, and I did not want to reply to him in his absence.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note, since this matter of a welfare state has now been raised and since a reproach has from time to time been levelled in regard to the taxes taken by the Government in proportion to the national income, what the position in South Africa is in comparison with the position in comparable countries. We find that in South Africa the Government takes 24 per cent of the net national income. In France it is 49 per cent, as against the 24 per cent in South Africa. In Germany it is 45 per cent; in Sweden 48 per cent; in the Netherlands 47 per cent and in Italy 38 per cent of the net national income. In other words, if it is argued, as the hon. member for Hillbrow wanted to argue indirectly, that we are a welfare state, the actual state of affairs is of course not being taken into account at all. We would then <span class="col_5275-5276" refersTo="page_1101"/>have to take almost twice as much from the population as we are in fact taking from them at the moment. This is also my reply to hon. members who make the statement that we are now falling behind European and other countries. Just recently a survey was made of the standard of living in South Africa and that in comparable European countries. South Africa ranked very highly in that survey.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, and as the White standard of living rose, so did that of the non-Whites. The Government, in spite of the propaganda which, when it suits hon. members, is made against the Government, is doing its duty in respect of the non-Whites.</p>

<p>The second question put to me by the hon. member for Parktown is whether we are prepared to make an estimate of the future growth rate. Because of his profession the hon. member for Parktown&#x2014;I readily concede this&#x2014;probably knows far more about these matters than I do, because of my profession. However, I think that the hon. member for Parktown will concede to me that one can visualize the growth rate approximating 5 per cent, and that it may even exceed 5 per cent. But the hon. member for Parktown will also agree with me that one has to be careful that it does not rise too much because, on the other hand, we have to watch inflation as well. But one can be optimistic about the future growth rate, because we have far better agricultural prospects now than we had last year and there is every reason to hope that the mineral market will in future be better than it has been in the recent past, and particularly if one takes into account that there is a greater upsurge in the offing in the industrial sector. One sees all the signs in this regard. Let me add that we, particularly if one takes into account that we have a very responsible labour force in South Africa &#x2014;for that I want to express my gratitude and appreciation&#x2014;a labour force which realizes that it must proceed very circumspectly in regard to wage demands else we will find ourselves in that spiral again which we have all heard of so frequently, may, if these circumstances are taken into account, look to the future with confidence. If, in the immediate future, we proceed with the greatest circumspection in respect of wage matters, in the interests of South Africa, and if we make a point of utilising the labour which we have to better effect and stimulating productivity, then I think I am right in the view I have just expressed to the hon. member for Parktown. I think the hon. member for Parktown will to a large extent agree with me in that connection.</p>

<p>I come now to the hon. member for Transkei. The hon. member put certain questions to me in that regard. I want to say to hon. members that I think I have in the past two to three years held more talks with the Bantu leaders of South Africa than all my predecessors put together. This was brought about by circumstances, and I therefore do not want to claim the credit for this for myself. I can say this. I can say that I am as fully conversant with their aspirations and their wishes as any other person. I also want to say to hon. members, and to the country in general, that those talks were held as candidly as any talks could possibly be held. Then I want to say to hon. members that I held talks with Bantu leaders, Coloured leaders and Indian leaders, for let us make no mistake about this&#x2014;any man who holds the position that I hold, and any man who succeeds me in this position, must be prepared to meet with those leaders at a round table conference and to thrash matters out with them.</p>

<p>I say it must be accepted as axiomatic that a man who is in this position must be well-informed and must hold talks with those people. I told the Bantu leaders, each and every one of them, that I know enough about human nature to know that we would not always agree. I said to all those leaders: &#x201C;There will be times when we differ with one another, but one thing you will always get from me: I shall at all times give you my standpoint candidly and openly, whether you like it or not.&#x201D;</p>

<p>One of the matters which keeps on cropping up during the talks&#x2014;this applies not only to the Chief of the Transkei, but to the others as well&#x2014;is land, land and land again. Land is always a point of discussion, and one can understand very well why this should be the case. I have stated unequivocally to all the leaders, and I want to repeat in this Parliament now, that the National Party Government stands by the 1936 Act. The National Party Government deems itself committed to keep the promise given by Gen. Smuts and Gen. Hertzog to the non-Whites. I have told them that we shall give them the land which the 1936 Act states they should have. Beyond the 1936 Act I am not prepared to go. I hope we understand that. That is also what I said to Chief Matanzima. He said to me : &#x201C;Sir, my people feel very strongly about those districts.&#x201D; I told him that I am not prepared to give him those districts for the historical reasons he advanced. That was my full and final answer. He said to me: &#x201C;Sir, my people feel very strongly about this matter; will you again submit it to your colleagues that I have made this request&#x003F;&#x201D; In all fairness I said to him : &#x201C;Yes, I shall again submit it to my colleagues, coming from the leader of the Transkei.&#x201D; I went further and I said to him: &#x201C;I am not holding out any hope to you, but it is my duty. You as leader are asking me to submit it to my colleagues, and I shall do so.&#x201D; And I submitted it to my colleagues, and I sent him the reply of my colleagues: &#x201C;I am sorry, but we cannot do so.&#x201D;</p>

I said to him: &#x201C;That land you shall have; it will be added to the Transkei.&#x201D; But to complete the picture: The hon. member is aware that the 1936 Act stated that we must give the Bantu 7&#x00BC; million morgen of White land.

<p>No, Sir, 7&#x00BC; million morgen of land. I do not know now whether the hon. member wants to get out of this or whether he wants to give them less; I am going to give them 7&#x00BC; million morgen. I think that is the spirit of the promise that was made, and I shall keep that promise; I shall keep the promise of the White man, the promise given by Smuts and Hertzog, to the Black man. I go further, Sir, Some of that land has been purchased over the years. The total extent still outstanding is 590 954 ha in the Transvaal, 235 798 ha in the Cape, and 63 359 ha in Natal. The position in regard to the Free State has been finalized. Now hon. members must understand that, as far as the Transvaal is concerned, the land still <span class="col_5279-5280" refersTo="page_1103"/>outstanding has to be subdivided. Let me rather put it like this: Various Bantu peoples have a claim to that land. There are the Venda, Prof. Ntsanwise&#x2019;s people, the North Sotho, and so on. In the Cape Province it is not only the Transkei that has a claim. The Ciskei has a claim, and the Tswanas as well in the Mafeking area. In other words, in the Cape Province there are three peoples whose circumstances have to be taken into account. In the Transvaal there are various peoples and in Natal it is the Zulus who have to be taken into account. Because this is all the land that is left, it is the aim of the department and the Minister in particular and of the Government to achieve maximum consolidation with the land still remaining. The hon. the Minister has given notice of certain proposals in regard to the Ciskei. I say there is still land which may fall to the Transkei and there is still land which may fall to the Tswanas out of this quota which still has to be purchased. Now the hon. member for Transkei has asked a question which has already been put frequently : When will the boundaries of these areas be finalized&#x003F; My reply is: The boundaries of these areas cannot be finalized before the last land has been purchased. Surely that goes without saving. When you have purchased the land or when you have come to a definite decision, you can say approximately where the boundaries are going to be and how the areas will be demarcated. I want to make one thing very clear in this connection: This land is being purchased and the Bantu are being consulted in regard to the matter. Naturally they have to be consulted, but the final say rests with the Government, for it is the Government that has to provide the money; it is the Government that has to keep the promise given by Smuts and Hertzog to give White land to the Black man, and the final word in that connection therefore rests with the Government. I spoke candidly along these lines to all the Black people. I said to them, and I want to repeat it here in Parliament, that there will always be people who want more land: there is no nation in the world that would not like to have more land, but I said to the Black leaders that their present problem was not so much that they should receive more land, but the better utilization of the land they have. I am not only saying this here in Parliament now. I said this to them, and I was very serious when I did so. They must utilize the land they have to better effect. This is the general view of the Minister, the department and the officials, and all our planning is geared to this. I went further and said to them : The position is the same in regard to the Whites. I have no land. There are many hon. members in this House who have no land. I mentioned the examples to them and said that we cannot all have land on which we can farm. Some of us have to be satisfied with a small plot in town.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, or a flat; we cannot all have land on which to farm. There is simply not enough land for all of us, and the Bantu must realize this as well. The Bantu must adapt themselves as well to the demands made on us as Whites. The point I want to make now, is that I discuss matters openly and straightforwardly with these people around a conference table, without beating about the bush in any way. We understand one another and we respect one another. I do not want to say that we will always agree, but I do want to say that all the talks we have held up to now took place in a spirit of the greatest candour and goodwill, and I do not foresee it being any different in future. I want to make it very clear to hon. members today that in my discussions with the Bantu leaders I have found up to now that they are highly responsible people. As long as we discuss our problems at a round table conference as we have done in the past, we will have differences of opinion, but I believe that we will discuss our problems and we will simply have to agree to differ on certain matters. This we have already made very clear to one another.</p>

<p>I stated my standpoint here in the House. I said: If there is a Bantu people that believes the time has arrived for it to become independent, it can come and discuss the matter with me, and then my door stands open to it. I repeat that today. To hon. members who speak disparagingly about this and who want to raise matters in this regard, I say that when I speak of independence, I mean independence in the normal sense of the word, the independence which Botswana or any other country has. In regard to my interview with <i>To the Point,</i> I want to say that it would have been extremely easy for me to have evaded the question.</p>

<p><span class="col_5281-5282" refersTo="page_1104"/>Hon. members know me well enough; I can talk around a point if I wish to! But I deliberately did not want to evade it, because I wanted to illustrate for all the world to see that when we say &#x201C;independence&#x201D;, we mean just that. As far as I am concerned--and I am saying this to hon. members now across the floor of the House&#x2014;if any of our Black peoples become independent, they will become independent in the same way as Lesotho or Ghana or Gabon or any other country in the world.</p>

<p>This has not yet been finalized, as I told the hon. member a moment ago. Sir, a Black people can do one of two things&#x2014;and this is not something impossible. They can say: &#x201C;Look, we are not going to become independent until such time as we have received all our land&#x201D;&#x2014;that is a fair attitude to adopt and it is their affair&#x2014;or they can say: &#x201C;We are going to become independent, for we have reason to trust that the Government will subsequently give us the other land that we have to receive,&#x201D; and the Government will give it to them. That it can do very easily. It is a question of transferring the land, for this land is owing to them. All that stands in the way of your being able to give it to them immediately is the fact that you do not have the money to purchase the land immediately, for there is a tremendous amount of money involved.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is necessary to purchase land in some cases because with the land that is still outstanding, one wants to achieve the maximum consolidation one is capable of achieving, and for that reason this is necessary.</p>

<p>But, Sir, since I am speaking now, I want to say a few words in that connection to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I want to discuss with him his policy in respect of Black representation and Coloured representation in this House. I think we must give this matter very serious thought. I want to begin by saying this to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, and this is my heartfelt conviction : Nothing which one can do in this country is going to stir up so much emotion and unleash so many forces which my hon. friend will not be able to bring under control again as bringing Coloured representation into this House of Assembly again. My hon. friend must understand this very clearly. Against this background I want to debate this matter with him this afternoon, and if it is possible, I want to make an urgent appeal to him to abandon this plan on which he is engaged. I do not think it is in the interests of anyone. It is not in the interests of the Whites; it is not in the interests of the non-Whites. This plan on which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is engaged is a dangerous one, and I shall tell him why. Sir, if one accepts the principle that the Black man, the Indians and the Coloureds have the right to be represented in this House&#x2014;and there is no doubt whatsoever that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition adopts the standpoint that they do have the right to be here&#x2014;then I really cannot see how one can refuse to concede that they should be represented here by their own people. That is the only moral thing to do. If one has accepted that they have the right to be here, then one must do what is the moral thing to do by saying that they should be represented here by their own people. But, Sir, I also want to submit this to the hon. Leader for his consideration : I know these people, all of them, probably better than any hon. member on the opposite side, and I am absolutely convinced that those people are not going to accept the insult which it implies. Not only is one going to cause frustration among these people, but one is also going to engender a terrible hate among them if one accepts the principle that they should be represented here but tells them that they cannot exercise such representation here themselves. But I want to go further.</p>

<p>If one concedes the principle to them that they may be represented here, the demand is bound to be made that they should be represented here according to their numbers, and one is going to have a perpetual gnawing at one; one is going to have perpetual frustration; one is going to have perpetual demands, for then one is responsible for their having come here. They will not have come here of their own accord; they will not be here only by invitation, but one says to them that they have the right to be represented here, and one will have to pay for that, and that account which one will have to pay will grow by the day.</p>

<p>No, in respect of the land I stand on a very different basis. In respect of the land Gen. Smuts and Gen.

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, surely that goes without saying. I do not know why the hon. member is putting that question to me. But Sir, I want to go further. I want to say to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that this plan is nowhere near implementation, and I cannot see how it will ever be implemented either, but let us, for the sake of argument, accept that <span class="col_5285-5286" refersTo="page_1106"/>it can be done, then the Leader of the Opposition is not even going to have unanimity within his own party in regard to these matters. After all, there are people within his party who do not subscribe to that standpoint that these representatives should be Whites. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout said in his characteristic way that it is a fool&#x2019;s paradise to accept that, and I want to know from the hon. the Leader of the Opposition where he stands, for he has not yet told us where he stands in this connection. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition must tell us whether he agrees with the hon. member for Bezuidenhout that it is a fool&#x2019;s paradise. But let us take a look now at all that it entails. I put this question to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I asked him: How long does he visualize this second stage, which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout says is a fool&#x2019;s paradise, will last&#x003F;</p>

<p>I should like to know now. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition went even further when he said here, in his presence, that that was only the opinion of the hon. member, and that also appears in Hansard. Now the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is pretending not to know, but surely the Leader of the Opposition was himself for a long time in favour of these representatives being Black representatives. He himself conceded to this, and he told us that he had done so because he had been under pressure at the time. I was even kind to him; he will remember it. I asked him whether the pressure had come from this side, and he said no, his own people had exerted such pressure on him that he had had to concede that these representatives should be Black people. But I want to debate the perniciousness of this matter further with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition along these lines. Suppose he were to win the election, with a majority of five. One of the first things he would do, I take it, would be to pass, with that small majority, that legislation to bring those 16 representatives into the House of Assembly in order to increase his majority to 21. And when they are here &#x2026; [Interjections.] But he is bringing them in here. The hon. members must not interrupt me now. They can debate this matter. It is their policy, and I can reply to them one by one, but I cannot reply to an entire chorus. But I want to go further. The hon. the Minister of Information quoted to him what Gen. Smuts had said about bringing in non-Whites to be the arbiters of White interests.</p>

He would go out with his hands free, but I want to know where the hon. the Leader of the Opposition stands in this connection. Can you understand now, Sir, why it cannot be taken amiss of me if I take into consideration that they can abolish the loading and the deloading, and that a front-bencher adopts this standpoint without being repudiated&#x003F; Can you understand, Sir, since I have stated the legal position and the consequences thereof, why I on my part have the right to warn the electorate and the people of South Africa by saying to them that the United Party is asking for only one chance, and after that they will see to the matter themselves&#x003F;</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I hope, Sir, that the situation will be reconsidered by the hon. gentleman, because he is embarking on an extremely dangerous course.</p>

<p>His course is dangerous in many other directions. He must try to attack the proposals of this side of the House in respect of non-European policy because his own policy is so indefensible in so many respects. You see, Sir, there are two aspects of his policy in particular which he cannot defend, and in respect of which it appears that he cannot see the end of the road. The first concerns the Cape Coloured people. The hon. gentleman knows that there is a great deal of dissatisfaction amongst those people at the present time. He knows that there have been warnings&#x2014; even by those nominated by him to the Coloured Persons Council. He knows that there have been warnings from the Police. He knows that many social workers in the country have already indicated what the dangers are in respect of that group of the population.</p>

<p>I say, Sir, that I have some sympathy for the hon. the Prime Minister; he is in a dilemma. He and his party have always said that there were only two alternatives in respect of non-European policy in South Africa. The first alternative is complete integration. The second alternative is separate development, and complete separation.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, which alternative is he following in respect of the Cape Coloured people&#x003F; He tells us that there is going to be no Colouredstan; and I agree with him. I think that that is a very wise decision, even if the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare is not always with him on that subject, even if we do not have his word as a member of the Cabinet that he believes a Colouredstan is impossible, and even if, until the day before yesterday, he was perhaps the alternative Prime Minister designate. People do not know what the policy of the party is.</p>

<p>Well, Sir, if it is not a Colouredstan, is it integration&#x003F; Is that the policy of the hon. gentleman in respect of the Cape Coloured people&#x003F; Some of the people in his party talk about a Colouredstan; some talk about moving further apart, and some talk about &#x201C;voller vennote met die Blankes&#x201D;. Of course this leads to a great deal more confusion, upset and unhappiness. By contrast, we have always accepted that there could be a third alternative. Our federal solution applies to that third alternative, which is neither integration nor a Colouredstan; it is a federal arrangement based on a common understanding and a common loyalty to one State. The trouble with this hon. Prime Minister is that he is making the same mistake as the hon. member for Houghton. They are trying to develop ultimate blueprints, but they are neglecting the present problems and are squabbling over things that may happen in the future, without having proper regard to the hurts and the problems of the present time.</p>

<p>Let us, in the light of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s remarks this afternoon, compare his plan and our plan for the Cape Coloured people. Obviously, if there is not going to be a Colouredstan, there must be representation for those Coloured people in this House at some time or other. Or does the hon. the Prime Minister say no, they won&#x2019;t&#x003F; Does the hon. the Prime Minister rule out for all time the representation of the Cape Coloured people in this House&#x003F; Then it is the most immoral and the most dangerous policy that could be followed by any party in South Africa. He talks about the dangers of my policy, about the danger of six representatives for the Coloured people in this House. But what of the dangers of never giving those people representation in this House or in any central Parliament&#x003F; Does he think that they are going to be satisfied with that&#x003F; The hon. the Prime Minister asked me whether they would be satisfied with six. But I want to ask him if they would be satisfied with none. His reply to me will be that he has never conceded the principle. What does that matter&#x003F; Does that make them any less unhappy&#x003F; How can they say that they have never conceded the principle&#x003F; Was it not they who took the Coloureds off the common roll and put them on a separate roll&#x003F; Was it not they who had separate representation in this House&#x003F;</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I am not arguing about the hon. gentleman having changed his policy. I am sure he is going to change it again. I am sure he is going to find that his policy is a dead end, and <span class="col_5291-5292" refersTo="page_1109"/>that he cannot get any further with it. If ever there was a policy to lead to unhappiness, rebellion, revolution and trouble in South Africa, it is the policy of that hon. gentleman in respect of the Cape Coloured people. Let us look at what is happening already in respect of the Cape Coloured people. When he established the Coloured Representative Council, we told him to make it wholly elected, but he would not listen. We told him to give it responsibility by way of taxing powers. We also told him to arrange for a liaison body with this House and not to liaise from the Cabinet to the appointed representatives that he has in that Coloured Representative Council. We told him that there were going to be frustrations, and we told him that it was going to lead to more and more difficulties. What is happening&#x003F; What have we had from just one Coloured leader in the last year&#x003F; That very Coloured leader nominated by the hon. the Prime Minister was dissatisfied with us because we did not give him &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D;. Our policy was a great disappointment to him. Only a week or so ago he was talking about the necessity for representation in the central Parliament for his people, but this morning we see a statement in the Press that he stands by separate development. Can this lead to any sort of continuity and certainty&#x003F; What will happen in time&#x003F; Is the hon. the Prime Minister going to give that Coloured Representative Council greater powers&#x003F; He is being urged on every side to go further &#x201C;om die einddoel van sy beleid te bereik&#x201D;. His own newspapers are writing about that sort of thing. There has never been more unhappiness amongst the Coloured people than at the present time. The frustration is building up to a degree that it is becoming quite explosive. The provincial council here in the Cape has deprived the Coloureds of a municipal franchise before ensuring that they have a proper alternative. I can go on with the various things that are irritating these people. What irritates them more than the sharp contrast between the treatment given a non-White from overseas and the treatment handed out to local non-Whites&#x003F; They talk about it. I do not know whether the hon. the Prime Minister knows. This raises the whole question of petty apartheid that is being applied at the present time. I do not like the phrase; I talk about public amenities. I believe that we have to reach a stage where there will have to be more local option and more freedom to the individual and less dictation from Pretoria as to what the situation should be in that regard. We have the situation again where the hon. the Prime Minister talks about their opportunities, but we still sit with the difficulties of job reservation in so far as it applies to them. We hear from the hon. the Minister that it is the Government&#x2019;s policy to limit the wage gap between Coloureds and Whites. We have had it from the hon. the Minister last session and yet no Government has ever done more to increase the disparity between the salaries paid to Coloureds and Whites in South Africa than the present Government.</p>

<p>I want to take the matter a little further with the hon. gentleman, because he knows as well as I do that one of the very big problems that arise with these people is the question of adequate training and adequate education. Is it his policy to assist to make funds available for compulsory education to be phased in for the Coloured people&#x003F; What steps is he prepared to take in that regard&#x003F; I can tell him that this is one of the big grievances, and he knows it. He has had discussions with them. I want to know whether he will allow the hon. the Minister of Community Development to go on moving Coloured people in terms of the Group Areas Act when there is still a vast shortage of housing for them and when the disparity in the numbers of Coloureds moved as opposed to Whites moved is so great that they feel that they have a legitimate grievance. They are talking about it to the hon. the Prime Minister. How does he think he will get these grievances settled&#x003F; How does he think he will get a situation in South Africa where he keeps the loyalty of those people, keeps them with us against the communists and against the terrorists&#x003F;</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>And you have done more to create housing problems than any other Government has done because of the number of Coloured families you have had to move. Sir. I do not want to go into detail on these things.</p>

<p><span class="col_5293-5294" refersTo="page_1110"/>I want to know from the hon. gentleman where this dead-end policy is leading us. He talks about the dangers and the limits of representation in this House. What is the danger involved in the policy of the hon. the Prime Minister&#x003F; Does he really think he can go on getting away with this sort of thing over the years&#x003F; Look at the tragedy of the Cape Coloured people at the present time. Their leadership class, their professional class, is becoming frustrated. It is becoming more and more anti-White; more and more of them are wanting to emigrate. There is an appalling brain drain amongst these people as they go overseas in search of opportunities for themselves and for their children. Tragically, they are not accepting responsibility towards their own people. What about the middle-class Coloureds at the present time&#x003F; They are having a vast lack of economic opportunities, because they cannot get their children apprenticed even though they are qualified. What artisans on the whole will not accept Coloured apprentices. They are limited to the few non-White artisans who are trained. If they are paid the rate for the job, they are certain that they are paid the minimum; they do not get the same wage for the same work. They resent very much the sitting of various commercial ventures near their areas. Then, tragically, there is a very big section of them, a section which I call the lower class or the less fortunate amongst the Coloured people. Unfortunately I think this group must represent round about 30 per cent or more of the Coloured population. There you have all the symptoms of the poverty syndrome in South Africa. You have degradation, alcoholism, illegitimacy, a high birth-rate, and you are heading for trouble unless something is done, and done quickly. What is the situation in which they find themselves&#x003F; They sit with the Coloured Representative Council, which does not have the power to take the necessary action; they sit with the Government which is frustrating them at virtually every turn and around every corner, and yet there are members on that side of the House who sit back and think of the days when Dr. D&#x00F6;nges spoke of &#x201C;five million hearts beating as one&#x2014; Coloured and White&#x201D;. This is one group in respect of which the hon. the Prime Minister is upon a dead-end road. However, it is not the only one.</p>

<p>There is yet another group, and that is the urban Bantu. Here again the hon. gentleman is on a dead-end road. I want to challenge him on this. Yesterday I said to him that the widening gap between the incomes of the different races might well be the gap through which Communism will breach the defenses of South Africa. I want to put to the hon. the Prime Minister the question of the policy of his party in this regard. I regard the urban Bantu as the flash-point of race relations in South Africa. Hon. members know what the situation is amongst them. They have seen this gap developing, but it is amongst them that the result of this gap is seen at its worst in South Africa at the present time. It exists with them more than with anyone else because of the policies of this Government which force them to work and to live under conditions which make it difficult for employers, either individually or collectively, to improve their situation, and in which the Bantu gets the worst of two worlds. He gets the worst of the world of being a labourer in a modern industrial society, and he gets the worst of the world of an unsophisticated citizen of an embryo homeland-state working in a foreign country. The experiences in both these worlds lead to resentment, resentment which is building up and of which the hon. the Prime Minister must be informed if he does not have knowledge of it yet. It is a very dangerous matter and I do not believe that we have ever had a satisfactory reply from either of his Ministers on the question of the urban Bantu in South Africa. I know why we have not had a reply. It is because it is the area in which his policy is falling down the worst, and they do not have an answer for it.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>They have no policy.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>There are three types of people involved, and I want to deal with them very briefly in the time at my disposal. Firstly, there is the Bantu living permanently in the White areas in townships where they have the right to stay for one reason or another. What does the policy mean to that Bantu&#x003F; It means to him that in most cases he has insecurity in his job. He may be allowed to do one of the better jobs while there is no White man available to do it, but the moment the White man turns up he may lose that job. He has no home ownership and in an overwhelming number of cases he has no real stake in the maintenance of law and order. He has no executive or administrative involvement in respect of the wellbeing of his own people in these areas. He <span class="col_5295-5296" refersTo="page_1111"/>has no adequate training for his jobs because there are no adequate training facilities available in the urban areas. The Government gives training of a kind in the homelands, but not in the urban areas. There is seldom adequate schooling for his children, and certainly not secondary schooling for his children. What is his position at the end of his working life&#x003F; He has no security that he can stay in that area where he has spent his whole life, because all sorts of pressures are being brought on him to force him to go back to the homeland, some of which he has probably never seen. His experiences mean that while he has been here, this wage gap has increased and he feels it is because of the restrictions which have been placed upon him. What are we offering that man to make him proof against communist propaganda and the sort of stories the agitators are telling him&#x003F; You are telling him he is going to get the vote in the homeland! That is the say he has in what is happening to him today &#x2014;a vote in the homeland. Does the hon. the Prime Minister really think he is going to keep those people satisfied with that sort of promise and that sort of political power&#x003F; Then he talks about the dangers of my policy in this House. The only dangers he really sees in my policy in this House are to the Nationalist Party, not to the White man in South Africa.</p>

<p>But there is a second type of man in the Bantu townships. That man is the contract labourer, the migratory labourer. That is not the man we are using on the frontier at the moment. The man we are using on the frontier at the moment is the permanent resident in the township. This is another type of man. He is here on contract; he is a migratory labourer. What does this policy mean to him&#x003F; No security, because he is here for his contract; that is all. No proper training, because there is none available. He is never sure whether at the end of the contract period he is going to be able to come back to the same boss. I know it is supposed to be guaranteed to him, but we know how often it does not happen. All the evil results of the migratory labour system are known to every church in South Africa and historically, have been the focus of all the trouble we have had in South Africa. There is a lack of mobility in offering his labour; his wages are low because nearly always employers have to employ more than they actually need because of the difficulties of getting replacements in times of pressure. There is little or no possibility of advancement. That could damn this policy right away.</p>

<p>But now, what does this policy mean to the employers of labour in South Africa and to South Africa itself&#x003F; First of all, the employer is faced with uncertainty and inefficiency in his labour force. That means low productivity and the inhibiting of wage increases. It means, as I have said before, having to employ more than he really wants to employ; it means a higher cost of production and cost of living to everybody in South Africa. Why is this security being denied them&#x003F; It is being denied them because the Government wants to try to push industries into border areas, where they really cannot protect these industries from overseas competition, except by giving them advantages, enabling them to compete unfairly, very often, with established industries in other parts of South Africa. What is the result&#x2014;check on the rate of development in South Africa; check on the growth of standards of living in South Africa; lower standards of living for everybody in South Africa and the prevention of that rapid economic development, which is so vital to South Africa to build up its strength to be able to stand up against the outside world that is threatening it at the present time. I want to say to the hon. the Prime Minister that the greatest bulwark against Communism in South Africa is a satisfied community. I relate that to his political plans in respect of these people. The hon. the Prime Minister seems to think that he has more chance of keeping these people satisfied with no representation in this House, as opposed to the limited representation which I am offering as the second stage to create machinery for consultation. Sir, what is the worry of the hon. the Prime Minister&#x003F; Sixteen representatives will come into this House, he says, who will all vote against the Nationalist Party.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Is that his faith in the policies that he has applied to the Bantu, Coloured and Indian people in South Africa in the 24 years that this Government has been in power&#x003F; Does he really want to tell me that that is all the confidence he has in the success of his policies&#x003F; We know, of course, that the real reason for putting the Coloureds on to the separate roll was that they did not vote for the Nationalist Party, and we know, of <span class="col_5297-5298" refersTo="page_1112"/>course, that the real reason for removing the four Coloured Representatives in this House, was that the Nationalist candicates who stood in those seats almost always lost their deposits. But, Sir, it is not necessary that it should always be so. There was a time when the Coloured people divided their political allegiance. Why should it not happen again if we can only get that party on the other side to adopt decent policies in respect of those people instead of keeping them on a dead-end road&#x003F; The hon. the Prime Minister has such tremendous confidence in the success of his policy in respect of the Bantu people; he has set them on the road to independence. He is going to offer them self-determination. I have told him that if they have reached the stage where, having been promised independence and having been prepared for it, they want it, we on this side of the House will not stand in their way. Does the hon. the Prime Minister despair of any Bantu representative coming to this House supporting his Government&#x003F; Is that the admission that I had from the hon. the Prime Minister this afternoon&#x003F; Is it not a shocking state of affairs&#x003F;</p>

<p>As far as this side of the House is concerned, we have said that we want to apply our policy in three stages. In the first stage we are going to deal with discriminatory legislation and legislation involving the rule of law and other matters, and we will try to raise the standard of living of all sections of the community. At the same time we will set about creating the machinery for consultation as to a federal constitution for South Africa. That will be done chiefly through the communal councils which we propose to create for each of the various groups. The Coloureds will have one; the detribalized urban Bantu who have lost their tribal affiliations will have another, and the various so-called homelands will have councils as well. We will have a proper machinery for consultation between them and this House, in which they can sit round a table to hammer out a future federal constitution for South Africa. Sir, there is no question of making any changes here, apart from what I have set out and guaranteed to the hon. gentleman, without a referendum of the White voters in which there is a substantial majority for the changes concerned.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister is back where he was, playing petty politics, as he did earlier on in the sesstion, about what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said or did not say, and a few other things. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout attended our national Congress, where this policy was put, and he accepted it wholeheartedly in all its aspects. He has said it publicly and he says it again. I say it, if he has not said it, loudly enough for the hon. gentleman to hear. The hon. the Prime Minister says that if the United Party were to win an election, they would promptly add representation to this House to strengthen their position. Sir, I wonder why the hon. gentleman always Judges others by himself.

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. VAN B. VILJOEN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition spoke mainly about the Coloureds and the urban Bantu. We shall speak about these matters again in due course, but I would at least like to ask this question : When has so much ever been done for a people as the National Party has done for the Coloureds during its period of rule&#x003F; More has been done for them by this Government than under any other political dispensation in South Africa. Sir, the hon. the Prime Minister asked the hon. the Leader of the Opposition a few very important, fundamental questions, to which he gave no reply whatsoever. But the Prime Minister will deal with him again at a later stage. A party which presents itself as an alternative government must, of course, be able to pass the test, and therefore, in the first instance, we expect the United Party to pass the test of having the necessary responsibility and honesty, just as the hon. the Prime Minister has, with great honour, passed this test throughout the years. There are only two ways one can test an alternative government, and that is by asking what plan they have for exercising authority in South Africa if they should ever come into power. What do they believe&#x003F; What is their philisophy of life&#x003F; The second question we can ask here in South Africa is how they rule in Natal. If we asked these two questions we shall quickly find that their plan would have disastrous consequences in South Africa, as very clearly indicated here this afternoon by the hon. the Prime Minister. A few days ago the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said that race relations and racial separation would be left to the public to a large extent. Sir, let us ask this question : How does that party rule in Natal&#x003F; It is very clear why hon members on that side are so sensitive about this language question. The United Party&#x2019;s record in Natal in respect of relations between the language groups and the neglect of Afrikaans, is not a pretty story.</p>

<speech by="#greyling">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>A tragic story.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#viljoen">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. VAN B. VILJOEN</person>:</from>

<p>The serious neglect of the Afrikaans language and of Afrikaans-speaking people in Natal, I myself have experienced. It took me five years of fighting and of threats on a city council before I could even bring them to acknowledge my language, and that in a United Party-controlled city council in Natal. Sir, uniligual documents of the Natal Provincial Administration are still legion today. We must take note of the fact that on statutory boards appointed by the provincial administration, Afrikaans is neglected to a serious degree; that only a few Afrikaans-speaking people serve on statutory boards, and usually we find that they only have Afrikaans names and cannot speak Afrikaans properly.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#greyling">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>That is what we call a renegade.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#viljoen">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. VAN B. VILJOEN</person>:</from>

<p>With only a few exceptions, there are quite a number of statutory boards in Natal which are exclusively uniligual; there is not a single Afrikaans-speaking person on those boards.</p>

<p>But let us look at Natal&#x2019;s poor financial position Natal has been in throughout the years. For 60 years the Natalians have been paying the highest taxes in South Africa. Before this new dispensation came into operation, the provincial taxes were in the region of 40 per cent. In the other provinces they were more or less 30 per cent. In spite of the fact that Natal&#x2019;s revenue increased by 44 per cent, before the advent of the new dispensation, in no way did they succeed in establishing any capital throughout the years. If we look at the other provinces we shall find that the Cape could establish 8 per cent of its own capital, the Free State 16 per cent and the Transvaal up to 30 per cent. We hear so frequently from that side of the House that this Government now wants to adopt autocratic powers for itself. Are they aware of the fact that in no other province is there a system of committees of inquiry existing where evidence is taken in secret and no legal representation is allowed&#x003F;</p>

<p>But let us look for a moment at how that party handles education in Natal. It is their declared policy to have dual medium or parallel medium education. In the first place, if one were to look at the White <span class="col_5301-5302" refersTo="page_1114"/>population ratio between the Transvaal and Natal, one would find that it is four to one as far as the training of teachers is concerned. But as far as the training of teachers is concerned, the Transvaal trains ten teachers for every one teacher trained in Natal. In other words, throughout the years Natal has been living off the other provinces as far as the training of teachers is concerned.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#viljoen">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. VAN B. VILJOEN</person>:</from>

<p>This so-called dual medium education policy of theirs, which they have wanted to implement throughout the years, has never come into its own. The fact remains that 74 per cent of all English-speaking children in Natal attend single medium private schools. This shows how sincere that side of the house is in respect of their declared policy. In the five years up to 1970 they built 19 single medium schools in Natal and only one parallel medium school. How does this compare with the rest of the country&#x003F; In the Free State 84 per cent of the schools are parallel medium schools and in the Cape the figure is 46 percent. As far as the planning of schools is concerned, the story is a tragic one. The whole province is crowded with prefabricated classrooms. With Newcastle now on the threshhold of this tremendous development, there was recently the tragic situation of the provincial administration having to go to Iscor to negotiate for the building of their schools. This is a situation we can no longer tolerate in Natal. That party comes along with a flourish and speaks of the voice of the parent. Parents have no say whatsoever in education in Natal. The parent advisory bodies cannot act in any executive capacity. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>It seems to me the hon. the Prime Minister cannot make a new speech without dragging in a few old speeches of mine, but seeing that he has done so now, I merely want to rectify a few matters. Firstly, there is the question of loading and deloading. I just want to put the record right by saying that I never referred to the question of loading or deloading; that is not what it was about. My objection is not to loading or deloading. I stated a standpoint based on principle&#x2014;I shall come to the standpoint of the party in a moment&#x2014;namely that a parliament (and this applies to our Parliament) should be a real reflection of the wishes of the electorate which sends the people to Parliament. In other words, it should be truly representative of the wishes of the people who vote. I think this is the essense of a democratic parliament, and I want to ask the hon. the Prime Minister: Does he not accept that&#x003F; Does he not believe that this Parliament should be a true reflection of the votes of the electorate&#x003F; I would be glad if he would say whether he rejected it. There was a time when he rejected democracy.</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>That is another matter. The loading is a way, a method, of dealing with the matter I want to put it like this to the hon. the Prime Minister; I admit we have a problem with large constituencies; but you have it in a country such as Germany as well, and although I do not want to suggest now that we must necessarily follow other countries, Germany, for example, has a system whereby, in an election, one votes on a constituency basis&#x2014;they also have large and small constituencies&#x2014;but in addition to this there is a panel, so that when voting has taken place for the constituencies with their loading and deloading, there is a way of compensating the parties if necessary; the various parties have a panel of candidates so that, if a party has gained a greater proportion of votes than seats in terms of the system of constituencies (with loading and deloading), it is compensated from the panel.</p>

<p>My argument has never concerned loading or deloading as such. You may retain loading and deloading, and there are methods in other countries where you have this, but over and above this you have is a supplementary system of voting which makes Parliament a true reflection of the wishes of the electorate. This is the principle I support, namely that this Parliament should be a true reflection of what the electorate wants. And I think it is a very legitimate standpoint. I was prepared to give the Prime Minister a frank reply, but I should like him to be so kind as to give me a frank <span class="col_5303-5304" refersTo="page_1115"/>reply to my question. Does he agree that this Parliament should be representative of the true wishes of the electorate&#x003F;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>What system&#x003F; The system in Germany is a proportional one. We have the same system as in Britain, which has even larger constituencies.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I understand all that, but I want the hon. Leader just to accept this point of mine, i.e. that in other countries there are various models according to which one may ensure that one&#x2019;s parliament is truly representative of the wishes of the electorate. Germany, for example, has the most modern constitution, because it got a completely new constitution after the last war.</p>

<p>Other countries have old constitutions and we also inherited the old British Constitution. But I do not want to quarrel about that. As the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said here, the two sides of Parliament can get together and work out a system. I only want to put one question. I have pleaded that this Parliament should at all times be a true reflection of the wishes of the electorate. And I would be suspicious of a person who told me he rejected this.</p>

<p>I want to go further now and say to the hon. the Prime Minister that he should reply to us in this regard. It is a matter we are discussing in the United Party, and at the moment it is the standpoint of the party that it supports the present system, and I accept that. But I still believe that, without abolishing the loading and the deloading because of the geographical circumstances of the country, we should devise a system which would make this Parliament a true reflection of the wishes of the electorate. [Interjections.] I simply cannot see how a person who calls himself a democrat can really oppose this standpoint of mine.</p>

But the point I want to make to the hon. the Prime Minister now, is this: He knows that he heard from the hon. the Leader of the Opposition today that the policy, the direction of the United Party and the goal it sets itself, is a federal system and that the others are all stages on the road to that. I am a strong supporter of the federal idea. But one thing I cannot endorse is the Prime Minister&#x2019;s artificial campaign in regard to Bantu representation, <span class="col_5305-5306" refersTo="page_1116"/>as is the present policy of the party. From 1910 to 1936 we had the Bantu on a common voters&#x2019; roll. There was no revolution.</p>

<p>Subsequently Gen. Hertzog and Gen. Smuts placed them on a separate roll, where they stayed from 1936 to 1961, and the Bantu had three representatives here and four in the Senate. But what is so interesting, Mr. Chairman, is that all the hon. members sitting there who supported the 1948 manifesto of the National Party&#x2014;the apartheid manifesto&#x2014;know that it provided for seven representatives in the Senate &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. BOTHA</person>:</from> 

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to react much to what was said by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. His argument concerning the fool&#x2019;s paradise was not very convincing; it was rather vague and I believe the Prime Minister, in his competent way, will in fact react to that. As regards the hon. member&#x2019;s story of loading and deloading, I can merely say that I think the deloading which is going to take place, as going to be the deloading of the United Party in Oudtshoorn.</p>

<p>Listening to this debate, classic as it was, I was reminded of a recent leading article in the <i>Sunday Times</i> which dealt with &#x201C;the U.P. Shake-up&#x201D;. It stated that &#x201C;this shake-up marked a clear shift in the policy of the United Party&#x201D;. After this &#x201C;shake-up&#x201D; had taken place, there was, according to the <i>Sunday Times,</i> a dramatic &#x201C;far-reaching statesman-like decision&#x201D; by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. He &#x201C;dramatically&#x201D; accepted the independence of the homelands as an accomplished fact. I think we have come to a second political &#x201C;shake-up&#x201D;, and in my opinion the Prime Minister and other speakers have shaken the United Party in an extremely competent way and successfully. I think it has been shown here indisputably in the interests of national unity that the United Party is the one who incites and is responsible for racial hatred between party and party in this country. It is not only the National Party and its speakers who say this, but none other than the <i>Sunday Times</i> and the writer Serfontein also endorse and confirm that Boere-haters are undoubtedly sitting on that side of this House. It is said that one cannot get rid of a member of the United Party in the Free State, that one can never convert him; he must die out. I believe that a Serfontein with the <i>Sunday Times</i> is possibly something worse than a member of the United Party in the Free State. I do not know how much Afrikaner blood Serfontein still has in his veins, but the little he has, perhaps 0,015 per cent, made him talkative and evoked a reaction from him on this occasion. What did he say&#x003F; He said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For decades most English-speaking South Africans and influential sections of the Opposition have been doing a grave injustice to Afrikaans culture. The actions and attitudes of many English-speaking South Africans are nothing but an insult to the Afrikaner.</block>

<p>We know it is true. Mr. Chairman, we remember. It is true. We remember how the Afrikaner had to go about with his hat in his hand during the war years. To whom did we have to go&#x003F; We had to go to collect the alms handed out by the high <span class="col_5307-5308" refersTo="page_1117"/>and mighty leaders of the United Party. The United Party should remember that it lays claim to serving as the alternative Government of this country. It should remember that it in fact represents the majority of the English-speaking people in this country. It should remember that what it says as well as the example it sets, manifests itself outside. That is what the people outside see of it; that is what they believe and that is where the example comes from. As a result of that example set by the United Party, we already have the phenomenon in South Africa that there is a type of arrogant jingo for whom the National Party has been governing this country too well for too long. This type makes his appearance and talks continually, in season and out of season, in derogatory terms of the Afrikaner in this country. We have an example of that in the most recent edition of <i>Commercial Opinion.</i> Here we have an article by Dr. R. Jordan, chairman of the Johannesburg Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Dr. R. Jordan. This is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The overwhelming majority of decision-makers in the Public Service, on statutory boards and in State-owned corporations are selected from those who unconditionally support official Government policy.</block>

<p>That is a disgraceful reflection on the Public Service. But he said more than this. He also said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is too little brain-power available amongst the elite that runs all these boards and wields all this authority. There are just not enough outstanding men to do all the necessary jobs. Many have grown up in rural surroundings and long for the country life of their youth. Urban life and its problems remain alien and unwelcome to them.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the only thing that is insinuated here by Dr. Jordan, is that the Afrikaner is a &#x201C;backvelder&#x201D; and that he does not fit in. He said this because he knows that the composition of the Public Service is mainly Afrikaans. That is why he made this statement. I say that this is the statement of an Afrikaner-hater and that it is nothing but a deliberate, purposeful dig at the Afrikaner in this country. The National Party has learnt one thing. That is that as a result of the United Party&#x2019;s incapacity and sterility, its political conviction is situated just below its gullet, and that it no longer has any conscience. I am referring to the 1970 election in the constituency of Ermelo, when the United Party fought that election in very close alliance with the H.N.P. and in which Dr. Hertzog, a political weakling with whom they made common cause, was exploited. Some traditional U.P. supporters of whom there are many in the Eastern Transvaal and who have not yet heard that Jan Smuts is dead, joined the organization of the H.N.P. in an active capacity. In a systematic and impudent way they went from house to house to visit Nationalists and they said that they had resigned from the United Party and had joined the organization of the H.N.P. The one and only idea was to sow dissension in the National Party. In a shameless way they used the slogan from house to house that the National Party was the party which was doing too much for the kaffir and that for that reason they had left the United Party and joined the H.N.P. When people say now &#x201C;Vorster faces a new challenge to leadership&#x201D;, I want to say I think it is precisely the other way round. After listening to the debate conducted in this House, I must say that if there is a leadership which is in question, it is that of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I think the question we are asking ourselves is only how long it will still take. I believe that the entire United Party will go to the Progressive Party without a bequest or a will.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I find great difficulty in reacting to the speech of the hon. member who has just sat down because it was inaudible. However, I got the impression that he was trying to revive the debate on &#x201C;Afrikanerhater&#x201D; so eloquently introduced into this House by the Minister of Defence. That gives me the opportunity of making an appeal to the hon. the Prime Minister. I want to make this appeal very seriously. He has given us an assurance on more than one occasion that he wants unity and better understanding, less bitterness and less vilification, I take it, between the Afrikaans and English-speaking people of this country. I take it that he will condemn <i>ex-parte</i> <span class="col_5309-5310" refersTo="page_1118"/>accusations, accusations without any foundation, by the one race group against the other. I want to appeal to him to have a look at the speech of the hon. Minister of Defence, who started this whole unhappy argument.</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I shall tell you that. I want to refer to p. D. 2 of the Minister&#x2019;s typed Hansard. He wanted to know whether &#x201C;die koningseun van Musgrave&#x201D; could speak Afrikaans. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Kan die agb. lid dit doen&#x003F; Ek daag die agb. lid, mnr. Emdin, uit om op te staan &#x2026; As huile dit nie doen nie en tog nog Afrikaans kan praat, dan s&#x00EA; ek dat dit erger is. Dan doen hulle dit nie uit minagting &#x2026;</block>

<p>*Is it a principle which the Prime Minister accepts, i.e. that if members of this House are able to speak another language and do not do so, they are doing it out of contempt&#x003F; Let us have clarity about that, because Hansard shows that the majority of the members opposite have never spoken English in this House. When I speak of members, I am referring to the members outside the Cabinet. Are they doing so out of contempt for English&#x003F; Is this the principle, the basis on which we build race relations in South Africa, or do we respect each other&#x2019;s rights to use ones&#x2019; own language or the other language as one thinks fit&#x003F; The hon. the Minister went further. On p. D.3 he said the following of the English-speaking members of this House&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In daardie party sit daar elemente in hierdie Raad en daarbuite wat die Afrikaner haat.</block>

<p>I deny it. I know my colleagues in the United Party in this House better than any Nationalist does. There is not one whose attitude in respect of the Afrikaner is not sound and good. Then the hon. member for Musgrave rose on a point of order. He felt hurt by the insult and asked Mr. Speaker whether it was permissible. There was a long discussion on that, after which Mr. Speaker ruled that it was not a point of order. It was his right, but then the Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ek herhaal dat die agb. lid wat daar sit &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is the hon. member for Musgrave&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; Afrikaans so minag dat hy die Afrikaner nie kan toespreek nie.</block>

<p>It is untrue, because the hon. member for Musgrave can speak Afrikaans. Perhaps he cannot do it as well as the hon. members opposite, but it is perfectly passable. Therefore it is untrue. Why should that accusation be levelled against an English-speaking member on this side without any justification except that he does not address this House in Afrikaans&#x003F; Then followed what was the culmination. Another discussion took place between the hon. member and Mr. Speaker. When it was over, the hon. the Minister of Defence said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die agb. lid vir Durban Musgrave is &#x2019;n Afrikanerhater.</block>

<p>This is on record, and goes into the world like that. The only justification for it is that the hon. member for Durban Musgrave does not address this House in Afrikaans, while the same thing applies to hon. members opposite as far as English is concerned. Now I want to ask something of the Prime Minister, something which may help us a great deal. He is the man who said he wanted deeds. Here is an opportunity for him to prove that he is willing to do deeds. I do not want the hon. the Prime Minister to repudiate the Minister; all I am asking of him is to rise and to say whether he agrees that if a person addresses this House in his language and does so often or regularly, then he hates the other language. Let him tell us that he does not agree with what was said, i.e. that the hon. member for Musgrave, to be specific, is an Afrikaner-hater for the reasons advanced. If he does not do so. I would have to say to my regret that all his protestations and fine sounding words of yesterday mean nothing to me, and I am sure to the people of South Africa. He has the opportunity now.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Will you just give me a chance, please&#x003F; I should like to raise it on the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote only in regard to one point. It is said in insurance circles in Johannesburg that the matter was brought to the attention of the Prime Minister in 1969 and in 1970. Steps were taken only in 1971. I merely want to know now whether the people who maintain that they brought it to the attention of the Prime Minister, are telling the truth or whether the facts they brought to his attention, were not important enough for the Prime Minister to react to them. I merely want him to tell us why, if the matter was raised with him, it took two years before any steps were taken. That is all. I want to raise this on the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote.</p>

<p>Thirdly I should like to register a protest because the Prime Minister neglects to reply to questions of fundamental importance to the people of South Africa, and because he is doing what he did last year as well, and that is to try to avoid pointed, responsible questions put to him by introducing into the debate new matters, usually of a highly controversial nature, which, because he holds the office he does, will enjoy attention from the public and distract attention from the actual matters we raise.</p>

<p>I am referring specifically to the question of labour and the use of South Africa&#x2019;s manpower which was raised by the hon. member for Hillbrow and myself&#x2014;who happen to be the chairman and the secretary of the labour group of the United Party. I want to complain particularly about the fact that the Prime Minister did not reply to the questions of my friend, the hon. member for Hillbrow, concerning the wage gap existing between White and non-White. In my opinion, and in the opinion of the United Party and of the businessmen of South Africa belonging to both parties and of all race groups, this is one of the bottlenecks, one of the danger points in South African life.</p>

The Prime Minister dealt with this matter at the International Press Conference he held last year. He gave his reply. I take it that he believed what he said; and what he said, is true, as far as it goes. But he also showed that he did not understand the position fully. I am not saying this to be derogatory, because I am seeking clarity for him, for myself and for all of us.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister then told him that he does not even have unanimity in his party, because the hon. member for Bezuidenhout does not feel the same way about this matter as he does. Then the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said that he does in fact feel the same way. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout spoke at the Transvaal congress of the United Party, and he may tell me whether he did in fact say the words I am going to quote or not. On the occasion of that congress he said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

The hon. member spoke so fast, and he was so excited, that I could not understand what his problem was in regard to the Transkei.

<p>No, he did not. He said they would become independent and that subsequently negotiations would take place in respect of their final extent and their final borders, and by those means the hon. the Prime Minister wants to cast a bone of contention between independent Bantu countries and an independent South Africa, something for which the people will perhaps have to suffer for their next 10 generations. It was the most irresponsible statement I have ever heard. But I do not want to go into it. With reference to the speech made by the hon. member for Wolmaransstad, the hon. the Prime Minister should tell us something more than he did when he spoke recently, after my hon. friend next to me had put a question to him about the borders of the Bantustans and the land which would be allocated to them, and referred to the schedules of the 1936 Act.</p>

<p>No, I am seeking information.

They define territories and areas, but not borders. The hon. the Prime Minister must admit that in terms of the Schedules to the 1936 Act, the districts of Maclear or Elliot may become part of the Bantustan. The uncertainty of the Whites in these districts has by no means been resolved by the Prime Minister&#x2019;s statement. Sir, unfortunately I cannot pursue this matter, because I was engaged in a discussion with the Prime Minister which I should like to finish.</p>

<p>In one sentence the hon. the Minister of Planning has now described the biography of the Nationalist Party. Sir, I want to speak to the hon. the Prime Minister again about the question of the wage gap, the income gap, between Whites and non-Whites in South Africa, which in my opinion and in that of every economic student in South Africa, is the greatest danger-point of all in South Africa. At his International Press Conference on 22nd November of last year, he replied to a question. I have already said that the Prime Minister had to reply off the cuff, therefore I am making many allowances for that. He said, for example&#x2014;I am reading from the official report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There must be no discrimination as far as the wage or salary&#x2014;if you want to call it that way&#x2014;is concerned between White and non-White.</block>

<p>He was referring to the provisions of the Industrial Conciliation Act and the Wage Act. He said that in terms of those Acts no discrimination was allowed&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">So there is no difference between the two races whatsoever.</block>

<p>I assume he was referring to the provisions of the legislation; that it was not a general statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A non-White Coloured bricklayer in the Western Cape, a Coloured carpenter, receives exactly the same wages according to the Industrial Conciliation Act as any White person.</block>

<p>It is perfectly true. This is the principle of equal pay for equal work (the rate for the job), which was written into the Act by the old South African Party when the Act was passed in 1924, and it still forms part of the Act. The Prime Minister was perfectly correct. Then the Prime Minister said there was no ceiling as far as the wages of non-Whites were concerned, and that he wanted to grant that thousands of non-Whites were earning more than Whites. That may be true. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is not a question that all the Whites earn better salary and have a higher standard of living than all the non-Whites in South Africa. You know that is not the position at all.</block>

<p>Sir, what the Prime Minister said there is perfectly true, it would be perfectly true if it were the whole story. But did he want to suggest that in real life there was not in fact a tremendous gap between the wages of Whites and non-Whites in South Africa&#x003F;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>The point I want to make is that in practice, as a result of the reclassification of jobs and the awards that are made under the Wage Act and under the Industrial Conciliation Act, the non-Whites are paid much, much less than the Whites. The hon. the Prime Minister himself recently&#x2014;I think in this debate&#x2014; said that their had been an increase in the wages of Whites over the past few years of 400 per cent and, in the case of non-Whites, an increase of 300 per cent, so the gap must be widening. That is my point. I want to concede that if we can make proper use of our labour force in this country, of all our resources, we cannot immediately pay everybody the rate for the job, except where there is a danger of immediate competition between White and non-White for the same job; then you must pay the rate for the job. But under the system of job classification or job determination, you can have discrimination.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I hope you will not take it amiss of me if I try to be calm after that tirade. I would rather come back to my argument with the hon. the Prime Minister. But what roused my interest in the speech made by the hon. member for Brits, as well as in the previous speech made by the Prime Minister, is the sudden fear which has developed, i.e. that if representatives of the non-Whites were to enter Parliament, it would mean the end of the Nationalist Party.</p>

<p>Oh yes! I cannot understand how hon. members opposite can repudiate their Prime Minister so soon.

We may conduct debates in this Parliament, but we may not disregard the records, and we may not repudiate the hon. the Prime Minister half an hour after he has spoken; at least, not if we belong to his party. Now I want to put a question specifically to the Nationalist Party. When they hurled the reproach at the United Party in the past&#x2014;also in the recent past&#x2014; that no non-White of any significance supported our policy, did they do so knowing they were telling an untruth&#x003F;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I withdraw. The hon. member for Potchefstroom asked me to prove whether they had ever said that the United Party did not have the support of the non-Whites. I want to quote from a speech which the hon. member concerned, that same hon. member, the hon. member for Potchefstroom, made in Parliament the other day, namely on 1st February, 1972. I shall quote from the Hansard of 1st February, column 165. According to the Hansard, the hon. member for Potchefstroom, Mr. Le Grange, asked whether we could mention the names of non-Whites who accepted the policy as far as representation in this House was concerned. He said we could not mention any such names. Then he went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is because the Bantu of South Africa know that the United Party is being politically dishonest with them. I challenge them here to quote any responsible Bantu who is prepared to accept the policy of the United Party. But it will not be accepted, for the simple reason that no Bantu &#x2026;</block>

<p>Not &#x201C;responsible Bantu&#x201D;, but &#x201C;no&#x201D; Bantu&#x2014;</p>

<p>A little later in his speech he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Today one has those revolts and petitions for civil rights. Now I say there are only two ways open to the Bantu in South Africa, i.e. the way advocated by the National Party and the way advocated by the hon. member for Houghton.</block>

<p>The hon. member said there, in the first place, that no Bantu supported our policy because we were politically dishonest. From that we are entitled to conclude that the Bantu support the policy of the hon. members opposite, because they are supposed to be politically honest. In that case, what are they scared of&#x003F; Surely the test is whether they have confidence that their policy will receive the support of the people. The hon. the Prime Minister said that if we were to carry out our policy and there were representatives of the non-Whites on our side, the United Party would be in power for ever.</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Very well, let us say for the sake of argument that I cannot mention the name of any Bantu leader. In that case, what does it mean when the Prime Minister says that that bloc of 16 representatives would keep the Nationalist Party out of power for the rest of the existence of this Parliament&#x003F; No, one must be consistent. The Bantu either support the United Party, or they do not support the United Party. The Prime Minister&#x2019;s argument is that they would support the United Party. At least, they would not support the Nationalist Party. That is the point. The hon. member for Potchefstroom is my witness, because it is recorded here in Hansard. It is also recorded in Hansard that he said there were only two alternatives. If that is the case, I want to ask him now what we are debating this evening. What is the significance of the major speech the Prime Minister made before dinner this evening&#x003F; At that stage the subject was the third choice, namely the alternative of the United Party.</p>

<p>The hon. member says now it is a dangerous one, but it cannot be dangerous if it does not exist. After all, he said in January that there were no alternatives except his and that of the hon. member for Houghton. Now I have to hear that our policy is dangerous, <span class="col_5329-5330" refersTo="page_1128"/>but it is supposed to be something that does not exist. What is one to think of the Nationalist Party which is scared out of its wits by something that does not exist&#x003F; I want to come back now to the Prime Minister, because this is a very serious matter. At the International Press Conference he said the rate for the job applied in South Africa. That is true. He said there was no ceiling on what the non-Whites could achieve in South Africa. That is true. However, earlier in this debate he said, if one analyses the figures he gave, that White wages had increased fourfold and non-White wages threefold. Therefore the gap is becoming wider. Up to now he has evaded the question put to him by my Leader and the hon. member for Hillbrow. He ran away from it and spoke about 16 Bantu representatives, and now he should tell me and the people frankly whether he regards it as a sound or an unsound situation that this tremendous gap should exist and should be getting wider and wider under the Nationalist Party&#x003F;</p>

<p>But he says his policy is to narrow it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>He says his policy is to narrow it, and he should tell us now what he is going to do in order to narrow it. The Industrial Conciliation Act and the Wage Act do not narrow it. The Industrial Conciliation Act was passed by the United Party in 1924, and the old S.A. Party placed the Wage Act on the Statute Book prior to the passing of the Industrial Conciliation Act. These are United Party Acts, and we know them. They are doing splendid work, but it is not their function to narrow the gap. No provisions are contained in those Acts for narrowing this gap. What is the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy for narrowing that gap&#x003F; There is only one way of narrowing the gap. We cannot decrease the wages of the Whites; we must increase the wages of the non-Whites. We should make them more productive so that they may earn higher wages. We should train them, educate them and coach them. What is his policy in that respect&#x003F; He must not tell me it is his policy to achieve those things in the reserves or on the borders of the reserves. As long as the Prime Minister and I and our children are alive, the reserves and the border areas will not be able to make the contribution to the employment of non-Whites which the White areas of South Africa are able to make. I want to come back to the question I put to the Prime Minister in my previous speech &#x003F;.nd which was not replied to, namely what use is it to us if, according to the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education, the Bantu are trained as artisans in the reserves &#x2026;</p>

<p>According to the Constitution they are the reserves, and I confine myself to the Acts of South Africa, and not to the visions and fantasies of the hon. the Deputy Minister. According to him they will be trained to become full-fledged artisans under more favourable conditions than those that apply in the case of White apprentices. I want to know where they are going to work. If they are to work in the reserves or on the borders of the reserves, it would possibly be a contribution towards solving the race problem in South Africa, but this would be useless and meaningless for solving the problems which arise from the wage gap. In my lifetime and in our lifetime there will be no real change in the pattern of industrial development in South Africa so that the reserves and the border areas may make a significant contribution towards eliminating the wage gap in South Africa. We are not dealing with what is going to happen in a 100 years&#x2019; time. What are we going to do in our lifetime, and the Prime Minister is as old as I am&#x003F; These are the questions from which the hon. the Prime Minister is running away from, and instead of facing them, he came forward with an emotional speech to the effect that he was afraid that the non-White representatives in this Parliament would not support him.

In other words, it is laid down that the policy to be followed is the one that hon. member is supposedly in favour of, and that is the rate for the job. In both these Acts the wages and conditions of service are laid down for the work which is done and not for the person. The hon. member ought to know this. What the hon. member does not know either, is that as far as the Bantu are concerned, virtually the whole of the engineering industry &#x2026; He must listen now and not sit there conducting a conversation.

How must the Bantu be trained&#x003F; The usual way in which an artisan is trained is that he is enrolled as an apprentice, serves his period of apprenticeship and is then accepted as a skilled artisan. When I was Minister of Labour I laid down provisions for the first time and put a Bill through for Bantu to be trained as building workers in their own areas, where they can then be used. These hon. members do not know what they are talking about.

It was the Boer War, because the Boers shot the English. It was not an English War at all. It was only an English War for the children of the &#x201C;Jingoes&#x201D;. [Interjections.] It was our war and the English are not going to get it. [Interjections.] We, the descendants of the people who fought in that war, do not want to fight that war all over again.

It is true that there was a time the Afrikaner could justifiably feel that his language and his traditions <span class="col_5337-5338" refersTo="page_1132"/>were in danger, if one can believe the history as I learnt it.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Yes &#x2026; [Interjections.] But I know we still have people in this country today who do not like an Afrikaner. I heard that during the last election. I heard how they voted in Sea Point. Certain people of the Progressive Party said, &#x201C;Vote against the Afrikaner&#x201D;. That is true. I raised objections with the highest authority in that party, who will still be able to remember this. I did so openly. [Interjections.] No, wait a minute, but I also heard that Afrikaans-speaking people had acted in a similar way on various occasions. I am thinking particularly of Port Elizabeth. There was an Afrikaans-speaking person with an English name who stood for the United Party, and the Nationalist Party shouted, &#x201C;Vote against the Englishman&#x201D;. All I want to say, is that there are such English-speaking people who do not like the Afrikaner, but they are not in the United Party. [Interjections.] There are Afrikaners who do not like the English. I believed that they were not in the Nationalist Party either. I thought they were with Albert Hertzog. But it seems to me Albert Hertzog does not have all his people with him yet. Some of Albert Hertzog&#x2019;s people are still to be found in other places. I have listened to this debate, and what the hon. the Minister of Defence said did not worry me a great deal. He and I grew up in politics together. In 1936 he was appointed organizing secretary&#x2014;and so was I, in the same area. You can imagine, Sir, what went on there. When I first stood for election, Sir, who do you think the Nationalist Party put up against me&#x003F; It was the Minister of Defence! And who do you think got a hiding&#x003F; He did! So the two of us grew up together. His politics do not worry me. I want to say today that I am grateful that the sum total of this debate amounted to this. I accept the word of both these two great men, the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, that they are going to make it their aim through word and deed to bring the people of South Africa, the English-speaking people and the Afrikaners, closer together. [Interjections.] Do you hear the objections we get from some people, Mr. Chairman&#x003F; I did not discriminate. I did not say my Leader was better than the Prime Minister, but do you hear what is being said, Sir, even from Ministerial benches&#x003F; When I said that, there were objections. I shall tell you why, Sir, and I want to say this to the hon. the Prime Minister. There was something that worried me more than anything else. We are living in a time in which the White man in South Africa finds himself in what is perhaps the most dangerous position since South Africa was founded. If we do not have national unity now, when will we have it&#x003F; What is the use of some of the members opposite becoming &#x201C;verlig&#x201D; on the colour question, but becoming &#x201C;verkramp&#x201D; on the English-Afrikaans question&#x003F; I listened to the hon. the Minister of Health. Is he here&#x003F; I am sorry he is not here. Do you know, Sir, what he said and did&#x003F; I think he did far more harm than the Minister of Defence. I cannot see how he can stay on in the Cabinet. Do you know what he said, Sir&#x003F; He referred to the hon. member for Turffontein and said, &#x201C;There sits a Fourie for whom Jopie Fourie is no hero&#x201D;. &#x201C;Who is his hero&#x003F;&#x201D; he asked; &#x201C;A Louis Botha!&#x201D; We had a remark from one of the Nationalist Party members in reply to that statement. I do not want to mention his name. He said Louis Botha was a traitor.</p>

<p>What must the civilized nations of the world think of us when the two greatest South Africans, heroes of the Boer War, the first and second Prime Ministers of South Africa, can so easily be held up as traitors to their own people&#x003F; What then about you and me.

Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister of Health went further. He said: The Nationalists must have an anchor, a source of inspiration. They have to be able to cast that anchor. His anchor is Jopie Fourie.</p>

<p>I have the greatest respect for the courage and heroism of Jopie Fourie. But, Mr. Chairman, when a Government finds itself in a time of crisis, I will never be able to <span class="col_5339-5340" refersTo="page_1133"/>approve of its officers committing treason against that Government. It does not matter what the circumstances are.</p>

<p>I now want to put a question to the hon. the Prime Minister. I am sorry I have to do this, but I think it is necessary that this be said in public. We are today using persons of different colour in the Caprivi Strip and elsewhere. Let us leave aside for a moment what the circumstances were as far as Jopie Fourie was concerned; I do not accept the story that he hoisted the white flag. But I am asking any Nationalist now : Is that the example, are these the heroes whose example you want the coloured races in South Africa to follow&#x003F; When this country is in danger, when one wears the uniform of this country, should they be able to defect to the enemy&#x003F;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, that party and its leadership cannot and may not take over the Government of this country, because, in the first place, they do not understand their own Constitution, and, in the second place, they completely fail to understand the way of life in the Republic&#x2014;the race relations, the social life.

<p>I withdraw them, Mr. Chairman. That party and its leadership represent neither English nor Afrikaans-speaking people, nor the Bantu in this country. What Government&#x2014;now I am talking of the Bantu; I am talking of justice&#x2014;introduced mother tongue instruction into our Bantu Education in the first place&#x003F; Was it that side&#x003F; No, Mr. Chairman, it was Dr. Eiselen under this Government who made Bantu language compulsory in Bantu schools. Mr. Chairman, the whole motive and motivation of those people is to denationalize, to divide and rule. They cannot and may not represent the Afrikaans-speaking people; neither the English-speaking people, because they also bring about division between the English-speaking person and the Afrikaner in this country. What was the remark made by the hon. Minister of Sport by way of interjection when he said : &#x201C;I am an Englishman with National convictions&#x201D;&#x003F; The hon. member for Zululand then asked him, &#x201C;But do you call yourself an Englishman&#x003F;&#x201D; [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, they can decide whom they want to insult. Do they want to insult this Government because it saw the merit in an English-speaking person in South Africa and made him a member of the Cabinet&#x003F; They may insult this Government if they like. Or they may decide to insult the Englishman by telling him that he has no merit and cannot be included in the Government for that reason. It is for them to decide which of these two attitudes they want to adopt. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hero from the ring of the game of &#x201C;ring-a-rosies&#x201D;, with the &#x201C;bucketful of posies&#x201D;, with his crystal in his hand, is landed here as the labour expert, and it is said that in his private member&#x2019;s motion he replied to all the questions of the hon. the Minister of Transport. Sir, what did we have in that private member&#x2019;s motion&#x003F; It was a direct copy of the British Training and Industrial Act, except for the fines which had been changed, and he presented that here as something original. Is the hon. member not ashamed of himself&#x003F;</p>

<p>Sir, I want to deal with their labour policy, their policy of simply throwing open the flood-gates. If we need one non-White labourer, why should nine of them be at the ready&#x003F; So that keener wage competition may be brought about, and so that we may perhaps, with less trouble and effort and by making use of automation and whatever the case may be, be able to do a little profitable business again. Sir, and then hon. members on that side come forward here and talk of a wage gap. Our standpoint is control of the non-Whites entering our labour market, but they want to throw open the flood-gates so that keener competition for wages may come about.</p>

<p>That is for a genera] worker. Take a boiler attendant, a man who has to get up in the middle of the night. Does he think that a boiler attendant is able to live and support his family on a minimum of R7,50 per week&#x003F; Sir, let us leave labourers out; let us take the sample attendant: R9,40; Let us take the night watchman, who works 14 hours: R5,35. The minimum wages are also laid down here for waiters and female clerks. This was signed by the Minister of Labour, of his own free will. I want to ask whether that is the way in which we guarantee the future harmony, and therefore the future security, of the White man in South Africa, and I want to ask the Minister of the Interior whether he agrees with these wages. After all, he shares joint responsibility with his colleague, the Minister of Labour. As a Cabinet Minister he shares the responsibility for this minimum wage of R3,80 per week. The hon. the Minister of the Interior has made noises about closing the wage gap; he has made noises about the danger of revolution and bloodshed and yet he sits in the Cabinet, Sir, when the Minister of Labour approves of these wages, a Minister of Labour who believes that people can live on R3, R5 and R7 per week; that they can live and feed themselves and clothe themselves and pay their transport from way out in the bundu where they are pushed by the Minister of Planning and the Minister of Community Development, and then still retain their respect on a wage of R3,80 to R7 or R9 a week.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of the Interior owes South Africa an explanation because he shares responsibility, just as he shares responsibility with the Cabinet and with his colleagues who follow the line which that hon. member took and which has been taken on and off for two weeks by the Government, of trying to stir up feelings between White and White and White and non-White in South Africa. I want to say to the hon. the Minister of the Interior that he owes this House and South Africa a speech to justify his frequent and, I believe, his sincere appeals for national unity, his appeals for us to find the things on which we can agree, his appeals to find the things on which to build a better South Africa. I ask him to reconcile that with the speeches we had last week from the Ministers of Defence, Community Development and Labour and Information. We have heard hard things. I said this afternoon that the Nationalist Party has no monopoly on sensitivity. Other people have feelings too. English-speaking people have feelings, as the hon. the Minister of the Interior knows. I want to call as witness to the patriotism and loyalty of South Africans who speak English and who live in Natal, the following words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Natal is an integral part of South Africa and makes a large contribution to our nationhood. The people of Natal are good patriots.</block>

<p>That was said by a gracious lady, by the first lady of Natal, the wife of the then Administrator of Natal. I hope the Minister of the Interior will support that view and will restore some sanity to the bitterness which his Cabinet and his colleagues are sowing in South Africa.</p>

<p>Last week the hon. member for Durban Point really regaled the House, so to speak, with his sport stories and his rugby stories and I must say the metamorphosis that has taken place in the meantime is remarkable. It seems as if the hiding the Opposition has received is only beginning to take proper effect now. [Interjections.] The difficulty with the hon. member near me here who is making such a fuss is that he can spell the word &#x201C;banana&#x201D; but does not know when to stop. I want to start off by quoting from a newspaper article, and then it will be interesting to note the date. But let us first take a look at what the article says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_5347-5348" refersTo="page_1137"/>A number of United Party M.P.s are going to Parliament this session determined to settle once and for all the question of the Party&#x2019;s colour policy. Although all members of the Party accept the broad programme of principles, there is a noticeable difference in the way it is interpreted&#x2014;and put over in public&#x2014; by members of the two main schools of thought. The so-called liberal group, which draws most of its support from the Rand and the Western Cape, believes that the Opposition should take a firmer stand against the Government and interpret the Party&#x2019;s colour policy in a much more progressive manner. The conservatives complain that they suffered during the general election when platteland audiences asked them to explain statements in the cities by members of the liberal group.</block>

<p>Now this is interesting. It was written by Aubrey Sussens and appeared in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> of 16th January, 1959.</p>

<p>He is one of their kindred spirits. The interesting thing about this is the following. What was said of this party in 1959, is more true than ever today. After all, they say, &#x201C;We have a horse for every course and a course for every horse.&#x201D; An old gentleman told me outside this House the other day that he was inclined to believe that the United Party had a &#x201C;horse for every course&#x201D;, but that he would like to know when they were going to withdraw the donkeys from the course. The hon. member for Durban Point was very sporting the other day. The National Party was supposed to have formed a scrum and then he had all kinds of jokes about &#x201C;Haak-Haak&#x201D; when the ball was put in, etc. But there is something he does not realize. Imagine if one had to choose a rugby team from their ranks. One would not know whether to laugh or to cry about this spectacle. One would probably have to start off with the scrum, but in a scrum one needs two props and usually they must have some backbone. Therefore one cannot choose anyone on that side for those positions. That is out of the question. Secondly, there is the position of hooker. Where is one going to find one&#x003F; Because they can only kick and bite&#x2014;they cannot hook. But the most interesting thought is that if such a United Party rugby team has to go on to the field and they are awarded a penalty kick out of compassion&#x2014;for a referee is human too&#x2014; just think what is going to happen. They are so used to kicking left and right at the same time that they will kick the ball with both feet at the same time. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Hillbrow is very talkative. He reminds me of the English rhyme we learned at school&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are, A pawpaw or an apple pie.</block>

<p>He came to the House last week and said that it should be noted that the United Party does not come to the people of South Africa with a slogan or with a warcry. This is the statement thrown at the National Party from his side. But what did they come forward with&#x003F; &#x201C;You name it, we have got it.&#x201D; To which may be added. &#x201C;And now we have had it.&#x201D; That is the kind of slogan with which they came to the public of South Africa. He is the Black-danger man. He sees dangers in everything. In the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 30th January, 1972, there was an amusing headline. &#x201C;Dr. Jacobs has done it again&#x201D;, and then the report went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I grieve to say that Dr. Gideon Jacobs, United Party M.P. for Hillbrow, has done it again. Last year, you might recall, the <i>Sunday Times</i> found cause to rap Dr. Jacobs over the knuckles for certain &#x201C;swart gevaar&#x201D; remarks he had made about the Bantustan leaders.</block>

<p>Their big problem is that everything is a danger to them; it is the red danger, the black danger and all sorts of dangers. But on this planet in 1972 it goes without saying that a state, a government or a country is surrounded by dangers. Modern technology has made this planet smaller, in the metaphorical sense. Where can one live or go on this planet today without there being any danger&#x003F; Dangers there are but they can be faced by means of sound principles. Surely a principle which is difficult to implement is not less sound because it is difficult to implement, and that is what they do not appreciate. They tell us they will join us in defending the country and <span class="col_5349-5350" refersTo="page_1138"/>we accept that. They are concerned that some of these Bantu states may possibly turn communist. They are concerned about a whole series of things, but what they lose sight of completely is that the biggest danger to South Africa is contained in the very essence of their policy. That is where the biggest danger to South Africa lies, and we get no reply to that. The hon. member for Wolmaransstad asked for replies in respect of the practical implementation of that policy. We are still waiting for them. One can enlarge upon that. Imagine the policy of the eight, the six and the two &#x2014;I suppose one sometimes has to imagine the impossible for the purposes of one&#x2019;s argument. Imagine for the sake of argument that the Bantu, Indian and Coloured representatives are in this House now in terms of the U.P. recipe. Just think of the one aspect of the numerical rates. Do not think only of the question of the White-Black confrontation. It goes further than that. If, according to their arbitrary allotment of representatives, the number of Coloureds is to be exactly the same as the number of Bantu, then, according to that dispensation, the Coloured people would have to have 45 representatives here. In other words, the Bantu representatives would ask: &#x201C;What is wrong with us; are we so bad that we are so much worse off than you are&#x003F; We get eight representatives, but on the basis of the numerical strength of the Coloured people there should be 45 of us here.&#x201D; If one makes a population projection for the future and accepts that there will be approximately 32 million Bantu, consisting of the various Bantu peoples, in South Africa by the end of the century, will they still have eight representatives here then&#x003F; These are the cardinal facts to which the United Party simply must reply. They refuse to believe and to see that man is bound to a group and that the individual&#x2014;reference was made here, <i>inter alia</i> by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, to more freedom for the individual&#x2014;can ultimately realize his fullest rights and freedom only within his national and group context. Man in general cannot orbit in space like a meteorite; he realizes himself, culturally and otherwise, within his national context.</p>

<p>With reference to this I should like to refer to the conclusions reached by a gentleman by the name of Michael Wright, a graduate of Oxford, who went to the Evelyn Hone College of Further Education in Lusaka, Zambia, as a lecturer. Recently, when he could stand it no longer, he left that country. With reference to the people who attach no value to the significance of the differences among peoples and ethnic groups and who pay no regard to the organic life of the group, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They deny to individuals fulfilment through their own separate communities. Denial of the existence of these separate communities leads to conflict and struggle as different groups war to preserve themselves. No group can see the denial of its own separate existence as valid in itself. It sees the denial only as the attemp by another group to destroy it.</block>

<p>Then he comes to the big question and says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">How can there be uniform community development when there is no uniform community&#x003F; Should we not rewrite the ideals of democracy for the individual in terms of a free recognition of each inividual&#x2019;s communal affiliations&#x003F;</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Wonderboom tried to make a speech here this evening, but I think he used his entire ten minutes in quoting from different newspaper cuttings. Then he spoke about rugby. As I am concerned with a different sport, I think I will leave the matter there and not reply to the talk he gave us here on rugby.</p>

<p>It has been very, very noticeable indeed during this debate that, after my hon. Leader made some very pertinent references to the problem of the urban Bantu in South Africa, not a single speaker on the other side of the House up till now has referred to the urban Bantu. This is easy to understand because. I believe, that never in the history of the Nationalist Party has there been more uncertainty and confusion in regard to the future of the urban Bantu than there is today. With the year 1978 just around the corner, that wonderful year when by a miracle the ever-increasing flow of the Bantu into the urban areas will be reversed, and with the chances of the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s pipe-dreams as remote as ever, we find of course that today many Nationalists are reluctantly agreeing that the Bantu in the urban area is a very integral <span class="col_5351-5352" refersTo="page_1139"/>part of our economy and that, as such, he should be recognized as a permanent citizen of South Africa. Unfortunately for South Africa, there is no doubt that the current concept of separate development, as seen through the eyes of the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, is still the idyllic one of a number of separate nations, White and Black, with clear and neat geographic boundaries, in other words, as independent sovereignties with all the trappings that go with any state. It is also perfectly obvious that the hon. the Prime Minister is still so enamoured of this concept of separate development, because he believes that South Africa has a lesson for the world in this respect, namely a lesson of how people of different languages, cultures and colour can live together in peace and harmony in one country. So certain is the hon. the Prime Minister of the eventual success of this policy of separate development that he even envisages the day when people will come from afar to watch the workings of separate development at first hand. I agree that separate development for the hon. the Prime Minister and his Government is indeed a wonderful concept, not that it will change a single fact of life in South Africa, and not because it has the remotest possibility of succeeding, but as a wonderful concept because it provides the hon. the Prime Minister and his Government with a rationalization for treating millions of Bantu who work and live permanently in the urban areas as aliens without citizenship rights and to expose them to all the irritations and restrictions of apartheid.</p>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>I will tell you. Sir. I want to say that for the hon. the Prime Minister separate development may be a very wonderful and noble thing, but for the millions of Bantu who live and work in South Africa and who are making a vital contribution to the economic progress and the safety of South Africa, this noble thing has a very false and hollow ring. I et us make no mistake about this. For the Bantu who are living and working in the urban area, separate development means just one thing, namely, apartheid in perpetuity which in turn means segregation without equal facilities, a fugitive fly-by-night existence for many, lack of job opportunities, passes and constant surveillance by the Police, and political impotence. There are a host of other irritations, far too many to mention, and which are part and parcel of this policy of separate development. I want to put a question to the hon. the Prime Minister: Does the hon. the Prime Minister really believe that the millions of Bantu living and working permanently in South Africa and who are kept here because of the policy of separate development physically while they are politically expected to be somewhere else, will abandon lightly their social and political aspirations in the country in which they live and work permanently&#x003F; Surely the hon. the Prime Minister must know that these people will still want political and social rights in the country which they serve with their presence and their labour. I want to say this to the hon. the Prime Minister : Does he really realize the degree of bitterness that is building up in the minds of the urban Bantu because of the effect that separate development has upon them&#x003F; There are many reasons for this feeling. I would say that the one that stands out above all of them is the feeling of insecurity and frustration. The Bantu in the urban areas is not allowed to own land. Yet his homeland, hopelessly under-developed, offers no compensatory rights to him. The result is that the urban Bantu is hopelessly suspended between two worlds, with his only security a piece of paper that can be removed for any mumber of reasons. To put it bluntly, certificates of citizenship mean nothing and solve nothing, because you cannot expect the Bantu who lives and works in White South Africa to be overjoyed at having to carry a certificate of citizenship of some homeland which he in all probability has never seen or never will see. I believe that for the past 25 years the Nationalist Party has been so busy trying to defend and justify the policy of separate development, that they have not &#x2026; [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#palm">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. D. PALM</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have only seven minutes at my disposal, and I should like to deal with one matter which has already been mentioned many times today, i.e. the federation policy of the United Party. I have tried to glean historically what the term &#x201C;federation&#x201D; embraces, and what lessons we can learn from the past with respect to such a policy. I read that Federalism has one of two objectives: The first objective can be to create a political <span class="col_5353-5354" refersTo="page_1140"/>situation from which there can develop, in the course of time, one nation built up of the various component parts. This happened in America, Germany, Italy and also in other countries. There is also a second type of federation which tries to string together various national groups in one political homeland. The first group of attempts at federation all succeeded, and the second group all failed. My question now is which of these two federation attempts the United Party envisages. I think it envisages not the first kind, but in fact the second. But all attempts at bringing about this second type of federation failed. There are eight reasons why these attempts at federation failed. I should like to mention them in the few minutes at my disposal.</p>

<p>The federation attempts I am speaking about were tried on three occasions in Africa, and also in Indonesia. As a result of these eight reasons or requirements, those four attempts at federation failed. Therefore I also want to add that I believe that this federation plan, which the United Party speaks about, will not succeed either. The first requirement laid down by all the national groups was that each component pant must be granted equal opportunities in respect of decisions and the determining of policy; in other words, they all wanted to be equal partners. The second requirement that was laid down was that there must be joint loyalty in respect of their history, their language, tradition and nationalism. The third requirement for success was that in none of these component parts should there be a striving towards individual independence. The fourth reason, and this is very important, why the attempts failed, was because people said that the White minority group in this federation plan was a minority group that wanted to give permanence to its own leadership. A fifth factor that contributed to the failure of those four attempts at federation was the requirement laid down that all individuals of those various component parts of the federation must have complete freedom of movement and complete freedom in respect of labour negotiation. A sixth causative factor in the failure of this federation attempt, which I have mentioned, was that there was too great a numerical disproportion in population between the various component entities and also too great a difference in the level of development between them. I have two names I should like to mention to hon. members. The first is that of the Chief Justice of the Rhodesian Federation, Sir Robert Tredgold, and the second is that of the Attorney-General of Senegal, Monsieur d&#x2019;Arboussier. These two people, together with several others&#x2014;and they were all involved in some of these federation attempts &#x2014;said that their experience in connection with why the federation attempts failed was, and I quote :</p>

<block name="quote">If the component units show too great a disproportion in population or in development, then association in such circumstances would evidently be tantamount to authorizing a hegemony of the strongest unit over the others.</block>

<p>Then I should like to mention the following. This is very important, as far as I am concerned, because the hon. the Leader of the Opposition speaks continually of &#x201C;communal rights&#x201D;. A seventh reason why those federations attempts failed was because, as the people I have just quoted also said:</p>

<block name="quote">In any federation there must be total integration and recognition of the equal status of each citizen. There must be no question of minority or communal rights.</block>

<p>The final reason for the failure of these four federally-orientated attempts, which I have mentioned, was because all the non-Whites in all the four cases said: &#x201C;Federation&#x003F; Fine, but give us a Black Prime Minister&#x201D;. What was the result&#x003F; The federation attempts in these four areas, i.e. Central Africa, East Africa, West Africa and Indonesia, failed. The eventual outcome was that this same Rhodesian Chief Justice, Sir Robert Tredgold, said that the 64 000 dollar question that cropped up for them in the course of time, after the attempt at federation, was &#x201C;How to unscramble federation&#x201D;, because it appeared to be a complete failure. I am sorry, I had to sketch this very rapidly, because my time was very limited.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the time allotted for this debate has almost expired. I therefore want to reply to the few matters still outstanding. Before doing so I do just want to refer to another matter. If one considers what may be discussed under a Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote and <span class="col_5355-5356" refersTo="page_1141"/>what is normally discussed under a Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote, if I consider that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has the benefit of two half-hours and that he has as much additional time at his disposal within the fixed period as he wishes, and if I consider what matters he raised here, I cannot but regard it as a special compliment under the circumstances. Then I must regard my handling of all the matters which are normally raised under this Vote, and which were very carefully avoided, as being irreproachable and insusceptible to criticism. Sir, if there was criticism to be levelled at it, the Opposition has been disgracefully neglectful of its duty in not bringing it to the attention of the House.</p>

<p>But before I reply to those matters still outstanding, and because the Leader of the Opposition has another opportunity to speak after me. I want to ask him to clarify two matters which have for a very long time been waiting to be clarified, questions which have from time to time been put to him. The Leader of the Opposition has told us once again now that his policy comprises three stages. The one will to a certain extent overlap the next. The first stage is the revision of the legislation passed by this Government and which they do not like. At the beginning of every session private members have ample opportunity. I want to give the Leader of the Opposition this suggestion to reflect on for next year: Why should we simply leave these matters hanging in the air&#x003F; Why not instruct or ask his members to put to us those things they would like to have revised&#x003F; They can do so by way of motions; they can do so by way of the other machinery established for that purpose by the House. Then we will not have to guess. Then it will not be necessary for these things to be stated in vague terms. Then we will have something tangible in front of us.</p>

<p>But the hon. the Leader of the Opposition also speaks very vaguely about the &#x201C;third stage&#x201D; about which he will negotiate during the second stage, and that is the stage which will actually bring us to the federation. Now, it goes without saying that in any country in which the current system is a federal one, and in which to a greater or lesser extent there are sub-autonomous bodies in the provinces or regions, there has to be an allocation of power between the federation on the one hand and the provinces or other bodies on the other. I have been hearing about this federation from the hon. member for many years, but I have never yet heard him making any attempt to say what powers will be delegated to the federation. After all, one cannot play around with the idea of a federation for such a long time without having it clear in one&#x2019;s mind what the powers are which that federation should have. Not only the non-Whites, but also the Whites of South Africa would be particularly interested to know what powers that eventual federal government would have. What power would it have in its hands to decide on the fate of <i>inter alia</i> the Whites&#x003F; But what is even more important than this power aspect&#x2014; and in this respect we have not yet heard anything from the hon. the Leader either &#x2014;is what he has in mind in regard to the composition of that federation. According to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition there has to be an overall federal Parliament. We have now heard that in the interim stage the usual Whites, who are now sitting here, will still be sitting here, plus the 16 non-White representatives. But the prospect of an overall Parliament is being held out to us, and I should like to know from him&#x2014;I think he owes this House a reply&#x2014;what the racial composition of that race federation will be. To how many White representatives will the Whites be entitled; to how many representatives will the Coloured people be entitled, and to how many representatives will the Bantu and the Indians be entitled&#x003F; For this will be the super-Parliament which will have the final say over everyone. This will be the super-Parliament which will have the greatest authority and the greatest power. I do not think the hon. the Leader of the Opposition should allow us to remain in the dark any longer in respect of this fundamentally important matter. I should very much like to hear what he has to say in that regard.</p>

<p>Sir, I notice here, according to my notes, that the hon. member for Hillbrow once again levelled the approach that our school system is what it is. When he spoke about national unity he once again levelled this reproach at us. I now want to tell him once again&#x2014;and I want to say this to him with particular reference to the candidate in Brakpan&#x2014;that it surprises me how frequently leaders of the United Party voice opinions in regard to this matter and how piously they discuss it, but when one comes to deeds, one finds exactly the opposite. <span class="col_5357-5358" refersTo="page_1142"/>Recently we heard the same story again from the United Party candidate in Brakpan. It so happens that Brakpan is a town which I know very well, and happen to know that there is a parallel-medium school in Brakpan for those parents who want their children, Afrikaans and English speaking, to attend school together. I would have expected the United Party candidate, who, together with the hon. member for Hillbrow, advocates parallel-medium schools so earnestly, to have sent his child to that school, but one does not find that happening. He boasts of being a super-Afrikaans-speaking person, but his child is attending an English medium school, not even a parallel-medium school. He has every right to send his child to whichever school he wishes, and I am saying nothing about that, but, Sir, why should we profess to advocate parallel-medium schools and charge the Government with not seeing to this matter, although it does do so, and then refrain from sending our children to those parallel-medium schools&#x003F; It so happens that I know what I am talking about here. When I was living in Brakpan my eldest child attended a parallel-medium school. Do you know, Sir, that that school subsequently became a single-medium school because the English-speaking parents took their children out of that school and sent them to single-medium English schools&#x003F; In my own constituency, Nigel, there was for many years a parallel-medium high school for English and Afrikaans speaking children, and the English parents&#x2014;and they have every right to do so and I am in no way condemning their doing so&#x2014;came to my provincial councillor and to me and said, &#x201C;We want you please to make arrangements with the province so that we may have our own single-medium English school.&#x201D; I expressed their wishes. We submitted their case to the provincial authorities and today, at their request, there are two schools in Nigel&#x2014; a single-medium Afrikaans school and a single-medium English high school. Why do we profess one thing and then do something else&#x003F; I have an intimate knowledge of the Transvaal, and I can state that there are hundreds of parallel-medium schools which are indicated on the books as being parallel-medium schools. [Interjections.] No, these are not merely little farm schools; these are high schools and big schools which are indicated on the books as parallel-medium schools, but are in fact Afrikaans-medium schools because the English parents prefer to send their children to English-medium schools. That is, after all, the practice. Why do we profess something we know our people do not want&#x003F; Surely we achieve nothing whatsoever by doing that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Johannesburg-North discussed the matter of the urban Bantu with me. I just want to tell him that during the past recess I went out of my way to attend conferences with the urban Bantu, where they stated their needs and problems very candidly.</p>

Those <span class="col_5359-5360" refersTo="page_1143"/>Whites will come here in the knowledge&#x2014; that is, if those hon. members should ever come into power&#x2014;that this side of the House does not want them here. Surely they will know too, that this side of the House will avail itself of the very first opportunity of getting them out of here again. Surely that goes without saying.</p>

<p>Oh no, Sir, after all, I am not a member of the United Party. But this again indicates to me how oversensitive hon. members are in respect of this matter. My argument is that they will come here in the knowledge that they are unwelcome as far as this side of the House is concerned. This side of the House will do everything in its power to prevent their election. Do hon. members think for one moment that those people who will have been brought to this Parliament in that way, will vote for their own abolition by siding with this side of the House&#x003F; Do hon. members think that for one moment&#x003F; Surely they have no other option. For what other reason are they coming here&#x003F; Surely they have absolutely no other option than to side with that side of the House, but what is more&#x2014;and this is what Gen. Smuts warned against&#x2014;those representatives will of course make use of their position, when the two sides are well-matched, to negotiate against the Government as much as possible. Whether the Government stands or falls is going to depend upon them.</p>

<p>If the two sides are more or less equal, it goes without saying that that side of the House will only be able to govern if these people support them. It also goes without saying that they will blackmail the government of the day, as groups of that kind have already done in Parliaments in other parts of the world. They will make their demands and you will have to comply with those demands, otherwise the Government would fall.</p>

<p>But they will not do so, for my policy is not to have them here. Surely they will not vote for their own abolition&#x003F; That is the most ridiculous argument ever advanced.</p>

<p>I again want to say to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that I would be pleased if he would furnish me with the replies to the questions I have put to him. The hon. member for Yeoville put certain questions to me. He quoted from the reply I gave in respect of the wage gap. My colleagues and I have already told him across the floor of the House what the policy of the Government is in respect of its own officials. That we have already stated. He then raised the question of those people who do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Government. Is it the policy of the United Party now, when it engages in such a penetrating dispute with me in regard to this matter, and must I conclude from that, that it wants this Government to intervene and prescribe to employers what they should pay their non-White workers&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to the Wage Board. I dealt with this matter in that piece. The Wage Board has only one function, which is to determine a minimum wage. The Wage Board performs that function from time to time. But does the hon. member now want the Government to prescribe to employers how much more they must pay than that minimum wage&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<p>He is accusing the Government of allowing them to be underpaid. That is in essence the accusation he is levelling at us. My hon. friend was quite right in pointing out to him&#x2014; and he had my reply in front of him&#x2014; that the Industrial Conciliation Act and the <span class="col_5361-5362" refersTo="page_1144"/>Wage Act prohibit a person from discriminating against any other person on the grounds of race or colour.

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>But the whole point of my argument centred around the gap.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>In the one case wages are negotiated, and in the other cases minimum wages are determined by independent boards and the employer. The employer can do one of two things now. He can pay only the negotiated wage, or only the minimum wage, or he can pay his employee more, according to what he is worth to him. That is all he can do. Must I now say to the employer, and how is one going to do this now, that what he is paying the employee&#x2014;which in most cases, if not in all, is more than the minimum wage&#x2014;is not enough and that he must pay his employees more than that, and that he must pay his Bantu in particular more, so that they receive more or less the same wages as the Whites&#x003F; Surely it goes without saying that Whites are receiving more than the negotiated wage today, firstly because they are worth more to the employer, and secondly, because there is a scarcity factor as far as they are concerned.</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is interesting to note that the hon. the Prime Minister is worried about certain subjects we did not raise under his Vote, but let me give him the assurance that we have several rods in pickle for his Ministers which will be discussed during the course of this session.</p>

<p>The Prime Miniter set out by asking me two questions and he suggested that I should arrange with members to deal by way of private motions and private Bills with those sorts of amendments we should like to see to legislation which is on the Statute Books. One can just see the hon. the Leader of the House giving time for a discussion of those old battles we have had in the past over section 6 of the Terrorism Act, over the unlimited powers without recourse to the courts given to Ministers in <span class="col_5363-5364" refersTo="page_1145"/>certain legislation, over the autonomy of the universities, over job reservation and a large number of other Acts! The hon. the Prime Minister has heard these set out before and so have members on the other side of the House.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, the hon. gentleman wished to know from me what the position will be at the third stage of the United Party&#x2019;s race federation plan and what the allocation of powers will be between the Federal Government and its components. He has also wished to know what the representation will be in that federal parliament. I should have thought that I had made it very clear that in the second stage we create the machinery for consultation. Does he want me to anticipate the result of the consultation before consultation takes place&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to know what your ideas are.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>SIR <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. gentleman wants to know what my ideas are. That is perfectly fair. A central parliament in which White leadership will be accepted and entrenched, a central parliament in which there will be defined representation for the various groups, which will not have regard to numbers, a federal constitution with entrenchments for the rights of various groups, individuals and perhaps geographical areas. The hon. gentleman is, of course, entitled to ask for any details he likes. He need not think that I am going to be led into those traps.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>What will be the composition of the Federal Parliament&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>SIR <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>That, Sir, will be decided as a result of consultation, but those will be the three characteristics of that parliament. Before it is put into operation, it will be submitted to the White electorate by way of a referendum. Even the hon. the Minister of Transport will probably be able to vote.</p>

<p>The hon. gentleman has obviously asked these questions because he wants to run away from a comparison between his policy and our policy in respect of the future of the White man and the future of this Republic in South Africa and its safety. The danger that he points to all the time, is the danger of 16 representatives in this House holding the balance of power and preventing a Nationalist Government from getting into power again. First of all, that shows a complete lack of confidence in his own policies or the possibility that they will ever attract support from non-Whites in South Africa, and&#x2014;something much more serious&#x2014;it shows a lack of confidence that the electorate will never by way of a referendum allow us to take a step here in South Africa which will mean the end of the White race or the end of proper constitutional government and law and order in South Africa. Sir, if you want to look at a policy that really brings danger into the centre of South Africa, a policy that can undermine law and order, and the future of civilized living here in South Africa, look at the policy of the Nationalist Party. Look at the independent states that can come under communist influence. Look at the sort of situation you can end up with if you have Peking, not in Zambia, but in Zululand; if you have your Russian communist influence not in Botswana, but in the Transkei. What does the hon. gentleman think he is doing, taking risks of this kind with the future of South Africa&#x003F; The only thing that really worries hon. gentlemen on that side of the House is not the future of Western civilization here, it is not the future of the White race, it is not civilized government here and the maintenance of law and order, the only thing that worries them is that they believe that there will be less chance for the Nationalist Party to get back into power and stay in power. I do not blame them having those worries after their record since they came into power. Look at what they did to ensure that they could stay in power over the years by removing the rights of other people one by one from this Parliament always with the excuse that it was going to be a White Parliament which was going to protect the interests of civilized government in South Africa. It is just this Parliament that is creating the greatest dangers with which South Africa has ever been faced.</p>

<p>I want to go on, because I am by no means satisfied with the replies of the hon. gentleman in respect of the urban Bantu. I believe that this is the flashpoint in South Africa today. As the hon. gentleman knows, we have been trying for several sessions to bring this matter to a discussion with the relevant Ministers, and they have always postponed it for another time. They always deal with something else. Never do <span class="col_5365-5366" refersTo="page_1146"/>we get down to the real centre of the thing &#x2026;</p>

<p>We never get down to the real guts of the debate which is the dangers of the position of the urban Bantu under the policy of this Government at the present time.</p>

<p>Nor have we had any satisfactory reply from the hon. the Prime Minister on the question of the Coloured people in South Africa. Are we really going forward again, for another year, on the sort of basis that the Coloureds have a semi-representative council with no say in the Government which controls their destiny, with no proper planning done for their training to increase their productivity and with no socio-economic schemes of upliftment&#x003F; Can we really go ahead in this way&#x003F; Has the time not come for the hon. gentlemen to look reality in the face once more and to realize that the one thing which will protect us against Communist propaganda in this country is rising living standards, living standards that rise faster in South Africa than in other parts of the world&#x003F; What plans are there really for the training of Whites and non-Whites; for Whites to take a bigger responsibility and for the non-Whites to take their place&#x003F; We have heard a little talk about training of Bantu in the homelands to do certain work which apparently they are only going to do in the homelands, but we are sitting with a labour force that needs training now. We are sitting with a shortage of skilled labour in South Africa at the present time. Our rate of growth is falling behind the growth rate of the countries of the Western World. There is a backlog in living standards. Instead of our catching up and moving forward as a young country should be doing, we are falling further behind because of the lack of foresight, because of the prejudice and because of the inability which this Government is evincing at the present time to face up to the problems of this country. We have raised this question of the wage gap and pointed to the difficulties. What do we hear&#x003F; We hear a lot of technical stuff, about Wage Boards and about industrial conciliation agreements. That is not the answer. The answer is : What example is the Government going to set to the private industrialists throughout South Africa to close that gap&#x003F; What did we get from the Government&#x003F; The gap is bigger than it was when they took over 24 years ago. It has become bigger and bigger and that is why we ask these questions. We ask them in the interests of South Africa because we want satisfied workers, workers who are proof against Communist propaganda and workers who are going to maintain civilized government here in South Africa.</p>
