<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. BODENSTEIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the present economic position in the Republic of South Africa directs a challenge not only at the Minister of Finance, the National Party and the Government; it is also a challenge to the entire South African people, because a growing and vital economy is the chief producer of taxable income, thereby ensuring the creation of capital necessary in the development of our Republic. As far as I am concerned it is a foregone conclusion that if this challenge is fully exploited it will entrench the Republic&#x2019;s future economic position. There is a shift of emphasis; gold is and continues to be a very important foreign exchange earner, but we are entering a new era as far as ore is concerned. There the object must be to mine at least 50 million to 100 million tons of ore annually. Secondly, there is growing industrial development in our country. This industrial development in the Republic is a big challenge. Unfortunately we do not obtain any support from the Opposition in this connection. We obtain no support from them for the encouragement of this industrial development, which is essential in establishing export products and assisting our balance of payments. We simply have continual chronic criticism to the effect that we ostensibly make no use of the labour that is available in the Republic of South Africa. By the way, Sir, South Africa is exporting to no fewer than 52 countries in the world. Twelve per cent of our production in this country is already being exported, as against 5 per cent in the case of Australia. This is already proof of the fact that we are becoming a big industrial country. I want to state that we shall become an industrial giant, but then this must take place on a responsible footing. We must then ensure efficiency. If we do this we shall find that the Opposition&#x2019;s conduct in saying that there is only one solution, i.e. the greater use of Bantu labour, is only a <span class="col_4915-4916" refersTo="page_0921"/>political trick to bring about a fragmentation of the homelands concept and border industries. Let us look at what Dr. Basie Kleu, chairman of the Productivity Advisory Council, had to say about this aspect&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Speaking at an N.D.M.F. seminar on productivity recently, Dr. Kleu pointed out that productivity does not concern labour only, but the optimum use of all factors of production, including land and capital. He supported this statement with the information that despite an increase in the percentage of non-Whites employed in industry from 66 per cent in 1951 to 70 per cent in 1967, there had been no accompanying rise in productivity. Indeed, the reverse is true and productivity is actually lagging behind the increase in the labour force.</block>

<p>Here this person unequivocally proves that notwithstanding an increase of Bantu labour in the industrial sector there is no increase in production. Today I want to say this: I think we must stop saying that the worker in South Africa must work harder; this is a misconception. We must speak of greater efficiency, and it is at management level where the greater efficiency must be effected. One can work hard day in and day out without being efficient, and then it serves no purpose. Let us look at the position of Sasol.</p>

<p>In the past two years, with a decrease of 5 per cent per annum in its White staff, Sasol has increased its production by no less than 30 per cent. Is this not unequivocal proof that our great shortcoming in the industrial sector today lies in the fact that we do not act with efficiency&#x003F; The Opposition must stop discrediting the White worker in South Africa by continually stating that the White worker&#x2019;s production in industry is inadequate. Sir, I have one minute left to me. I want to conclude by saying that the hon. the Minister presented a Budget embodying the inherent potential of making this country an industrial giant, within the traditional pattern of life in South Africa and not on an integration basis, as the Opposition would like it. They have only one reason for that, and that is to discredit the concept of the right to self-determination, the concept of homeland development and the concept of a White South Africa with economic integration, thereby eventually bringing about social integration. Sir, this Government will continue to rule South Africa, because this Government rules honestly and sincerely on a principle basis and not on the basis of gossip, by which manner the Opposition is trying to take over power.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, it is difficult to reply to the hon. member for Rustenburg, who has just resumed his seat, when he does not accept the basic fact of life that economic integration does exist in South Africa.</p>

<p>Sir, having said that, I will leave the hon. member and will raise certain matters with the hon. the Minister of Finance a little later in the course of my speech this morning. Sir, you will realize that all of us sooner or later exercise the right to reminisce. If we do it too soon, we are regarded as being presumptuous; if we do it too late, we are regarded as being senile and our reminiscences are not taken very seriously. I do not become angry when the hon. member for Wolmaransstad, as he did yesterday by way of interjection, refers to my short period of membership of this House; it does not worry me. But I appreciate it when the hon. member for Piketberg asks me to look back over the history of the political parties. Perhaps I have the advantage over the hon. member for Wolmaransstad, and even over the hon. member for Piketberg, of a few extra years of experience and of a greater variety of experience than they have had. Mr. Speaker, for what purpose do we recall the past&#x003F; Does it help us in the 1970s in South Africa to recall that in the late 1920s and in the early &#x2018;thirties it was necessary for me to hawk (smous) home-made jams to help the economy of my family at home&#x003F; Does it prove that the National Government of the late 1920s and the early 1930s was anti-English-speaking South African&#x003F; But hon. members on the other side, when they recall the financial difficulties of the subsequent years from 1934 until they took over in 1948, deduce therefrom that it was because of the anti-Afrikaner attitude of the Government of South Africa at that time. Sir, if I recall to the House the words of Dr. Malan, does it suggest that I am entitled to assume that there is common ground between the National Government today and the Bolshevik or Communist Government of Russia&#x003F; Because what did Dr. Malan say at one period of his political career&#x003F; He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_4917-4918" refersTo="page_0922"/>The aim of the Bolshevists was that Russians should manage their own affairs without interference from outside. That was the same policy that the Nationalists would follow in South Africa. The Bolshevists stand for freedom just like the National Party.</block>

<p>Sir, what does that prove&#x003F; [Interjection.] The Bolshevists were merely the militant communists. I am the last person to suggest that this Government is a communist-orientated Government, because those were the views of one of its architects of the past. Sir, must I also recall that Afrikanerdom survived despite the so-called English victory in World War II, and remind the hon. the Leader of this House what his sentiments were in 1940&#x003F; I quote what he said, speaking at the Nationalist Party congress in Bloemfontein&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The whole future of Afrikanerdom is dependent upon a German victory.</block>

<p>Sir, must I say today, and must South Africa say today, what you would rule out of order, and that is that hon. members opposite are Nazis&#x003F;</p>

<p>You want to whip up emotions now.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>No, what I am trying to say to hon. members opposite and to the Chief Whip is that those things are dead. We have evolved as political parties. I concede that even the hon. member has evolved to a wiser political philosophy than he had in the past. I concede that his thinking is today different. He accepts democracy today. But what would it profit me if I were today to linger on and hold in my heart a bitterness because I was called by members of that Party during the war years one of the &#x201C;Red lice&#x201D;&#x003F; What would it profit me or my country today if I were to look back only to the miserable self-centred party-political interests which have been raised during this debate by hon. members on the other side&#x003F; I am thankful for one thing as an English-speaking South African. I am thankful that my first lesson in Afrikaner tradition came from reading a biography of Paul Kruger. We on this side of the House and the English-speaking people are prepared to accept those aspects of the Afrikaner which are in line with the great thinkers of Afrikanerdom. We believe in the philosophy of Paul Kruger, &#x201C;Neem uit die verlede wat goed is en bou daarop die toekoms&#x201D;. Now, what have we had from the hon. members opposite in their attempts to stir up feeling between English- and Afrikaans-speaking South Africans&#x003F; Might I say that the hon. the Minister of Defence succeeded in making a good many English-speaking South Africans angry and resentful of his expressions and of the opinions he expressed. But fortunately a few days have passed and I believe that as I sit here today in my party, in this United Party, there is something greater than the attitude of that hon. Minister. I believe there is a dedication in this party, a dedication which has been built up over the years and which is the corner-stone of our philosophy in this party&#x003F; We are here to serve South Africa and not a political party or a section of the people of South Africa. It is for that reason that we are prepared to accept the challenge of the fact that we are a multi-racial state. We are prepared to accept the challenge of finding a <i>modus vivendi</i> not only between those of us of the White group with different languages, but also a <i>modus vivendi</i> between those of different colours whom Providence has put in this country. We believe that that is the challenge. I would have expected the party opposite to have built on its achievements when the referendum of 1961 was in favour of a republic. When we look back to 1961 there was great division in South Africa, great emotional division. The result of that referendum, as you will recall, Sir, was not an overwhelming vote in favour of the Republic. But it was a majority vote and many thousands of South Africans who had felt deeply against the desirability of a republic, were faced with one decision. Were they to support and accept the democratic decision which had been taken in South Africa, or were they to perpetuate the divisions and the emotional differences of the past&#x003F; The South Africans in this party in 1961 accepted that there was a Republic, that we have a Republic in South Africa. We thanked God that the emotional differences had now been settled, even though not as some of us would have liked to have them settled, and that we in South Africa could now look at the problems of South Africa and see what was to be done. Sir, I want to say this to the hon. the Minister of Defence. I am sorry he is not in the House at the moment. We are not angry with him. We pity him. We pity him because he has not only lost our respect <span class="col_4919-4920" refersTo="page_0923"/>as individuals, but he has even forfeited the respect to which he would normally be entitled as a Minister of State.</p>

<p>Now I want to pass, if I may, to certain Budget proposals, to which I hope the hon. the Minister of Finance will even at this late hour be able to give some further consideration. I want to refer first of all to the interest-fixing for participation bonds. Since the announcements made by the hon. the Minister in his Budget speech, there has been a great deal of research into the position of participation bonds in South Africa. One finds, for instance, in a research done in Durban, that there are some R200 million to R300 million invested in participation bonds which have already elapsed the initial fixed period and merely continuing to be operative by mutual agreement between the mortgagor and the mortgagee. What is the position in regard to these bonds&#x003F; Is the position now that the interest rate of these bonds is to be reduced because of the expiry of the fixed period; is it to be reduced now to 8&#x00BD; per cent interest&#x003F; I believe the Registrar of Financial Institutions holds that view at present. There is a great deal of anxiety in the public mind over the uncertainty, and I hope the hon. the Minister will clarify the position, because if that is to take place it is feared, and I think on good grounds, that there will be wholesale calling up of these participation bonds by trust companies whose investors will wish to withdraw their participation. It is a fact that the average investment per investor in participation bonds is somewhere between R2 000 and R4 000. In other words, it is the small investor who has R2 000 to R4 000 to put in who gets the benefit of a participation bond at the higher rate of interest. The big institutions finance their own bonds. Does the Minister realize that to these small investors this pegging of the interest rate to 8&#x00BD; per cent will mean a reduction of 15 per cent in their income from this source&#x003F;</p>

<p>The second point that is of great concern is that if this participation bond source of finance is withdrawn, it can have a very serious effect on the housing position in South Africa. The Minister knows that township developers are dependent almost entirely on participation bonds for financing the early stages of the development of townships, that is before the township has been proclaimed, to provide for services. It would be a tragic state of affairs if these persons are now to be left to look for money on the grey market for the establishment of townships. I ask the hon. the Minister please to see that no hasty steps are taken in regard to bonds which are existent and which are continuing beyond their fixed period, and I would also ask him whether he will not try to find time to have consultations with the Association of Trust Companies, who mainly handle this type of investment, and with the S.A. Property Owners&#x2019; Association, who are vitally concerned with the development of townships.</p>

<p>Then I want to refer to one other matter and that is to the home saving scheme, which we welcome, the scheme advocated by the hon. member for Parktown some years ago. But unfortunately the hon. the Minister of Community Development was not listening and he only discovered the fact that there was this type of saving when he spent several thousands of rands on a trip overseas last year. The point I want to mention to the hon. the Minister is this : that unfortunately he has linked it in 1972 to purchasing and bond limits, which are out of date. This will not provide the benefit that it could provide. The Minister limits it to the income group of R5 000 per annum and he limits it to a purchase price of R16 000 per house, but those are not available in our big cities, and to the limit of the bond amount which has now been fixed. I want to know what is the Minister&#x2019;s attitude in regard to these limits. Can he not raise it&#x003F; I want to tell him that to make this scheme really effective he must take one more step, and that is to grant some relief in the costs of transfer, the cost of acquisition of a property. The hon. the Minister knows that some eight years ago it was fixed that there should be a two-thirds rebate of transfer duty up to a purchase price of R5 000, one-half between R5 000 and R10 000 and one-third between R10 000 and R15 000. Those limits are unrealistic today. The Minister himself knows that. If he takes the depreciated purchasing power of the rand over the last eight years into consideration, he will realize that these rebates on transfer duty are not realistic and no longer helpful for the purposes for which they were introduced eight years ago. I do hope that when he deals with these tax proposals, he will still find some opportunity to review the position pertaining to transfer duties.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Community Development started his political speech in this debate with a cursory reference to housing. He suggested that everything was <span class="col_4921-4922" refersTo="page_0924"/>all right, White housing was 100 per cent and Coloured housing was being sorted out by his department. I am going to ignore the political nonsense that he spoke. On public occasions the hon. the Minister frequently attributes to himself very good reasons why we should ignore what he says politically, because he has in the past belonged to every political party which has existed in South Africa. He only has to join one more party and that is the Progressive Party, he has belonged to all the others. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister of Justice has found out how much the irresponsibility and the loose tongue of the Minister have cost the country in regard to costs in the defamation case. The hon. the Minister of Justice will, no doubt, at some time or another make that interesting figure available to us, because I shall see that a question in that connection is put on to the Order Paper. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Community Development has stated that in so far as housing is concerned everything under his control has really gone well. Let me remind him of the position. I shall only quote figures in relation to the position when he took over in 1969. These figures were given to the House by the hon. the Minister himself; they are not my figures. I shall give him the position which obtained in 1969 and the position as it was at 31st December, 1971. The hon. the Minister announced in Question No. 3, Col. 343 of Hansard, 1969, that there was a shortage of 4 860 homes for Whites. In Col. 131 of Hansard, 1972, the Minister tells us that there is now a requirement in eight centres only of 12 165 homes. [Interjections.] That is progress! He told us that the Coloured housing position in 1969 was such that the requirement was 21 410 homes; the position today is such that 43 394 homes are required. In so far as the Indians are concerned, he told us when he assumed responsibility for this department, that the shortage was 11 333 homes. He has now told us that at 31 December, 1971, 22971 homes were required. That is progress! That is the efficient Minister! He has also told us that apart from these shortages, the position in regard to disqualified persons requiring homes is at present such that there are 35 345 Coloured families, 12 267 Indian families, 1 165 Chinese families and 165 White families who require homes.</p>

<p>If I may, I now want to talk to the hon. the Minister who is concerned with the implementation of group areas&#x2014;the same hon. Minister. Is it not time now to stop this business of regarding every disqualified person as somebody who has of necessity to move from where he is at the present time&#x003F; We can speak at great length about what it has meant to some of the old Cape families. I wonder how the hon. the Minister would feel if for generations his people had lived in Newlands under the oaks on the slopes of Table Mountain, and were suddenly denied the pleasures of living there, the pleasures of living there in that area during spring, and were told to live on the Cape Flats&#x003F; What is worse, is that their houses after they had been vacated were not demolished. They are dollied up and with profit to the White person who had taken those houses over.</p>

<p>Will the hon. the Minister not consider a system whereby the Coloured people who have a roof over their heads can receive a grant as is the case in other countries&#x003F; The purpose of the grant is to put them in a position to restore their decaying houses. Can they not be assisted in that way&#x003F; It will be a much cheaper system than to build houses to find homes for 35 000 displaced families. Many of them have roofs over their heads.</p>

<p>I want to raise another question in regard to the implementation of the Group Areas Act. We realize this must take years in some cases. The hon. the Minister must think again, if he does not want these sprawling townships on the Cape Flats but wants to build proper towns, which will be the correct thing to do. However, in the meantime these people are living in a state of fear and trepidation as to what would happen.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs, speaking at King William&#x2019;s Town during September last year, made a statement which is contrary to the actions and the policy of the hon. the Minister of Community Development. I hope the hon. the Minister of Community Development will <span class="col_4923-4924" refersTo="page_0925"/>get together with his colleague and that they will adopt the approach upon which his colleague elaborated in his speech at King William&#x2019;s Town. He talked about the establishment of this new Coloured township Breidbach near King William&#x2019;s Town. I want to come to the important point and I quote from a newspaper report of his speech&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Loots said that the proclamation could not be rescinded &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is fair enough&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; but that no one who did not voluntarily want to be in the townships would be forced to be. Home-owners still paying off loans would be able to remain in Schornville until the 1980s, while others might remain for even longer.</block>

<p>That is a humanitarian, realistic and proper approach to the removal of persons when it becomes necessary for slum clearance or other reasons. Create the attractions elsewhere, as we on this side of the House have always said, and let them go of their own free will. The hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs continued&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Those who did sell or let their homes, would be required to do so to Whites only. Anyone who remained dissatisfied with the compensation offered to him for his home, could approach him personally &#x2026;</block>

<block name="quote">Mr. Loots said that Breidbach township would one day be administered by a Coloured local authority and that there would be a voluntary movement of Coloured people to take advantage of its amenities.</block>

<p>That is the policy which we have advocated in these matters, a policy which I trust the hon. the Minister of Community Development will find possible to adopt in future, because when the hon. the Minister of Community Development sticks his fingers into something of a local nature, chaos results. Let me remind him for instance of the problems in District Six. Long before the hon. the Minister took over responsibility for his portfolio, the city council had commenced slum clearance. They started in the 1930s and at the time the war broke out, they had built 483 dwelling units. These were new flat dwelling units in District Six. In 1957 the Group Areas Act came into effect. What happened then&#x003F; In respect of the moneys given to the city council for rehousing, they were required to give 40 per cent of the new houses to rehouse disqualified persons on the Cape Flats. There were no funds left available to the city council to redevelop District Six and development was stopped. In 1962, when the city council was able to put forward a new scheme for the redevelopment of District Six and able to finance it itself, it was told that it could not do anything in District Six until the Group Areas Board had decided how it should be handled under the Group Areas Act.</p>

<p>Every suggestion by the Cape Town City Council was turned down by this Government. In 1964 it became a frozen area; in 1965 a co-ordinating committee was appointed to advise his department. Sir, during the whole of this period thousands of families were placed in doubt as to what their future was going to be. And now, Sir, after 10 years, in 1972, 10 years since the time the City Council was stopped from doing any renewal, what do we find&#x003F; The hon. the Minister tells us that the acquisitions by his department of the properties necessary for a renewal scheme will only be completed by the end of 1973. What has he done as far as the redevelopment is concerned&#x003F; No properties have been sold pending replanning. So, in 10 years he has taken out of Cape Town and out of the use of the population of Cape Town&#x2014; Whites, Coloureds and Indians&#x2014;the whole of District Six. He has immobilized the whole of District Six. He has poured in millions of rands by the Government. And the hon. the Minister tells us now, Sir, at this stage, in 1972, that the replanning is not yet completed. That the replanning is not yet completed! Sir, what were the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s assurances when he was challenged on this matter before&#x003F; The hon. the Minister, as reported in the <i>Cape Times</i> of 10th January, 1969, when he entered upon his task as Minister, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In these circumstances it should be possible to commence with the physical redevelopment of the area during 1970.</block>

<p>But what do the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s words mean &#x201C;acquisitions will not be completed before the end of 1973 and no properties can be sold until the replanning is completed&#x201D;&#x003F; At that early stage the hon. the Minister said that he had to give the assurance to the present inhabitants that they <span class="col_4925-4926" refersTo="page_0926"/>would not be put out onto the street unless they were provided with alternative housing in a responsible way. And what are they doing&#x003F; What do these people do&#x003F; Does the hon. the Minister not realize what he is doing unto these people&#x003F;</p>

<p>Sir, as hon. members will now hear I am going as far as the year 2000. [Interjections.] And with all their struggling here, their rummaging around, their speeches and the smokescreens they threw up, I got to thinking a little about the fact that in our history there was also a period that counts against them as an indictment as far as the Afrikaans-speaking people in South Africa are concerned, just as they stand accused for their rule before we took over the reins of government. Here in the Cape, Mr. Speaker, at the corner of the Heerengracht and Longmarket Street there stood, in 1814, a house that belonged to a Mr. Dreyer. And when the rule of those years suppressed the Afrikaans-speaking people, the old Dutch element, and discriminated against them, quite a number of satirical poems saw the light. And because freedom of the Press was not allowed at the time, and the poor Dutch citizens were subjected to all manner of restricting measures, they pasted these satirical poems up against the walls of the houses at night, and so it happened that they pasted a satirical poem up on the front stoep&#x2014;it was a high stoep &#x2014;of the house of a Mr. Dreyer. [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, after having listened to hon. members I went to look up that satirical poem, and the question I ask myself, and which the people must ask themselves, is whether this satirical poem is applicable here. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">O Heere der heere!</block>

<block name="quote">Wie zal hier in Afrika weer regeere&#x003F;</block>

<block name="quote">Alle, die uit Engeland zijn gebannen.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as I see them sitting there&#x2014; particularly the hon. member for Constantia; he is, after all, a real old English ox; he will continue struggling, but he will never achieve anything. And then the satirical poem continues and reads&#x2014;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I obey your ruling. The satirical poem continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">En lei ons tog maar mensen</block>

<block name="quote">Onse arme Hollandse Christen mensen.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, our big question is who will rule South Africa&#x003F; Who will rule South Africa in the succeeding decades up to the year 2000&#x003F; And if we now wish to make a projection, Mr. Speaker, the matter looks very rosy to us under National Party rule. If we want to make a projection to the year 2000&#x2014;that is in 28 years time; that is when those young men on that side and the young men on this side will be in leadership positions, and they will be placed in decisive roles against the background of history. Let us make a projection. From 1946 to 1971 our average growth rate was 8,6 per cent. This indicates a tendency for the growth rate to double every ten years. And if we now make a projection, we come to this virtually baffling figure, i.e. that in the year 2000&#x2014;in 28 years time&#x2014; our gross national product, very conservatively calculated, will be about R100 000 million. I say this is very conservatively calculated. If one follows another projection curve it gives one a figure of R140 000 million. What does this imply&#x003F; Since today we spend, as far as capital expenditure is concerned, ,17 per cent of our gross national product on defence, ,43 per cent on education, ,03 per cent on housing and 2,02 per cent on economic services this implies that with the increase of our national product by the same percentage we can spend astronomical figures on education, defence, housing and economic services. The basis on which I make this projection is the basis I have faith in, because for the past 2&#x00BD; decades, since the National Party took over power, there has been a remarkable, an incomparable stability embodied and discernible in our economic development. I do not want to repeat this, but in its economic and political development under the National Party, South Africa has escaped what most other countries could not escape. We have gained a remarkable stability in South Africa and if one makes a projection into the future, to the year 2000, and one takes the last two decades as the basis and the norm, one is justified in making, with a large degree of certainty, a projection of R100 000 million for our gross national product for the year 2000. This will bring about a consequent increase of our capacity, resulting in an increase of our defence expenditure, our education expenditure and our expenditure on economic services and our housing. A further encouraging sign is that, if we take our saving from 1946 to 1971 as a percentage of our gross national product, we see that this works out to an average of about 24 per cent. This is a very rosy and a very favourable figure. If we take our capital investment over that same period, from 1946 to 1971, as a percentage of our gross national product, this also tallies with the figure of 24 per cent. What does this mean&#x003F; If one&#x2019;s saving equals one&#x2019;s capital investment as a percentage of one&#x2019;s gross national product, this means greater independence from foreign capital influence for local development. This is an outstanding tendency and it gives me the courage to make a projection to the year 2000 with the certainty with which one can do so.</p>

<p>There are other less encouraging signs. On 5th May, 1970&#x2014;these are the latest figures I could get hold of&#x2014;we had an economically active population of 7,5 million. The <i>per capita</i> contribution to the gross national product of those 7,5 million economically active people was R1 563-50. That is less encouraging. There will have to be an improvement because this less favourable <i>per capita</i> contribution from the economically active population not only embraces purely material considerations, but also a crisis raging today in the spirit and the heart of our people. We shall have to overcome that crisis. Thanks to the privilege that befell me, I was recently on a visit to Japan. Permit me to quote what <i>Die Zeit,</i> a German newspaper, writes about what is happening in Japan, which is developing into one of the great super states and which we shall in fact have to take proper account of. The following is written in connection with this <i>per capita</i> contribution, this approach to labour, this attitude to labour and to production, the individual worker&#x2019;s evaluation of labour, production and his country. I quote :</p>

<block name="quote"><i>Die Zeit</i> writes that a British visitor was highly astonished about the overall discipline and dedication of Toyota workers, finding no cigarette butts lying around, no pin-up girls&#x2019; photos standing at the working places, and when he heard that there had been no strikes at Toyota for the last ten years, the Britisher understood why that company could with only one-fourth of the working force produce <span class="col_4929-4930" refersTo="page_0928"/>more cars than the British Motor Corporation.</block>

<p>I want to make another quotation from what appeared in the German newspaper <i>Die Welt. Die Welt</i> asks :</p>

<block name="quote">What kind of nation is this where people do not sleep in bed but travel on the fastest trains of the world, do not sit in chairs, but construct the most giant ships, build super cities, but give no names to their streets, boast of the largest newspaper circulation in the world &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is indeed the case, because one single newspaper in Japan has a circulation of close on eight million&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; boast of the largest newspaper circulation in the world and yet know so well to pass over the most essential things in silence.</block>

<p>The article reads further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the average time difference of train arrivals on schedule is only 18 seconds.</block>

<p>I want to quote a third article in connection with this approach, of our labourer to his work, which concerns me. I quote:</p>

<block name="quote">Japan by means owes her success on the world markets to cheap labour because while the construction of a 50 000 ton tanker under similar conditions takes 24 months in the United States of America, 16 months in Spain, 12 in Germany, the Japanese builders need 7 to 8 months.</block>

<p>Now I want to say something. While a projection to the year 2000 is bewilderingly encouraging for us, there are, at the same time, too many people walking round in our country without performing a single productive act in the interests of the country. There are too many people walking around in our country and living on the infrastructure, which entails costly expenditure. They live on the expensive infrastructures that we have to build up, and they do not furnish a real contribution to the country&#x2019;s gross national product. As far as the <i>per capita</i> contribution to our gross national product is concerned, there are too many people who do not comply with the requirements. We can take an example from Japan.</p>

<p>I was also in Taiwan. I did not see any long hair there; I did not see people slouching around in the streets; I did not see the bars full from early in the afternoon; I did not hear any noise. What strikes one is a silence that fits in with the atmosphere of industrious people. Why&#x003F; Because between 60 and 80 miles from Taiwan there lies a powerful country, and they are indeed waging a war for their existence against that powerful country. Our people do not realize that we are also engaged in a full-scale war; we do not realize it, because here in South Africa things are too &#x201C;jolly&#x201D;. We are squarely in the midst of a war, and it is not only a cold war; it is a hot war. There our boys stand covering thousands of miles of the front.</p>

<p>He knows about it. Now that that hon. member is speaking about that, I want to say that I have never yet heard a single word of praise or encouragement to those boys from his mouth. He has never done so yet. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Sir, I have now made a projection of what we can expect in the next two, almost three decades, what our strength will be and what we will be capable of, and now I want to put to you eight challenges that face the Republic of South Africa. These are realities we must take cognizance of at the moment. These points I am now going to mention are not far-off in the distance; they are not shrouded in a cloak of future obscurity; these are matters we must take into account at the present moment, and which are actually taking place.</p>

<p>The first is the military onslaught from the North which is in preparation. Our boys are already there. All the signs point to the formation of a new power block in Africa, in which communism will play an important role. We are not the only ones to say so. When our hon. Prime Minister and the Minister of Police warned against it, hon. members on that side and their newspapers stated: &#x201C;This is simply a disparagement; these are simply excuses; these are simply scare stories.&#x201D; What did the leader of the newly established opposition <span class="col_4931-4932" refersTo="page_0929"/>party in Zambia say the day before yesterday [translation]&#x003F; &#x201C;The Tanzam railway line will serve as and be used for conducting communists from Zanzibar and Tanzania closer to Zambia.&#x201D; I am now warning that hon. member for Port Natal in particular. The hon. member for North Rand said a few years ago : &#x201C;What we need is a shock from outside.&#x201D; I am now warning that hon. member: The &#x201C;shock from outside&#x201D; is at hand.</p>

<p>The second challenge we must prepare ourselves for is the threat to the Republic of South Africa &#x2026; [Interjections.]</p>

<speech by="#deputy_speaker">

<speech by="#greyling">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>He is engaged in a cheap attempt at diversion which even a child can comprehend. The second matter is the threat to the Republic from the Indian and the Atlantic Oceans. You know, Sir, that Zanzibar is the most southernly Black state that has a harbour at its disposal in Africa. We know that there is great activity in progress in Zanzibar as far as the Chinese are concerned, in connection with the construction of a harbour and in connection with maritime operations.</p>

<p>The third point is the challenge and the problems the European Common Market is going to set us. This morning we heard over the radio that while Mr. Nixon is in Canada, his Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs has mentioned the difficulties awaiting even a powerful super state like America in connection with the European Common Market. We must prepare ourselves for that. Thanks to the National Party, early and provisional arrangements have been made and discussions and consultations have been conducted.</p>

<p>Then I want to come to an important point, i.e. that in the Far East a big power point is developing, with Japan as the key spot. After Japan was destroyed in the Second World War it experienced such an economic miracle that every projection for the future, after the year 2000, indicates that Japan will overtake America and the Soviet Union, the only two countries which are still superior to it. This will be of tremendous significance to us in South Africa.</p>

<p>A powerful economic bloc is developing, with a powerful and virile economy. We can thank the Lord because, as it is now developing, it appears to us it will be a non-communist bloc with the countries in South-East Asia. For us in the Republic of South Africa, who have only now made a break-through to the markets of the Far East, and will and must do so to an ever-increasing extent, this will be of far-reaching significance. We shall have to prepare ourselves for that. We must not go and look for our markets only in the Western world: we shall also specifically have to focus our attention on that part of the world which, in the future, is going to play an undeniably big role in world economy, and particularly as far as South Africa is concerned.</p>

<p>I want to mention a fifth point. In the succeeding decades we shall have to break through to the new Africa, that reshuffling of powers that took place when the old colonial powers were rejected under force of the militant, aggressive nationalism, which we cannot accept and understand, which has its effect in the economic and political spheres and on inter-state relations. It is an aggressive nationalism, in contrast with the nationalism that has been developed by this National Party. Our nationalism is evolutionary, not passive, but inspiring. It is not aggressive, but developing. It will be our task&#x2014;it has been placed on our shoulders&#x2014;to make a breakthrough, in the next few decades ahead, into the very heart of those carriers of aggressive nationalism as it is still unfolding itself before us today in all its militant forms.</p>

<p>Then I come to the sixth task facing us, and this is the absolute necessity for our Bantustans to obtain their political independence in co-operation with the Whites in South Africa. The seventh is the necessity for us to realize that a common market will, of necessity, have to develop here in Southern Africa and that this will exercise tremendous pressure on our economic, technological and intellectual sources. Sir, today I want to say this with a large degree of certainty : As far as these eight big objectives and challenges are concerned, as I have stated them here, the National Party is armed. Sir, this task cannot in future be entrusted to that party, because it is a party that kills everything. They are like a buck, and everything a buck eats, dies. [Interjection.] Sir, what is wrong with that hon. member&#x003F; Is he sick&#x003F; Let me tell you what they have killed. They have <span class="col_4933-4934" refersTo="page_0930"/>killed their own Press, which supported them throughout the years. For the information of the younger members who do not know it, I just want to say that there was a newspaper called <i>Volk;</i> that newspaper is dead. <i>Eendrag,</i> which was previously published in the Transvaal, died, while they were ruling. The old <i>Volkstem,</i> which was over 50 years old, is dead. The Rand&#x2019;s <i>Pos</i> is dead; the <i>Vrystater</i> in the O.F.S. is dead; the <i>Natalse Afrikaner</i> in Natal is dead; <i>Ons Land</i> in the Cape is dead; the <i>Suiderstem,</i> with its powerful capital behind it and its advertising power when they ruled, is dead. They killed everything, and now their own supporting press is in the process of killing them. Sir, they not only killed their own newspapers. There were seven points of concurrence between Hertzog and Smuts at the time of coalition. They murdered coalition; they killed it.</p>

<speech by="#greyling">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>They killed coalition as a result of their unreliability and their disloyalty. The first point of their agreement was that the government of the country would be conducted on a basis of South African principles and in a spirit of South African nationalism. And then&#x003F; That ink was not even dry yet, when they issued the 1948 election manifesto, and what did they say in that manifesto&#x003F; Exterminate Nationalism! They said that Nationalism came from the troglodytes; the Nationalists sitting here are a lot of troglodytes. I quote (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nationalism emanates from the isolationism of primitive troglodytes, but when man began to develop in the course of centuries and became more civilized, he gained broader insight.</block>

<p>Sir, I could continue in this vein. Every possible principle that was entrenched in the old coalition agreement was destroyed by the spirit of that party, and therefore, as far as I am concerned, I want to say this in connection with these stories about coalition that were spread here: Never ever would I enter into a coalition with them, because their past betrays them and one cannot depend on their future because they do not have one. Sir, the other day the hon. member for Parktown said a dangerous thing here, and it is characteristic of them that they simply weave it in. He said in his speech during the Little Budget: &#x201C;Back to earth; listen to the advice of real and true Afrikaners.&#x201D; Sir, who are his real and true Afrikaners&#x003F; Who gives us advice here&#x003F; People like the hon. member for Salt River, our own noisy friend sitting there, the hon. member for Constantia and that member himself; and what does he say&#x003F; He says: Stop interfering in the private sector; remove all these unnecessary control measures. Initially they said we should hand over the Railways to private initiative. Now each year they ceaselessly inquire here after the public corporation&#x2019;s accounts. Sir, the hon. member, as chief spokesman of their party, ought to know better. There is not one of these economic super-states in the world today in which Government control measures and Government control are not the order of the day. What is the position in Japan&#x003F; I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Even in the beginning &#x2026;</block>

<p>Sir, after the speeches of the past three days, I must say in all honesty that more than ever I have come to the conclusion that it is not in the interests of South Africa that the Party on the opposite side should continue to govern this country. Sir, there cannot be any objection to a member of any side getting up and going into the past of his rival party and criticizing his rival party for standpoints and attitudes adopted by it in the past. Whether it will yield political profit for such a side in the long run is a question which a man must decide for himself if he decides to conduct such a debate. My impression is that the people in the country are more and more beginning to adopt the attitude that at any particular moment a political party belongs to the people who support the party at that moment, and that they are not at all concerned with what other people did at a different time under the banner of the party. I myself am of the opinion that we are entering a period in which people are going to judge our political parties not in terms of what they were, but in terms of what they are and what they make of <span class="col_4935-4936" refersTo="page_0931"/>themselves today. I do not want to deny that a party should carry its history with it and, as I have said, there can also be ho objection to a man getting up here and criticizing a party on the grounds of things which happened in its past. But the fact of the matter is that every party,&#x2014;and certainly both major parties in South Africa&#x2014;has in its past things which it would like to remember; but in its past it also has things which it would like to forget. When one compares the two parties in this respect, I often wonder whether that side does not have many more things it would like to forget than this side has. Sir, we can conduct precisely the same kind of debate as we have had from that side; and I want to go so far as to say that if we wanted to do so, we would be able to do so with far more effect than the other side has done. Sir, there are people on that side who, prior to our becoming a Republic, made speeches and wrote articles about what the Republic should look like, who wrote articles and who made speeches on the language question, which were nothing but what the Herstigte Nasionale Party stands for today.</p>

<p>Very well, so what&#x003F; There are people on that side i who, if one were to read out today what they said the South African Republic should look like, would blush up to their ears. To tell the truth, it was in fact all those absurdities written by members on that side at that time about the future Republic that put us back years and that led to people opposing the Republic who had never been opposed to it in principle. There are people on that side who pleaded for National Socialism. There are people on that side who did not want anything to do with the Parliamentary system and who described this Parliamentary system as an Anglo-Jewish invention. There are members on that side who at one time did not even want to stand for Parliament, because they said they had no use for this institution. If we want to stir up feelings between Afrikaners and Englishmen or between Whites and non-Whites, look at the material we have. Hansard abounds with anti-Semitic speeches made on that side. Motions were introduced here on that side in typically Hitler fashion, motions which sought to limit the number of Jews in the professions in South Africa.

<p>They say that only they have the right to do it. All I say is that I wonder, if this is the part they are going to play for the rest of this Parliamentary session, whether this side will not derive more benefit from it than that side will. But what assistance will we have given South Africa then&#x003F; What will happen to race relations&#x003F; If we want to stir up racial feeling here: I remember that people on that side attacked us by saying that we would &#x201C;pick up lice&#x201D; if we entered the homes of the Coloured people. Must we now rake up all these things here&#x003F; They speak of foreign threats: We are alleged to be soft on foreign threats and sabotage and terrorism. But surely this is not the first time in our history that we have to deal with foreign threats and with sabotage and terrorism. In 1938, when there was a serious infiltration from Europe of forces subversive of the State in South-West Africa and the Hitler r&#x00E9;gime was trying to take over South-West Africa from within and that territory was on the verge of a <i>coup d&#x2019;&#x00E9;tat,</i> it was Gen. Hertzog and the United Party who sent armed Police to quell the unrest; and what was the attitude then of hon. members who are now sitting on that side of the House&#x003F; Stones of opposition and aversion rained down upon this side because it took those safety measures in respect of South-West Africa. And the leader of the Nationalist Party in Transvaal, Mr. Strydom, went so far as to say in the name of that party&#x2014; and I am quoting him&#x2014;that the Nationalist Party would not lift a rifle to defend South-West Africa if Germany (under Hitler) wanted South-West Africa back. A year later the Second World War broke out and dangers of a global nature threatened South-West Africa as well as South Africa and the rest of the world. Here in Parliament <span class="col_4937-4938" refersTo="page_0932"/>there was a serious difference of opinion about our participation, and I leave it at that. It was justified. One could agree or one could disagree; but as far as the United Party was concerned, it thought in terms of the interests of South Africa and went into action, and it wrote an impressive chapter in the history of South Africa. And today, when the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs goes abroad and arrives in America, France and England, what is the main point he raises&#x003F; He proudly tells them that South Africa fought on the side of the Allies. This is his main argument in favour of friendship with South Africa. In the forties we had sabotage and subversion on a large scale here in South Africa, not from the same quarter as today, but in far more serious circumstances, because the Government and our Police and the South African Defence Force were fully occupied with our being engaged in a war beyond our borders. However, we not only had sabotage and subversion in the most serious degree within the country, but we also had terrorism within our country&#x2019;s borders. Efforts were made to blow up post offices, trains and bridges.</p>

Who was soft on terrorism then&#x003F; We should just ask the hon. the Minister of Community Development, who was a newspaper editor at the time, what he wrote then about which side was soft on terrorism.

<p>The conversion of South Africa into an industrial country took place during the war years under the U.P. Government. The hon. members are contradicting the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The Minister of Foreign Affairs himself said at the U.N. that the conversion of South Africa into an industrial country took place during the war years under our Government. I am not raising these things in order to offend anyone. I am only mentioning them in order to show that it is true that every party has things it would like to remember, just as it has things it would like to forget; and to my mind a slanging match in this Parliament about the past will not get South Africa any further. Particularly this planned campaign of the National Party according to which it is alleged that the Afrikaner is now hated so terribly, is to my mind, beneath the dignity of the Afrikaner. Look, let us be honest with each other now. We know there are Englishmen who do not like the Afrikaner, but there are many Afrikaners who do not like the English either; and there are Afrikaners and Englishmen who do not like the Jews; and there are Nationalists who do not like Portuguese immigrants; and there are Protestants who do not like Catholics. This is simply the kind of country we are, and I can continue in this vein. But where is it going to get us if the Jews sitting here get up and start abusing the Nationalists whom they suspect and say that they hate the Jews; and if English-speaking people start playing the same game and abuse members opposite because they allegedly hate the English. This would simply become a political madhouse.</p>

<p>I said that, but on this side there are no Englishmen who introduced motions, if we want to go back into the past, of the kind that members of the Government side did. I concede <span class="col_4939-4940" refersTo="page_0933"/>that in the past most of us were subject to feelings which ran very high, and one must allow for that. Most of us have at some time or other in the past made generalizations and statements we should perhaps not have made; but one had hoped that we were past the stage where we would still approve things of this kind; and if a Minister has proof that a person is an anti-Afrikaner, one does not mind if he gets up and produces that proof. But I think it is grossly unfair that the charge is simply made against a man, whether he be English-speaking or Afrikaans-speaking, he hates the Afrikaner, without there being a single proof of it. Sir, a new phenomenon which I think is absolutely ridiculous has now arisen here. It is the duty of this House, it is its basic purpose, to scrutinize as thoroughly as possible the way in which the country is administered, and it is also the duty of this House to take a keen look at the way in which a Cabinet member handles his portfolio. But I think it is the height of absurdity for a Minister to adopt the attitude here that he should not be attacked or criticized because, if it is done, it is done because he is an Afrikaner. I think it is extremely improper for a Minister, or any member, to hide behind his Afrikanerhood when he is criticized, because it amounts to this, that he claims for himself the right not to be criticized, because he is either an Afrikaner or an English-speaking person, like the hon. the Minister of Tourism. However, the point I actually wanted to make is that, whatever the situation between the Afrikaans-speaking and the English-speaking people, I think we can still manage with this kind of thing, but what is far more serious is the new verkrampte onslaught in regard to matters of colour that we have been getting from various circles during the past four days. No one will deny that there are situations to which the White community, of which all of us form part, does not have an immediate answer. We do not have all the answers to every difficult situation. There are situations about which we as Whites will still have to think very hard, but we are not going to get any closer to the answers with the kind of speeches made here by the Minister of Labour, the hon. member for Lydenburg and the hon. member for Malmesbury as well as the hon. the Minister of Information. The attitude they revealed in regard to White/non-White relations is of no value to South Africa. Take the speech of the hon. the Minister of Information. He put a number of questions to me. Let me say what I find a pity. He is the Minister of Information and everything he says in this House is studied by foreign representatives. It is analysed and sent abroad to the Governments there, because he is the person who has to polish up South Africa&#x2019;s image to the outside world. However, he comes here with petty apartheid politics, which almost ought to be something of the past, and talks about separate entrances and universities and so forth. He wanted to know whether we would allow mixed universities. But his party has been in power for almost 25 years. Surely there are mixed universities at present&#x003F; [Interjections.] Why does he ask us&#x003F; He asks whether we would allow mixed schools, but are there not mixed schools in South Africa today&#x003F;</p>

<p>What particularly worried me was the hon. member for Lydenburg&#x2014;look at the speech he made. He concerned himself particularly with Coloured members of the House of Assembly. It is alleged to be such a terrible thing that a Coloured would sit here in the House of Assembly. He was very quick to talk about spineless people on this side. I want to ask him&#x2014;and I also ask other hon. members sitting over there : They have seen in the newspaper that Coloureds, Indians and Black South Africans are now for the first time in the history of South Africa going to be used to help fight terrorists on our borders; no longer, as in the old days, merely as assistants or attendants. No, Gen. Gideon Joubert, the Commissioner of Police, announced that they were being effectively armed, and he used the following words (<i>Rapport,</i> 16.1.72) (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<p>On a page featuring a big photograph <i>Die Vaderland</i> published the following (<i>Die Vaderland,</i> 27.3.72) (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">White and Black fight the enemy side by side: Fully-trained non-White policemen, all of them armed to the teeth, just as our Whites, are being used in increasing numbers against Black terrorists on our borders &#x2026; The same sophisticated weapons used by White policemen on the border, have been issued to the non-Whites. These include the deadly R1 gun, as well as the usual other sub-machine guns and machine guns. The border uniforms of the non-Whites are exactly the same as those of the White police. They are also housed in the same manner.</block>

<p>I hope they are given the same pay, because every man&#x2019;s life is worth the same to him. However, we shall be able to discuss that at a later stage. I mention this with appreciation to the Commissioner of Police, Gen. Joubert, and to the hon. the Minister of Police. This is level-headedness; this is right. But now I ask the hon. member for Lydenburg&#x2014;he may reply to me later, since he is not present at the moment in any event and I do not expect someone to give answers across the floor; it is not the proper way to do so&#x2014;whether he, as a White man who is not a spineless person, <span class="col_4943-4944" refersTo="page_0935"/>is of the opinion that the Coloured people &#x2026; I use the Coloured people as an example, because the Coloured people are in the position that their eventual political rights cannot be organized on a decentralized basis, on a geographically decentralized basis. That is the only reason why I am using the Coloured people as an example.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. member whether he and other hon. members adopt the attitude that we are going to call upon the Coloured people to perform the highest civic duty, but that those very same Coloured people who are helping to save our skins, while we are sitting here in the shadow of Table Mountain, are to be afforded no opportunity of earning the highest civic right as well&#x003F; [Interjections.] Is that his view&#x003F; Is it a proper view for a White man&#x003F;</p>

I think people who tell that story ought to be ashamed of themselves. If 166 White representatives in this House were to be unable to protect their fundamental interests in the face of six Coloured representatives, the Whites in South Africa would not be worth two pinches of salt and the writing would already be on the wall for them in any event. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The Government&#x2019;s approach to this matter is a misrepresentation of the facts in any event. The Coloured electorate never acted as a bloc against any specific party in the past. The old National Party under Gen. Hertzog enjoyed very strong support from the Coloured people. Mr. Bruckner de Villiers won the election in Stellenbosch on the strength of the Coloured vote and he was carried into these buildings of Parliament by the Coloured people.</p>

And if they were to get civic rights tomorrow and become an ordinary citizen and have the vote, and have representation in this House, they will be as divided among the parties as the White group is.

<p>And we shall have to face one thing, and that is that the policy of supremacy (baasskap) has no future. And what I find interesting is that the Government has acknowledged this in the case of the Black man; it is honest enough to admit that supremacy over the Black man has no future, but it obstinately clings to the myth that supremacy over the Coloured people has a future. Why then the duality&#x003F; And I want to say this: They are trying all kinds of roundabout ways which are characteristic of the old colonial powers. Sham powers are dished out and councils are established which will never be able to get truly meaningful powers. And I think it is ironic, Mr. Speaker, that the Afrikaners, who in fact pride themselves having been the first to revolt against imperialism and colonialism, are trying to apply all the tricks of the old colonial powers all over again to the Coloured people here. It is just a question of time before you will see that a council such as the Coloured Persons Representative Council is going to collapse&#x2014;the process has already set in&#x2014; because in the long run one simply cannot gull someone into thinking that he has powers while he has none. And in a situation as intertwined as the Coloured people are with the Whites, one cannot establish two Parliaments in the same territory. Mr. Speaker, I believe we should give the Coloured people a share in every case where decisions are taken about their interests and their lives just as about ours.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think you will allow me, before I go further, to convey the sincere congratulations of this side of the House to the hon. the Minister of Transport on the honorary doctorate which he received from the University of Port Elizabeth. I do this particularly because in the <i>curriculum vitae,</i> which was presented, it was mentioned that the honorary doctorate was being granted to him in consideration of the services which the hon. the Minister of Transport furnished in this House. We join him in gratitude for that well-earned award that was granted to him.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, who has just resumed his seat, of course adopted the old United Party tactics that we know well by saying that if we continue along these lines in quoting history, we shall get no further, because that will then be the position, and then he devotes more than half of the speech he made to the sins the National Party allegedly committed in the past. The hon. member even accuses them of terrorism, etc. I leave it at that, Mr. Speaker, but then the hon. member says that if we continue in this vein &#x2026; You see, Mr. Speaker, it is the same old story we are objecting to. But I come back to the hon. member. When the election in Oudtshoorn was announced, a report appeared in the <i>Sunday Times</i> about the candidate in Oudtshoorn. And the report was headlined as follows: &#x201C;Horses for courses.&#x201D; All kinds of accusations were brought against Mr. Myburgh. As far as I am concerned it is not a question of whether he wants to eat with Coloureds or not. What I am more concerned about is that on the same occasion he said (translation): &#x201C;It does not concern me what the Bantu&#x2019;s position in South Africa is : it is not my task to look after them.&#x201D; Mr. Speaker, this must be read in conjunction with what this newspaper, the <i>Sunday Times,</i> wrote about the hon. member for Hillbrow a short while ago when he was hauled over the coals because he allegedly made certain disparaging remarks about certain Bantustans. Myburgh is praised to the skies, praised to the very skies.</p>

<p>But what happened, Mr. Speaker. When Mr. Myburgh became the United Party candidate for Oudtshoorn, there in the far north, in the Transvaal the English-language Press&#x2014;the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> and such newspapers, which do not get near Oudtshoorn, objected to Mr. Myburgh&#x2019;s candidature for the edification and the consumption of the Transvaal electorate and for consumption abroad. But here in the Cape the <i>Cape Times</i> and the <i>Cape Argus,</i> which could possibly be read in Oudtshoorn, keep perfectly quiet. You see, Mr. Speaker, here is South Africa&#x2019;s dilemma, i.e. that the English-language Press in South Africa has drawn a &#x201C;Paper Curtain&#x201D; around South Africa similar to the &#x201C;Iron Curtain&#x201D;. And the true image, the cross-sectional <span class="col_4947-4948" refersTo="page_0937"/>image, of South Africa cannot reach the countries abroad. The best elements of the democracy that can become known outside South Africa, except for what is done by the hon. the Minister of Information and his department, are due to your efforts, Mr. Speaker, by way of your protection of the hon. member for Houghton. That is all that is known. For the rest we are dependent upon reports that create an absolutely impossible position; which create a position such as that over the last few months in which a merciless campaign has been conducted against the Police in this country.</p>

<p>Those hon. members of the Opposition sitting opposite us over there&#x2014;I can mention numerous examples&#x2014;who conduct a campaign against the Police because, in the first place, they believe they will use every means in the struggle&#x2014;it does not matter what damage South Africa suffers&#x2014;as long as the National Party is simply ploughed under. In the second place, Mr. Speaker, it is because most of the Police are Afrikaners. In <i>The Star</i> of 2nd November, 1971, there appears a report under the following heading: &#x201C;M.P. has new fear for Police.&#x201D; I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Eric Winchester, United Party M.P. for Port Natal, warned today that the Government may ultimately allow the Security Branch to turn its attention to the members of the official Opposition. Mr. Winchester said the public should not be surprised if the actions of the Security Police and the Government&#x2019;s refusal to hold public inquiries into the death of Mr. Timol. If the alarming trend continues &#x2026;</block>

<p>Then he states a significant thing&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and history repeats itself, even the official Opposition will be subjected in this mode.</block>

<p>All the hon. members know that this statement is devoid of all truth. The fact is that this report must be read outside the country&#x2019;s borders. It is that &#x201C;Paper Curtain&#x201D;, which in many cases is more formidable than the real &#x201C;Iron Curtain&#x201D;. We know that story and we know how they have had various things to say, even in this Parliament, for outside consumption. The hon. member for Constantia stood up the other day and said that the process of devaluation is a process of bankruptcy.</p>

<p>The other day he stood up and said that the measure of revival in the South African economy is not attributable to the Minister of Finance&#x2019;s Budget, but to the Budget in the British Parliament. Must everything then be discredited&#x003F; Hon. members are aware of the fact that a merciless gossip campaign has been launched against every Afrikaans company on the Stock Exchange. I would not be surprised if the gossip campaign launched against the Trust Bank does not also emanate from that ride. Hon. members saw what happened last Sunday. Another big financial institution, Volkskas, was attacked in bold headlines by a certain newspaper. From a business point of view I do not think that Volkskas acted correctly, but is that a way to drag a big financial institution through the mud, as a result of a mistake in a statute probably dating from the days prior to its appearance on the Exchange&#x003F; Notwithstanding that, these statutes were approved by the Exchange. No objection was raised. No, we cannot go on in that vein.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the basic subject we have been debating throughout the week. This concerns the policy of the United Party. No one has taken any notice of the policy of the United Party, but as the hon. the Minister of Labour stated clearly the other day, they say they want to take over and therefore we must see if there is any future. In the <i>Volksblad</i> of 11th December, 1971, I read the following in connection with the United Party&#x2019;s Congress at Bloemfontein (translation): &#x201C;Federation : Vause Raw sees no end to the road.&#x201D;</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. V. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>That is Vause Raw. From this report it was very clear that he was referring to another statement of the Leader of the Opposition. I tried to see whether I could not get hold of the report. And I did get hold of it. It appeared in the <i>Cape Argus</i> of 10th November, 1971, and also concerns this congress. The Leader of the Opposition said, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and the criticism of the United Party policy centres on what would be no more than an &#x201C;interim phase&#x201D; &#x2026;</block>

<p>As far as I am concerned, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition&#x2019;s conduct is the strangest phenomenon I have seen in a long time. Here, in the hon. the Leader of the Opposition&#x2019;s presence, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout must stand up at the beginning of the year and clearly say that the Leader of the Opposition said it is only an interim policy. What was the reaction to that&#x003F; The hon. member for Yeoville then suddenly said to the Chief Whip : &#x201C;Tell Japie he must sit down.&#x201D; What the Chief Whip said I could not hear, because he speaks a little softly. The leader let it pass just like that, and for months the matter was simply left there, and there were hints, as if the hon. member for Bezuidenhout had committed an offence. There were even some of the United Party members who said in the passages outside : &#x201C;We really are going to wallop him; this sort of thing must stop.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Now I ask hon. members what they would do. If my leader were in such a position, and placed me in such a position that he could not give me that protection when I repeated what he said, I would rather leave. Then one begins to think about the possibilities of the Leader of the Opposition. Eventually one can only laugh at him, but if one thinks further one asks oneself who could become Leader of the Opposition. One then lands oneself up in the position of the man who laughed at his wife&#x2019;s cosmetics. He laughed at her cosmetics until one day he saw her without any make-up. However, the report continues. Those three phases are created, the first of which is that all the discriminating laws will be repealed, something which was spoken about in the House yesterday by the Minister of Information and which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout ostensibly replied to. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout mentioned one small instance that took place, and built everything up around that.</p>

<p>My reply to him is with reference to the first National Party Oudtshoorn representative, Mr. C. J. Langenhoven (translation): &#x201C;Who points to a hole in a sieve and pokes fun at it&#x003F;&#x201D; That is the first phase. Now we come to the second phase. In the second phase the various representatives are nominated. After that there are questions about how the people are going to be chosen. Then they say they must not ask that, because that is just an academic question. There will be eight, six and two representatives respectively for the Bantu, the Coloureds and the Indians. Then the Leader of the Opposition states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Then would come the final stage. It would be the product of proper consultation and agreement &#x2026;</block>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; that there would be consultation and negotiation with independent or near-independent Bantustans.</block>

<p>Sir, there must first be eight representatives of the Bantu in this Parliament, and after those eight representatives have been appointed, they will for the first time speak to the Bantustans. In other words, those eight representatives cannot come from the Bantustans; they must just be taken from amongst the other Bantu. Only then must there be consultations with all the millions of other Bantu remaining. How can anyone else consult them without giving them representation&#x003F; It is utterly and completely unthinkable.</p>

<p>I regret that my time is now up. It is very clear to me that the Leader of the Oposition does not see the end of the road either. He is simply going to make an interim plan. The Leader of the Opposition expects every White man in this country to put him in a position of the toad who fell into the can of cream. After he has fallen in he must just go on kicking until the cream turns to butter, and then he can get out. But the condition is: One must first fall in.</p>

<speech by="#janson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. N. H. JANSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in my opinion it is probably not necessary to say that in Parliament there are certain important debates in which major matters of policy are discussed. One of the important debates, besides the no-confidence debate, is the debate which has been conducted over the past few days. In this debate we may discuss major matters of policy. It is not only as from today that this has been the case. In 1945, when Dr. Malan was still the Leader of the Opposition, he put it in clear terms in the Budget debate held in March of that year. On that occasion he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You can possibly take measures to ensure a livelihood for the population as a whole, and for sections of the population, but this question that I have touched on this morning eclipses all the others in importance.</block>

<p>Later in his speech he said, by way of criticism of what was happening in the case of the then Government, that its attitude was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Do not look at the question of race or of the colour of the skin; look at the profits that the Railways makes. Run the railways in the cheapest way, and that is the only consideration there should be.</block>

<p>He made these accusations and then went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That gave rise, as everyone later could see, to the creation on a larger scale than ever before of slums in our towns, which are an eternal reproach to South Africa and to the policy of the White population. Slums where White and non-White, Europeans, Natives and Coloureds live mixed up, whatever the consequence of that might be. The position during those 26 years when it was a case of groping round in the semidarkness developed still further, and became more complicated and still more insoluble.</block>

<p>Then he put the theme of his speech, the theme which had dominated the political scene, the entire national scene in South Africa over the years, like this. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When I put the question: &#x2018;Whither is South Africa heading&#x003F;&#x2019;, it includes the question: &#x2018;What will be the position in the future of the White race in South Africa&#x003F;&#x2019; It goes even deeper, there is a still more serious question : &#x2018;In the long run will there still be a White race in South Africa&#x003F;&#x2019;</block>

<p>Sir, as a member of this side of the House, let me merely say this : Let us differ in considering methods; let us differ about smaller things and the implementation of policy, but to me the basic question we are concerned with in South Africa is not, in the <span class="col_4953-4954" refersTo="page_0940"/>first place, along what channels other peoples may be led to independence&#x2014;because there have been adjustments to the policy in the past, and there will have to be in future as well&#x2014;but still whether there will be a White, Christian civilization in South Africa in 20 or 30 years&#x2019; time. I make no apology to South Africa, neither to the non-Whites of South Africa, nor to Africa, the West, the East or to the world when I say that I am in the first place fighting for the survival of my own people, of my White, Christian civilization.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we have always heard preciously little about this from the side of the Opposition, not only in this debate, but also in the no-confidence debate. A few moments ago the hon. member for Fauresmith said : &#x201C;Who looks at a small hole in a sieve and ridicules it&#x003F;&#x201D; This derisive question is applicable to numerous members opposite who, over the years and now again have had the opportunity of making a positive contribution to the welfare of South Africa but only looked at one small hole in the sieve. Sir, it was necessary to examine the pattern for the future. I believe one thing, Mr. Speaker. There may be exceptions; there may be people like the member for Houghton and there may be inciters who are far worse than the representative of Houghton&#x2014;some of whom have fled the country and some of whom are still here&#x2014;but I believe that there are also people sitting on the opposite side, and people who vote for the opposite side, who believe along with me and this side of the House that what we are concerned with is the preservation of the White, Christian civilization in South Africa. But, Sir, what have we had from that side of this House, a side that represents people who took them at their word when they said that they, too, wanted to fight for White survival, for Christian survival&#x003F; What have we had from them&#x003F; They ridicule a small hole in a sieve.</p>

<p>Where we are concerned here with major matters, not only backbenchers of that party, but also frontbenchers, have devoted their attention to minor, insignificant things which, when the dust has settled and the history books are written, will not even be mentioned.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout spoke here this morning. He is a very intelligent man; we know this. But for every person who wants to use his intelligence, there is one necessary component, and that is that he should use his common sense as well. If one only has intelligence and does not use one&#x2019;s common sense, it does not bring one anywhere. Where does it bring one when that hon. member reproaches our side of this House with raising minor matters, when he himself speaks with a cynical laugh of small apartheid, and of a lift in which Coloureds are allowed at one place but perhaps not at another&#x003F; I admit it is necessary for adjustments to be made from time to time in the implementation of our policy. But that hon. member, a frontbencher of that party, delights in talking of minor examples of apartheid, and of a notice board wrongly phrased at one place and wrongly advertised at another. Of what importance are these insignificant examples in the major issue that South Africa shall remain White&#x003F; And not only that White South Africa shall remain White, but that it shall carry out its calling, its task, towards the rest of Africa&#x003F; As the hon. the Prime Minister has said, our calling is not merely to preserve our Christian civilization here, but to convey that message to the rest of Africa.</p>

<p>What else have we had from the Opposition&#x003F; It is true that certain things that have happened, such as the Agliotti transaction, have to be investigated, and I, for one, am glad that they are being thoroughly investigated, not merely as irregularities which simply occurred but that they are being investigated in such a way that even though the investigations may take longer, they will allow of measures being taken for the prevention of similar cases, which may crop up in any administration. But when the dust has settled about the Agliotti case, what would it have done as regards the preservation of the White, Christian civilization.</p>

<p>That hon. member for Zululand, who is a frontbencher and a leader, who has to guide not only junior members on his side, but also his voters and other people in South Africa, that man whose voice is heard by the non-Whites who should take an example from the Whites&#x2014;is it fitting to hear from the lips of a senior man of the United Party, the alternative Government, from the lips of a man who is a member of the shadow Cabinet of the Opposition, a reference in this House to &#x201C;maggots feeding on a corpse&#x201D;&#x003F;</p>

<p>Has it become the task of an Opposition in these major debates, not when Votes are under discussion&#x2014;because I agree it is necessary that they should continually be examined and that criticism should be exercised where necessary, and that proper administration should be ensured from all sides&#x2014;but has it become the pattern of an Opposition that wants to gain a seat here and a number of votes somewhere else, to boast that it has drawn more votes&#x003F; It elevates to the status of a major issue that what has to be dragged in by the hair every time year after year, such as the case of a Land Bank loan to a certain Mr. Kolver. Has this become the main thing for an Opposition, the alternative Government, that goes and tells the world as though it was the most terrible transgression that a telephone had been installed which, as it happened, served a Minister as well&#x003F; Has it become the main thing in the discussion of our national policy, of the future of a White, Christian civilization, if year after year in budget debates and in no-confidence debates we have talk of the price of soap and of blades&#x003F; How many times have these things been mentioned in this House, to the point of boredom, and from public platforms when we as Whites should be fighting together for the survival of South Africa&#x003F;</p>

<p>Now it is being said that this National Party Government has created bad race relations. I am not going to bore you with long quotations. I merely want to say that in 1947, in the discussion of a private motion, the late Adv. Eric Louw rose and warned against the dangers which prevailed in Africa, and he quoted from publications which were well-disposed towards the Opposition. These things which are now being said of the creation of bad relations, these charges of hate which is growing&#x2014;I admit there are bad relations; I admit everything is not right between our population groups, especially between our White and our Coloured population groups. I admit that a great deal of work must be done, and I know that we shall have to accept that task with dedication. But did this start today, or was Adv. Eric Louw wrong when he quoted what had been said by Dr. A. M. Dadoo in 1947 about the defeat of Gen. Smuts at the UN&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is an indication that the Union Government is bent upon continuing with its old racial and colour bar policies in the face of the United Nations&#x2019; General Assembly&#x2019;s decision to the contrary.</block>

<p>Is it this Government which is responsible for the flame of hate which flared up in the world as long ago as that not only against the National Party, but against the Whites, and for the following statement made by a Mrs. Z. Gool here on the square in Cape Town the day after the Prime Minister had spoken on his return from the UN&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Gen. Smuts has suffered a major defeat at UNO and the great powers of the world now knew how the non-Europeans in South Africa were oppressed.</block>

<p>In spite of representation in Parliament at the time and promises of further representation, this was said. What else was said&#x003F; I am discussing this for the information of the hon. friend who spoke of the Utopia which prevailed at that time under the United Party Government of Gen. Smuts. Adv. Eric Louw quoted that the report went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Another speaker said we must be ready to fight for our rights to the extent of spilling blood.</block>

<p>These are not statements of today. In 1947 that flame of hate had already been planted in Africa and we have inherited it. I am not saying that was the fault of the United Party. It is petty to level that sort of accusation across the floor of this House. I do think, however, the time has arrived when we must accept that we have a joint task and that a party in Africa, a party in South Africa, a party which professes that it wants to be Christian and White, must not indulge in petty things when major matters must be discussed.</p>

<p>That is a young member, but I am not going to call him a backbencher, because he is as much a member of this House as I am. I shall reply to what he as an Afrikaans-speaking person says. I am also Afrikaans speaking. I shall reply briefly because I think enough has been said about this aspect. I am sorry it has become necessary for these things to be repeated, but I have had the experience in Cape Town&#x2014;I am making no apology <span class="col_4957-4958" refersTo="page_0942"/>for my conduct&#x2014;that I phone people and speak in my language, but that I am answered in English. If somebody else says he cannot speak Afrikaans, I answer him in English. We do so with immigrants as well. Let me say to that Afrikaner son, who says he is Afrikaans-speaking, that English is a world language. I am proud of the fact that I have some knowledge of that language because it enables me to make myself understood in the world. I want to say to that fellow member what Langenhoven said. I am not saying he is a renegade, but Afrikaans-speaking people should guard against renegades in this country. Langenhoven once said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. N. H. JANSON</person>:</from>

<p>It is so that things have improved over the years, and let me say that I am grateful for it. I am grateful for the fact that a man such as the hon. member for Durban Point rises and delivers part of his speech in Afrikaans and that other English-speaking members do so as well. I can understand that there are people who cannot do so in full. However, I draw the line when people start scorning their own language. Let me address this to that hon. member for Turffontein and a few of his Afrikaner friends here. I have noticed something else in this House. I have noticed something which has hurt me, because it hurts me as an Afrikaner to know that whilst we have English-speaking people here and who look at one with appreciation when one talks of Afrikanerhood and about other things of which one is proud, there are a few of those extreme United Party members who profess to be Afrikaners, yet laugh at one when one speaks of Afrikanerhood. They do this while English-speaking people appreciate one&#x2019;s standpoint. I do not apologize for being Afrikaans-speaking.</p>

<p>What is happening here in South Africa and in Africa, simply demands of leaders on both sides to take a fresh look at an old approach. One cannot get away from the fact that whatever is said in this House, is used against us.</p>

<p>Eight non-White representatives have been suggested as a solution. Surely there was representation of non-White groups in this House and surely there was talk of extending their representation. Surely there was thinking along those lines. Is it necessary for us to argue over and over about morality in this regard&#x003F; People ask whether it is morally right not to give representation to non-Whites, while, as someone said a moment ago, one expects of them to join one in a fight. But is it moral to give him fewer voices than one gives oneself&#x003F; Am I worth 12 Coloureds, or is a member of the United Party worth 20 Coloureds&#x003F; Why should they be fewer in number&#x003F; Where is the morality&#x003F; If we start talking about morality, and if we are honest in our hearts as far as morality is concerned and are not playing with words which are cast before people, let us apply the consequences of morality throughout. In that case, why should a difference be made between Coloureds and Bantu&#x003F; Where is the morality in an assumption that a Coloured is worth more than a Bantu, if those arbitrary norms are applied&#x003F; Why should they be treated differently&#x003F; If the Opposition wants to carry the morality argument through to its full consequences, do so by all means. Why did they say initially that the representatives should first be Whites&#x003F; Why should Whites decide whether the number of representatives should be eight if the non-Whites ask for 10 or 12 or 20&#x003F; Must they come with their hats in their hands and ask the United Party&#x003F; Is that the last word&#x003F; Is there any one in South Africa who is still na&#x00EF;ve enough to think that they will want eight representatives&#x2014;make it 20, no, 50 representatives&#x2014;and that they would reach a final solution or come closer to a solution by those means&#x003F;</p>

<p>Once there was an old Afrikaans statesman who was concerned about problems of franchise in his republic. It was an Afrikaans-speaking republic, but at present we are living in a Republic in which English and Afrikaans-speaking people, Jews and non-Jews, Christians, Roman Catholics and Protestants will all fight together. But <span class="col_4959-4960" refersTo="page_0943"/>he said what I should just like to tell the Opposition today: Do not think those who demand it want the franchise. &#x201C;They do not want the franchise,&#x201D; President Kruger said, &#x201C;they want our fatherland.&#x201D; Do hon. members think those people in London who collect money for Defence and Aid, those expatriates who traverse the world with their propaganda and who, under our democratic right, are even allowed here to distribute their propaganda among the people, want the franchise or three representatives in the House of Assembly&#x003F;</p>

<p>They want your fatherland, not only mine. The National Party has said &#x201C;over our dead body&#x201D;. They will not get our fatherland. With the fairest and most genuine intentions as Christians, we want to say to them we shall give them their own fatherland. If hon. members only wanted to co-operate and convince the people of our sincere intentions to give them something, the term &#x201C;homeland&#x201D; that we use today, would no longer be used, but the day would arrive when the Tswana would refer to his country not as his homeland, but as his fatherland. This is what is being done by this party and what this party is working for.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that an appeal goes out not only to the Opposition members who mean well by South Africa, but also to those well-meaning critics in the Afrikaner ranks, in the newspaper world, to the academics, and to those people who are critical of the National Party, often with justification. Sometimes those people, too, give sound advice to our country from afar and express well-considered criticism. But there is only one place in which the future of South Africa may be served best &#x2014;we are addressing that invitation to academics, learned men and businessmen&#x2014; and that is within the organization of the National Party. There is the threat to the Christian civilization of the hordes of Mohammedans and others moving across Africa. There is only one place to save South Africa and to save Africa for Christianity from those hordes which are coming, and that is within the framework of the National Party.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member for Witbank was not bound, unfortunately, by the inhibitions of a party member, he would have explained what he really wanted to say, more particularly to the hon. Minister of Defence, who is leaving the Chamber, and to some of the other front benchers of the Government Party and those who attacked this party with regard to language. He would have liked to have told them&#x2014;that is what I think he intended to convey throughout his speech; a deeply emotional speech&#x2014;that he absolutely abhors the unfortunate level to which the attack of the Government has descended in dragging across the floor of this House matters of 50 years ago, differences which have been buried already. It is a time when we should be living in unity, when the people of South Africa should be thinking as South Africans. This is what he wanted to criticize the House for. He was talking his own politics, but right through his whole address it was clear that his purpose was to chide the House for having introduced the note to which we were unfortunately obliged to listen from the Government side throughout the last few days. It is not only he. He feels it as a man who has ministered to a community, but right throughout the city and the country people are questioning the reason as to why the Government allowed its frontbenchers, its leading members, to descend to the level to which they descended in the last few days, introducing racial matters and the very flame of hatred to which the hon. member who has just sat down, has referred. While we were dealing with the finances of the people, with the future of South Africa&#x2019;s sustenance, with the alleviation of the problems and the difficulties of the man in the street, in addition to the economy of the country, the whole debate was diverted to a personal attack in this House on an issue which had been dealt with and settled years ago, an issue which members on the Government side themselves have maintained in recent years has been forgotten. They had maintained that South Africa was now moving on the road to unity, where the White peoples of South Africa were more concerned with the problems facing our country than the differences between them on simple, childish issues. We were accused that we had raised little issues. The reason why reference was made to these issues, was that the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions introduced a number of extremely petty issues into the debate in the course of his address yesterday, to which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout has adequately replied, and to which the hon. Minister had no answer at all.</p>

<p>I think we should come back to the question of finance. But before doing so, I want <span class="col_4961-4962" refersTo="page_0944"/>to make another point clear as well. <i>Die Burger</i> carried a leader yesterday and made an admission. This is an admission which the Government side has unfortunately been obliged to face. It is now obliged to take notice of the fact that there is a growing feeling of support throughout the country which is going to bring the Opposition Party to Government. There is a real danger today, as far as they are concerned, that an alternative Government will take over and the time may be much shorter than they realize themselves. Whereas, instead of dealing with the policy of this party, if they wish to do so, they diverted the debate to a discussion of racial issues. They are concerned that in the event of their majority in Oudtshoorn being cut even by as little as 500 or 200 votes, it will add further stimulus to the growing conviction throughout the country that the country is preparing itself for an alternative Government in South Africa. This was evident right from the day the debate started, on Monday, but more particularly on Tuesday, when without hesitation the Government speakers immediately plunged into this peculiar debate. But I feel it is essential to bring the House back to the subject with which we are faced in this particular debate.</p>

<p>I had the opportunity yesterday morning of sending over to the hon. the Minister of Finance a petition signed by approximately 30 000 women. According to what has been told to me by their representatives who handed the petition to me, it was signed by women from all over South Africa, from small towns, large towns, villages and settlements. It was a wide cross-section of persons from all the different political and other convictions. It was a petition which was not organized by anyone in particular, but arose spontaneously from a desire of a group of housewives to try to say something for themselves, if they could, directly to the Government concerning the increase in the cost of living. Sir, the point has been made on the other side of the House that wages over the last couple of years have increased at a much faster rate than the consumer index. Sir, the comparison of wages with the consumer index is a fallacious one. When we find that wages increase and productivity either stands still or recedes then the cost of living automatically goes up. And that is exactly what will happen as a result of the policy as it exemplifies itself through the tone of the Budget. Whilst an effort is being made by the hon. the Minister of Defence and the Government to encourage further productivity, unless it is going to increase at a rapid pace, overall it will be impossible for it to counteract the spiralling increase in the cost of living. Sir, it is the opinion of many economists throughout the country that it is going to be almost impossible to check this.</p>

<p>What are these women complaining about, Sir&#x003F; In their petition they state that they are aware that the health of the nation depends on basic foodstuffs&#x2014;bread, butter, milk, cheese, meat, fish, etc.&#x2014;and that these foodstuffs are being priced out of thousands of homes in South Africa. They are aware of the fact that the right to own a home is being denied most of the younger generation of married South Africans because of high prices. They are aware of the fact that it is becoming more and more difficult to clothe families adequately and to give them the amenities to which civilized life entitles them. And they are aware, Sir, that there are hundreds of thousands of people throughout our country whose misfortunes because of the high cost of living, exceed even those of the very people who signed this petition. Their appeal is that something should be done to alleviate and to halt this rising cost of living. And we have to consider, Sir, whether the hon. the Minister, in the course of his Budget speech, has furnished us with any plan by means of which this kind of alleviation can be provided. In common with men who have a real knowledge of this subject&#x2014;and you will find this in every report that has been issued by leading spokesmen throughout South Africa, such as the General Manager of Trust Bank and leading financiers of large companies, mining companies, industrial companies and of all large undertakings in South Africa&#x2014;I say that unless one solves the problem of labour, it still remains the crux and the answer to the entire economic future of the country and the possibility of growth in our economy.</p>

<p>Whilst the hon. the Minister has spoken about a new flexibility in labour, and whilst the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs has by means of certain clich&#x00E9;s&#x2014; with which I am going to deal in a moment&#x2014;indicated that he is going to use non-White labour, or let us say, unutilized labour, where it can be economically used by people to serve their own people, the hon. the Minister of Transport took an entirely different line because he spoke <span class="col_4963-4964" refersTo="page_0945"/>about training labour, about ensuring that he has the labour to enable the wheels of his industry to move. And if you will look at the various statements made by these particular Ministers, Sir, you will find that there is a complete difference in their approach. The hon. the Minister of Transport did not speak vaguely of the flexibility of labour, nor did he lay down certain restrictions for certain restricted fields in which it could be used. He went further than that. He says the following, and I am reading from column 2763 of Hansard of 8th March, 1972&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The employment of non-Whites in certain graded positions previously occupied by Whites, on a basis whereby the duties of the two groups are clearly demarcated, has widened the scope of work in which the services of non-Whites may be utilized.</block>

<p>He says that Government policy is being implemented wherever possible, resulting in the releasing of Whites for work elsewhere and in filling more vacancies in the bread and butter grades. In other words, Sir, there is no fear in his mind that anyone is being pushed out of a job.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I was quoting the policy of the hon. the Minister of Transport with regard to labour. I want to conclude with one other point he made. He said in his Budget speech that it was interesting to note that, through the greater utilization of non-White labour, the department had been able to offer many White workers better positions. The point I wish to make is that, whilst the hon. the Minister of Finance is trying to ensure that we get the full benefits of the expenditure on infrastructure over the last few years and that, in the current Budget, the loan moneys should at least be sufficient to maintain the continuance of the much-needed infrastructure, it is vital to remember that the reason why economic experts say that labour is still the crux of the future growth of the country, is that manpower forms a vital part of the infrastructure of the country. Although one has machinery and equipment, roads, railways and all the other factors that are important in order to bring about production and to increase the gross national product of the country, it is nevertheless vital and essential that one has the manpower to use and man it satisfactorily. One must have efficient manpower. Experts such as Etienne Rossouw and others, who have recently delivered addresses, all make it very clear indeed that South Africa has a long way to go in order to meet its requirements for management over the next few years, not to mention the various other grades of work in which manpower will be required. The clich&#x00E9; that has been used by the hon. the Minister of Labour, which I think has been used purely for political reasons and only with the hope that it will appeal to some of his voters and nothing else, is that non-White labour can be used only if it does not displace other workers, if it is sufficiently controlled and so on. This is not a sound approach because non-White labour will be introduced only if it is required. Labour of any kind will be introduced into the economy only if it is required. It will be largely guided by the law of supply and demand. However, it is vital to a country such as South Africa, if we are to maintain our growth, that we should not restrict it or inhibit it because of the lack of labour resources. It is also an accepted fact today, as I have pointed out earlier, that, in introducing labour at the initial stages of an upward trend, instead of displacing others, it enables them to move into very much better positions with better pay where their experience can be of value.</p>

<p>The po&#x2019;int has also been raised&#x2014;and this is vital&#x2014;that, unless one trains labour and makes it readily available for this purpose, one is bound to strike difficulties and snags, in which case the labour will not be productive. Properly trained and prepared labour can be productive. I put it to the hon. the Minister of Finance that, if he is concerned about the future wealth and economic growth of South Africa, he has a responsibility to ensure, by virtue of the fact that he is the economic expert of the Government, that the country will not suffer in years to come from the lack of plentiful, properly trained labour in its various stages of development. The appeal that is always made to workers is that they must make sacrifices and work harder. I say that what is really being done, is to inhibit the future of the young generation and those who are coming forward to play their part in the economic life of the country. I believe that what is taking place today, is that the Government is showing a <span class="col_4965-4966" refersTo="page_0946"/>complete lack of leadership with regard to the future of South Africa. The people who will take them to task with regard to their lack of leadership, are the younger generation on whom we must depend if the future of South Africa is to mean anything at all.</p>

<p>The other important result that will flow from greater productivity and the greater use of labour is twofold: Firstly, as a result of greater productivity, we will be able to meet our demands and, secondly, more money will be injected into the economy through a bigger consumer market because of a much wider spectrum of earnings on the part of additional workers in our economy. If our consumer market continues to expand, we have an opportunity to be more competitive with our exports. It is a well known fact that the secret of the success of the American economy has been the fact that they have been able to provide for a continuously expanding consumer market. The whole secret of the American success in the economic world is that it has a tremendous consumer market, the requirements of which it has been able to meet. Its productivity has consequently increased at a very much greater pace. Its wage-earning capacity has been at an increasingly high level and its standard of living is extremely high indeed. In addition, it has been able to meet a competitive export market when it has needed to. In fact, the American economy hardly looked for an export market until recently because of the fact that it immersed itself in the tremendous experiment of assisting backward countries and countries which had suffered as a result of war, in order to bring about a more equable economy throughout the world. That is the only reason why its economy has suffered recently and why it is paying the price.</p>

<p>Then there is another point of view which is put forward, namely that we have a country which is entirely different because we have to meet different classes of people and different races. We have to meet people who enjoy different standards of living and who are not on the same cultural level. Our problem would therefore appear to be entirely different. I do not believe that this is the case. An improvement in the economy of the underprivileged will not bring about conflict and difficulty in our country. If anything, it will bring about greater contentment and a greater sense of unison in preserving the future of the country and in serving the country to ensure that that future is fully protected. Therefore I want to direct a plea to the hon. the Minister of Finance that he must and should give a lead with regard to the manpower position in our country and that he should give a lead to his colleagues on this particular issue, and that he should not present the country with some of the clich&#x00E9;s we have been accustomed to hearing from the Minister of Labour. This Minister can only use them for political purposes because he knows that, economically, he is entirely out of step with the economic development in the country.</p>

<p>Then I should like to mention another factor, which I believe is very important, a matter to which the hon. the Minister of Labour has not given sufficient attention. This matter was raised a little earlier and, in fact, this party dealt with it some years ago. In 1959 we raised the whole issue of the minimum wage in this country. At that time the hon. the Minister, who was the Deputy Minister of Labour, said that nowhere in the Wage Act could he find reference to the fact that wages should be based on a civilized standard. The Wage Act makes it perfectly clear that one of its objects is that the Wage Board, in making its inquiries, seeking information and presenting a plan to the country, should take into account the standard of wages required to enable a person to meet modern demands on a civilized basis. That is ingrained and is part and parcel of that particular statute. The hon. the Minister is the only person who can refuse to accept any recommendation of the Wage Board. It is not entirely in their hands. They can make the recommendation, but if the hon. the Minister is not satisfied with that recommendation, he can return it to them for further information and investigation. It is in this field, as well, that he is failing to give a lead to the country. There is no reason, today, why anyone in South Africa, whatever colour he may be, should live below the poverty datum line. As I said earlier, it not only affects them vitally in so far as their living standards are concerned, but it also inhibits the economic growth of the country and the spending power of the country. In other words, it breaks the important chain that is built up with productivity which goes together with greater earnings, a greater consumer market, a better standard of living, a standard which enables you to be competitive in your exports throughout the <span class="col_4967-4968" refersTo="page_0947"/>world. That is one reason why we are going to lose out on devaluation. We are going to lose because at this stage we are not geared up by any means to take advantage of the devaluation in South Africa. Save for the gold production, and possibly the good maize crop of last year, there are no other fields where the country has geared itself to take advantage of devaluation. In fact, for years now, due to the inhibited method of dealing with labour, the industrialists of the country have not been sufficiently encouraged nor have they received sufficient incentives which would have enabled them to export or to want to export which would have put them in the position that today under present-day circumstances they could have taken full advantage of this situation. Therefore I say to the hon. Minister he must realize that playing politics with labour is not going to get him any further. He must take an example of the fact that by proper negotiations with trade unions who themselves are not that foolish, he can possibly solve the labour problems. Recently we had numerous statements from the General Secretary of the Railway Trade Union of Salstaf and of other trade unions&#x2014;Tucsa just being one of them but not the trade union that alone needs to be quoted&#x2014;to the effect of the importance of ensuring that the labour market be met. This can be done, according to them, by negotiation where people can see eye to eye what are the proper steps to be taken in order to build up the labour situation in South Africa. All this, incidentally, affects the cost of living, because if we are to keep the cost of living down, the only way in which it can be done will be by ensuring greater productivity so that productivity races ahead of any increase in wages. If productivity overtakes the wage increase every section benefits. The wage earner benefits, the country&#x2019;s general wealth benefits and the cost of living begins to drop. I think the hon. Minister should give us a complete answer on that issue. Hitherto the only answer has been that wages have gone up at a greater pace than the consumer index. Therefore it is maintained that the cost of living is in fact not spiralling, but now it is largely due to the ideas that the Minister has put into force in his Part Appropriation Bill and other departmental steps. He is beginning to get the benefit by bringing about a drop in the cost of living. All experts maintain, and you find it in every economic newspaper you read, that costs are going to rise.</p>

<p>The cost of clothes is going to spiral, the hon. the Minister knows that, because the cost of running the factories is spiralling, the costs of motor-cars are going to increase and the cost of food is going to go up. Everything is beginning to move up or beginning to meet the limited pay-packet. This is so because today you have this extraordinary situation that instead of the housewives themselves being the shoppers for the family you find the men folk, the head of the household, assisting his wife in shopping. You will find this in all the supermarkets in the city. This is especially so during the week-end. Business men, with their wives, are doing the shopping because such a careful control has to be maintained with regard to the cost of living. It is no comfort to tell us that perhaps over one or two months there will have been a slight drop. It is no good because it will never drop until you can improve the productivity. The only way you can improve the productivity is by the introduction of labour, but if, on the other hand, the Minister of Labour can produce another 1 million, &#x00BD; million or &#x00BD; million&#x2014;White souls which are to satisfy him and which can be injected into the labour market&#x2014;let him by all means do it. This can be done by all means because economics is not concerned with the question of Colour. Economics is concerned with the introduction of sufficient labour in order to maintain that productivity. Therefore we find that whatever authority you need and whoever you listen to in this country except for the Ministers on the Government front benches&#x2014;they pose as experts&#x2014;in other words, if you listen to the acknowledged experts they will tell you that the crux of your whole problem is that the secret of the future growth of South Africa is in the solution of the problem of labour. The Minister of Transport would never have had co-operation from his trade unions unless they themselves had realized the position. They did realize it and therefore he has had the co-operation. He has never done otherwise and he had the one Government department under him which over the years has almost more non-Whites working for it than Whites. It has not affected the situation of South Africa and it has not kept young men out of jobs; on the contrary, with a policy like this the future generations will have a very much higher standard of living and they will begin to play a greater part in the economic life of this country. They will begin to find <span class="col_4969-4970" refersTo="page_0948"/>that they can train their children to play a greater part in it. Therefore we shall have a standard which is very high and we shall not have to ask them to be the hewers of wood and the drawers of water. Let me point out to the Minister of Labour a very interesting thing that is taking place even in that very labour field which he feels he should not make use of. Even they, the Bantu, when they come from the Reserves to, for instance, jobs like cleansing jobs in municipalities and jobs like the delivery of heavy articles such as bags of cement and bags of coal, are five or six months in the job before they start looking for something better. If this were all properly controlled, and if this were placed in the proper categories we would be able to infuse a steady control and scientific labour force which would be able to meet all the requirement of the country in its proper stages. This would enable the entire wage earning capacity of the country to achieve greater heights and we would not have people signing petitions, and clamouring for a reduction in the cost of living and complaining about the burdens which are placed upon them. Finally, I want to say if the hon. Minister thinks that he can find any comfort in what some industrialists have said about providing for future growth &#x2026; [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have now come to the end of a very historic week in the history of this Parliament. If one looks at the methods used by the United Party and the English Press in the politics of South Africa, it was a very essential week as well. Let me say that the members on this side, the people of South Africa and I are grateful that my colleagues, the Minister of Defence, the Minister of Labour, the Minister of Community Development, the Minister of Sport and Recreation and the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions spoke the way they did in this debate.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is very regrettable and a disgrace for the United Party and its people that after 12 years of being a Republic, it is still necessary to sneak like this in South Africa. The Prime Minister has indicated that he wholeheartedly agrees with what was said by my colleague the Minister of Defence. Let me say to the hon. members that the entire Cabinet and the entire caucus of the National Party are grateful that he spoke like that. Because we dare talk of Boer-haters in South Africa and because we dare talk of the injustice being done to the Afrikaans language, a cry is going up on the United Party side that we are prejudicing national unity. Mr. Speaker, for people in executive positions and those aspiring to take a seat in these benches to be so conversant with the Afrikaans language as to be able to serve others in it, is not merely a gesture of courtesy towards me as an Afrikaner; this is not only essential in public life, but also embodied in the legislation of the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>This Bill has now reached the final stage of its passage through both House of Parliament. We have opposed it from its first introduction in the Other Place and we intend to oppose it again at this stage. Nothing has transpired during its various stages through both these Houses to change the basic objections we have to this Bill and which I should like to reiterate again briefly for the sake of the record.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Public Works who is handling this Bill said in reply to the Second Reading debate in this House that he could not understand why the Opposition was opposing this legislation because it was supported by the City Council of Pretoria which is most affected by it. He in fact used quite strong language. He said the City Council has no objection. No one has objection, except for these two members, referring to the hon. member for Green Point and Pietermaritzburg City, and the United Party. He said they had better decide for themselves what they are objecting to; they do not even know what it is all about. Now, it is all very well for the hon. the Minister to use language of this sort. We are used to having this type of approach from him in this House but we are as capable of reading legislation and understanding its effects as he is or as any member on his side is.</p>

The council no doubt has very good reasons for supporting the legislation and I leave it at that. But I wish to emphasize that we on this side of the House regard this as an important principle which we cannot support because if it can be applied in respect of an area of the Pretoria City Council&#x2019;s jurisdiction, it can be applied in respect of the area of jurisdiction of any other local authority in the country.</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Thank you, Mr. Speaker; I will now carry out what I should have done previously. The hon. the Minister, in introducing this Bill in the Other Place, told the Other Place that this Bill did not remove any part of the powers of the Pretoria City Council. This is clearly nonsense. This is the whole object of this legislation. The whole object of it is to remove from the City Council the power to deal with the future development of this particular area within the jurisdiction of the Pretoria City Council. The hon. the Minister suggested in the Other Place&#x2014;and I think he made a similar suggestion during the Second Reading of this Bill in this House&#x2014;that because the Pretoria City Council would have the opportunity of stating its views to the Minister, the Pretoria City Council is not being by-passed. Now, Mr. Speaker, this is nonsense. The powers that are being given to the Minister, under this legislation enable him to deal with the future development of this part of Pretoria, irrespective of whether the Pretoria City Council agrees to does not agree with the proposals of the Minister. The only right that the Pretoria City Council retains is the right to express its views to the hon. the Minister, or rather, in terms of the amended clause 2 (4), to express its views firstly to the sub-committee, which will then advise the Minister as to what should be done. If the hon. the Minister decides to do something which the Pretoria City Council does not agree with, this legislation entitles the Minister to override their wishes. If that is not removing from the Pretoria City Council rights which they have at present, I don&#x2019;t know what the English language, or the Afrikaans, language, if you want to look at the Afrikaans version of this Bill, means.</p>

<p>We therefore, oppose this Bill, on the fundamental principle that we believe that in respect of a local authority area, the <span class="col_4981-4982" refersTo="page_0954"/>local authority should be responsible for the development of its area subject, as is the case at present, to the control of the Provincial Council concerned. We see no reason, Mr. Speaker, for derogating in this instance, especially as the hon. the Minister explained in his reply to the Second Reading debate that the future development plan for this area had already been approved. According to the hon. the Minister it had already been submitted by this committee that considered it to the Council, which approved it. If that is the case, then why is it that the Pretoria City Council cannot be left with the power to deal with the future of that area in accordance with the plan that has already been approved&#x003F; Why must the Minister poke his nose into this and take the power to deal with this matter himself&#x003F;</p>

<p>I want to point out that this goes very far. If any of the owners of buildings or property within this area wish to make any alterations&#x2014;demolish buildings, construct other buildings and so forth&#x2014;they will not, once this Bill is passed, submit their proposals to the City Council; although this is still within the local authority area of the Pretoria City Council, they must now submit their proposals direct to the Minister through the Secretary for Public Works. This surely is completely by-passing the Pretoria City Council. We therefore oppose this Bill on the basis of this principle. We oppose this legislation also on certain other grounds which are of less importance than this fundamental principle. They nevertheless are of some importance.</p>

<p>Firstly, the Bill makes no provision whatsoever for private owners of property within this area to express their views to the hon. the Minister. The only provision that there is for the Pretoria City Council to express views. There is no provision for the public of Pretoria to express their views. The hon. the Minister, in replying to that allegation during previous stages of this legislation, said that he could see no reason why the public should be interested if the Pretoria City Council deals with the matter. In all matters of town planning and the alteration of town planning schemes, the public has the right at present to express its views, even though the City Council.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>I will tell the hon. the Minister what prevents them from doing it. There is no provision in this legislation entitling them to do it. The hon. the Minister may accept it. That is true. If they wish to present their views he may accept them. But he may just as well say &#x201C;I am not required by this legislation to even consider representations from the public, and I will not do so&#x201D;. No right has been given to the public under this legislation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_public_works">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS</person>:</from>

<p>Exactly as the Administrator can do today, in the interests of the public.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>The Administrator need not listen to the public, but the public has the right to present their views to the Administrator. This is the important difference. When the Minister says that the Administrator does not need to listen to the public, he is quite wrong in one respect. If the Administrator&#x2019;s refusal to listen to a public objection is <i>mala fide,</i> the Administrator can be taken to court and his decision can be set aside. So it is not just a matter that the Administrator can simply brush aside representations from the public. He must give due consideration to them. If he is <i>mala fide</i> in his approach, his decision can be set aside. Unless a right is given to the public to express their views and to raise objections, the question of <i>mala fides</i> does not enter into it. The Minister can simply say &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t even want to hear what you have to say&#x201D;.</p>

<p>A further objection we have to this Bill is that there is no right of appeal to anybody whatsoever. The Minister has the final word, and he can go entirely against the wishes, for example, of the Pretoria City Council. The Pretoria City Council can do nothing about it. The citizens of Pretoria, likewise, have no right of appeal. The owners of property within the area have no right of appeal. The Minister&#x2019;s say is final.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Bill provides for no compensation. I would point out that this question of compensation may well become a very material one, because the Minister <span class="col_4983-4984" refersTo="page_0955"/>has the power to restrict any development of some properties if he considers that these particular properties are of historical or aesthetic importance to the square. He can say to the owners of these properties, &#x201C;You may not change their aspect in any way&#x201D;. In this way he can reduce the value of these properties. He can do so without paying any compensation whatever to these owners.</p>

<p>Finally, there is this strange provision where the existing servitudes in respect of this area are being wiped out under clause 5. Let us just consider what these servitudes are. There are two of them. They provide&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) That no buildings, statues or memorials of any nature are to be erected, and that no improvements to the properties are to be effected without the State President having given his approval and</li>

<li>(2) that a driveway 79 ft. wide around the square should be maintained for use by the public.</li>

</ol>

<p>Now. Sir, if one is concerned about the historical aspect of this square and its future development from that point of view, surely these are two valuable servitudes which should be retained. Why are they now being removed&#x003F; The hon. the Minister has given no satisfactory explanation whatsoever.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to tackle the hon. the Minister in regard to a further statement that he made. He made the statement that the proposed measures of control under this Bill do not curtail any existing rights which the private owners of the sites concerned have at present. The hon. the Minister is quite wrong. In justifying this statement he has referred to the existing town planning restrictions for the properties within this area and he seemed to imply that because these were not being changed under the Bill, the existing owners&#x2019; rights were not being curtailed. I would point out to the hon. the Minister that this Bill gives him <i>carte blanche</i> to change these by-laws if he wishes to do so. He may impose any restrictions that he chooses. As I pointed out a moment ago, he can go so far as to say that he will not give his consent to any change in respect of any particular buildings in that area. To suggest that existing rights of property owners in the area are not being affected by this Bill, is simply either indicating a lack of understanding of the extent of the provisions, or it seems to suggest that the hon. the Minister does not appreciate what the legislation that he is introducing is. I do not know which is correct, but perhaps the hon. the Minister will explain to us, in replying, how he can possibly justify the statement which he made that the existing rights of property owners cannot be affected in terms of this legislation. I would emphasize that it may well be that the hon. the Minister may decide not to change the height and bulk restrictions that he referred to when he made that statement. He may decide not to change them, and if he does, his contention that the rights would not be affected would be correct. But he has the power to make these changes and he can decide to do so if he wishes. If he does change the height and bulk provisions, he is changing the existing rights property owners have in regard to the development of these properties. But it goes further than that. Any owner of property in a local authority area has the right to apply for changes in the height and bulk restrictions of his property. He can put in an application to put up more storeys and to put up greater bulk on his land. If he puts up a case which is convincing, the local authority may accept it. If the local authority does not accept it, the owners have the right to appeal to the Provincial Administration, the Administrator in Executive Committee. But no such power exists under this Bill. The owners may well go to the Minister and say that they want to make those changes, but the Minister is entitled to refuse if he wishes to and to give no reasons whatsoever. That will then be the end of the matter. They will have no right of appeal to anyone. There are important reasons why we on this side of the House oppose this legislation, whether or not the Pretoria City Council, which is the local authority concerned, is prepared to approve of it. As I indicated at the commencement of my address, we are still very much opposed to this legislation and we will vote against it.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, apparently there are in this House only Cape men and Natalians on the United Party side, for up to now the Opposition has not asked one single member from the Transvaal to raise objections to this legislation. Actually, one finds it rather strange that the hon. member for Musgrave, who hails from the Province of Natal, is <span class="col_4985-4986" refersTo="page_0956"/>now so terribly concerned about the planning of Church Square. He made a great deal of reference to the fact that the Minister had allegedly said that they did not know much about it. I am afraid the hon. the Minister is correct; they do not know much about it. They know so little about it that when this very same legislation was dealt with in the Other Place, several Opposition speakers complained terribly and asked, &#x201C;Why is the hon. the Minister in such a hurry with this legislation&#x003F;&#x201D; At the time they wanted to suggest that there was something sinister behind the legislation and that the hon. the Minister had certain sinister motives; for what other reason would he be in such a terrible hurry&#x003F; But in the meantime weeks have passed; in the meantime there was a recess. After all, during that time Opposition members could have ascertained everything and could have invited people to raise objections, etc. I suppose that in the meantime they have also received telegrams and letters, in which they were told, &#x201C;Please, object to that legislation.&#x201D; Now they want to object to this legislation, whilst the City Council of Pretoria are quite content with it and whilst the City Council of Pretoria had a representative on the Church Square Committee, i.e. the Town Clerk of Pretoria. Not only the City Council, but also the Provincial Administration was represented on that committee. That committee prepared this legislation. Now hon. members opposite are boasting about their wanting to protect Pretoria&#x2019;s interests here.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister took certain powers, which does not constitute a departure from the powers of the Administrator. What is more, the City Council of Pretoria has to obtain the approval of the Administrator. Now, what is the difference&#x003F; Sir, I shall now tell you what the difference is. Instead of one body having to consult another, we now have three bodies and all three levels of government are involved. The City Council draws up the plans, the committee considers the plans, and representatives of the Provincial Council serve on the committee. Then it goes to the Minister, and the Minister, together with his department, acts in the first instance in a co-ordinating capacity, which improves the matter so much the more. But now they are talking about distrust. This is what I should like to know: Are there different voters voting for the City Council, the Provincial Council and for the House of Assembly&#x003F; What is really the difference&#x003F; The hon. the Minister acts in a co-ordinating capacity and takes certain powers because Church Square does not form part of Pretoria alone; it is not only a showpiece and the pride of Pretoria; it is also the show-window for the Republic of South Africa. Because it is the show-window of the Republic, and because many people from overseas come to Pretoria in order to have discussions and consultations with the Government there, it is essential that there should be good planning as far as Church Square is concerned. Now they say that the Minister has all of a sudden introduced a motion of no-confidence in the City Council of Pretoria, although they did have a share in that legislation. I invite the Opposition to tell us how many of them received objections from the public or from elsewhere. People wrote in the newspapers about this matter. Let the Opposition tell me now, &#x201C;Here we have a telegram.&#x201D; What the Opposition will perhaps show me, is one letter. That is all they will possibly be able to show me. They are bitterly disappointed because no complaints, etc., have been lodged and because those arguments of theirs have fallen away, arguments to the effect that the Minister is in too much of a hurry and that there is supposedly something sinister behind this legislation. Now they are bitterly disappointed. They cannot allow the Third Reading to be agreed to just like that, because they made too much of a fuss at the Second Reading.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, reference was also made to private enterprise, the private owners, who supposedly have no say. I want to ask whether those private owners would have had anything to say if the City Council had in any case done it on its own. Surely, if they would have had something to say in that case, then they may all the more have to say to the Government. The complaint is also being heard that these private owners will lose all their privileges, that they will receive no compensation, etc. Once again they are trying to steal a political march. I want to ask the Opposition whether they can furnish proof of one case where the State imposed certain restrictions or whatever on people and where those people suffered losses. The State has always looked after the interests of its people. When are they afforded more protection: under the City Council or under the hon. the Minister who keeps an eye on this matter&#x003F;</p>

<p>To us and especially to the Pretorians, to the Transyalers, to the Republic of South Africa and, I want to say, to us as Afrikaners, <span class="col_4987-4988" refersTo="page_0957"/>Church Square is of very great importance. In the first instance, we have on it the statue of a president of the old South African Republic. Church Square dates back to the days of the old Republic. Moreover, Church Square is surrounded by buildings which we should not like to be dwarfed or obscured, namely the Old Raadsaal, the Palace of Justice and others. To my mind it is only right that the interests and the planning of Church Square should be guarded jealously. After all, it stands to reason that one cannot simply allow uncontrolled and unrestrained planning to take place on and around Church Square. It stands to reason that there will have to be certain restrictions in order to preserve the balance and to ensure that starting from Church Square the planning will be done correctly.</p>

<p>I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister on this legislation, and I want to convey my sincere thanks to him for it. I believe that this measure, once this Bill has been enacted, will bear a great deal of fruit. Furthermore, I believe that the Minister and his department will act in a coordinating capacity, and I do not doubt for a single moment that they will turn a ready ear to people who may have objections in this regard, if there should ever be any, which I doubt.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there is little I can add to what was said by the hon. member for Hercules in reply to the hon. member for Musgrave. However, I just want to point out a few things. The hon. member for Musgrave blamed me for saying that they knew absolutely nothing about Church Square. I repeat it. He knows absolutely nothing about Church Square. He does not know about the plans for Church Square; he does not know what has been done on Church Square over the past few years, and he does not know about the new plans that have been drawn up. He has not seen them; he is not interested in them and, to tell the truth. I believe that he does not know that new plans have been drawn up for Church Square. What is strange in this matter, is that the city councillors of Pretoria, the Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns and all the people who saw the plans, are satisfied with them. The Foundation of Ex-Pretorians (Stigting van Oud-Pretoriane) is also satisfied with them. The only people who are not satisfied with them, are those who have never seen them and who know absolutely nothing about them. I repeat my question : Why is the hon. member for Musgrave so concerned about Church Square in Pretoria if the City Council of Pretoria is not concerned about it&#x003F; I want to put a very simple question to him.</p>

<p>That is the biggest lot of nonsense in the world. If this step could be taken under the Development Act, we would have done so, but the law advisers say that we cannot do so under that legislation. These plans were drawn up and a committee was appointed by the Cabinet to deal with Church Square. They drew up new plans for Church Square, and at the moment that committee is the advisers of the Minister for the future development of Church Square. I shall tell hon. members what I think happened here. The hon. members opposite were under the impression which they were given by the hon. Senator Getz. The impression he gave them, was that this step was causing a great deal of dissatisfaction in Pretoria. They thought that because a great deal of dissatisfaction was being caused in Pretoria, they would oppose the legislation here and could by those means make some political capital out of it. The hard facts of the matter are that it did not cause any dissatisfaction in Pretoria.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. M. STEPHENS</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to discuss the effect of this Bill on the South African law of majority in general. We welcome this Bill, as has been said before by this side of the House. We believe that it contains a real benefit and that it will benefit our youth in all respects. But I should like to consider the effect of this Bill, especially its effect on two aspects of the South African law of persons. We know that the old Roman rule of <i>venia aetatis</i> exists in this connection, and then there is the second aspect, i.e. that of tacit emancipation. Under the old law <i>venia aetatis</i> was granted to a minor by the sovereign power in the country concerned. The effect of that was majority, except for the fact that the minor could not automatically alienate or encumber immovable property at that stage, according to Grotius 1.10.3. In addition, however, he needed parental consent to enable him to marry. In this the Bill before us goes further than the old law. Now the minor becomes a major of full status and this, too, is an aspect we welcome particularly. Up to today the law of <i>venia aetatis</i> has been very uncertain in South Africa. The right apparently existed in the Orange Free State, but many arguments were conducted in legal circles whether <i>venia aetatis</i> could in fact be applied in the other provinces of South Africa. In any event, nowhere in South Africa was there any machinery by means of which it could be applied. This part of the law, too, is now being elucidated conclusively by this Bill. This gives one still further reason for gratitude. But then, as a matter of fact, we come to the second aspect, i.e. that of tacit emancipation.</p>

<p><span class="col_4993-4994" refersTo="page_0960"/>I believe we have a problem here to which we shall have to give attention. I should like to hear from the hon. the Minister what his viewpoint is as to the effect of this Bill on that aspect of South African law. In the first place I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether or not it is his intention to abrogate by means of this Bill the right to tacit emancipation. If this is in fact his intention, Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that this Bill, which does not put this aspect plainly, should possibly be referred by the Minister to his law advisers for further investigation. If it would appear necessary to do so, an amendment could be moved in the Senate in order to effect an improvement.</p>

<p>As I see the problem, tacit emancipation in fact has no provision relating to age. This Bill makes provision for it to be applicable to minors who have reached the age of 18 years. Tacit emancipation on the other hand has no age restriction. In other words, it applies not only to 18 year olds, but in fact to minors of any age. As regards the only condition attached hereto by law. I should like to read to you from the book by Hahlo and Ellison Khan, i.e. <i>The Union of South Africa&#x2014;Development of its Laws and Constitution,</i> as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">According to the Roman-Dutch authorities, a minor is tacitly emancipated if with the express or implied consent of his father he lives on his own and carries on some trade or business on his own account.</block>

<p>There are further ramifications, but I do not want to go into them now. This, however, is the basis on which tacit emancipation is based. There are two possible effects which this Bill may have on the legal aspect. It may be that the Bill abrogates tacit emancipation for minors who have attained the age of 18 years or older, whereas tacit emancipation may still take place and may still be applicable to minors under the age of 18 years. Or, in the second place, the two systems of <i>venia aetatis</i> and tacit emancipation may continue to exist side by side. In other words, a person of 18 years or more may still be emancipated by means of tacit emancipation as well. I want to suggest that if this is going to be the effect of this, we have to investigate the matter further, because I believe that it may possibly be undesirable.</p>

<p>There are various problems as regards tacit emancipation. In the past this has led to many lawsuits. In the first instance, there may be various degrees of tacit emancipation. In addition there may be emancipation for certain purposes only. It all depends on the circumstances of a particular case. Consequently this causes many uncertainties in law, especially in commercial law and law of contracts. I should like to read to you from the same book I have just quoted, on page 366, in order to illustrate to you one of the problems which may arise. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whether an emancipated minor can be granted <i>restitutio in integrum</i> in respect of a transaction which causes him serious prejudice, is a controversial question. There seems to be no direct authority on the point, but there is some authority in support of the proposition that an emancipated minor is in the position of one who is his own guardian, and if this be so, it would seem to follow logically that <i>restitutio</i> must be available to him.</block>

<p>In other words, if a person is tacitly emancipated, and the contract is not completely to his advantage, it is still possible that he may obtain <i>restitutio,</i> in other words, the contract may be declared invalid and the other party has to surrender what he has obtained from the contract, and similarly the minor. Since we have this Bill and therewith a very just and easy method of emancipation, it would be undesirable to allow this fluid and obscure position to continue to exist.</p>

<p>A further obscurity is the real effect of tacit emancipation. To date there are various conflcting judgments in South African law in this regard. It is precisely here where the degree of emancipation and the facts of the circumstances enter the picture. This Bill does not seem to clarify this matter. I think one would like to see people using this procedure instead. It is just, final and certain. One would like to see clarity being introduced, also as regards this aspect of the law. I should like to have an explanation from the hon. the Minister in this regard.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the first place I should like to thank the hon. member very sincerely for having indicated on behalf of the Opposition that they support the principle of this Bill. I think the two important aspects of the matter are, firstly, the question of perpetuating the present position, in other <span class="col_4995-4996" refersTo="page_0961"/>words, reproclaiming what existed prior to Union. This is the first principle of the matter and, secondly, to make <i>venia aetatis</i> possible by leaving it in the hands of our courts. This is the second important principle. Now, however, the hon. member has dragged in another matter and that is the question of tacit emancipation. I did not know the hon. member was going to do so, but my information is that it has nothing whatsoever to do with and cannot be directly affected by any of the clauses of the Bill under discussion, and that the Bill may simply remain as it is at the moment. In other words, tacit emancipation will not be affected by the question of the right of the citizen to apply to a court to obtain his majority at the age of 18 years. This, in brief, is what I can tell the hon. member.</p>

<p>I have already discussed the matter with a law adviser and it is something we can look into. And I shall do so too. I promise the hon. member that I shall do so prior to the next sitting of the Senate, but our present impression is that the two matters are completely detached from each other and need not affect each other. Consequently this is all I can tell the hon. member.</p>

<heading>COLOURED PERSONS IN SOUTHWEST AFRICA EDUCATION BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading resumed)</summary>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Second Reading speech on this long and very complex Bill was made, we consider, with unseemly haste as hon. members may remember, on the afternoon of March 30th, a few minutes before the House adjourned for the Easter recess. One received the impression that afternoon, while listening to the hon. the Minister, that the full text of his speech was considerably curtailed because of the dispute over the adjournment which took place between the parties that afternoon. The more is the pity, for educational matters of this complexity should not be dealt with, we consider, in a hurry, whatever the circumstances.</p>

<p>In the course of his opening remarks, the hon. the Minister made the following statement (Hansard, Col. 4469<b>): &#x2014;</b></p>

<p>In order to meet the educational needs of the aforesaid population groups, each according to his own needs and with a view to the cultural-anthropological features of each ethnic group, it is now my intention to introduce separate Bills, of which this is the first, one for each population group.</p>

<p>A little later, he went on and said :</p>

<block name="quote">Experience has shown that the education of an ethnic group only comes into its own when it develops within the framework of a distinctive educational system.</block>

<p>The suggestion of &#x201C;cultural-anthropological&#x201D; groups and features and the use of the term &#x201C;ethnic groups&#x201D; reveal of course that in this case the Government is steering clear of its normal description of &#x201C;multi-national&#x201D; groups, which in the context of South-West Africa, has particular significance. There may be diplomatic reasons for this curious terminology; but I must say that it must have required some mental agility on the part of the person who drafted the Bill to think out the term &#x201C;cultural-anthropological&#x201D;. If the hon. the Minister can tell me precisely what that means, I will be very glad indeed.</p>

<p>Here at the start I want to ask the hon. the Minister a straight question: Has he himself consulted with the people concerned over this proposed new dispensation for education now being instituted for these three Coloured groups in South-West Africa&#x003F; Then their is another question : Have the Coloured Representative Council and the Legislative Assembly in South-West Africa asked for this measure&#x003F; I think it is very important that we in this House, and the public generally, should know the answer to that question. I must say I doubt very much, knowing the territory a little myself because of having lived there, whether the Rehoboth Basters&#x2019; Council wants this kind of interference by the central Government. What are their views&#x003F; Perhaps the hon. the Minister will tell us. What options if any, were these &#x201C;cultural anthropological&#x201D; groups given in the first place in regard to this matter&#x003F;</p>

<p>There is another aspect to this Bill and this legislation generally, and that is the question of international concern. The hon. the Minister knows very well that the South-West African position is a matter of great international concern. Surely, at this <span class="col_4997-4998" refersTo="page_0962"/>stage, it is extremely unwise for the Government to impose any legislation upon the people there unless they specifically ask for it. I do not have to remind the hon. the Minister that after Dr. Waldheim&#x2019;s recent visit to the territory it was made perfectly clear, both by him and by the Prime Minister himself, that no conflict existed between the United Nations and the South African Government over the ultimate granting of independence to the people of South-West Africa. In fact, Dr. Hilgard Muller said as much himself when addressing the Ovambo people in the territory on March 28th, a few days after the Secretary of the United Nations had left. I want to read to the hon. the Minister what the Minister of Foreign Affairs told the Ovambo people, with special reference to all the other peoples in the territory. I quote from his speech which was handed out by the Division of Information. This is what the hon. the Minister told the Ovambos&#x2014;he said it applied to everybody else: &#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For the Government of the Republic of South Africa is there to assist you on the road that lies ahead. The Government has said it before and I repeat it today: It is also our object to lead and support the people of Ovambo in the attainment of full self-determination and independence in accordance with your wishes. And I hope and trust that you will thus also welcome close co-operation with us.</block>

<p>Then he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For instance, it could happen that some of these people may wish to unite in one or other economic union&#x2014; something which takes place today in many parts of the world. I need only, as an example, refer to the European Economic Union &#x2026;</block>

<p>Then he said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It may also happen that they, or some of them &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is the population groups in South West&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; may desire to go still further and conclude some or other political alliance with each other. That is the prerogative of independent people. On the other hand, they may perhaps desire to remain politically apart. That, too, will be possible. But I wish to emphasize today that the decision will rest with each and every one of them. After the attainment of independence each one decides for itself regarding its future.</block>

<p>For that reason neither the Government of the Republic of South Africa, nor the United Nations nor any other country in the world, can decide in this regard. After that categorical statement by the Minister of Foreign Affairs in regard to the future independence of these population groups, I would like to ask the hon. the Minister on what grounds this degree of independence should not apply equally in the field of education. Why should the Government at this stage wish to centralize control of education in this way by means of a very elaborate Bill&#x003F; Control will be exercised from Pretoria. Unless the Government&#x2019;s promises in regard to independence are meaningless, these complex proposals which are under discussion today will sooner or later have to be undone. Financial assistance from South Africa to South-West Africa for educational purposes can be fully reconciled with our development plans for the Territory and with the line we have always taken towards these people. But I submit that sooner or later all this machinery will have to be undone in terms of the speech made by the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs. This arrangement can only lead to increased inefficiency and not to greater efficiency.</p>

<p>Surely the local parents who know the local conditions and the experience of the Director of Education in Windhoek and his staff are the people who should have final jurisdiction over these matters and not a Minister sitting thousands of miles away in Pretoria, even if he has powers to delegate his authority. In terms of Government policy, namely ultimate independence for these areas, the whole administrative egg which we are now busy laying here will sooner or later have to be unscrambled. It is absolutely ridiculous. It will lead to an interim duplication of educational power in the Republic and in South-West Africa and greatly increase public expenditure all round, which is not going to benefit the taxpayers of the Republic nor the taxpayers of South-West Africa. We now have the ridiculous situation that we have before us three large and complicated Bills to deal with a number of pupils&#x2014;the Minister himself gave <span class="col_4999-5000" refersTo="page_0963"/>these figures during his Second Reading speech&#x2014;just over 20 000 in 1971. We have three big Bills laying down all sorts of regulations and controls from Pretoria for 20 000 odd people who have been broken up into three different groups for the purpose. The whole thing is ridiculous.</p>

<p>If the hon. the Minister will refer for a moment to clause 25 he will agree that this is a new provision. I say &#x201C;new&#x201D; because as the hon. the Minister said in his Second Reading speech all three Bills are based in the first place, on the 1963 Act dealing with education for Coloured people in the Republic. Clause 25 deals with the holding of office in certain public and statutory bodies, which nobody can do without the Minister&#x2019;s consent. Clause 25 (4) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If any person referred to in section 21 (1)&#x2026;</block>

<p>That means, anybody other than an officer, and an officer is someone who is under the control of the Public Service Act. In other words, this refers specifically to teachers. I will read the subsection again&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If any person referred to in section 21 (1) seeks election as a Member of Parliament, a provincial council, the Legislative Assembly of the Territory, or the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council of the Republic of South Africa, he shall be deemed to have resigned from the service of the department with effect from the date upon which, in accordance with the provisions of the Electoral Consolidation Act, 1946 (Act No. 46 of 1946) &#x2026;</block>

<p>It goes on to say that such a person could apply for membership of the Coloured Representative Council in South Africa. No specific mention is made in this clause of the existing Coloured Representative Council in South-West Africa. We all know that it is a purely nominated body and we also know that the Government has been promising for years that the people there will have the right to elect this body. But the Government has been avoiding this issue and we would be very interested to know why. Of course the real answer to this is quite apparent; the South-West African Council is not mentioned in this subsection because scarcely anyone but the teachers in South-West Africa, are, in fact, competent to make adequate contributions to a Coloured Representative Council. Where this clause talks about these people standing for Legislative Assemblies and Parliament, what has the Government in mind&#x003F;</p>

<p>As I understand, from people who know the territory well, 99 per cent of the teachers in South-West Africa are Coloured people and they will be covered by this Bill. So presumably this clause refers specifically to Coloured people. Since when was a Coloured person in South-West Africa, or anywhere else, in terms of Government policy, entitled to stand for the Legislative Assembly of South-West Africa, for Parliament or for the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council in the Republic&#x003F; White employees who may be involved in terms of this clause are already covered by other legislation such as our National Education Act, as the hon. the Minister well knows. I imagine he is here specifically referring to Coloured teachers. The thing just does not make sense.</p>

<p>I also want to refer to a specific matter in regard to clause 15. This is also an entirely new provision, if one compares it with the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Education Act of 1963. It deals with the requirements for appointment. These requirements are dealt with at some length. What is quite fantastic to me&#x2014;I do not understand it at all and I hope the hon. the Minister will give us some clarity&#x2014;is that it is stated that &#x201C;subject to the provisions of section 10 every (permanent appointment to a post included in the establishment of a State school or a State-aided school shall be on probation &#x2026;&#x201D; What does that mean&#x003F; I mean, this is a contradiction in terms. It is an unheard of stipulation in any legislation dealing with education anywhere as far as I know. The whole thing seems to me suspicious concerning the status and standing and activities of teachers in South-West Africa.</p>

<p>Paragraph (b) of clause 15 (1) states that the person concerned must be of good character, but surely no one is appointed to a post as a teacher in an establishment unless he is of good character&#x003F; This is not stipulated in the 1963 Act for the Republic. Why is it necessary to insert it here&#x003F; Paragraph (e) of the same subsection states that such a person must be a South African citizen. What does that mean&#x003F; To expect Republican teachers to be South African citizens is one thing, but for a territory with an international status surely <span class="col_5001-5002" refersTo="page_0964"/>this provision is both unnecessary and unwise.</p>

<p>Another point is that in terms of the definitions no mention is made anywhere of &#x201C;agricultural schools&#x201D;. They are specifically omitted in comparison with the 1963 Act for the education of Coloured persons in the Republic. I should like to know why agricultural schools were omitted. It is specifically mentioned in the other Act and South-West Africa surely is a territory where agricultural instruction is perhaps more necessary than in any other territory, particularly in the &#x201C;Rehoboth Gebiet&#x201D;, where the hon. the Minister must know, a large experimental farm was established by the South-West African educational authorities for this very purpose some time ago. I find it a very serious omission that no mention is made of agricultural schools in dealing with this matter administratively. I should like the hon. the Minister to tell me why they have been omitted.</p>

<p>In his Second Reading speech, the hon. the Minister referred specifically to staff associations. He said that the Department had already recognized the body known as the Coloured Persons Education Association in South-West Africa and that this recognition is now to be made statutory. There is no provision in the Bill for making this body a statutory body. It was merely mentioned by the Minister in his speech. He obviously has powers of his own and he can presumably do this by regulation. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am of the opinion that this method of recognition &#x2026;</block>

<p>Statutory recognition&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; will ensure the continuation of fruitful negotiations between my department and the aforesaid association.</block>

<p>This is a very strange and unheard of precedent. What it really means, in hard fact, is that the teachers&#x2019; association which will receive this statutory recognition will now virtually come under Government control. Why should this be necessary&#x003F; It does not apply to teachers anywhere else that I know of, and certainly not to teachers in the Republic, either Coloured or White. Why should these people suddenly be given statutory recognition&#x003F; It sounds fine, but in effect it simply means that the Minister will exercise control over this association, its objects and also, I imagine, its activities, because he does not specify but merely says that he thinks it will help negotiations between them and his department. I think that this is a very unhappy note to strike in relation to the Territory as a whole, particularly as it is the focus of international interest and attention at this time.</p>

<p>There are just a few more points that I want to make. The main text of this Bill is almost identical with that of Act No. 47 of 1963. The same applies to the Bill we have for the Namas and the Rehoboth-Basters. However, there are certain obvious omissions and I want to mention these. The definition of a Coloured or a Nama or a Baster carries no reference to the Population Registration Act. We know that it is not applicable in South-West Africa, but the interesting thing is that anyone is a member of any of the three groups provided he is &#x201C;generally accepted&#x201D; as a member of that population group. When the hon. the Minister says &#x201C;generally accepted&#x201D;, does he mean this definition of acceptability to be &#x201C;cultural-anthropological&#x201D;, or what is it&#x003F; This is a strange, a kind of woolly, messy definition. Perhaps the hon. the Minister will make the position clear.</p>

<p>The Bill only mentions State schools or State-aided schools, training schools and training colleges, with an occasional reference to vocational and special education if they are needed. Then it refers to education for deviate children. We do not like the use of the word &#x201C;deviate&#x201D;. It carries an unpleasant implication. Somebody who is a deviate is, for all intents and purposes, a delinquent of some kind. If that is what the hon. the Minister means, then he must say so, but I would have thought that &#x201C;retarded&#x201D; was a better expression to use. There is no provision in terms of this Bill for an education council for the three groups, although the Minister did say that provision was also being made for the establishment of some kind of regional educational council. In broad outline, the functions of such a council are to be the same as those of a school board. If the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Education Association, referred to by the Minister under the heading &#x201C;staff associations&#x201D;, is to be given statutory recognition, which means that they are presumably people who are qualified and suited to serve on this educational association, why is there no provision for <span class="col_5003-5004" refersTo="page_0965"/>an education council straight away for these people, as is provided for the Coloured people in the Republic&#x003F;</p>

<p>The 1963 Act also lays down that until the Minister decides otherwise, the Department of Education, Arts and Science, that is to say the Department of National Education, shall institute all courses and lay down standards for examinations in all educational institutions. In other words, the standards here remain the same for Whites and Coloureds. The hon. the Minister went to great pains in the course of his speech to say that the whole idea was to keep standards as high as possible. We accept that he meant what he said. But in terms of the present Bill, it is not the Minister of Education, Arts and Science who lays down the standards, but the Minister of Coloured Affairs, who may institute new courses and examinations to be conducted and diplomas or certificates to be issued to persons passing such examinations as he has decided on&#x2014;he and not the Minister of Education, Arts and Science. The Minister of Coloured Affairs can also abolish any course so instituted. This suggests to us that whatever the Minister may say to the contrary, general educational standards will not or need not follow the pattern laid down for Whites and Coloureds in the Republic. My submission is that they will probably be lower.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister did say in his Second Reading speech that the Matriculation Board will set examination standards. That the Matriculation Board should set standards for that level of schooling is entirely understandable and commendable. But in spite of the Minister&#x2019;s protests that there is an adequate inspectorate who will look after the whole business and will oversee the question of standards, I should like to ask him whether he really thinks he has a sufficiently adequate inspectorate to uplift the academic or educational standards of these schools to the level that they should be raised to in terms of the 1963 Act for Coloured people here in the Republic. I have my doubts about this question of standards, I am afraid, and I should like to have some explanation from the hon. the Minister as to what his real intentions are.</p>

<p>The Minister&#x2019;s reassurances about the maintenance of standards, line up with the provisions of clause 15, which deals with the requirements for appointment. Clause 15 is an entirely new clause and it embodies some very strange provisions. Subclause (2) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1) (a) or (1) (d) the Minister may approve that any person other than an officer or employee&#x2014;</block>

<p>Therefore, it refers specifically to the teacher&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) who does not possess the qualifications determined by the Minister, but possesses other qualifications which, in the opinion of the Minister, will enable such person to render satisfactory service, be appointed in a permanent capacity.</li>

</ol>

<p>What are the other qualifications, other than the normal qualifications, that the hon. the Minister has in mind&#x003F; He made no statement on that in the course of his address. He could have said that there are not sufficient teachers who are up to standard and that they are trying to improve this but the hon. the Minister gave us no indication as to what these other qualifications, other than the normal qualifications, are likely to be. I think we are correct in our suggestion that it means that the standard will be considerably lower. I suggested this earlier.</p>

<p>Then there are some innovations apart from the omissions. Clause 9 on page 9 deals with the classification of certain posts as posts in the Public Service. That is administrative, and we have no objection to it. But in terms of clause 10, all appointments, promotions, transfers and discharges of all teaching staff are vested in the Minister. This is a new provision. It does not appear in the 1963 Act for the Coloured people in the Republic. What are the reasons for this provision&#x003F; Surely the South West African Education Department could be entrusted with this responsibility. After all, they have been considered competent in <span class="col_5005-5006" refersTo="page_0966"/>the past. They are familiar with local conditions; they are familiar with the background and the qualifications of personnel, and we consider that these decisions should be left to them as they are in fact left to the provincial administrations here in the Republic.</p>

<p>Clause 18 (2) refers to moneys received by any teacher who has employment outside his teaching job, or who receives money from any other source. He has to pay that money into a common fund. Well, this is also an innovation, and a strange one. One can understand that there should be some regulation preventing him from taking employment over and above his teaching job, because it might affect his ability and dedication as a teacher. Supposing, however, that he inherits money or has fixed property which he lets to someone, from which he receives rent or that he has a similar complementary income; is he in terms of this clause prohibited from retaining his income from sources such as these&#x003F;</p>

<p>Clause 20 on page 17 of the Bill is really one of the most extraordinary clauses I have ever come across. It is also an innovation. It deals with &#x201C;promotion of persons employed at State schools and State-aided schools&#x201D;. Promotion is to be on probation only for all grades of teachers. Have you ever heard of such a thing anywhere in the world! It does not say whether this promotion on probation applies only to junior teachers. It could apply to a vice-principal or a senior member of staff as well. There are no specifications in this regard. The period of probation, too, is not specified. What does the hon. the Minister expect these teachers to be&#x2014;a lot of stooges or what&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>&#x201C;Stooges&#x201D; or what&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>Well, stooges. This is a most extraordinary situation. The definition of &#x201C;officer&#x201D; and &#x201C;employee&#x201D;, who are defined by the Public Service Act, are specifically omitted. Therefore this applies to the teaching staff. It seems to me that the teachers can have no security of tenure under these circumstances. If teachers of every single grade are only promoted on probation, what sort of dedication, loyalty and stability are you going to have in the educational system under those provisions&#x003F;</p>

<p>Then, clause 22 on page 19 deals with the definitions of misconduct. Paragraph (f) differs slightly from the 1963 Act, but we object very strongly to the new paragraph (r) and (s). I want to refer to these for a moment. The new paragraph (r) says that a teacher can be charged with misconduct if&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">he performs an act likely to encourage feelings of hostility among the different population groups of the territory.</block>

<p>I think it is unheard of that a provision of this kind should be written into a statute providing for education. I would like to say to the hon. the Minister that we on this side of the House take the view that there are enough laws on the Statute Book governing subversive activities or the creation of ill feeling between population groups. The Ministers of Justice and Police have every means at their disposal for dealing with this. Why should this have anything to do with the Minister of Education, particularly in terms of misconduct of teachers&#x003F; Is this going to mean that there will be periodical witch-hunts in the department to find out whether they are encouraging feelings of hostility amongst each other, or what is it all about&#x003F; I think that it is a disgrace and that it should never have appeared in a Bill on education at all.</p>

<p>Paragraph (s) says that any person can be accused of misconduct if&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">he does or causes or permits to be done or connives at anything which is prejudicial to the administration, discipline or efficiency of any department, office or institution of the State or a State-aided school.</block>

<p>What does the hon. the Minister mean by &#x201C;any department&#x201D;&#x003F; Suppose a teacher, in his spare time, does a bit of farming and has a quarrel with the Department of Agriculture; is he then going to be charged with misconduct in terms of this Bill, or what is meant by &#x201C;any department&#x201D;&#x003F; This is the most extraordinary terminology and we cannot understand it at all. Before my <span class="col_5007-5008" refersTo="page_0967"/>time expires I should like to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House declines to pass the Second Reading of the <i>Coloured Persons in South-West Africa Education Bill</i> because the territory concerned will be deprived of the supervision and control of its own educational affairs&#x201D;.</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should just like to make a few comments on this Bill. Until now there has been a consolidated ordinance in South-West Africa, Ordinance No. 27 of 1962, which leaves the general control over education for Whites and for Coloureds&#x2014;i.e. for all non-Bantu&#x2014;in the Territory, in the hands of the Administrator, and through him in the hands of the South-West Africa Department of Education. The Legislative Assembly in Windhoek had the power to determine &#x201C;the general education policy&#x201D;, which was to be followed for the Whites and the Coloureds. It is interesting enough to note that in the preamble to the Ordinance it is provided that the education policy for these two groups should be planned in such a way that &#x201C;a spirit of national unity should be cultivated and racial co-operation should be furthered in the Territory&#x201D;. A special chapter in the Ordinance, as the hon. the Minister will know, Chapter 9, dealt with education for the Coloureds in the Territory. What is happening now is that the hon. the Minister is repealing the entire Chapter 9 and is putting in its place a Bill which effects radical changes. In the first place this Bill removes all control over education from local hands, in other words, it is being taken out of the hands of the people who are on the scene and who have first-hand knowledge of the circumstances of South-West Africa. It is now being placed in the hands of someone in Pretoria. In other words, it is being placed in the hands of the Minister of Coloured Affairs. That, in itself, is not the main point of criticism, but where I do in fact find grounds for criticism is in the fact that provisions and restrictions which are applicable in the Republic to Coloured education and Coloured teachers are being made applicable, almost word for word, to the Coloureds of South-West Africa. In this way certain circumstances are being created, circumstances which in my opinion can do no good under the present difficult international position in respect of South-West Africa. I want to mention an example to hon. members. If the Coloured teachers in the Republic, for whatever reasons, cannot receive pay equal to that of the Whites for equal services and qualifications, because the money is not there owing to the large numbers of teachers, it means that the Coloured teachers in South-West Africa cannot receive this either, since the hon. the Minister would not be able to make a distinction there. He will not be able to do it, however necessary it may be, for international reasons, for a special arrangement to be made in respect of the limited number of Coloured teachers, for example. It will not be possible to do this, if this uniformity is applied. There are today only about 14 000 Coloureds in South-West Africa. The Odendaal Report put the number at 12 708. If my information is correct, then we have almost 20 000 Coloured teachers in the Republic. In South-West Africa&#x2014;the hon. the Minister was so kind as to let me have the figures for 1972&#x2014; there are only 8 397 pupils and only 277 Coloured teachers. Actually, there are 119 more Coloured teachers who are teaching the Namas and the Basters, but the hon. the Minister will concede that there can be no question, as far as this little group is concerned, of ultimate entirely independent control, on the lines that each group can take care of itself. Sir, owing to the growing problem which is confronting us in regard to South-West Africa, an obligation is going to rest on us to eliminate as many discriminatory practices as possible in that Territory. Last year already members of the Cabinet made a start with legislation to eliminate discriminatory practices there dealing with colour and race, and this is going to become progressively more necessary in the case of South-West Africa. Therefore I think that the entire step of equalizing matters at this difficult international stage and making the conditions of the Coloured teachers equal to those of the Coloured teachers in the Republic is not a sensible step. I am not saying that the position of Coloured teachers in the Republic should not also be improved; this will also have to be improved, but if one links the two together, then it means that it is going to be difficult for the Government to adopt any measures which may be necessary for <span class="col_5009-5010" refersTo="page_0968"/>the small group in South-West Africa, if it cannot do the same here as well. That is why it seems to me highly undesirable to come forward now, at this stage, with a Bill of this nature.</p>

<p>The second point I want to make is that the Bill which we now have before us provides that a teacher for a Coloured school in South-West Africa must be a South African citizen. I concede that, generally speaking, it will most certainly be better, or the best thing, that a man who is a South African citizen should be appointed as teacher in South-West Africa, because one may virtually accept that he will have a knowledge of the two official languages. Sir, until now there has been nothing of this nature in the existing ordinance, and there are certain traditions in South-West Africa which make the situation rather different. With the churches and the missionary societies there was a very tolerant relationship in regard to education. Not all parts of South-West Africa are attractive: it is not always easy to find teachers for South-West Africa, and particularly in the case of Coloured teachers it is more difficult than in the case of Whites to find teachers for undeveloped and unattractive places. Under these difficult circumstances the churches and the missionary societies did excellent work and played a major constructive role in the old days. In this important task we were frequently assisted by people who are not citizens of South Africa, but who nevertheless acquired a knowledge of the two languages very quickly. It is remarkable how quickly some of the teachers who were imported to South-West Africa acquired a knowledge of the two languages and became proficient in English and Afrikaans. The same applies in the White schools. At the German schools in South-West Africa a major importation, if I may call it that, of German teachers from Germany takes place; the schools would not otherwise be able to exist, and those people are not citizens of South Africa. I say again that it would of course be better, as a general rule, if one could find a citizen of South Africa, but, unlike the case of the Whites, to go and stipulate this now as an obligation for the Coloureds&#x2014;while there is already a shortage of Coloured teachers &#x2014;that they should be South African citizens, otherwise they cannot be appointed, is not, I think in the best interests of the Coloureds; it is not in the best interests of South-West Africa and of Coloured education in the Territory, and in any case it creates a new discrimination which is in itself undesirable. The Coloureds are in any case a group which has to deal with the problem of a greater shortage of teachers than in the case of the Whites.</p>

<p>A further objection which we have to the Bill is that the Bill places all kinds of restrictions on Coloured teachers which are not contained in the existing ordinance. The hon. member for Wynberg has already referred to a few of these. She referred to clause 18, where the teacher is now prohibited from accepting extra work. Sir, we already have the situation that the Coloured teacher is remunerated at a lower rate than the White teacher. So if there is a teacher who should in fact take something which comes to hand to improve his position, since that gap does exist, he is prohibited from doing so. The Coloured teacher is now being placed in the especially difficult position that he cannot perform additional work in order to earn something extra; and very often in a community which has not yet achieved the same situation as the Whites, it is always the teacher who has to knuckle down to his additional task and help to uplift this population group. This is particularly the case in the smaller communities in South-West Africa; there the teacher is frequently obliged to play a more general role than in the larger communities. I do not think that this is a fair provision, and this is another reason why we are opposed to the Bill.</p>

<p>Another question I want to mention is the discrimination which is also being created now between White and Coloured teachers in the sphere of behaviour. Clause 22 (e) of this Bill provides, in the case of a Coloured teacher, that he may not, otherwise than at a meeting convened by an association recognized by the Minister under section 26&#x2014;that is, a teachers&#x2019; association&#x2014;publicly criticize the administration of any department, office or institution of the State. One would think that it would be fair to refer instead here to a department of education. For this means that a Coloured teacher, for example, if he feels aggrieved as a person at a specific apartheid measure, may not air his criticism because he would then in that way be criticizing an office, an institution or a department of the Government. I think that in the circumstances pertaining in South-West Africa, where we know that every Bill is closely scrutinized, it is highly undesirable, <span class="col_5011-5012" refersTo="page_0969"/>and probably unfair as well to introduce such a provision. Take for example section 22 (r) which provides that a Coloured teacher may not perform an act &#x201C;likely to encourage feelings of hostility among the different population groups of the territory&#x201D;.</p>

Section 40 of the same ordinance provides that subject to the provisions of this section, a White teacher &#x201C;may become a member of any political party, including any management body thereof, and he may make himself available for election as a member of Parliament cf the Republic or of the Legislative Assembly &#x2026;&#x201D;. In other words, a White teacher is free to enter politics; he may even stand for Parliament and the Legislative Assembly, and in his political activities it is more than likely that he may encourage feelings of hostility among people, and he is free to do so. But the poor Coloured teacher is being placed in the position here that he cannot really put forward a plea for the improvement of his lot as a Coloured without being charged with having performed an act which is likely to encourage feelings of hostility among the different population groups. I think that this Bill goes in a completely different direction as far as the Coloured teacher, as opposed to the White teacher, is concerned, with the strictest measures being applicable to the Coloured teacher compared to those which are applicable to the White teacher. This is looking for trouble, particularly since we know that when we are dealing with South-West Africa affairs in the outside world, every piece of legislation is studied and closely scrutinized and the situation between Whites and Coloureds is thoroughly examined. I think that this approach is unrealistic in the light of the future of South-West Africa. I think that in the interests of us all the Government will have to cease weakening local control in South-West Africa and seeking uniformity with everything (in the Republic. Why&#x003F; It serves no purpose. It would be much better to strengthen, expand and keep local control detached from the situation in the Republic. But this is not what is being done here now. There are other objections to this Bill as well, which may perhaps be dealt with best during the Committee Stage, but I want to say that in general it is not sensible to apply such a Bill as this, which applies to situations in the Republic, there and create an entire series of new differentiations and discriminations between the White teacher and the Coloured teacher. That is why we oppose this Bill, and support the amendment.</p>

<p>One finds it regrettable that the two hon. members opposite, who spoke about the Bill, gave the appearance that there was again discrimination between the population groups of South-West Africa. I agree with the hon. member for Wynberg about one thing she said, i.e. that she knows nothing about South-West Africa. There I agree with her. After her conduct here, I think I can perhaps say that we shall not miss her there either. After her conduct here, I think I can perhaps say that we shall not miss her there either. Many questions were asked here to which I think the Minister will reply, but a number of the answers are, as far as I know, embodied in one answer. In the early sixties the South African Government appointed a long-term commission about South-West Africa, i.e. the Odendaal Commission, and these are some of its recommendations which were accepted by the Government. The report of the Odendaal Commission was accepted by the Government and also by the Legislative Assembly of South-West Africa in all its aspects. A White Paper was issued on that aspect, and these actions of the Minister are not in contradiction of those decisions that were taken and approved.</p>

<p>Yes, that is so, but why accept a long-term report, a brilliant report such as the Odendaal Commission&#x2019;s <span class="col_5013-5014" refersTo="page_0970"/>report, and then not implement it&#x003F; For what reason&#x003F; We of South-West Africa at least have enough confidence in the Government of South Africa to know that there will be no discrimination and that these people&#x2019;s interests are safe, as are those of the people in the Republic, and that their educational interests will also be safe in the hands of this Government under this Minister. It is a fact that Bantu education has also passed into the hands of the Minister of Bantu Administration. He handles it, and I can see no earthly reason why this education must continue to fall under the South-West Africa Administration. I just want to say again that this was agreed on; it was recommended by a commission and approved by the House of Assembly and also by the Legislative Assembly, and I think already it is the answer to many of the questions.</p>

<p>As an old inhabitant of South-West I do not think I can pass up this opportunity of paying tribute to the South-West Administration for the pioneer work they did there over very many years and under very difficult circumstances. They did good pioneer work on a large scale and under difficult circumstances, for which I think they deserve full mention. There are even a few names one should perhaps mention in this connection, people like Dr. Vettder, a person who, in his day, was in the Senate, specifically because of his knowledge of these people, a person who did brilliant pioneer work. There is Dr. Fry, who was also in the Senate, and who did brilliant work. If one goes further into history one sees how much progress has been made since 1921. Then only 8 per cent of the Coloured and Baster children were at school. In 1960 80 per cent of them were at school and in 1972, 90 per cent. The figures in respect of the other indigenous groups, which do not have a bearing on this legislation, have likewise increased. Therefore I think it is no more than right that we should appreciatively express our thanks to the South-West Administration. We on this side of the House have the utmost confidence in the Department of Coloured Affairs and the Minister of that department, in the knowledge that these people&#x2019;s interests will be safe, as they were in the past. I do not want to go into the particulars of the legislation. We agree wholeheartedly that the education of those groups of people should be transferred to the Minister of Coloured Affairs and we support the legislation.</p>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>I wonder whether hon. members opposite sometimes ask themselves why we deal with certain legislation in this House. In this instance it is very clear to me that we are only giving effect on paper to the policy of the Government; in other words, we are here engaged in what I think is, in reality, paper apartheid, because it is virtually being done only so that the consciences of the other side may be assuaged. Dealing as we are with a Bill on education for Coloured persons, and knowing that legislation is to follow, dealing with the education of the Basters in the Rehoboth area, as well as that of the Nama in South-West Africa, we realize that here we are dealing with nothing more than paper apartheid. I could still understand the object of this if the argument was based on the fact that we are dealing here with full-fledged peoples. I do not believe that this legislation for the Coloured persons is in any way a Magna Charta for the education which the Coloured persons of South-West Africa are seeking. I want to say frankly that I believe that everything that can be achieved in the future will be possible if the present position is maintained, i.e. if this is under the control and direction of the provincial administration. This could have been done if the hon. the Minister and the Government had realized their responsibility in that respect and are prepared to do their duty. But I wonder where this paper apartheid is going to end. In the name of apartheid we already have, in South Africa, four different Ministers of Education, one for Whites, one for Coloured persons, one for Bantu and one for Indians. This in itself is already a strange phenomenon. In an ordinary country one usually finds only one power or authority in the sphere of education, but here we have four. Now it is, of course, inevitable that if one has four Ministers of Education, each basically engaged in the same task one would, of necessity, obtain divergent opinions and attitudes about education. At a later stage I shall indicate that according to the Minister&#x2019;s Second Reading speech there is clear proof that he recognizes views different to those of the hon. the Minister of National Education. However, first I want to make a request to those hon. members opposite <span class="col_5015-5016" refersTo="page_0971"/>who are possibly the thinkers and philosophers in the Government. I do just want to tell them that they must not take too seriously the recent publication in which it was announced that there are certain White groups in South Africa that have 7 per cent non-White blood in their veins. If they take it too seriously, with a view to their multinational concept, or as it is stated here, ethno-cultural characteristics, they are going to argue that if there are certain people with an average of 7 per cent of non-White blood in their veins, there might be certain parties with 14 per cent and others who are completely pure-blooded. Then I fear that in the future we are going to have a Bill on education for the purified Whites, one for the Whites with 7 per cent non-White blood and one for the Whites with 14 per cent non-White blood. In the same way we are engaged here in making an ethnological distinction between the Basters of Rehoboth, the Coloured persons of South-West Africa and the Nama.</p>

<p>Since we already have confusion, in the light of the fact that we already have four Ministers of Education, one is of necessity going to have divergent attitudes in respect of education. In the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Second Reading speech, for example, the following statement &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>Are there differences in principle among the various Ministers&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member asks me whether there are differences in principle. I am now going to deal with a difference of principle. In the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Second Reading speech he told us why it is essential that there should be three different Bills. He said that there are circumstances in South-West Africa that preclude the possibility of a uniform education system. But what have we thus far always heard from Ministers of National Education&#x003F; No matter what one&#x2019;s arguments may be, and even if one tries to tell them that there are certain geographic areas in South Africa that have certain historic opinions about education it has always been said: &#x201C;No, look, it simply must be uniform&#x201D;. That is why we in South Africa find that the various Provinces are all being forced in one specific direction. But here we obtain the acknowledgment of the hon. the Minister that there can be circumstances in a country which preclude uniformity. I must tell the hon. the Minister that I agree with him in that connection. With a view to the South-West African set-up it would have been much more important for the Administration of South-West Africa those who are closest to those people, to have been entrusted with the development of education in that area, instead of the Basters of Rehoboth and the Coloured persons of South-West Africa being linked up with the Coloureds of the Cape for example. I believe that they have much less in common than do the people of the South-West Africa area, whether they be Whites or non-Whites.</p>

<p>I want to continue by saying that even if I had no objections in principle to this Bill, it would still have been very difficult for me to support the Second Reading. The hon. the Minister had a wonderful opportunity to present this House with a model education Bill. He could have drawn richly uDon the experience of the various other Ministers and their departments, and even his own department. He could also have drawn on the experience of the various other provincial education ordinances. However, what do we have before us&#x003F; Before us we have a Bill which, in its main characteristics, retains virtually all the undesirable characteristics of the existing Education Acts in the country, and then a few have even been added here and there. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that I am very sorry about that, particularly if we view the Bill against the background of the Coloured teacher in South Africa. We already know that he is weighed down by the disadvantages of a salary gap with respect to the salaries of Whites and non-Whites. What the hon. the Minister could have done, since we are dealing with paper apartheid, was at least to have given the Coloured teachers something on paper which is equal to that in the White education departments. It was, as I have said, possible for the hon. the Minister to present us with a better Bill.</p>

<p>Let us look at certain of these clauses. There is, for example, clause 15 dealing with the requirements for appointment. There we find, that the unmarried Coloured woman cannot obtain a permanent appointment. There is, of course, a proviso to the effect that if the Minister is of the opinion that it is in the interests of education, she can obtain a permanent appointment. On <span class="col_5017-5018" refersTo="page_0972"/>the other hand it is provided in clause 21 that as soon as a female teacher marries she can no longer occupy her post on a permanent basis. I wonder why the hon. the Minister did not consult the Natal Provincial Administration, because they would have told him that for years now it has been standing practice that there is no legitimate cause to discriminate between the married and unmarried woman. This principle is implemented in practice in that province. Perhaps the hon. the Minister accepts the idea that the best, the most dedicated female teacher is specifically the one who is going to remain a spinster for the rest of her life&#x003F;</p>

<p>When we come to clause 17, for example, which has to do with the transfer on a full-time basis of teachers from certain Departments of State, we find that certain guarantees are given in respect of leave, subsistence allowances, transfer costs and transport facilities. However, what is missing here&#x003F; No guarantee is given in respect of the salary scale in terms of which such a person will be paid when he is transferred. In the Educational Services Act, No. 41 of 1967, there are also provisions with respect to the appointment of certain persons, in the employment of certain schools, to posts in the Public Service. In other words, those provisions concern the transfer of a teacher from a school to a post in the Public Service. In such a case there are specific provisions in connection with the salary scale that must be applicable. It is also provided that there should be no decrease in salary. However, this Bill does not contain similar provisions.</p>

<p>What type of person is transferred from another Department of State to education&#x003F; I am now specifically speaking about teachers. According to experience gained with White teachers, these are persons who were perhaps in the Public Service but who had a desire to engage in the teaching profession and consequently qualified themselves as teachers. As a result they applied for and obtained appointments in the Education Department. In the provincial administrations such a person is already successfully transferred and his previous service wholly or partly recognized, with the result that he does not begin on the lowest notch of the salary scale, but on a higher one. I am very sorry there is not a similar provision in this Bill.</p>

<p>Reference has already been made to clause 18, in which it is provided that a teacher may not do any other work. We know that there is also a similar provision in respect of White teachers. Here we are therefore dealing with the same kind of restriction. I wonder when we shall realize that overseas there is a well-known system in operation by which a teacher, or anyone else, can do two jobs. That system is known as &#x201C;moonlighting&#x201D;. The person who has the enterprise, the initiative and the perseverance to do so must not be penalized. I know that the hon. the Minister and his department, and other education departments in South Africa, are worried about the matter, because they are of the opinion that such a person will neglect his work, but if he neglects his work there are a whole series of other clauses and provisions in terms of which action can be taken against him as a result of negligence, etc. When we come to the promotion of teachers in State schools, under clause 20, we also find that the hon. the Minister is retaining something in his legislation which causes a great deal of trouble in the teaching profession. In terms of subsection (4) of clause 20, it is possible for a person to be appointed to a high-grade post, but the mere fact that he occupies that position does not give him any claim to a higher salary. I realize fully that something of this nature is essential, because it sometimes happens that one wants to promote somebody, but that at the moment there is no equivalent post into which he can be promoted, and that one has to keep him in the same post temporarily. However, experience has taught us that departments conveniently forget about people in those posts. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that it will be a sad day if it ever happens that any Coloured teacher in his department is exploited according to the provisions of this subsection (4).</p>

<p>As far as misconduct is concerned, as defined in clause 22, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout has already mentioned the fact that a teacher cannot criticize the administration of a department, officer or institution of the State. But I want to draw attention to the fact that he may not do so in public, alhough the provision is followed by the words &#x201C;otherwise than at a meeting convened by an association recognized by the Minister under section 26&#x201D;. However, we must realize that this type of clause and this type of provision continually expose the teacher, and in this case the Coloured teacher, to technical offences. In <span class="col_5019-5020" refersTo="page_0973"/>clause 23 it is provided that a charge of misconduct can be submitted in writing by anyone, and it must be in writing, and a copy of it must go to the person himself, but anyone can do this. I want to mention one case. Perhaps it is an hypothetical case, but it is an actual possibility. The teacher enters a post office. It is an office of another Government Department, and he is dissatisfied with his treatment. He makes a remark and passes criticism. He perhaps does so to two of his friends, but he has done so in public. He perhaps did so on the pavement or on the steps outside. This is a situation to which. I feel, this provision can lead. It would be much better if this were eliminated completely. It is going to be no use for the hon. the Minister to say that there are certain education departments that also apply this. I do not agree with that either.</p>

<p>Clause 25 deals with the making available of a person in the service of the department. I accept, of course, that in this case there will be certain Whites that would like to stand for parliamentary or provincial council election. But this also affects the Coloured persons. We see that in terms of this Bill, it is possible for them to make themselves available. According to the provisions of subsection (4) of clause 25, they are regarded as having left the service of the department the moment they are nominated. This places them in a very unenviable position. The moment one leaves the service of any department, and one has not yet reached retirement age, one loses one&#x2019;s pension benefits, one&#x2019;s promotion and one&#x2019;s status. What would the case be of such a person seeking election and finding that he is not elected&#x003F; Then such a person returns without the promotion he previously had. It may be a question of only two or three months. I really think that when we come to the Committee Stage we should make a suggestion which states, more or less, that from the moment a person is nominated for an election that person should be regarded as being on unpaid leave. The moment he is elected such a person should then automatically be regarded as no longer being employed. I really think this is something that must be considered.</p>

<p>I am very glad to note that in section 29 mention is made of compulsory school attendance. However, nowhere is mention made of free education in this respect. Any State or Government in any country that goes so far as to make education compulsory for certain age groups, must realize that in doing so the responsibility rests with that State or Government to ensure that if education is made compulsory, whether it be up to Std. 6 or Std. 4, up to 12 or 14 years of age, that that education as such shall be free. I now know that hon. members opposite will ask me why I do not read the contents of clause 13. There it is provided that in connection with boarding fees and class fees application can be made for partial or total exemption. However, I am sure that this is not good enough. In every country in the world where education is made compulsory, provision is also made for free education, which includes the supply of free books, etc. I think this is something that must be stated here in black and white.</p>

<p>I want to continue and mention a final aspect, i.e. that since there is now going to be an automatic change-over and transfer of paysheets from the South-West Administration to the department, great care must be taken. In this connection, I just want to make one request to the hon. the Minister, i.e. to make sure that as soon as such a transfer takes place, the teachers will be receiving their salaries on time the following term. I mention this particularly as a result of the experience in Natal when Coloured education was linked up to the Department of Coloured Affairs At the time there were several cases of persons who had to wait for their salaries as a result of administrative problems. I am aware of the fact that it even happens in White departments that teachers only receive their first salary cheque two months after they have been appointed. Since the hon. the Minister is now going to be working with the change-over to a new system, something the Minister has perhaps set his heart on making a success of. it is much more important for him to retain the good faith of his own people. This is one way in which he will lose it, i.e. if the change-over does not take place smoothly and, as far as teachers are concerned, if it cannot run smoothly in respect of the payment of their salaries.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is a long time since I last heard members of the Opposition struggling so much to dish up arguments with which to oppose legislation. The hon. member for Durban <span class="col_5021-5022" refersTo="page_0974"/>Central said that this legislation was another example of paper apartheid. In the first place I want to say that in my opinion that is not only an unfounded, but also a nonsensical statement to make. In the years I have been sitting in this Parliament, the legislation on education which has been passed in respect of the various population groups has, judging from the results, been very successful. We have pointed this out repeatedly in debates to hon. members on the opposite side. We realize, however, that the Opposition will of course never want to admit the success which has already resulted from that legislation. The hon. member for Durban Central also said that the present position should really be retained under the provincial administrations, for, he said, there have during the past years already been four Ministers to whom Coloured affairs have been entrusted.</p>

<p>Yes, the educational aspect. He also alleged that different Ministers held different views. I asked him whether those &#x201C;different views&#x201D; were in fact differences in principle. The hon. member then tried to furnish me with a reply, but it was a noncommittal reply, which proves that there are no differences in principle. The differences which do in fact exist are probably in this sense that they will result in improvements in education, as such, for the specific group.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg expressed her fear that the level of education will not be equal to the level of education for White education. Did I understand the hon. member correctly&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>*Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>No, not to the level of education for Coloured education existing in the Republic.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>Well then, not equal to the level of Coloured education here in the Cape. We know that it is a fear complex which the United Party displays whenever educational legislation in respect of other population groups is introduced in this House. This was the case in respect of Coloured education, and the same thing happened in respect of Bantu education, and in respect of Indian education and the results, up to now, prove that their fears were completely misplaced.</p>

<p>Then, too, the hon. member for Wynber said that she feared for a witch-hunt in respect of the staff in the service of education there. She referred to various clauses. The other two hon. speakers also referred to those specific clauses. These are, namely clauses 18, 21, 22, 23 and 24.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout, if I understand him well, raised the objection that the regulations and the conditions of service which will apply in respect of those Coloured teachers in South-West Africa, are cast in the mould of regulations and measures which apply to Coloured teachers here in the Republic. I hope I understood him correctly and that I am not misinterpreting his words. If this is true, I would have thought that he would have welcomed it, because here we already have a well-organized department which can in many respects set examples in regard to the control of education. After all, it provides a very good guideline for the development of Coloured education in South-West Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout also complained about discrimination against teachers. In fact, this also emerged to a certain extent in a speech made by the hon. member for Durban Central. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout referred in particular to the fact that they will not enjoy certain rights or privileges. The legislation in respect of Coloured education and the regulations which apply to Coloured teachers, just as is the case with the legislation in respect of Indian education and the regulations which apply to Indian teachers, seeks very strongly to prevent the persons concerned from becoming members of a party political organization or any other organization. In other words, restrictions are being imposed on those persons. It seems to me as if the hon. member for Bezuidenhout wants even more rights for Coloured teachers in South-West Africa than <span class="col_5023-5024" refersTo="page_0975"/>Coloured teachers and teachers of other ethnic groups have in the Republic.</p>

<p>By means of this Bill facilities are being created to meet the educational requirements of the Coloureds in South-West Africa. The National Party is a party which bases its arguments in respect of education on sound educational principles. The National Party believes that education should be orientated to the child. In other words, the focal point of education should be the child, regardless of what ethnic group that child may belong to. In addition, the child is a member of a specific ethnic group. He must be educated, or receive a schooling in that ethnic milieu, for he must subsequently serve that specific ethnic community; in other words, we believe&#x2014;and this is educationally quite correct&#x2014;that education should be ethnically orientated. The general policy of the National Party is to provide every ethnic group with its own schools. The education of the children of a people can only come into its own when it is offered or developed within the scope of a distinctive system of education. This legislation proposes the machinery whereby this may be applied. The machinery is set out in the various clauses. I think that we and the hon. members on that side will be afforded a reasonable opportunity of discussing the various clauses during the Committee Stage. I want to associate myself with the hon. member who supports this legislation and say that we are convinced that this is very good legislation. I am convinced that the education for this specific population group in terms of this legislation will not be of a poorer standard than the education of other population groups in the Republic for which provision has been made by means of other legislation which has been passed here. I gladly support this legislation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Koedoespoort is always critical of the attitude we adopt in regard to our concern over the divided departmental control of education. I believe that, if he were to make an in-depth study of the various sections or departments which handle the education of the various races and the amount of money that is allocated to these departments in relation to the number of students they are called upon to educate, he would realize that there are many discrepancies and many anomalies and perhaps, if he looked at it carefully, he would be led to change his views.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister, in his second Reading speech, dealt with the history of the education of the Coloured people in South-West Africa and he stressed the exceptional contribution made by the mission schools. He also expressed gratitude to the church societies because, I understand, he felt that they had made considerable financial assistance available for the mission schools to function and to carry out a very useful purpose when, at the time, no other facilities were available. I can understand the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s expressions of gratitude and I believe we on this side of the House associate ourselves with him in his remarks of appreciation to the mission schools.</p>

<p>It is interesting to observe&#x2014;and I quote from the 1960 Year Book of South Africa, No. 30&#x2014;that in 1960 there were 40 schools for Coloureds in South-West Africa and that they had a total enrolment of 3 700-odd pupils. Of those 40 schools, only four were Government-sponsored; the others were provided for by five different religious denominations. In 1966, six years later, the position was that the total number of schools had increased to 53 and the enrolment had increased almost 2&#x00BD; times to 9 400-odd, but that the number of Government schools had increased only from four to five. Religious denominations were still bearing the main burden of the education of the Coloured people. There were one Anglican, five Methodist, 20 Rhenisch, 15 Roman Catholic, five Dutch Reformed and two undenominational schools, which had borne the burden of the education of the Coloured people in South-West Africa. While we are grateful to these people, it seems to me that it is unfortunate that in this very Bill, in terms of clause 15 (1) (e), none of these people, who may have made signal contributions to the education of the Coloureds in South-West Africa, will be able to be accepted as permanent members of the staff unless they are South African <span class="col_5025-5026" refersTo="page_0976"/>citizens. It seems to me a little unfair that some of these good people, who may have devoted the best years of their lives to this type of work in South-West Africa, may find themselves in the position that they will be regarded as merely temporary employees when this Bill is put into effect.</p>

<p>I have given these details because I feel they justify our objection. They also, I think, lend argument to the amendment. We feel that people such as these, who have laid the ground-work and have specialized experience and who have enjoyed a certain amount of autonomy, will gradually be taken over not by an organization within the bounds of South-West Africa, but by a department which could be in Cape Town or Johannesburg some thousands of miles away&#x2014;education by remote control. The hon. the Minister, in his Second Reading speech, said that the Bill provides the necessary machinery for the expansion, in due course, of all the facets of a full-fledged system of education. He went on to state that this implied from Sub-Std. A to Std. 10 and that the education provided would include vocational schools, special schools, nursery schools and also post-school training. He then referred to the question of adults and said that there would be educational opportunities for the self-development of adults by means of part-time classes.</p>

<p>I hope that the hon. the Minister will give some assurance with regard to these part-time classes. I hope he will be able to assure us that there will be no unnecessary difficulties encountered in establishing and maintaining these part-time classes, particularly in the initial stages. They are for adults and, by their very nature, it may be necessary to use halls and other facilities which may be situated in White areas or areas allocated to other groups. Many people who require part-time classes could be in domestic service. The only time they can get their education on a part-time basis, would be after normal hours. The only way in which they can receive that education would be for them to have these facilities easily accessible. I just hope that, in this respect, we will have a maximum of co-operation and a minimum of hindrance of other legislation which may have the same effect that has taken place in regard to the education of the urban Bantu, particularly domestic Bantu, who now, through various Acts passed by this Government, are virtually deprived of the ability to attend night schools, continuation classes and part-time classes. I hope that the hon. the Minister can give some assurance that he will take a sympathetic view, particularly when these classes are first initiated.</p>

<p>Then I want to raise the question of the part-time classes. They are specifically referred to in cluase 3 (1) (b) and yet they are not defined. I accept that part-time classes are not defined in the Coloured Persons Education Act, but they are defined in the Indians Education Act. It seems logical to me that there should be some definition which would indicate what the intention is in regard to the people who take part-time classes. Let me refer briefly to the definition in the Indians Education Act. It says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mainly for Indians not subject to compulsory school attendance.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister referred to the teacher shortage. He said the shortage of teachers among the Coloured schools in the Coloured education system of South-West Africa was quite considerable. He referred specifically to the Nama and Baster ethnic groups and indicated that Coloured teachers were being used there. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he is satisfied that there will be funds available when this Bill becomes law to provide some sort of crash programme in teachers&#x2019; training so that he will be satisfied that the need for teachers will be met. We on this side of the House have indicated already that we welcome the provision of compulsory school attendance, but we appreciate there that any form of implementation of compulsory education, no matter how limited in the initial stages, will be vitally dependent upon an adequate supply of suitable teachers. From experience in the Republic we can say that the Government has shown itself unable to eliminate critical teacher <span class="col_5027-5028" refersTo="page_0977"/>shortages, particularly among the non-White races.</p>

<p>Then the hon. the Minister referred to higher education, because he said that the needs of the different population groups will be provided according to their own needs. Then he made the profound statement, to which the hon. member for Wynberg has referred with a view to the cultural-anthropological features of each ethnic group. I find a little difficulty in getting clarity on this and I hope the hon. member for Wynberg and I will have clarity on this aspect after the Minister has replied to this debate. I want to ask the hon. the Minister what plans he has in mind for the ultimate university education of these people. I think he will accept and agree with me that it is impracticable to suggest that there will be separate ethnic universities for these groups; impracticable from the point of view of numbers and not feasible because of the terrific financial expenditure that would be involved. We only have to see the enormous expense which has been undertaken to provide three ethnic universities for some of the largest ethnic Bantu groups in South Africa who out-number in the actual number of pupils enrolled the number of Coloured pupils enrolled by 150 times. Hon. members see that these are minority groups, because according to the 1966 census estimate, the Coloureds represent under 3 per cent of the total population of South-West Africa, the Basters under 3 per cent and the Namas under 7 per cent of the total population.</p>

<p>My question to the Minister is as follows : Obviously the pupils from these three ethnic groups will ultimately reach university level. Where will they go&#x003F; Will the Coloureds and the Basters be able to be accepted and assimilated in the University of the Western Cape&#x003F; From the <i>South-West Africa Survey</i> I understand that they are mainly Afrikaans-speaking, but what about the Namas then&#x003F; Will they be absorbed or integrated into some other Bantu ethnic university&#x003F; What will be the facilities provided for them ultimately when they need university education&#x003F; In the light of this Government&#x2019;s policy these people must receive university education if they are ever to be in a position to implement the Government&#x2019;s own policy of self-determination and separate development.</p>

<p>The Minister also mentioned that although in general the principles agree, there were differences. He said: &#x201C;Circumstances inevitably exclude a uniform system of education&#x201D;, and I join with the hon. member for Durban Central in asking what these circumstances could be. Are the differences to which he refers as great as the differences which exist between the Coloured pupils in the Cape Peninsula and the Coloured pupils in Natal, both of whom are at the present moment being educated under the same system and I take it under the same standards&#x003F;</p>

<p>Then the Bill refers to the establishment of school committees. The Minister in his Second Reading speech referred to regional education councils which he said&#x2014;and I can accept his logic for this&#x2014;would not be instituted at an early stage. However, I believe that there is a glaring omission in this Bill, because as I have read the Bill and as I have understood it, there has been no provision for the establishment of an education advisory council. Surely an education advisory council is necessary, even if in the Minister&#x2019;s own concept it need not be introduced at this early stage, the provision for its being brought into being as the need arises should be in the Bill, because on that basis it must help to provide the opportunities for development which is part of Government policy. Provision has been made for this education advisory council in the Coloured Persons Education Act, No. 47 of 1963. It is being provided in the Indians Education Act, No. 61 of 1965, but I see no reference to it in this Bill. If I am correct in my conclusion, I would like to urge this Minister to give serious consideration to moving an instruction either at some later stage in the debate in this House, or in the Other Place when it is being debated there, to make provision in this Bill for the establishment, when the occasion requires, of an education advisory council.</p>

<p>Then I want to come back to what the hon. member for Wynberg said in connection with the definition of &#x201C;deviate child&#x201D;. I think the choice of the word &#x201C;deviate&#x201D; was an unfortunate one. It may be, as the <span class="col_5029-5030" refersTo="page_0978"/>hon. member for Wynberg has suggested, that this Bill has been hurried along a little and that attention may not have been given to the wording in the English version. If one considers the dictionary definition of &#x201C;deviate&#x201D;, one finds that it says &#x201C;to cause to swerve&#x201D;, or &#x201C;turning aside from the right way&#x201D;. If we consider the term &#x201C;handicapped&#x201D;, we find that it refers to disability. Surely it is not the desire of the department to regard people who have been handicapped and who need special care as deviates, or to describe them as deviates. I want to make a very earnest appeal to the hon. the Minister to see whether he cannot bring the term &#x201C;deviate&#x201D; into line with other legislation. In the Afrikaans the definition is &#x201C;afwykende kind&#x201D;, and that stands in the definition under the Coloured Persons Education Act and also under the Indian Education Act. I want to point out to the hon. the Minister that the wording of the definition is absolutely identical, so that we have &#x201C;handicapped child&#x201D; in those two Acts as opposed to &#x201C;deviate child&#x201D; in this Bill, which I think is unfortunate. This is the case, although the definitions are identical, word for word. I believe it is imperative, particularly with the interest which this Bill must enjoy in overseas circles, to eliminate a wrong impression and put the right connotation to this particular definition.</p>

<p>Then, in clause 3 (1) (c) we read, <i>inter alia,</i> that the Minister has the right to establish, to erect and to maintain hostels, etc., &#x201C;and any other accessories in connection with State schools.&#x201D; Will I be right in saying that the &#x201C;other accessories&#x201D; can possibly refer to sportsfields and school grounds&#x003F; If so, I wish to address a further urgent appeal to the hon. the Minister. Where I come from in Natal it is possible to tell the race of the school by the condition of its school-grounds. It is always possible to say that the Coloured schools have the worst grounds. Surely, Sir, sports grounds and the grounds of a school should be the school&#x2019;s shop-window&#x003F; I want to appeal to the Minister not only to see that funds will be provided under this Bill to make sure that the facilities are adequate and that they are facilities of which the pupils can be proud, but that he should also consider right away this aspect in so far as Coloured schools in the Republic are concerned.</p>

<p>Then, in conclusion, I want to refer briefly to clause 30, because although the clause appears in both the Indian Education Act and the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Education Act, in this particular Bill there is an addition, &#x201C;a Coloured person who is a student of a university established by law&#x201D;. This particular clause, as I understand it, refers mainly to the allocation of loans, bursaries and the granting of financial assistance, but I wondered what the specific reason was in the drafting of this Bill for the inclusion of this particular clause. Sir, I believe that we on this side of the House have expressed our point of view and I support the amendment moved by my colleague, the hon. member for Wynberg.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; to the speeches of hon. members. I must say that I expected a somewhat smoother passage for this measure of mine through the House. I do not know whether I shall be able fully to answer all the arguments and points raised by hon. members, but I do want to assure the hon. member for Wynberg that the speech which I made when I introduced this measure was not made in unseemly haste. On the contrary, I prided myself, while I was standing here, that for a speech that was being read, it was being read very well, especially remembering that I was put off very much by the urgent conferences that were going on all the time between the Whips owing to a misunderstanding that had arisen here regarding the adjournment of the House on that Friday afternoon. In any case, I may also add that my speech was not considerably curtailed. I read the full speech which I had prepared and <span class="col_5031-5032" refersTo="page_0979"/>which, I may say, was considerably altered by myself.</p>

<p>In any case, the hon. member has asked me whether I have consulted with the people who are affected by this Bill and by the other two Bills that I propose bringing before this House. My reply to that is that I would like to give hon. members the history of these measures. I want to take hon. members back to the South-West Africa Affairs Act of 1969. The Schedule to that Act lists &#x201C;matters in regard to which the administration of the affairs of the Territory shall be carried on by a Minister of the Republic.&#x201D; Item 14 of the Schedule reads: &#x201C;matters specially affecting Coloured persons (including Namas) and members of the Rehoboth Baster community, including education for the said Coloured persons and members, but excluding the entry into the Territory of Coloured persons.&#x201D; The South-West Africa Affairs Act of 1969 thus actually transferred the administration of all Coloured education in South-West Africa to me. These Bills are not being brought before Parliament to bring those matters under my control. For nearly three years already the Minister of Coloured Affairs has been in full charge of the administration of education for the Coloureds of South-West Africa, the Basters of South-West Africa and the Namas of South-West Africa. I maintain, therefore, that absolutely nothing is being taken away from the Territory of South-West Africa. The Act of 1969, which was produced as a result of the report of the Odendaal Commission, was an agreed measure between this Government and the Administration of South-West Africa, and transferred the education of those three race groups to my department as far back as 1969. I think, in view of that, the amendment of the hon. member is a bit unfortunate, because it says that hon. members opposite are against this Bill because the Territory will be deprived of the control of its own educational affairs. But for three years already the Territory has not had this control; I have had this control.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, we administered Coloured education in South-West Africa under the South-West Africa Ordinance of 1962. We used that as the legal basis for the administration of Coloured education in South-West Africa. Hon. members on the other side will appreciate that it is a bit difficult to use an ordinance of 1962, good as it was and good as it still may be, as a legal instrument, and our only wish here is to put this matter on a proper basis. I felt, therefore &#x2014;and I still feel&#x2014;that although the Opposition may object, they should not object too strongly to this measure. We can in the Committee Stage go very thoroughly into the various points which they have raised here. It has been said that perhaps I am imposing something on people which they do not want. I think, Sir, that I am giving these people an education measure that is really worthwhile. There are a few features to which the Opposition has some real objection, but on the whole these are educational measures which can cater well for the education of any people.</p>

<p>The hon. member wants to know why I bring three separate Bills before the House. I was also asked what I mean by &#x201C;cultural differences&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;kultureel-volkekundig&#x201D;. I introduced this measure in Afrikaans and I used the word &#x201C;kultureel-volkekundig&#x201D;. I think all hon. members on both sides of the House know South-West Africa. We know that the Basters of South-West Africa are a completely separate group. They are people who came into being in the North-Western Cape through the inter-mixing of White men and Coloured women, and they formed a community&#x2014;a &#x201C;volk&#x201D;&#x2014;of their own. They trekked to South-West Africa and settled in the Rehoboth Gebiet. They have a citizenship of their own; they have their own &#x201C;vaderlike wette&#x201D; and they keep <span class="col_5033-5034" refersTo="page_0980"/>out of that community anybody who is not a Baster. They do not want to be known as Coloureds because they say that they are certainly not Coloured. Naturally they are not Namas, as hon. members all know. They say that they are &#x201C;Basters&#x201D;. They are a separate &#x201C;volkekundige, kulturele groep&#x201D;, and nobody can really deny that.</p>

<p>Then you have the Namas. They are an indigenous group in South-West Africa. They have their own Reserves and their own system of organization, and they have their own tribal system, which the Coloured people do not have. They have their own language. So the Namas are a separate group and the Coloureds, as we all know, are a separate group. So we have these three groups, and if you want to keep the anthropological part out of it, there are still cultural differences that exist among these three groups.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask a question&#x003F; I would like to ask the hon. the Minister what these cultural or other differences have to do with education as such, because presumably education is the same whether you are White or Black or Pink or Blue.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p> am not basing my case on cultural differences only, but I have pointed out to the hon. member that, for instance, one of these groups has its own language, and surely language is a cultural matter. But I do not want to pursue the hon. member&#x2019;s argument that you can have just one educational ordinance for Whites, Blacks, Bantu and Coloureds. I do not want to pursue that line of thought. There are cultural differences between these people, but I am not basing my case solely on that. Then these peoples also have certain constitutional institutions. They are only in their very initial stages, but on both sides of the House we take it for granted that these constitutional agencies will develop in time and there will come a time when we would like to hand over to them something of their own to administer and to control themselves, and then we will have an educational instrument for the Basters and say &#x201C;Here is your educational Act, you can now carry on.&#x201D; Then we need not give them something antiquated, something of 1962 which in any event does not deal specifically with their case, but we can give them something definite and tell them to carry on. The same applies to the Namas. This is more or less the explanation I give for bringing these matters before the House.</p>

<p>Now there have been certain arguments in connection with the measures and I would just like shortly to reply to some of them. Hon. members have said that we must not bring discrimination into the picture here. I can assure hon. members that I do not want to bring discrimination into the education of these people. In the Committee Stage we can look into this, and if hon. members can point out to me that I bring in new discriminatory measures, I will be prepared to look at that clause very thoroughly. It has been mentioned here that by one of these clauses we will now penalize people who have rendered very valuable service to education in South-West Africa, to the non-European people, people who may not be South African citizens. I will give the matter some thought. I will discuss it with my department. If there are today teachers who are performing a valuable service and who are not South African citizens, we can look at this matter when we come to the Committee Stage. But let me say that we do make provision for State schools and State-aided schools, and it is not my idea or that of my department&#x2014;and we have not done so for the last few years&#x2014;to take over all State-aided schools. We would like the educational set-up in South-West Africa to continue as we found it and as we have administered it now for more than two years. We have no intention in the least of changing it, but I will look into this matter, and if this stipulation here about South African citizenship will penalize some of those mission societies when they who continue with the good work they have been doing, I will look into it.</p>

<p>There are certain other matters, like remuneration for private work. As far as I know, that is a clause which you will find in all education ordinances and Acts. You will <span class="col_5035-5036" refersTo="page_0981"/>find in the Public Service Act that people are supposed to do the work the Government pays them for. If they want to perform outside work, they have to get the Minister&#x2019;s permission. This is not something out of the ordinary. I have been asked whether I envisage ultimate university education for these people. Naturally I do, but for a small group of people like this it is something which you might say might happen in the future or might not. At present these people come to the Republic and attend teachers&#x2019; training centres in the Republic. I believe a few have attended the University of the Western Cape, and that will be the process we will continue with in future. Hon. members will see that we make provision for assisting those people with bursaries, especially as one hon. member has told the House that there is such a scarcity of these teachers in South-West Africa. The thing must be economic and you cannot put up colleges for a small group of people like that. But on the other hand I feel that provision should be made in the Act for this. The hon. member for Berea mentioned another thing which I cannot see here. He says it should have been in here even though it is not foreseeable for the near future. The hon. member for Wynberg and the hon. member for Durban Central also touched on many points and asked <i>inter alia</i> : What about agricultural education&#x003F; Under the Act as it stands I can in effect cater for an agricultural school, because the Act gives me the power to lay down the curriculum, and the subjects that must be taught in any school. So, in effect, I can create any school and I can transform any school into an agricultural school if I want to.</p>

<p>In regard to part-time classes, I am very sympathetic, but the hon. member must realize that these things come slowly, it is also a matter of money. The hon. member also asked about the word &#x201C;accessories&#x201D;, whether this means facilities and amenities like playing-fields, etc. I cannot give the assurance that that word covers that. I will find out, but I do not think it refers to outside amenities. As the hon. members have told the House, most of these schools are State-aided schools and not State schools; we try to give subsidies and aid to those schools as far as possible, but we are also limited in our funds.</p>

<p>Then, with regard to standards, I would like to assure hon. members on both sides of the House that we are very keen to maintain standards. There is one thing I have found in my dealings with the Coloured people, namely that they are even more keen than we are to maintain educational standards. They do not want me or anybody else to do anything which will in the least detract from the high educational standards which they also want. If a Coloured youth comes out with his matric certificate, he wants to have all the confidence in the world to say that his certificate is at least as good as any other matric certificate. As hon. members perhaps know, my department, through its educational adviser, is a member of the Matriculation Board. The education we are dealing with here today is therefore, through my department, covered by the Matriculation Board. In that way, and through our system of inspectors, we will see to it that standards are indeed maintained. Then there is the question of appointment on probation. The hon. member could make enquiries and I would like her to do so before we come to the Committee Stage, but I can give her the assurance that all teachers in South Africa are appointed on probation, be they White, Coloured, Brown or Black.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I have referred to permanent appointments for the first time, which are done on probation. Now we come to promotions. I can give hon. members the assurance that even a European inspector of schools in South Africa is appointed on probation. He could be a complete failure and the department might want to put him back in his old grade. We could look into this. My information however is that this is not a completely strange <span class="col_5037-5038" refersTo="page_0982"/>provision. In any case, this is not the type of provision that would necessitate hon. members voting against the Bill.</p>

<p>Then we have participation in local affairs and political affairs. There are one or two things here which we can look into further. It is my wish that the Coloured teachers who are really the leaders of their people should participate in the organization of their own affairs, such as societies, committees, and so forth. It is indeed my wish although I do want to have some sort of check.</p>

<p>Then we have this matter of political participation. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout raised the point. I do not want to make any difference between a Coloured person teaching in South-West Africa and a European person teaching in South-West Africa. As much as the European teacher can become a member of a political party, an executive or chairman of the branch, so the Coloured person must have that same right, which in fact he has.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It will be quite possible for such a person to become chairman of a branch. There are such people in South-West Africa today. I think we can deal with the question of election. Hon. members will understand that as far as the House of Assembly and the Legislative Assembly of South-West Africa are concerned, it can only relate to Whites who are teachers. We are not arguing about that. At the moment it is not under discussion, because the Coloured people of South-West Africa do not elect members to the Coloured Persons Representative Council. The wording will possibly have to be changed when the Coloured Persons Council of South-West Africa is made an elected council. Provision will have to be made for that. I can assure hon. members that I also noticed the point made by them. It can involve a person in difficulties if he has to resign when he is nominated. He will then have to go back to his school if he does not make the grade. I do not want to promise that I shall definitely change this, but when I read through the Bill it occurred to me as well. I shall go into the matter. This is not a matter of real importance today. This clause does not enter into the matter at all because no Coloured person can seek election in terms of this section today. But when the Coloured Council of South-West Africa becomes an elected council this will enter into the matter, and in view of that I shall have to go into this point. The question is whether he has to resign on the day on which he is nominated or whether it must be the day on which he is elected.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of criticism. How far can a person go with criticism outside the association that has to do with his work&#x003F; Since the members spoke English I have the English text here. The word &#x201C;publicly&#x201D; is used and in Afrikaans this is probably &#x201C;in die openbaar&#x201D;. It is a question of &#x201C;publicly&#x201D;. After all, one is not unreasonable. This type of clause is usually included with a view to the prevention of abuse. It remains a matter of discretion. It is said that might be a Minister or official who dislikes a person and who would then be stricter with him than with another person. I realize that it is a matter of discretion. The intention is not that it will apply if someone should say that he is dissatisfied with the service in a Post Office or should express some criticism against an increase in the price of petrol or whatever, or if someone is a chairman of a branch and talks with his people and deals with these matters.</p>

<p>As far as I am concerned, it will be permissible.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member asked me about the regional education council. This Bill makes <span class="col_5039-5040" refersTo="page_0983"/>provision for the establishment of school committees, as the hon. member knows. It also makes provision for the establishment of a sort of regional educational council, which will not be instituted immediately, but perhaps later on. This will actually be more like a school board. It is not my intention&#x2014;I am referring to the speech of the hon. member for Berea&#x2014;to establish some kind of educational advisory council at this stage. My department is represented on the education council in the Republic and I think that representation is sufficient for the moment. I shall look into the provision which deals with deviate children and if it is necessary the word can be substituted.</p>

<p>*That is about all I have to say about this Bill and I conclude by saying that I think it will be a good thing if these three Bills are put through Parliament and I request Parliament to pass them.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the Budget debate which came to an end last Friday afternoon was probaby one of the most remarkable debates of its kind I have ever experienced in my career as a parliamentarian. We were supposed to have held a Budget debate here which would deal with financial matters, but very little was said about financial affairs.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>For one day a few of the eight wise gentlemen of the Opposition, who had to bring a charge against the Government, aired their opinions of the Budget. For five long days we had to sit here, and for five long days I had to sit here waiting to hear, on one day only, a few feeble remarks from the Opposition on the Budget. It is true that during the last few days there were a few members, such as the hon. members for Green Point and Jeppes, the hon. Leader of the Opposition and others, who rose to make certain comments of a financial nature, but these were of an ephemeral nature, and contributed little to clarifying the debate. And this, Sir, after we had for months already been hearing, both inside and outside this House, about the tremendous importance of this Budget of last month, and after we had heard in the Press and hear in Parliament that this Budget had been one of the most important Budgets ever introduced in South Africa, and at least one of the most important Budgets of the past twenty years. This Budget, it was said, was a particularly critical Budget, one upon which the future of South Africa would depend, and one which would determine whether the National Party Government would or would not survive. What did we have, Sir&#x003F; For five long days we sat here and during those five long days we heard, virtually for one day only, tepid and insignificant, apathetic criticism from the hon. members of the Opposition.</p>

<p>That the Opposition was in trouble we noticed the first day already when the hon. member for Parktown rose to speak here. The hon. member for Parktown also rose to speak immediately after I had made my Budget speech, and I have never before seen him so frustrated and so disappointed. The hon. member is a member who has a great deal of confidence in himself; that is as I have come to know him, but I have seldom before seen him at such a loss as he was on that Wednesday afternoon. The hon. member is a fairly eloquent speaker; sometimes he has a quite poetic turn of phrase; sometimes he has quite a Shakespearian turn of phrase, but when the hon. member had to rise to speak that Wednesday afternoon of the 29th March he really did not know what to say or how he should say it. The hon. member had brought along with him a sheaf of notes, which he had apparently made before he heard the Budget, and which he then had to use in respect of a Budget which turned out quite differently to what he had expected. Therefore, to use the English words, one could see that the hon. member was &#x201C;flustered&#x201D;: he floundered in every way. The same thing became apparent when the hon. member rose on Monday to go further into this Budget. There was dead silence while he was speaking. There was no reaction from that side of the House. The only jollity, hilarity and reaction the hon. member elicited was when he referred in an uncalled for way to my friend, the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs, and mentioned what a newspaper had supposedly written the week before, i.e. that a previous Minister of Economic Affairs would have to be called back to the Cabinet.</p>

<p>Sir, those hon. members must not be so quick to speak; they must not be so quick to rejoice over matters which can bring them no joy. Have they forgotten that their own Press has stated, not once but several times, that if the United Party should ever come into power they will include people from the private sector in their Cabinet, and that they have on numerous occasions already said that they will include people, particularly from commerce and industry, in their Cabinet&#x003F; In other words, the Press of those hon. members has proved that they do not have confidence in those hon. members and in the wise hon. stars sitting there. They want to ask people from outside, from commerce and industry, to serve in that Cabinet. The hon. member for Parktown should be very careful about what he says, for only recently their newspapers were writing that the future Minister of Finance should be Dr. Frans Cronje. Sir, people who live in glass houses should not throw stones. Sir, why is it that after twelve days of rest, quiet and calm after the Budget had been delivered, the Opposition put up such a poor show, twelve days in which they did, after all, have time to ponder the Budget and to consult one another&#x003F; Why could they not do any better&#x003F; In the first place, the reason for that is to be found in the fact that this Budget was received by the general public, by all sectors of the public, in a much better way than hon. members on that side ever feared or expected. I do not have the time now to go into all the criticisms and into all the ways in which this Budget was received, but if hon. members will consult the Press, they will find that this Budget was received by other bodies and other persons, that know something about this matter, in a way a Budget has seldom if ever been received before. Sir, if you will allow me, I just want to quote a few of the scores of extracts from the Press. I do not want to talk about the newspapers themselves, but about the various bodies: but let me just mention a few newspapers here first which are not kindlv-disposed towards me. I take the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> first : &#x201C;Given the limitations within which he had to work. Dr. Diederichs has done a creditable job with his sixth Budget&#x201D;. The following newspaper I want to quote is <i>The Star</i> : &#x201C;Diederichs has set the scene for a big boost to the economy&#x201D;. The <i>Cape Times:</i> &#x201C;A shrewd udget all round&#x201D;. The <i>Rand Daily Mail:</i> &#x201C;Industry, commerce: two cheers&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Yes, one from commerce and one from industry. Here is a summary of the opinions of all the various bodies&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The general reaction was that the measures would help stimulate the economy. These views reflected the general consensus among all the major industrial bodies.</block>

<p>It is then mentioned here how Mr. Back, the president of the Chamber of Industries, praises this Budget; then reference is made here to Mr. Sher, the president of Assocom, who praised the Budget; the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut, the trade unions and the bankers were mentioned here. This Budget was praised throughout by all the major bodies as a Budget which in all respects achieved its objects. The Stock Exchange is also mentioned here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Diederichs did all market expected. He did just about everything investors and brokers reauired him to do in Wednesday&#x2019;s Budget.</block>

<p>We then come to the farmers&#x2019; associations&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Farmers hail R18 million fillip.</block>

<p>We find that the banks, in the words of Mr. Oxford, welcomed the improvement of credit facilities. We find that the National Board of Executors accepted this Budget with praise. We find that various professors, who according to the United Party are always opposed to us, welcomed this Budget. That is the reason, Mr. Speaker, why hon. members on that side were not capable of criticizing this Budget, which was in general accepted by the public and various bodies. Of course there was criticism as well; of course there were people who did not agree entirely with this Budget. Of course there were people who found fault with certain parts of this Budget, for it is after all impossible to prepare a Budget which will satisfy everyone, and with which everyone will agree. I think that even if you could persuade the Angel Gabriel to prepare a Budget, there would still be criticism. Even if you were to get <span class="col_5045-5046" refersTo="page_0986"/>all the eight wise stars on that side of the House together to prepare a Budget jointly, you would still have criticism. But there is another reason why hon. members on that side do not want to accept this Budget, and why their criticism was so extremely poor. This second reason for the weakness of their criticism lies therein that they have absolutely no logical policy or standpoint in regard to the economy of our country and because they do not know what a Budget at this particular juncture in South Africa should look like. Hon. members on that side did not succeed in analysing, what they regard as the sickness, the weakness in our economy, correctly, and they succeeded even less in indicating methods according to which the so-called weaknesses in our economy could be eliminated. We on this side have frequently been accused of not having a policy, but if I must judge from the contributions made by hon. members on that side last week, then I must say that I have never heard such lack of policy, such lack of direction, in the financial sphere as I did last week in this House. Not only did they differ one from the other, but the same speaker frequently differed with himself in the same speech. Not only did they contradict one another, but the same speaker frequently contradicted himself, as I shall indicate in a moment. The only solution they bring to our problems and difficulties is as always the same old cry of making greater use of Black labour in our country. Of course they discussed the problems of the low growth rate, the increasing prices, and the balance of payments deficit. These are things with which all of us are acquainted. These are problems which not only we are experiencing; these are problems which are being experienced in all parts of the world. But hon. members on the opposite side were not able to indicate to us any course to take. If we analyse the contributions made by hon. members on that side, we find that particularly the hon. member for Gardens, probably the most pessimistic member who has ever sat in this House, could not find words strong enough to condemn this Budget.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The one question to which we all had to find a reply, and to which the hon. member had to furnish a reply, is this: What is the true nature and character of our economic and financial problems&#x003F; The question confronting us is whether the economy is too hot or too cold. Was the total demand for goods and services during the past year, in proportion to the available supply, too high, or was it too low&#x003F; Was our problem during the past year a problem of labour shortages, of bottlenecks and of a pressure on our limited resources, or was our problem in the economy a problem of under-utilization, of unemployment and of surplus capacity&#x003F; Those were the problems confronting us, and we expected hon. members on that side to give us guidance and indicate a course to take, in their criticism. Some speakers on that side said that we were confronted by a problem of demand inflation and that we should stimulate our growth rate as rapidly as possible. Others, on the other hand, said that we were on the verge of a recession, and that we should stave off this recession. The hon. member for Parktown did not know which way to go. He only knew that he must go against the Government. On the one hand we received, in the speech made by the hon. member, complaints concerning a high rate of inflation, the deficit on the current balance of payments account, a so-called deficit on the Budget, and we received from him complaints about the amount of money which is being injected into the economy. He complained about the use of the Stabilization Fund, and discussed the use of funds for the Revenue Account which were intended for the Loan Account. If we consider all these complaints made by the hon. member as a whole, we must deduce from them that his problem in regard to the economy is that the economy is over-heated and that we are dealing with a problem of demand inflation, that it is a threatening danger and that we should have adopted measures against this demand inflation and against this excess money. That is one aspect of the picture he painted. On the other hand the hon. member painted a picture the reverse of this one. He said that the economic measures of the Government were the fundamental cause of the downturn in the economy. He said the Budget had not stimulated growth sufficiently. He said credit control had not been relaxed to a sufficient degree; in other words, we must afford people more and more opportunities for incurring debt. He said the relaxation of the hire purchase restrictions <span class="col_5047-5048" refersTo="page_0987"/>on motor-cars was insufficient; in other words, we must allow people to purchase more motor-cars. He said the sales duty had not been reduced sufficiently; in other words, we must increase the buying power of those people in that way as well. This is the opposite image he depicted to us. On the one hand he actually warns against inflation; on the other hand he paints us a different picture of a recessionistic economy. I think the hon. member for Parktown must decide now whether the economy is too hot or whether it is too cold. Must we, according to him, inject more money into the economy, or must we inject less money into the economy&#x003F; Must we curb spending to check inflation, or must we stimulate spending to promote growth&#x003F; The hon. member is like a person who wants to drive to the left, but at the same time wants to move right.</p>

<p>But there is something else which worried the hon. member tremendously. What worried him was that there was such a small deficit on last year&#x2019;s Revenue Account. The hon. member prepared himself to come to this debate and be able to attack the Government on the tremendous deficit on the Revenue Account of last year&#x2019;s Budget, but how disappointed he was when he came here to find that our deficit on the Budget of last year was only slightly more than R4 million. Then the hon. member began to look for methods with which to prove &#x2014;and I see the hon. the Leader of the Opposition thinks so, too, because he is laughing about this.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>He began to look for methods to prove that this deficit was far greater than the indicated R4,3 million. What did he do then&#x003F; We began with an initial balance of R72.5 million. Virtually every Budget begins with an initial balance. This is the transfer from the previous year to the next on Revenue Account. This is customary in the economy. We began with an initial balance of R72,5 million. Last year we budgeted for an initial balance this year, for a surplus of R39,7 million, and found that this year it was R72,5 million. In addition to that we have R39,l million which we voted last year from the Revenue Account to the Loan Account, and we found that the Loan Account no longer needed this amount, and we then returned it to the Revenue Account, where it belongs. Now the hon. member said that if we had not done these things, there would have been a deficit. Surely that is quite right. Surely that is budgeting practice. It is what happens every day and in every country, i.e. that one begins with a surplus from the previous year which you transfer to the next year. It is quite in order that we should return to the Revenue Account, where it belongs, money from the Revenue Account which we intended for the Loan Account, but then found the Loan Account did not need. However, my hon. friend states that if the hon. the Minister had not done this and if the hon. the Minister had not done that, he would have had a deficit of R130 million. But we are not discussing &#x201C;ifs&#x201D; here. We have nothing to do with &#x201C;ifs&#x201D;. The hon. member could just as well have said that if my revenue had decreased by R100 million and my expenditure had increased by R100 million I would have had a deficit of R200 million. However, this did not happen. These things did not happen either, and the hon. member was unnecessarily startled at what should not have been.</p>

<p>The hon. member said the following, <i>inter alia,</i> about the Budget&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister was not prepared to accept that there was going to be or was a downturn in the economy and he would not accept that his income would as a result be less than his estimates.</block>

<p>Again my hon. friend was wrong in his calculations. My income is less than I expected, but not as a result of economic circumstances. My income is less as a result of diminished import duties&#x2014;R20 million&#x2014;because during the last quarter of this financial year fewer commodities were imported.</p>

<p>What does this have to do with the economy&#x003F; The true indication is the internal revenue. The internal revenue which is the true and a better barometer of the economy, appears to be R21 million more than we originally budgeted for.</p>

<p>That is a very serious matter in regard to which I have to take the hon. member to task. I refer to an announcement made on the morning of the day on which I delivered my Budget speech, by the President of the Reserve Bank, to the effect that the limit on loans for discounting would be increased by 5 per cent and that the limit or the ceiling on investments by monetary banks would be raised by 10 per cent. Together this would result in an amount of R140 million, which would in that way flow into the economy of the country. What did my hon. friend say about that&#x003F;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This, I am told, merely gives legal recognition to the existing position.</block>

<p>I wonder whether the hon. member knows what a serious accusation he was making there, a serious accusation that the monetary banks would in the month of March alone exceed their limit by R140 million. Does the hon. member not realize what a serious charge he was in that way making against the integrity of the banks&#x003F; [Interjections.] What is more, why did he say the following&#x003F; He said&#x2014; &#x201C;I am told&#x201D;. Therefore, he heard this somewhere. Is that the way in which we should conduct debates in this House&#x003F; Is that the way in which we should argue about the serious problems in the country&#x2014;with stories picked up in the street, in the club or somewhere else&#x003F; &#x201C;I am told&#x201D;.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is what the hon. member came forward with and attacked the banks in the country. I think these are random allegations, which are not befitting the hon. member. The hon. member for Constantia, to whom I shall come in a moment, did something similar. The hon. member also said, and I do not want to go into this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Where it is in price control and import control, the hon. the Minister really contributes very little.</block>

<p>I think I shall tell the hon. member to go back and read my Budget speech where it deals with this. Another point which the hon. member also feels very badly about is that my department, with the assistance of my colleagues on this side, has succeeded in curbing the expenditure for the coming year to such an extent that it is only 5,9 per cent more than in the previous year. I have already referred to the fact that this is a major achievement which could only take place owing to the loyal co-operation of my colleague. Now the hon. member claims for himself and that side of the House the credit for that, for, he says, it is they who said this, it is they who demanded this. He said that he just wanted to tell me that if I was able to do this now, I could have done it previously as well. Then he said that I had supposedly said, previously, that it was not possible, but that I had in fact proved now that it was in fact possible. While I am not denying that there could have been curbs in regard to the Budget of previous years, I do want to tell the hon. member that if we had not, in the previous years, incurred major expenditure, it would not have been possible to introduce these major curbs now. Much of the expenditure incurred during the previous year was expenditure in respect of our infrastructure, something which is vitally necessary for continued growth in this country. If this had not been done at that stage, it would have had to have been done in this year&#x2019;s Budget.</p>

<p>I want to concede one thing to the hon. member. The hon. member is correct when he says that I used up the full R161,5 million in my Stabilization Fund. The hon. member was tremendously shocked at the fact that the R161,5 million which was left over in the Stabilization Fund has been used to balance the Revenue Budget and to deposit an amount in the Loan Budget. He was shocked to such an extent that he almost cried out, like Hamlet&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our cupboard is almost bare.</block>

<p>That means he is bewailing the fact that our coffers are almost empty. Hon. members will recall what happened two or three years ago when I proposed the introduction and the building up of this Stabilization <span class="col_5051-5052" refersTo="page_0989"/>Fund. Hon. members will still recall what the reaction was from the hon. members on that side of the House, and specifically the hon. member for Parktown. Does he still remember how he criticized me over the fact that we had supposedly withdrawn money unnecessarily from the public sector and put it in safe-keeping there so that it did not have to be used in the Budget of our State&#x003F; Now that the money is being used, he is the one who is tremendously concerned about the fact that our coffers are virtually empty now. If the hon. members had been in power there would have been no coffers in which the money could be found.</p>

<p>I come now to the hon. member for Von Brandis. He fell into the same difficulties as the hon. member for Parktown. He contradicted himself to such an extent that he did not know where he was. He could not understand this; he could not comprehend that; and the hon. member must tell us now whether we are in a situation of over-heating or whether we are in a situation of recession. The hon. member said that our major problem in this country was the problem of too little growth. If that is his standpoint, then it is quite correct, but then he went further and stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Of these three weaknesses, lower growth is without question the fundamental weakness in the South African economy. The other two, the deficit on the balance of payments and inflation, are to a large extent consequential in the low growth which we have experienced in recent years.</block>

<p>In other words, what the hon. member is suggesting is that we have problems of inflation and problems with our balance of payments because we in South Africa are allegedly growing slowly. In other words, if you want to extricate the country from inflation and want to rectify the balance of payments, only one possibility remains open to you, and that is to open all the sluice-gates and to grow for all you are worth; you must grow with might and main and at all costs in order to overcome inflation and make the balance of payments sound. Surely the hon. member knows that is not so. Surely he knows that, as far as a young country like South Africa is concerned, the faster it grows, and especially if it grows beyond its limits, the more pressure there will be on the balance of payments and the more inflation there will be. The hon. member is putting matters in completely the wrong order. If he were correct, we would be able to bring about a surplus on our balance of payments and to eliminate inflation. If we want to reduce taxation and abolish credit control, we will have to set to work very expansionistically in the monetary and fiscal spheres. The hon. member knows that it is an absolutely false argument, which will not hold water.</p>

<p>The hon. member furthermore accused the Government of having caused the difficulties in the country because we had tried to suppress growth in recent years. Mr. Speaker, this Government has not tried to suppress real growth. Our movements and attempts in recent years have been aimed at halting inflation, at suppressing the demand for goods and services, which had become too great. We applied fiscal and monetary methods in order to bring this about. I want to know from the hon. member what South Africa&#x2019;s position would have been today if we had not used fiscal and monetary methods over the past six years. What would our position not have been as far as inflation is concerned&#x003F; The Government remains in favour of growth, but it believes that growth can be based only on stability. Therefore we are seeking in the first place to infuse stability into the economy in order to base our growth on that. The hon. member for Von Brandis was guilty of even more contradictions. He said that all direct measures of control, such as price control, import control and interest rate control, were the result of restrictive monetary and fiscal measures of the Government. The hon. member is completely off the mark. If the liberal policy he advocates were followed, it would be much more necessary to introduce these restrictive measures.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia also made certain observations here. He finds himself in a very dualistic position. A moment ago I referred to members who cannot decide in which direction the economy is moving. I mentioned examples from the courses of action adopted by two members. The finest example of this was the course of action adopted by the hon. member for Constantia. The hon. member spoke about &#x201C;the factor of deficit budgeting&#x201D;. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_5053-5054" refersTo="page_0990"/>I suggest that deficit budgeting in itself is highly inflationary, because it means that we are living off our savings&#x2014;in other words, we are not financing our current expenditure out of our current income and the Government is living beyond its means. When added to deficit budgeting you have the considerable injection of new money into the economy by way of a heavy overseas borrowing programme, then the whole fiscal position becomes highly inflationary.</block>

<p>Did I hear someone say &#x201C;yes&#x201D;&#x003F; That is the standpoint the hon. member adopted. He gave us a whole paragraph full of proofs of how, as a result of the method of budgeting, &#x201C;the position has become highly inflationary&#x201D;. Only two minutes later the hon. member said, &#x201C;To me the whole Budget conveyed the impression of being a damping-down Budget.&#x201D; I see the hon. member is even shaking his head. How can one understand that anyone can in the same speech label the Budget as &#x201C;highly inflationary&#x201D; and then a few minutes later as a &#x201C;damping-down&#x201D; Budget&#x003F; These are the contradictions we get in the actions of hon. members opposite. The hon. member for Constantia not only differs with his colleagues, but with himself as well. Together with the hon. member for Parktown, the hon. member sinned very badly. He also referred to the R140 million extra which is now going to be given to monetary banks and with which they may increase their credit. Just as the hon. member for Parktown said, i.e. that he had heard, &#x201C;I have been told&#x201D;, that this merely maintained the established position, the hon. member for Constantia also said, &#x201C;It is really little more than making honest men of the bankers; in other words, legalizing an existing <i>de facto</i> position.&#x201D; What was the hon. member insinuating by that&#x003F; Was the hon. member insinuating by that that in the past month the bankers of South Africa had acted dishonourably, that they had exceeded their credit ceilings by R140 million in a dishourable way&#x003F; The hon. member must have been insinuating that. The hon. member is of the opinion that in one month, in March, the banks in this country exceeded their credit ceiling by R140 million. This is a tremendous reflection on the banks. Did the hon. member obtain his information from the same source as the hon. member for Parktown did&#x003F; Would they perhaps give us the source of their information&#x003F; Neither the hon. member for Constantia, nor the hon. member for Parktown nor the informant who told them this could have known anything about what they have alleged. The Treasury does not know it, nor does the Reserve Bank. The only available figures are those at the end of February. The figures at the end of February show that banks were approximately R7 million or R8 million above their credit limit. However, hon. members say that the banks were R140 million above their credit limit. I have simply made decent people of them now.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Cape Town Gardens apparently realized that his colleagues were making no impression with their arguments, and then decided to try to make an impression by the harshness of his language. We have heard many Jeremiahs in this House, but I have never heard a bigger Jeremiah than the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens. The hon. member for Parktown can also act like a Jeremiah sometimes, but possesses the exceptional gift of singing the Lamentations of Jeremiah to the tune of the Song of Solomon. However, the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens is a worse Jeremiah than Jeremiah himself. Just listen to his words, and this was the crux of his argument: &#x201C;The economy reduced to an almost all-time low; the man in the street suffering; the harsh implementation of tax policies; the high and almost uncontrollable cost-of-living; the economy in its disastrous state; chaos and crisis.&#x201D; This is the language that was used by the hon. member. It was no analysis, but an attempt at gathering together the most unbridled and wild language one can use in order to abuse this Budget. Apparently the hon. member knew that he had no arguments to use in the Budget debate. For this reason he resorted to the use of harsh, sharp and unbridled language. I want to say to him too what Horatio said to Hamlet : &#x201C;Wild and whirling words.&#x201D; However, the hon. member did touch upon one point of which one should perhaps take note. The hon. member charged me with having made certain statements about motor-cars at five minutes past three in my Budget speech, while the Stock Exchange closed only at 3.30 p.m. He spoke of a &#x201C;severe error of judgment&#x201D;. It was therefore a tremendous mistake I had made by announcing something about motor-cars at <span class="col_5055-5056" refersTo="page_0991"/>3.05, while the Stock Exchange closed only at 3.30. Does the hon. member not know that the purpose of keeping a Budget secret is that unauthorized persons should not obtain information before others so as to derive benefit from it for themselves&#x003F; In this case the Budget was broadcast. It was broadcast in both English and Afrikaans throughout the length and breadth of the country, so that the same information was made available to everyone in the country simultaneously. Nobody was given any undue advantage by it. I think the only way of satisfying the hon. member would have been to close the Stock Exchange on that day. I must say I have never heard of any necessity that the Stock Exchange should close on the day the Budget is presented.</p>

<p>I now come to my hon. friend, the member for Pinetown. He did not provide much clarity either. On the contrary; as always, the hon. member asked the usual questions. The first question he asked was in regard to participation bonds. He said:</p>

<block name="quote">Does the Minister know how much is invested in participation bonds and what the time period for these bonds is&#x003F; What is the position when one of the participants with, say, R4 000 takes in its stead R100 000 and wants to draw his money&#x003F;</block>

<p>I can inform the hon. member that in 1971 participation bonds increased by an amount of R173 million to a total of R686 million. The periods of these bonds vary, but in most cases the period is three years, with the possibility of an extention.</p>

<p>In this regard I also want to provide some clarity about questions put by the hon. member for Green Point, and I want to do so by just emphasizing the following facts. The maximum rate of 8&#x00BD; per cent which was announced does not include the service fee of the managing company. In other words, the company may charge a service fee of more than 8&#x00BD; per cent. The maximum of 8&#x00BD; per cent applies only to new bonds. If a participant claims his money in an existing participation bond and his share is transferred to another person, the maximum is not applicable.</p>

<p>In the third place, hon. members know that deposits at banks are sometimes subject to withdrawal within a particular period after notice has been given by the depositor. Such notice may be given at any time. For the purpose of interest rate control it is deemed that in all such cases notice was given on 29th March, 1972, so that the deposit contract is terminated after the expiration of the notice period. Therefore, if the deposits are retained at the bank concerned after this date, i.e. after the expiration of the period of notice, the maximum rates of interest are applicable. Participation bonds, however, are dealt with differently. Investments in such bonds are usually for a period of three years, after which the investor may give notice for the purpose of claiming his money. But in this case it is not deemed that notice was given on 29th March. As long as the participation bond is maintained, the interest rate may be maintained.</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. the Minister a question&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to the hon. member&#x2019;s problems now. The hon. member for Green Point said the following (Hansard, 14th April, 1972, page C2)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There are some R200 million to R300 million invested in participation bonds which have already elapsed the initial fixed period and merely continue to be operative by mutual agreement between the mortgagor and the mortgagee. What is the position in regard to these bonds&#x003F;</block>

<p>My reply to the hon. member is as I read out a moment ago; the existing rate of interest rate is maintained as long as the bond is maintained. The hon. member also expressed his concern about another aspect. He said (Hansard, 14th April, 1972, page C2 (a))&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Township developers are dependent almost entirely on participation bonds for financing the early stages of the development of a township, i.e. before the township has been proclaimed, to provide for services. It would be a tragic state of affairs if these persons are now to be left to look for money on the grey market for the establishment of townships.</block>

<p>In my opinion&#x2014;and I think the hon. member will agree with me&#x2014;tackling a project of this nature, such as a township, before the necessary capital is available to complete it is a very unhealthy way of financing. The Registrar of Financial Institutions has repeatedly warned against this practice. I want to say, however, that with <span class="col_5057-5058" refersTo="page_0992"/>the present more relaxed tendency in respect of interest rates, especially as we expect the position will be in future, it is not at all out of the question that it will be possible to obtain the necessary funds on the public market at 8&#x00BD; per cent. In order to reassure the hon. member, I also want to say this: The Registrar of Financial Institutions is at present conducting discussions with the various trust companies and all interested parties about this type of bond. All the problems which have arisen in that regard will be examined thoroughly now. We shall see to it that this scheme runs as smoothly as possible and with the least trouble.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>There is one further point which the hon. the Minister has not dealt with. Will a bond agreed to on 29th March but not yet registered be permitted to go through without the 8&#x00BD; per cent restriction, or is this a matter which will be dealt with in the discussions that will take place&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>This is one of the matters which will be discussed now by the trust companies and the Registrar of Financial Institutions.</p>

<p>A great deal has been said about the grey market and the black market. We are all inclined to speak in very condemnatory terms of the grey market and the black market, but I think we should realize that the grey market also has a purpose in the country, and that we cannot condemn it completely. The grey market is the borrowing of money between company and company, between individual and individual or between individual and company. Often those loans serve a very good purpose. It is only when the grey market assumes proportions that render the monetary control of the authorities powerless that it becomes dangerous. Hon. members will know that a grey market of that nature exists mainly where banks lend themselves to providing a guarantee in respect of loans between lender and borrower. We are investigating the matter, at the momnet so as, if need be perhaps to introduce legislation before the end of the session in order to prohibit that guarantee by a bank.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point also asked a question in regard to transfer duties. He asked whether I should not reduce transfer duties in respect of houses under R15 000. The hon. member has repeatedly put this question in different forms in the past. I can give him the assurance that we have often investigated these problems and that we have looked at them very sympathetically, but I regret to say that I have not yet been able to find a way of meeting that, because of the large amounts I would have to sacrifice as a result of it. If the economy develops as we hope it will in the coming years, it will perhaps become easier to do something like this.</p>

<p>I come now to Land Bank debentures. Hon. members will know that in the third report of the commission of inquiry on fiscal and monetary policy the opinion was expressed that for the purposes of the Bank Act the definition of liquid assets should be narrowed down. This matter is at present enjoying the attention of the Technical Committee on Banks and Building Societies. It has come to my attention that the resultant uncertainty is having a very unfavourable effect on the marketability of short-term debentures issued by the Land Bank and which at present qualify as liquid assets. On this occasion I want to make it very clear that the Government has not yet decided about this matter and that, no matter what is decided eventually, existing obligations issued by the Land Bank as well as any later obligations issued by the Land Bank will continue to qualify as liquid assets until the expiry date, until it has been decided what will be done.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinetown asked me about foreign investments in South Africa.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I just want to tell the hon. member that foreign investment in South Africa will be as welcome as ever. The hon. member will recall that in my Budget speech I mentioned that last year we had a considerable inflow of foreign capital, more than R700 million. By far the greater part of those investments has been in respect of private, permanent capital. This Government has always welcomed the investment of foreign moneys in this country, not only because we need those investments for quicker growth, but because of the knowhow which usually accompanies these funds, and because of the contacts which such foreign investments bring to South Africa. I think it was the hon. member for Gardens who said that &#x201C;nothing that has been done is likely to create overseas investment in this country on a long-term basis&#x201D;. The statement I have just made, and which I <span class="col_5059-5060" refersTo="page_0993"/>also made last year, namely that in one of the most difficult years of our history in the financial sphere we attracted a large amount of foreign capital, shows that the hon. member is completely wrong in what he says.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Pinetown also raised a very interesting matter, i.e. in connection with international relations. The hon. member asked me whether I expected that there would be clarity and stability in the international sphere. This was his question (Hansard manuscript, 10th April, 1972, p. JJ3)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Does the Minister regard the present position as fixed, or does he think that the realignment of currencies is temporary&#x003F; Does he anticipate another international monetary conference similar to the Bretton Woods conference&#x003F;</block>

<p>I am sorry to have to say to the hon. member that in my opinion no lasting solution has yet been found in respect of the international monetary problems. In spite of the &#x201C;realignment of currencies&#x201D;, the Smithsonian Agreement made in Washington last December, it is clear to me that no calm and peace has yet been achieved in the monetary sphere. I will not say that there will be a crisis in the monetary sphere this year. This year the most important event in the international sphere is apparently the election of the American President. Before the election of the American President, America, at any rate, will do everything in its power to avert a monetary crisis. What is going to happen early next year nobody can predict, but as far as I am concerned, I find that the monetary future is not very clear. The most important problems in this sphere are the problems of what should take the place of the dollar, the problem of the convertibility of the dollar, the problem of the position of gold in the international monetary system, and the problem of the short-term commitments of 50-60 million dollars which America has towards the rest of the world. No solution has yet been found to these problems. Hon. members have probably noticed that only recently there was talk that SDRs should take the place of the dollar, because the dollar would no longer be accepted in future as the actual means of payment as it was in the past, and that something should be found in place of the dollar. Many experts think that SDRs&#x2014;paper gold&#x2014;should take the place of the dollar. But there are also many who rightly believe that SDRs are still an unproved means, that they have not yet withstood the test of time, that they have not yet inspired confidence and that it would be wrong to put SDRs in the place of the dollar at this stage. There is the problem of the future of gold. Hon. members have probably noticed that recently the message came from official circles in America that America may consider putting its $10 billion in gold on the open market, as a result of which the price of gold on the free market would be completely upset. My personal opinion in this regard is that we need not be afraid of this. After all, the American Government is a responsible one and I cannot believe for one moment that it would commit such an irresponsible act. If, for monetary reasons, the American Government thought it no longer needed that $10 billion of gold, I think it would find in future that it in fact needed that gold for military and stategic reasons. I do not think the American Government would consider selling its gold, because it must take into account the views of other countries, the countries of Western Europe, and I cannot imagine the countries of Western Europe tolerating something like that. There are still many problems in the international sphere. The hon. member asked me whether a conference such as the Bretton Woods one would be held again. I do not think another one like that will be held soon. Big conferences, at which 120 countries are represented, never solve problems. Problems of this nature are solved only by smaller groups, and big conferences are than requested to endorse these solutions. The hon. member probably knows too that there are moves afoot in this sphere; that there are moves to establish a new body larger than the Group of Ten, but smaller than the one America in particular is striving to establish. The hon. member knows that the Group of Ten is composed of the 10 richest countries in the world, mostly European countries and including Japan, America and Canada. In recent years this Group of Ten has played a tremendous part in international monetary politics, but apparently America is not completely satisfied with the actions and influence of these Ten and is seeking to have a group of, say 20 people formed, who would probably be governors of the International Monetary Fund, in order to do the preparatory work for an international monetary <span class="col_5061-5062" refersTo="page_0994"/>structure. I do not think a solution has been found for the world&#x2019;s monetary problems, but nor do I think that a crisis will come this year.</p>

<p>I conclude, Sir, by saying that the Budget I introduced two weeks ago should be seen against the background of the past year. The past year was one of the most difficult years we have experienced in South Africa in recent times, a difficult time not only nationally, but also internationally. Every country in the world experienced those difficulties in the monetary and financial pheres. At present we have a different climate, a climate of new confidence, both domestically and abroad. A new spirit is discernible in the economy of South Africa. The fact that we have such wonderful surpluses on our balance of payments account week a ter week and that our reserves are steadily increasing every day, has brought new life and a new optimism into the South African economy. We are entering the year ahead with great optimism. But I want to warn that, while we believe that we are approaching a year of prosperity, we should not be too greedy, that we should not want to demand all the prosperity immediately, that we should not hasten the harvest, but that we should build carefully on firm ground and build solidly at the prosperity of the future. The position is such that there are signs of much better times. We on this side have confidence in the future of our economy, and we hope that side will help us to strengthen that confidence among our people.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit the definition of deviate child (vi): to insert the following definition to follow the definition of governing body (ix):</block>

<block name="quote">(ix) &#x201C;handicapped child&#x201D; means a Coloured person between the ages of three and twenty-three years who, in the opinion of the Secretary, is capable of deriving appreciable benefit from a suitable course of education, but deviates to such an extent from the majority of persons of his age in body, mind or behaviour that he&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) cannot derive sufficient benefit from the instruction normally provided in the ordinary course of education; or</li>

<li>(b) requires special education in order to facilitate his adaptation to the community; or</li>

<li>(c) should not attend an ordinary class in an ordinary school, because such attendance may be harmful to himself or to the other pupils in such class; (ii)</li>

</ol>

<p>and in lines 28 and 34, page 5, respectively, to omit &#x201C;deviate&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;handicapped&#x201D;.</p>

<p>In his reply to the Second Reading debate the hon. the Minister indicated as a result of my appeal to him that he would look into the provision which deals with deviate children and if necessary, that the word &#x201C;deviate&#x201D; would be substituted by the word &#x201C;handicapped&#x201D;. In view of the fact that the term &#x201C;handicapped&#x201D; has been accepted in the Coloured Persons Education Act, and also in the Indian Education Act, and because it has a better connotation than the term &#x201C;deviate&#x201D;, I would like to urge the hon. the Minister to accept this amendment. I do so because I believe that the word &#x201C;deviate&#x201D; can be defined as &#x201C;turning aside from the right way&#x201D;. It could have a meaning not intended in so far as children who may be mentally or physically handicapped are concerned.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 17, after &#x201C;schools&#x201D;, where it occurs for the second time, to insert &#x201C;agricultural schools&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I made this point in my Second Reading speech and I made it advisedly because the definition of &#x201C;schools&#x201D;, as I pointed out on Friday, in terms of Act 47 of 1963, which deals with Coloured pupils in the Republic, specifically incorporates agricultural schools. As the hon. the Minister knows there is already an experimental farm in the Rehoboth Gebied for pupils who want to be instructed in agriculture. To omit it from this clause is a great pity, particularly in view of the fact that South-West Africa as a territory is perhaps more suitable for this type of school than almost any other area that I can think of. On those grounds I move these amendments.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I accept your ruling completely, but the hon. the Minister was kind enough to say, in reply to the Second Reading, that he would give this matter his consideration in due course, and I would like to think that he will do that.</p>

<p>Sir, as the clause reads here it states &#x201C;The Minister may &#x2026; establish, erect and maintain training colleges, training schools, high schools, secondary schools, primary schools, vocational schools, special schools and homes&#x201D;. Personally, I think that if one takes, for instance the matter of technical schools, I think that if there is a dire need among the Coloured community, it is for technical education and for technical schools. My experience of the Coloured people has taught me that above all else, if I can give them technical schools throughout the country, it will mean a tremendous amount to them. So, I take the view that I do have the power to introduce courses for any kind of schooling under clause 27, as you will see. I take the view that I can introduce courses for agricultural training and also for technical training at any school in South-West Africa. That is the reason why I feel that in view especially of the ruling of the hon. Chairman, we can leave this matter as it is for the time being.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am very glad to have this assurance from the hon. the Minister. But I wonder whether he would not go a little further and take this Committee into his confidence. This matter of agricultural schools, and even technical schools, as he himself points out, is something which is most important. Surely, Sir, the whole object of the education of these people in South-West Africa is to educate them in some field which they can use, in some sphere in which they can make a living and be useful to their own people and to their country, and of course to their own territory of South-West Africa. Now, Sir, the hon. the Minister is quite right. In terms of clause 27 he does have the power to institute any &#x201C;course&#x201D; in any Government school. But surely, Sir, when it comes to technical and to agricultural schools, these are specialized institutions. These are institutions which require special facilities which cannot be instituted merely as a &#x201C;course&#x201D; in an established school. Now, Sir, the hon. the Minister did, in the course of his reply to the Second Reading debate, indicate that he would give his consideration to this matter. As I said, Sir, I wonder whether the hon. the Minister would take us into his confidence this afternoon and give us some indication of whether he will at least consider this and if necessary move an amendment in the Other Place. Because I feel, Sir, that what we need and what we are asking for here is something more than just a course at a school. We are asking for a school with the proper facilities for carrying out this agricultural training.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I accept the ruling on the amendment of the hon. member for Wynberg in connection with this particular amendment. But does that not mean, however, that if the amendment of the hon. member broadens the scope of the Bill, that the Minister does not have the power that we hope he does have, and which he claims to have under the clause as it stands. If he does not have that power, does it not make it more necessary than ever that he should, in the Other Place, give consideration to seeking an instruction whereby he can extend <span class="col_5067-5068" refersTo="page_0997"/>the scope of the Bill to give him that particular power&#x003F;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 32, after &#x201C;time&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;after consultation with the school board or school committee or other body established in terms of section 34 (1) of this Act.&#x201D;</block>

<p>If this amendment is accepted it will mean that the Minister may at any time, after consultation with the school boards or school committees, close or disestablish any State school or any hostel, teachers&#x2019; quarters, school clinic or other accessories used in connection with a State school. I believe that this amendment is a very reasonable one and that it will go a long way in cultivating good relations between the local Coloured communities in South-West Africa and the hon. the Minister and his department. South-West Africa is a very long way from Pretoria and Cape Town. I know for a fact that thousands of people in Pretoria and Cape Town have never even had the opportunity of visiting South-West Africa. According to what we have accepted already, the hon. the Minister will have all the control. When it comes to such an important matter to a local community as a decision to close a school, I think there must at all times be consultation with the local people. We know that in terms of clause 34 there will be the school boards and school committees which will have certain powers and duties. But if we accept clause 3 as it stands, we will then, of course, deprive these people of having any real power. The degree of success of cultivating a feeling of involvement of the local community in the affairs of their schools, will never be achieved if this subsection is not amended.</p>

<p>*I believe that it is, after all, the ultimate object for the local community, or peoples, to manage their own education. If we were to provide here that such a school may simply be closed without prior consultation with the school board or the school committee, we would be looking for trouble. In this clause it is laid down that the Minister, in consultation with the Minister of Finance, may establish certain schools. I accept that as far as the establishment of schools is concerned, the Minister will naturally receive certain representations from the local community beforehand and that, when he proceeds to establish a school, contact will, in fact, be made with the various local communities. However, when it comes to the closing of a school, the hon. the Minister must admit that these people may feel that their feelings have not been taken into consideration. All of us would like to see that when the provisions of this measure are implemented in practice, there should or may never be any reason for people to feel that they have been overlooked in the process. I sincerely hope that the hon. the Minister will be able to accept this amendment. In the normal course of events one could have asked the Minister to consult the Coloured Advisory Council on education, but in the whole of this legislation there is no reference whatsoever to the advisory council on education, although reference is made to school boards and school committees. I also have to remind hon. members that as far as White education is concerned, particularly in the provinces where we have school boards, the department will, after all, never close a school without consulting the local inhabitants on the matter. The hon. the Minister may now argue that he is not in a position to contact these people every time this happens. However, he will appreciate that, in terms of this legislation, he is not expected to do everything himself. All the powers contained in clause 3 are powers the Minister may delegate. This is indicated under other clauses. At this stage I should like to hear from the Minister how he feels about this matter.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_coloured_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there are very few schools in South-West Africa as it is&#x2014;why then would I close schools left, right and centre&#x003F; I should much prefer to have more schools there. If one wants to convert-State-aided schools into State schools, adequate provision is being made in the Bill as it reads at present for all the people concerned to be duly consulted and to come to an agreement with them. I now want to say that I am not bent on closing schools. Must one have advisory committees for everything one wants to do&#x003F; After all, we will consult the school committee. In any case, there is no provision in the Act for school boards, as the amendment of the hon. member reads at present. The hon. member talks about regional councils or something of that nature. We <span class="col_5069-5070" refersTo="page_0998"/>can go into the matter but it really amounts to the function a school board fulfils. However, the Act does not mention &#x201C;school boards&#x201D;. Neither are we going to introduce this as such. It is not our intention to introduce this at this stage, although provision has been made for some kind of overall council apart from the school committee to enable the parents and the communities to play their part in the education of their own people. But I want to say that there may be reasons in future for my wanting to close a school. I may just mention that the parents of that national group need not be afraid at all that we are now going to close some of the schools.</p>

<p>The argument hon. members repeatedly advanced, i.e. that Pretoria was supposed to be such a long way from South-West Africa, simply does not apply. Apparently hon. members have been unaware of the fact that Pretoria has been such a long way from South-West Africa for the last three years. This they discovered for the first time on Friday. It is not our intention now to start undermining the education system in South-West Africa. I am therefore not prepared to accept the amendment moved by the hon. member, because situations may arise in which something of this nature might be necessary. However, I have no desire to close schools left, right and centre. If a school is closed in South-West Africa, it will be closed for very sound reasons, and the school committee will be consulted. There is not doubt about that. But why should I write this into the Act&#x003F; As a matter of fact, I had another look at the Bill. I do not know whether this can do any harm. I may just as well accept the amendment moved by the hon. member for Wynberg and write &#x201C;agriclutural schools&#x201D; into the Bill here. But I just want to say that this is not going to become a real issue. When opposing this measure the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and other hon. members wanted to know why there were three Bills&#x003F; At that time it was opposed on account of the fact that there was only a handful of children in respect of whom this mass of legislation was necessary. I told hon. members why. Now hon. members want to go further. I say that we are going to offer these people a choice of subjects. This we are trying to do at one or two places. This is the need there is in South-West Africa. I will accept it, but it will not be necessary for a long time, just as there are other unnecessary provisions on the Statute Book.</p>

<p>Oh, I beg your pardon. In other words, it is my intention to introduce subjects which are of value to those people, subjects such as agricultural training and certain technical subjects, which will be of enormous value to them. This we will introduce as and when high schools are established for those people there. But hon. members know there is only one high school for this national group in the whole of South-West Africa. In other words, one has to be realistic and practical. The agricultural schools have been dropped, and I accept it as such. As far as the other amendment is concerned, I want to give the assurance that, when we want to close a school, we shall consult the committee. Furthermore, we are not bent on closing schools. I am afraid this is my point of view, and hon. members are free to argue about it further if they want to do so.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. M. STEPHENS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I must say we appreciate the attitude adopted by the hon. the Minister in connection with the amendment of the hon. member for Wynberg. Even if it is out of order, I am sure that he&#x2014;since he accepts the principle of it&#x2014;will make the necessary arrangements in the Other Place. However, there is one other point I should like to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister. The hon. the Minister said that he was not going to close schools in South-West Africa left, right and centre. We accept that the hon. the Minister is not going to do this; as a matter of fact, he is going to establish a great number of schools but we must remember that this legislation does not exist only for the present time; it is going to be in existence for a long time and during that time many schools will probably be closed while others will be established. What we have in mind, is therefore not only those schools which exist in South-West Africa at the moment; other schools are going to be established. We believe that this legislation is going to apply for a long time, and during that time it may happen that schools, which are going to be established, will be disestablished.</p>

<p>It may even be decided at this stage to remove a school from one community to another because it may not have the best possible situation. We feel that those <span class="col_5071-5072" refersTo="page_0999"/>people have a real interest in this; they have an &#x201C;established interest&#x201D; in the schools which have already been established. This is not so in the case of a school which has not been established yet, but once a school is established, it becomes an amenity which such a community has. For that reason such a school is of far greater importance once it has been established. For that reason we feel that this amendment should be written into the Bill because these powers are not powers the Minister is necessarily going to give effect to himself. These are powers he is going to delegate. The hon. the Minister gives us the assurance that such a community will, in fact, be consulted, but it is possible in future, when this legislation is still in force, that there may be other people to whom these powers have been delegated, people who are not going to consult such a community, because in terms of the legislation these people are not compelled to consult those communities. For that reason we prefer that this amendment be placed on the Statute Book so that this consultation must take place with the body established in terms of clause 34 (1) before a school may be closed.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I really cannot understand the objections raised by those hon. members. The department which is going to be responsible for this education will, after all, establish schools for the benefit and well-being of these people; they are not bent on closing schools. Apparently those hon. members are afraid that our Minister, or Ministers which may come in future, will act in an irresponsible manner, but who should be able to bear greater responsibility in our political set-up than, in fact, the Minister&#x003F; In my long career in education I know of not one single case where an education department or a Minister has acted in such an irresponsible manner as to close a school without consulting the community concerned. There are even small farm schools, the existence of which can no longer be justified, but which continued to exist until it became impossible to keep them going, simply because the communities concerned did not want to close those schools. There has always been consultation with those communities. I do not doubt that when something of this nature has to be done, this department will consult the communities concerned. I must say I do not believe that this will happen unless there are very sound reasons. As was said by that hon. member opposite a moment ago, it may be necessary for a school to be removed. Large sums of money are spent on the construction of a school and to establish its facilities, and a decision to remove such school will not be taken very lightly. As was said by the hon. member, the whole of the department would be involved. In other words, the Minister acts on advice he receives from his department in this respect. Sir, I cannot believe that the hon. members opposite are serious when they raise this objection. Neither do I see any danger in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s having the power to close schools.</p>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister said that I had referred to school boards. I just want to remind him that it is clearly laid down in clause 34 that &#x201C;the Minister may in the manner prescribed by regulation establish for any such school or schools a board, committee or other body&#x201D;. Sir, what is at issue here, is not only the closing of schools. I want to draw his attention to the fact that it also deals with the equipment and school clinics. We are grateful to learn from the hon. the Minister that he will personally see to it that, when a school has to be closed, consultation will take place first, because he admits that consultation is desirable. I therefore cannot see why he is not prepared to have it written into this legislation. After all, no school or hostel or clinic will be closed without consultation first taking place. The hon. member for Karas also said that he could not imagine that a school would be closed without consultation first taking place. If it is desirable that there should be consultation, it is all the more reason why it should be laid down in the Bill that consultation has to take place. Then these boards or bodies will know that they will, in fact, be consulted. It is no use one&#x2019;s doing the correct thing 99 times out of 100 by having voluntary consultation if, in the hundredth case because one is not compelled to consult, one overlooks the local people and does not consult them. Because of that one act all the good faith that has been built up over the years is destroyed completely. It is specifically for this reason that I say that it should be clearly laid down in the Act that whatever the hon. the Minister, by implication, has regarded as desirable, will be done at all times.</p>

<p>The present Ordinance, unless it was amended after 1962, lays down in the section dealing with the closing of schools that the Administrator may close any of the abovementioned schools if he is satisfied that the school is no longer necessary, &#x201C;provided that, before closing a school, the school committee has to be consulted&#x201D;. To me this does not seem to be unreasonable. I do not think any Minister will summarily close a school; this goes without saying, but it may be that a misunderstanding arises between the people who have the power and, perhaps, the good intentions, and the local people. The local people may have certain information in regard to local circumstances which the Administrator or, in this case, the Minister, or his officials overlooks. It does not seem to me to be an unreasonable request that specific provision should be made for consultation before a school is closed. It does not mean that there should necessarily be agreement.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_coloured_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>The standpoint I adopted was based on the fact that it is, after all, obvious that a Minister, who is in charge of a department, will not close a school until he has examined all the reasons pertaining to it. If any school at any place in South Africa is to be closed, there will be reasons why this must be done, and usually these are not reasons which have arisen overnight; it is usually reasons which have arisen over a number of years. The whole question is discussed and debated. By that time the inspector of schools would most probably often have mentioned the matter to his departmental chief in the reports he submitted to him because it affects both the children and the staff. As far as hostels and clinics, and so forth, are concerned, it affects a wider field when a school is ultimately closed. When a school is closed the whole procedure of consultation, negotiations, reports, investigations and reinvestigations has been gone through and it is done for obvious reasons. For that reason I was of the opinion&#x2014;and I am still of the opinion&#x2014;that it is superfluous to write into the Act what is being proposed in the amendment. I should not like not to include in this Bill something which, in the case of the Ordinance, probably was some kind of protection or whatever it was, and in view of what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout quoted from the Ordinance a moment ago, I give the assurance that I shall go into the Ordinance as far as this point is concerned and to investigate the matter further. The hon. member will not know whether I am really going to do this, but I shall seriously consider introducing such an amendment in the Other Place. I do not know whether this will satisfy the hon. member, because he has no assurance that I am in fact going to do this, but in view of what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout quoted here, I shall consider this matter favourably. However, I should like to go into this matter first to see what the provisions of the Ordinance are.</p>

<p>Sir, in view of this, I should like to submit a further aspect for the consideration of the hon. the Minister. We are dealing here with Coloured schools, and we know from experience that one often finds that improper political pressure, or let me rather say, political pressure, if not always improper, is being brought to bear by a White community for the removal or closing of a Coloured school in its vicinity. In view of this I think it would be a good thing if we could have a provision in the Act to compel the White authority to consult those people who are affected. It would not be the Minister who is to be blamed for this, but there may be local pressure on the part of the White people, and under these circumstances I feel that such a provision should rather be written into the Act.</p>

<p>This clause deals with the transfer of management and control of State-aided schools to the department. I just want to avail myself of this opportunity to thank the hon. the Minister for clearly having learned from the mistakes of his predecessor. We find here, for example, that the Minister may take over such a school &#x201C;in consultation with the Minister of Finance and after negotiation and agreement with the governing body of a State-aided school, by notice in the <i>Gazette&#x201D;.</i> The fact remains that the words &#x201C;in consultation with the Minister of Finance and after negotiation and agreement with the governing body of a State-aided school&#x201D; have been inserted in this clause, and this is something which his predecessor, the present Minister of Defence, refused to accept in 1963. All I want to say is that I am grateful that it has now been included in the legislation.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to move an amendment to this clause.</p>

<p>&#x2020;This clause deals with the transfer of persons employed in State-aided schools to the service of the department in the event of the transfer of such schools. I wish to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To add the following proviso at the end of the Clause :</block>

<block name="quote">Provided that no reduction in the emoluments or diminution of privileges or change in conditions of service of such persons shall be made without his consent.</block>

<p>* I take it that the hon. the Minister is going to draw my attention to the fact that in terms of clause 5 there is going to be negotiation and agreement with the governing body of such schools before the transfer takes place. Therefore he will say that those governing bodies would most certainly have paid attention to the matter and would most certainly not allow their teachers to be sacrificed in the process. I accept that argument, but I should like to remind the hon. the Minister of the <span class="col_5077-5078" refersTo="page_1002"/>fact that it is not quite unheard of for a teacher to be sacrificed by a governing body. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that the only guarantee the teacher has must be what is contained here in clause 12. If he has been done an injustice there must be something to which he can have recourse. He cannot have recourse to his previous governing body. He must be able to turn to the Bill for protection. I say this particularly in view of the fact that although further clauses, such as clause 13, for example specifically refer to the conditions of service of persons who are transferred, the only guarantee is in respect of vacational and medical allowances. This clause provides that the Minister will have to decide at which notch on the salary scale such a person shall be remunerated. It is with this in view that I refer to the person&#x2019;s emoluments and argue that it should be likewise guaranteed and should not be reduced without his consent.</p>

<p>I know that the hon. the Minister will reply that this was done three years ago and ask what the use of such an amendment would be. If a person was wronged three years ago and we now afford the Minister the opportunity to right that wrong by invoking the provisions of this amendment, I think we shall have achieved something worthwhile.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not know whether it is necessary to accept that amendment. This clause covers the case of a person going from a State-aided school to a State school. The persons in the establishment of such a school are then transferred to the establishment of the department and in terms of the provisions of the Bill they are deemed to have been appointed on the date on which the State-aided school changed into a State school. I notice that clause 19 provides, <i>inter alia,</i> as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any person &#x2026; occupying a post included in the establishment of a State school or a State-aided school may &#x2026; be transferred to any &#x2026; institution whether established under this Act or any other law.</block>

<p>Then it goes on to provide that the transfer shall not be made without the person&#x2019;s consent, and so on. I want to point out that the hon. member did not make any of these amendments available to me beforehand; I have only now received them across the floor of the House. I notice that this amendment includes the following proviso&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Provided that no reduction in the emoluments or diminution of privileges or change in conditions of service of such persons shall be made without his consent.</block>

<p>But it is provided in clause 19 (2) that no such transfer shall be made without the consent of the person concerned. I have not had the opportunity to ascertain whether such a transfer may be covered by the provisions of clause 19 (2), but I can go into the matter. If it is the intention that clause 19 (2) should also cover that kind of transfer, namely transfers from the establishment of a State-aided school to a State school, the amendment is not necessary. If clause 19 (2) only refers to transfer from other activities, this can be the case, but it seems to me that clause 19 (2) refers to teachers serving in Baster schools and then transferred to Coloured schools, where their services are needed most, and vice versa. It is also possible that clause 19 (2) may only refer to transfer from State-aided schools to State schools. I should like to go into these aspects. For the rest it seems to me, on the face of it that there can be no harm in the amendment. However, the position is that one does not want to write a lot of unnecessary provisos into a Bill. If it is necessary we shall insert it.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we deal here with a clause which provides that any person who is in the employ of a school on the dates the hon. the Minister <span class="col_5079-5080" refersTo="page_1003"/>and his department take over the control of that school, &#x201C;shall be transferred to the service of the Department and shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be deemed to have been appointed in terms of the provisions of the said Act to such post on that date&#x201D;. This is all very well. We have had a discussion on the question of whether these conditions of service will be the same or otherwise. The hon. the Minister has given the undertaking to the effect that he will look into this matter and if it is not covered by the other clauses he will move such an amendment in the Other Place. However, one aspect of this has not been taken care of. That is, what about the attitude of the person concerned&#x003F; The person about whom we are talking now is a teacher or an administrative officer in the school. As far as I can see, mo provision has been made in this Bill for the will or the wish of the person concerned to be considered. At the moment he is in the employ of the Administration of South-West Africa and here, by a stroke of a pen, we are being asked to transfer him or to give the Minister the power simply by taking over the administration of the school, to transfer him, whether or not he wishes it, to the employ of another department. Surely the wishes and the feelings of the official or the teacher concerned should be taken into consideration.</p>

<p>Well, I will not tie this only to the hon. member for Carletonville, because he says that other hon. members too say that it is utter nonsense. I want to remind them of a debate which took place in this House last year. There we debated the Bantu Affairs Administration Bill. We debated this very question; whether a person can be transferred from one department to another without his consent, at great length. For the benefit of the hon. member for Carletonville, and the other members who say this is nonsense, I want to say that the hon. Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, in his wisdom, finally acceded to our wish and that that amendment was included in the Bill. Today it stands in the Act and I would like to remind him by reading the wording of the Act as it reads today. I quote section 10 (1) of the Bantu Affairs Administration Act, Act No. 45 of 1971&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The work incidental to the performance by a board of its functions shall be performed at its expense and under its direction and control by&#x2014;</block>

<block name="quote">(a) persons in the service of a local authority who may by arrangement with such local authority be seconded, with their consent, or in terms of subsection (5), to the service of the board &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is the important thing&#x2014;they may only be seconded with their consent. We have a parallel, Sir, in legislation which we debated last year, the Public Service Amendment Act, where provision was made for the transfer of officers to the service of Bantu authorities. Again, Sir, this was done with the consent of the officer concerned. Why should it be any different here&#x003F; Why should we not take the feelings of the official concerned into consideration&#x003F; I feel that it is only fair that we should do this. I maintain that it is in the interests of the hon. the Minister and his department that we should take the feelings of the officer concerned into consideration. Of what use is it his having in his department a number of press-ganged officials, officials who have been press-ganged into working for him, who have not been given the opportunity of saying &#x201C;yea&#x201D; or &#x201C;nay&#x201D;; that they wish, or do not wish, to work for his department&#x003F; Sir, in all seriousness, I think the hon. the Minister must consider the following amendment, which I now move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 4, to omit &#x201C;shall&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;may with his consent&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Sir, I feel that this is only reasonable: I have given two precedents of what was accepted during the Committee Stage last year, and I urge the hon. the Minister &#x2026;</p>

He is covered by the terms of his employment in terms of his contract with the Administration of South-West Africa. He is covered in that way and he remains an employee of the Administration not an employee of the department of the hon. the Minister.</p>

<speech by="#brandt">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. BRANDT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it seems as if the hon. member, and other hon. members opposite, now want to create difficulties for the administration of this legislation, or actually, in my opinion, to make it impossible. You can imagine a similar position if one should work for a public company, say, in Johannesburg or Pietermaritzburg, and that company is taken over and then becomes a subsidiary company of another company. One&#x2019;s position and one&#x2019;s activities, however, remain unchanged. What really takes place here is a change of the overhead control.</p>

<p>&#x2020; An overhead change has taken place. It does not affect the individual or his work, he is still a teacher in a department. Why the hon. member requires him to give his consent, I cannot understand. No company holding a position of overall authority over other companies will go and ask the consent of the employee of that same company as to whether or not that take-over should take place, or whether or not they would like to continue their duties with the company. I think the whole idea is just silly.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_coloured_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wonder whether the hon. member understands the position correctly; I do not think so. We are dealing here with State-aided schools. They are the schools which were started in South-West Africa by the missionary societies. The missionary societies are controlling and running those schools. They appoint and discharge the teachers. But we pay the salaries of those teachers as well as of all the teachers in the State schools.</p>

<p>Now, this Act makes provision&#x2014;and we have been praised for this by the hon. member for Durban Central&#x2014;that the takeover of these State-aided schools can be effected after negotiation and agreement. This clause simply states that after these negotiations have taken place and an agreement has been reached, a State-aided school, call it a mission school, now becomes a State school. The teachers are transferred and they are then deemed, under this clause, to have been appointed to the establishment of my department. That is all there is in this provision. I think the hon. member is proposing a completely unnecessary amendment. What is more, he is not doing those teachers a service, and he is arguing on a false basis. Those teachers are not changing over from the South-West Africa Administration to my department. They are coming over from what we can perhaps call &#x201C;private schools&#x201D; to my department. This will only happen after consultation and with their agreement. This will happen in most cases, if not in all, where those societies, churches, or call them what you will, find themselves, owing to financial circumstances, unable to continue running a certain school. They then come to us and after an agreement has been reached, we take over and such a school becomes a State school. Everybody then comes over to the department. If they do not want to come over, they are at liberty not to do so. This amendment of the hon. member is therefore superfluous.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to ask the hon. the Minister a question. The Minister will remember that during the Second Reading debate I raised the point that we may find ourselves in a situation in which it will be desirable to bring about parity in the salaries of the various population groups and their teachers in South-West. For that reason we felt that it was better to keep the arrangement as it was. I am not dropping the argument, but I want to ask the Minister whether I am reading this clause correctly when I say that it is nevertheless in his power to make a separate arrangement, in this case for the Coloured people <span class="col_5083-5084" refersTo="page_1005"/>in South-West Africa, if he should wish to do so.</p>

<p>As the clause now stands, it is within the power of the Minister to make a different arrangement in South-West, as far as salaries are concerned, from that which is applicable to Coloured teachers in the Republic&#x003F; Does he have that power to make a different arrangement for South-West, as far as salaries of teachers are concerned, if circumstances should require it&#x003F; Or is the Minister tied down to the arrangement that what happens here in the Republic must also happen there, and vice versa&#x003F; My own impression, and I should like to have it confirmed, is that the Minister does have the power to make a different arrangement in South-West if he so wishes, but I should be glad if the hon. the Minister would go into this and reply to my question. If I am reading clause 13 (1) correctly, the Minister determines the salaries of teachers in South-West &#x201C;in consultation with the Minister of Finance and on the recommendation of the Public Service Commission&#x201D;. My question is just whether it is in his power then, if it should be necessary, to make a different arrangement there from the one which applies here in respect of salaries.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this is a very important question and I suppose it is important that I should not give a wrong answer now, or one of which I am not sure. As the hon. member for Bezuidenhout rightly said, the salaries for these Coloured teachers are determined on the recommendation of the Public Service Commission and in consultation with the Minister of Finance. It is therefore more reasonable to assume that the Public Service Commission will recommend the same salary scales for both the Republic and South-West Africa. It is also possible, however, that in view of the history of teaching in South-West and the position of White teachers there, the Public Service Commission may recommend different salary scales and/or privileges for these schools, provided that the Minister of Finance is then willing to introduce them into the Budget. I am sorry, but I do not want to be more specific than that.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when we study clause 13, the position in clause 12 is much clarified. This clause deals with conditions of service of persons employed at State schools and State-aided schools. In terms of subsection (2)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">the salary, salary scale, allowances, leave privileges and other conditions of service of any person who is, by virtue of the provisions of section 11 (1), deemed to have been appointed to a post &#x2026;</block>

<p>are guaranteed. This is the position in subsection (2). Subsections (3) and (4) refer to the persons who are transferred in terms of clause 12, namely those from State-aided schools. Subsection (4) provides that sick and accumulative vacational leave are guaranteed, but not the salary itself and the salary scale. In terms of subsection 13) the person will be left in the hands of the hon. the Minister as regards the salary and the salary scale. Is other words, as far as that person is concerned, there is no guarantee. I am just mentioning this to the hon. the Minister. He has promised to reconsider clause 12 at a later stage. The real reasons for this are we find in the provisions in clause 13. In other words, clause 13 does not sufficiently guarantee the position of the persons affected by clause 12. Guarantees are given to other categories. I do not want to oppose this clause at all, but I just want the hon. the Minister to consider clause 12 in the light of this. In other words, clause 13 is really the key one <span class="col_5085-5086" refersTo="page_1006"/>has to use to see exactly in what way the person in clause 12 is affected.</p>

</speech>

<p>Subsection (3) controls the salary after transfer. I shall go into this subsection very thoroughly. Subsection (4) controls the other conditions. I do not think a person will in any way be placed in a worse position than the one he occupies at his present school, where in any case we are paying his salary at the moment. We are paying their salaries at the State-aided schools as well, as the Administration used to do, although they are not under our control. Now we shall go on paying their salaries and they will be placed under our control. If a person is not on a suitable salary scale, we transfer him and adjust the salary scale to his experience, qualifications and whatever according to the salary scale which has to be determined by someone, after all, in this case by the Minister. But it is important for those people, and therefore we shall go into the matter.</p>

<p>This is an amendment which I sincerely hope that the hon. the Minister will seriously consider. I believe that we have come to a stage where we can no longer discriminate in our labour force against married women.</p>

<p>*It is very important for us at this stage, I think that the married woman, in every colour group, should be fully absorbed into the labour market. In the teaching profession in particular we know from experience that the married woman is the mainstay of this profession, not only as far as White education is concerned, but in that of the other colour groups as well. I think we have now come to the stage where we can no longer deny the married woman the advantages of permanent employment, as is being done here. In Natal married women have been employed in a permanent capacity for quite some time. This was also done in the Transvaal a few years ago. The system in the Transvaal and Natal is working very well. It has resulted in many married women, some of them of a more advanced age at which they cannot have children any more, returning to the teaching profession. They have done very valuable work and have been able in this way to earn an additional income for their families at the stage at which they need it most, especially when they are married. There may even be grandchildren. This is the ideal type of work which a married woman can do without neglecting her children. Therefore I think we should not discriminate against the married woman here, but give her all the advantages of permanent employment. Consequently I should be very glad if the hon. the Minister would accept this amendment.</p>

<from><span class="col_5087-5088" refersTo="page_1007"/>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this question of the permanent appointment of married women teachers has been the subject of debate in this country for many, many years. I was glad to hear the hon. member for Florida mention that in Natal and in the Transvaal they have become sufficiently sophisticated to give them permanent appointment. Even in the Cape Province we have come to the stage, slow as it is, where married women, at any rate as far as Europeans are concerned, can now be guaranteed a three year appointment instead of being asked automatically to resign when they marry. Not everybody will necessarily agree with me, but I take the view that this decision should not in the first place rest with the authorities at all. It should rest with the woman concerned. If she gets married and still wants to go on working, it is her own business and nobody else&#x2019;s. If she has been a competent teacher, the decision to resign or stay on should in the last resort be left to her. I hope the day will come when we go even further than the talking stage and that this decision will be left with the person concerned, and that the woman herself can make this decision. Women, after all, if they are competent to teach, are competent also to make that kind of decision. The figures, both in the case of Coloured education and as far as European education is concerned, prove, over a long period of years here in the Republic, that without the assistance of married women teachers, our entire education system would have collapsed, and I defy anybody to tell me that that is not correct. It seems to me that it is quite ridiculous at this stage to repeat this provision in this law. These people, who tend on the whole to be very dedicated people, as well as very experienced people, deserve some security of tenure. The male teachers have all the security of tenure they want. Hon. members know very well&#x2014;the hon. the Minister should know this, and I am sure the officials of his department will know&#x2014;that the teaching profession is becoming a profession increasingly manned by women, if I may use the expression. The fact is that fewer and fewer men are going into the teaching profession. I would say that, married or unmarried, because they bear the major burden in the educational field, whether it is for Whites. Coloureds or anybody else, women should be absolutely guaranteed their security of tenure. I should like to support the amendment moved by the hon. member for Florida, and say that it is time this principle of married women being appointed on a permanent basis, and what is more, making the decision themselves, was made applicable throughout the Republic, as well as in South-West Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to lend support to the amendment moved by the hon. member for Florida, and I also want to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to the fact that during the Second Reading debate, the question was raised of people who had taught for years at some of these mission schools, which were now possibly State-aided schools. They could find themselves in a position where they were discriminated against because, although they had been in South-West Africa for a number of years and had rendered sterling service, they were not South African citizens, and clause 15 (1) (e) stipulated that South African citizenship was a necessary condition for a teacher to be assured of permanent employment. In this regard the Minister said :</p>

<block name="quote">I will give the matter some thought. I will discuss it with my department. If there are today teachers who are performing a valuable service and who are not South African citizens, we can look at this matter when we come to the Committee Stage.</block>

<p><span class="col_5089-5090" refersTo="page_1008"/>Then he went further:</p>

<block name="quote">I shall look into the matter, and if this stipulation about South African citizenship will penalize some of those mission societies when they continue with the good work they have been doing, I will look into it.</block>

<p>I wonder whether the Minister has been able to consider this matter, and whether he could indicate that there will be no victimization or that these people will not be penalized in any way, should they subsequently wish to transfer from a mission school to a State-aided school, or subsequently, to a State school.</p>

<p>With this amendment we shall in my opinion overcome the problem mentioned here by the hon. member for Berea. If there are teachers at these schools who are doing good work there and who have been doing it for a long time, but who are not South African citizens, it will enable us to retain their services. As regards married women, hon. members must remember that we are dealing here with schools for Coloured persons in South-West Africa. There are not many married Coloured women employed at those schools. Therefore the married women who teach at these schools is not really a factor. The married women who teach there may be White women, and I feel that it would be wrong to write into the Act that they are to be either permanently appointed or not appointed at all. After all, we know the position in regard to White women who assist at Coloured schools everywhere. They are doing it on a scale which is very much appreciated. I do not think the amendment moved by hon. members on that side will really improve our position. I am now taking the power here to appoint married women on a permanent basis in deserving cases, and also to retain persons who are not South African citizens in the establishments of the schools.</p>

<p>Sir, married women in the Coloured schools may be a small factor, as the hon. the Minister said, and I accept that they are a small factor, but the fact is that this matter is in fact mentioned in the Bill and therefore we should not only look at it from the practical point of view, but also from the point of view of the principle concerned. This clause, as it now reads, provides that the Minister may approve that any person other than an officer or employee&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(b) who is a married female, but whose permanent appointment will, in the opinion of the Minister, be in the interest of education,</block>

<p>be appointed in a permanent capacity. Our premise and principle is that it is in the interest of the teaching profession that any married female should be appointed permanently if she wants to teach. In other words, the one clause which prohibits it and the other which allows it are not necessary. Neither of the two should appear here, and it is from this view-point of principle that I put the matter to the hon. the Minister again for reconsideration.</p>

<p>I should also like to tell the hon. the Minister that I accept, in the first place, that there are extremely few Coloured women in the teaching profession in South-West Africa at the moment, and if we were to accept this Bill as it now reads, the people who would derive the greatest benefit from it would be the White women who are teaching there.</p>

<p>The position is that White women enjoy this privilege in the White departments at the moment. The hon. the Minister realizes, after all, that in terms of his own policy this presence of White teachers in the department is of a temporary nature, and what we are now doing here is to pilot through a Bill which must provide for the future. In respect of the Coloured people in particular we accept that certain socio-economic conditions prevail today as far as they are concerned, and that is why I believe that it is very really necessary for the Coloured women to be appointed in a permanent capacity in this case. If it is essential to have working <span class="col_5091-5092" refersTo="page_1009"/>mothers among the Whites in the times in which we are living today, I believe that it is also essential to have working mothers among the Coloured people. I really believe that the Minister can decide in this respect that since the Whites are dealt with on this basis, justice must also be done to the Coloured woman in her own department.</p>

<p>I must say how pleased I am to hear this amendment of the hon. the Minister and that he is now taking the power to allow the appointment, as a permanent employee, of a non-South African citizen, of a foreigner who perhaps has been working for many years in these schools. I did feel that it was a little bit rough of the Minister to exclude willy-nilly all non-South Africans from appointments to the permanent staff of these institutions. But I am afraid I cannot say the same about the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s rejection of the amendment of the hon. member for Florida, dealing with married female teachers. The hon. the Minister has indicated that in terms of subsection (2) (b) he is prepared to appoint certain women teachers, but why should South African women teachers be put in the same category as foreign teachers, that they have first to get the approval of the hon. the Minister before they can be appointed permanently&#x003F; I think that this is a little unreasonable. I believe that in this enlightened year of 1972 where we have talk of women&#x2019;s emancipation in all respects, and where it has already been accepted by the education departments of at least three of the provinces, the Minister should reconsider this matter and accept the amendment of the hon. member; because we are going to have the situation where women teachers will again say that they are only second-grade teachers, that they can never hope to retain full status as teachers in this country, because immediately they become married they become second-grade teachers and will not be allowed to continue as full-time teachers. So I urge the hon. the Minister to reconsider this. I accept it as far as non-South African citizens are concerned. That we all accept; we are very glad to have that amendment, but with regard to married women I do believe that there should be no discrimination and no question of the Minister having to exercise any prerogative or discretion as to whether a particular woman teacher should be a temporary employee or a permanent employee. I believe that if they are good enough to be teachers they are good enough to be permanently appointed.</p>

<p>Clause, as amended, accordingly agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 17 :</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, during my Second Reading speech I specifically referred to this clause. I wonder whether at this stage the hon. the Minister can give us more information about its actual purport. We are dealing here with appointments deemed to be transfers. We consequently have here a whole series of persons involved in this, for example persons employed by the South African Railways and Harbours, the State diggings, the Provincial Education Department, universities or a Department of State. These persons can be transferred. In lines 14 to 17 the following is stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_5095-5096" refersTo="page_1011"/>&#x2026; his appointment shall for the purposes of leave, subsistence allowance, transfer costs and transport facilities be deemed to be a transfer, unless the Minister determines otherwise.</block>

<p>I find again that there is no mention at all of the whole matter and question of that person&#x2019;s salary scale and notch. I particularly want to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to what does happen, and to how it happens that persons from these departments can be transferred. In the case of someone working in the South African Railways and Harbours, for example, who is not qualified as a teacher but who, by studying further, has qualified himself as a teacher and goes over, without a break in service, from the Railways and Harbours, where he was a clerk, to the Minister&#x2019;s department as a teacher, we find that all other matters are guaranteed to him by this clause. However, there is no guarantee in respect of the notch or the salary at which he can be engaged. If this has no bearing on such persons, the Minister must tell me as much. If it has no bearing on persons who are now going to become teachers, I can understand this. If it is only going to have a bearing on persons who, for example, were clerks in any of those departments, but who are being transferred as clerks into his department, I can also understand it. I know that there are numerous persons who are weighed down by these circumstances under the White education system. The various education departments have, for example, worked out scales and the adjustments that are made in similar cases. For example, they tell the person that if he was in a non-teaching post in the Department of Labour, for example, and he now begins as a qualified teacher, they are prepared to recognize six months of every year of his service as signifying service on the salary scale of a teacher. In other words, this means that the person, who has perhaps worked for ten years in the other department. begins on the fifth notch as a teacher. He therefore does not begin at the very bottom. I already mentioned this in my Second Reading speech. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister can clarify this aspect for us.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_coloured_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as I understand the clause it does not concern transfers, but appointments, for example if a person is appointed to the department to teach because he applies for a post. Up to and including the date of appointment to the new post of teacher, he occupies a post in another Department of State. Supposing he had obtained a B.Comm. degree and he was employed by one of these said bodies. If there is a very great need at a certain school for a bookkeeping teacher and there is someone who is interested and applies, the question of salaries is not relevant, because he knows the salary relevant to the post for which he is applying. My department cannot take any person from another Department of State and allow him to serve at one of the schools falling under my department. But if he applies for a post, he applies for a post involving a specific salary. His pension and so on are regulated by other Acts we do not have to worry about. The matters that are not regulated by this are such a person&#x2019;s leave, subsistence allowance, transfer costs and transport facilities. For these purposes it is deemed to be a transfer. Compensation is then payable to such a person according to the scales laid down.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I thank the hon. the Minister for his explanation, but I just want to tell him that his department will in fact have to do something about this matter, because if there are 10 persons with B.Comm. degrees working in other departments, and this clause remains as it now stands, it will be found that there will in fact be one or two of those people who will voluntarily apply to be transferred to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department, but his department will not draw the overall majority of them. The other education departments will get them, because the other education departments specifically make provision for these circumstances. It will be in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s interests to institute investigations and then ensure by way of regulations that his department offers the same as other departments. I accept the fact that these persons cannot be compelled to work for this department, but the position must, after all be made attractive for them. I believe that the education departments do in fact now make it attractive for these people. This is not only in the case of persons working in other departments; there is also the case of people in private industry. In their case we cannot say that we shall accept them and pay their subsistence and transfer costs. This cannot actually fall under this heading. However, <span class="col_5097-5098" refersTo="page_1012"/>the hon. the Minister will also have to give attention to how certain education departments in South Africa&#x2014;I am thinking here, for example, of the Natal Education Department&#x2014;have bridged the problem of a shortage of teachers. For example, people with a B.Sc. degree working for Lever Brothers, say, were told that they should qualify themselves as teachers and then come to the education department. Those people were told that they would not need to start at the bottom, but that five of the 10 years they worked for Lever Brothers, for example, would be recognized as five years in education. In other words, they need not start on the bottom notch, but in actual fact on a higher notch. I am just giving this as a hint to the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>Clause 18 :</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 30, to omit &#x201C;shall&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;may&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I mentioned this matter during the course of the Second Reading debate. The amendment refers to the fact that any remuneration, as it is put in clause 18, received from any source by any teacher other than his salary shall be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund, and if such a teacher fails to do so, the Minister can resort to legal action and various other provisions. I know the hon. the Minister said that this is the usual procedure. That may be so, but that does not mean to say that because it has been so for the last umpteen years, we have to carry on with it. The hon. the Minister referred in his Second Reading speech to a teacher not being allowed to receive extra remuneration for doing some job other than his teaching job. We agree with that entirely. Quite clearly, no teacher who is doing his job properly, can hold down some other type of employment at the same time. But supposing an individual inherits private funds or makes money from investments which he or she is entitled to do, supposing he or she earns rent from the lease of privately owned property, surely the payment of income of that kind into the Consolidated Revenue Fund should not be mandatory. Surely the circumstances in each individual case should be given consideration by the Minister. I do think that the Minister should be free to exercise his discretion in these matters, because there could be certain circumstances in which people do not play the game. I also think, however, that the teacher should have some degree of freedom in this matter of their own finances. To make it mandatory, as the clause stands at present, seems to us to be very arbitrary indeed. On those grounds we move this amendment, namely that it will not be mandatory, but that each case will be considered on its merits.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_coloured_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am sorry but I cannot accept this amendment. I can only reiterate that the position we have in this clause is similar to the position in South-West Africa at present. The hon. member also mentioned that it also applied in the Civil Service. This has nothing to do with income such as a legacy or inheritance. The clause specifically states that a person shall not &#x201C;perform or bind himself to perform&#x201D; to do other remunerative work and that he shall not accept remuneration in respect of &#x201C;any duty or work performed by him by the order of a competent authority&#x201D;. The whole object of this provision is to get the teacher as far as is practicable to place the whole of his time, as is stated in clause 18 (1) (a) &#x201C;at the disposal of the school at which he is employed&#x201D;. I know of teachers who write for various periodicals and I feel those people could get an exemption from the Minister. It is not work they are doing while they are in the full-time employ of the State. This is a generally-accepted principle. No employer would like his employees not to give their whole attention to their work for which they get paid. It is the same with these schools. I can therefore not accept this amendment. In any case, if we change the word &#x201C;shall&#x201D; to &#x201C;may&#x201D; we would destroy the whole meaning of the clause. We might then just as well scrap the whole clause and leave it to the conscience of every individual teacher. I think this is a principle embodied in just about all education ordinances and the Civil Service. I cannot see anything wrong with it and if there is a deserving case, any teacher of any Coloured school in South-West Africa <span class="col_5099-5100" refersTo="page_1013"/>can contact me. In any event, I will not prevent any man from doing something in his spare time, and after all a teacher is entitled to his spare time as much as I am entitled to mine, for which he receives remuneration.</p>

<p>This is the whole crux of the matter. The hon. the Minister concedes that a teacher in his spare time, as he puts it, might write articles to a magazine for instance. If he concedes that a teacher in his spare time might be entitled to keep the fees that he would get for writing such articles for a magazine, short stories or something of that nature. But in terms of this clause the Minister has no discretion. No discretion is granted to the Minister or to anybody else to allow such a teacher to do that. If he must do it and gets a cheque he is compelled to pay into the General Revenue Account. There is not even provision whereby the Minister of Finance can say thanks very much, but I am prepared to refund it to you. I agree that the amendment moved by the hon. member for Wynberg does not quite answer the question, but I also believe that this clause is very badly framed. It appears that the Minister and we on this side of the House are <i>ad idem</i> in this whole question. We believe that if a teacher should earn such fees which will come under the classification of remuneration, he should be entitled to keep them. I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that he has another look at this clause and that he asks his legal advisers to see if they cannot draft something &#x2026;</p>

This is something which is important to many teachers. As the hon. the Minister knows there are many teachers in this country who do just this very thing he is talking about and during their spare time do earn extra money to augment their salaries. We must have provision for this and this is what I am asking the Minister to do. Can he not in a responsible way consider with his legal advisers some way of giving the Minister this very loophole which he is asking for&#x003F; Let us not make it so tight as it is now.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not know why I am having this trouble with the hon. members. After all, there is a principal who knows what his staff members are doing. And then there are school inspectors as well. If a person is doing his work, and you know that from ten to twelve at night he writes short stories for <i>Rooi Rose,</i> then surely you would leave him alone. Similarly, if, for example, a person has a brother who has a little caf&#x00E9;, and he helps his brother every night with his bookkeeping and if his brother then gives him a packet of cigarettes for doing so then surely one is not going to take action against him. I am not going to concern myself with petty matters. Where abuses take place, they will be reported in the normal way by the inspectorate or whoever. The department will then take action in terms of this clause. We are, however, not trying to look for trouble. I therefore do not think that it is necessary for us to worry any further about this clause.</p>

<p>Clause 18 (1) (b) explicitly provides that a person must obtain the permission of the Minister. Paragraph (c) deals with the position of a competent authority. A person may, for example, receive a commission from a society or some government body or other. After all, it is common knowledge that public servants who are remunerated for their work for the Government or who, for example, receive directors&#x2019; fees, pay it back into the Treasury. This is more or less what is meant with paragraph (c).</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>This clause deals with the transfer and secondment of certain persons employed by the department. We find, in respect of the transfer of persons, that assurances are being given that there will not be a reduction in their pensionable emoluments for the purposes of any law without their consent. But we also know that the secondment of a person, for which provision is being made in subsection (4), is sometimes in practice regarded by departments as a transfer. How many times does one not hear, for example, that a person has been seconded, and, that he simply remains for a very long time in the post to which he has been seconded. One perhaps finds that it is possibly a higher grade post, in actual fact, than the one he previously occupied. However, there is no assurance that when he goes to a lower grade post there will be a reduction in his pensionable emoluments. For that reason I consequently want to move the following amendments&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 43, after &#x201C;(1)&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;or secondment in terms of subsection (4)&#x201D;; and in line 45, after &#x201C;transfer&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;or secondment&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I know that in such a case, under normal circumstances, it is sometimes unavoidable as far as the administration of a department is concerned. The amendment consequently also aims at our obtaining the consent of the person in this case.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have just received these two amendments. I do not know what the hon. member&#x2019;s difficulty is. The position is that we can now have three Acts that deal with the schools for Coloured persons, for the Basters and the Nama. We may now think it necessary, in the interests of the Coloured persons, to transfer staff from one post to another within the same school or to another school. Notwithstanding the provisions of the other two Bills, which we still hope to pass in this House, we shall be able to transfer them from the one post to the other on the establishment of our department, on condition that this does not embody any prejudicing of that official&#x2019;s position. I am not prepared to go any further than that. The fact of the matter is that we are not going to act dictatorially in that respect, and neither must that impression be created, but where it is in the interests of the work we must do in South-West, we would like to have the power. Let us therefore keep the clause as it is. There is already the provision that if a person is placed into a lower grade post he retains his full salary. As soon as there is a post vacant for him he must be transferred back, and he is appointed in his previous grade. I think it could considerably complicate cur position if it is laid down as a requirement that the person must grant his permission. In many instances a person will agree to be transferred, but if he knows he has the right to say &#x201C;No&#x201D; then he says &#x201C;No&#x201D;. I think that we should simply keep <span class="col_5103-5104" refersTo="page_1015"/>the clause as it is. I am not prepared to accept the amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry to hear that the hon. the Minister is not prepared to accept this amendment. The whole matter concerns the fact that secondment sometimes inevitably becomes permanent, and though the Minister is prepared to provide that a person shall not be transferred permanently without his permission, I am sorry to find that he is not prepared to grant the same protection in the case of a person being seconded.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I want to move the following further amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 60, after &#x201C;Commission&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;and with such person&#x2019;s consent&#x201D;.</block>

<p>This clause will then read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A person may be seconded, upon the recommendation of the Public Service Commission and with such person&#x2019;s consent, to the service of the State or the Administration of the Territory or the service of the State in any other capacity.</block>

<p>*One can find my reasons for moving this amendment in sub-clause (4) (b). There we find that a person can be seconded, with his own consent, to the service of the government of any other country or of any person. In other words, if we want to send a person to another country, the hon. the Minister must first obtain his consent. If we want to transfer a person to the service of one of the non-White states, his consent must first be obtained, but when we want to second a teacher, in the service of the State, to the service of the State in another capacity as a teacher, we do not need to obtain his consent. Take the case of one&#x2019;s wanting to second a teacher to another Department of State, where he will be serving in a capacity other than that of a teacher. He can, for example, be seconded to work in a clerical capacity. In that case the hon. the Minister is not prepared to provide that that person&#x2019;s permission be obtained. We must in no way create the impression here that any exploitation will take place, and the amendment I am moving is based on the experience that a person is sometimes transferred permanently under the cloak of secondment.</p>

<p>I am really sorry the hon. the Minister is not prepared to consider the acceptance of this amendment. The hon. the Minister has already accepted the principle that where a person is transferred his permission must be obtained if the transfer can possibly be to his detriment. What is the difference between the transfer and the secondment of a person under those circumstances, bearing in mind the fact that such a secondment can be for a long period of time or on a permanent basis.

<p>Sir, one must assume that we shall treat our people there as well as possible. One cannot assume that we shall penalize people if we have the slightest chance to do so. After all, we do want to retain their services, and we want to treat them as well as possible. Hon. members must remember that the salaries in Coloured schools and Baster schools in South-West Africa are not the same as the salaries in Nama schools. That is perhaps one of the reasons why some of the provisions of the Bill read as they do at present. If one transfers a Coloured teacher to a Nama school, he retains his salary as a Coloured teacher. If one transfers a Nama teacher to a Coloured school, he does not obtain the higher salary of a Coloured teacher; he obtains the salary of a Nama teacher, and as soon as possible one returns him to a Nama school. The length of time for which a teacher is transferred from one school to another will depend on circumstances. My attention is drawn to the fact that under all circumstances we still always have to obtain the recommendation of the Public Service Commission. Hon. members may consequently accept the fact that transfers will not take place at random. They cannot take place to the permanent detriment of the relevant official. They can only be made in the interests of education there. If the person is not happy in his new post we shall transfer him back as soon as possible, or place him where he would like to be. We know what it is like with officials in the Republic. I am not speaking about teachers now, but I have already had many cases in my constituency of a man being transferred from one post office exchange to another, from one police station to another or from one railway station to another. When that happens <span class="col_5105-5106" refersTo="page_1016"/>he and his wife or his parents come to me. We are requesting here the authority to transfer or second teachers to other schools in the interests of education in South-West Africa. This is not something we are going to do at random. I should like to have the authority, because under certain circumstances I may need it. It must be accepted that it is not our point of departure to cause trouble in the ranks of our teachers, but on the contrary to keep them as satisfied as possible, with a view to promoting the education of these groups as much as possible.</p>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would like to make it quite clear from the start that we oppose the whole principle involved in this clause, the principle of promotion on probation. It is the most daft thing that I have heard of in any piece of legislation to do with education and, what is more, we said so during the Second Reading debate. The whole clause suggests that in the first instance the authorities themselves are incompetent to assess the qualifications of any person who is due for promotion. If, in fact, their powers of assessment are so poor that they can only promote people on probation, then I would say that the reflection lies not on the person who is being promoted, but on the authorities themselves and their incompetence to assess the qualifications of the teacher concerned. After all let us face the fact that if a person is qualified and has earned promotion, either he has earned it and he deserves it or he does not. You cannot muck about and have it both ways. There can be no justification whatsoever for a period of probation. It is something that is quite unheard of in legislation dealing with education anywhere in the world. I would like to ask the Minister the same question I asked him in the Second Reading. What is the object of this promotion on probation&#x003F; Is the implication here that teachers who will be promoted, on the Minister&#x2019;s assessment, or of whosoever he delegates his power to&#x2014;is the implication that these teachers are to be a bunch of stooges or that they will create trouble&#x003F; What is the reason&#x003F; What is the point&#x003F; We do not like it at all. It is a complete innovation. It does not appear in Act 47 of 1963, dealing with Coloured people in the Republic. We object in the strongest terms to the whole idea of promotion on probation. Promotion is promotion, finished and &#x201C;klaar&#x201D;, and if the person proves incompetent, the Minister has the power to discharge him or to transfer him or to do anything else, but to talk about promotion on probation is just poppycock.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit subsection (4).</block>

<p>In regard to the point which the hon. member for Wynberg has just mentioned, I have no desire to be difficult or to delete something that does not exist. The hon. member says it does not exist anywhere in the world. I do not know. I have not examined the position all over the world in that manner, but the fact of the matter is that the hon. member referred to this matter on Friday afternoon. I was away for the whole week-end, although I did not go all over the world. [Interjection.] No, there was no need for me to go to Oudtshoorn. I said on Friday that I would check that information. I am going to retain this clause here, but I want to tell the hon. member now that I have been informed&#x2014;but I shall consult the Education Department of the Cape Province&#x2014;by an inspector of White Education himself that his appointment as an inspector of education was made on probation. That was my information. I could not go into it. But if a student has completed his studies at university and has obtained his B.A. degree and his S.E.D. or his H.P.D., and one appoints him as a teacher, he is appointed on probation even if he has already qualified and has obtained his degrees. But one appoints him on probation. Now one appoints a person as a principal on promotion. One cannot guarantee in advance that he will be a success. The voters may elect those members to be members of the Opposition, and just see how hopelessly they will be defeated at the polls! One cannot guarantee in advance that a person in a certain position is going to be a success, and, after all is said and done, what could be so terribly wrong with a person being returned to his previous post by the higher authorities&#x2014;for there are always higher authorities over us, no matter <span class="col_5107-5108" refersTo="page_1017"/>where we go in life&#x2014;if he was not a success in his new post&#x003F; I shall go into the matter and I shall give some more thought to it, but at this stage I want to insist on this, as I have said, except that I am willing to omit subsection (4).</p>

<p>In reply to the hon. the Minister, I accept his <i>bona fides</i> particularly when he says that he has received information from the Cape Education Department. But the Minister is continuing to do this afternoon precisely what he did on Friday. He accuses me of suggesting that we disapprove of appointments on probation, but that is not what I said. Appointment on probation is an entirely different thing from promotion on probation. I hope the Minister gets the message. The Minister cited for instance student teachers who start with degrees. That is right. In the first place they are new teachers and neither the department nor the Minister knows whether they will be a success, and it is perfectly natural and right that anyone who is appointed, particularly in the junior grades, should be appointed on probation. Nobody has any objection to that, but this clause makes no distinction. It does not say it is for junior grades; it does not say it is for newly-appointed people. It is a blanket measure and the Minister can deal with a senior member of the staff or a vice-principal who is promoted to a post as principal or anyone else in the whole hierarchy of training colleges. The Minister has in no sense really answered my point. I really think that he has failed completely to deal with my argument.</p>

<p>It is entirely acceptable to us that if a person is appointed he should be appointed on a period of probation if the authorities think it wise. That goes for somebody who comes straight from the university. But that is not what this clause says. This clause talks of promotion without any reference to any grade and by implication it means that a vice-principal can be promoted to the position of a principal, but only on probation, and I think it is a vote of no-confidence in the teaching staff of the Territory itself that this should be the case. I am not talking about appointments on probation, but about promotion on probation. There is no security of tenure, particularly for senior people if they are granted promotion and they know that promotion is only on a probationary basis. If people get to the higher grades of teaching, either they are competent or not, and if the department cannot assess it adequately and make the appointment permanent, it is the department which is incompetent and not the teacher.</p>

<p>I am afraid I must support the hon. member for Wynberg in this and I would like to draw pertinently to the attention of the hon. the Minister the fact that he is dealing now with people who are already in the employ of the department. The hon. member for Wynberg, with respect, submitted that this is a vote of no-confidence in his staff, but I would suggest that this is a vote of no-confidence, or an expression of lack of confidence, in the Minister himself and an expression of lack of confidence in the senior members of his department who deal with these people who are promoted. Because what the Minister is in effect saying is: I am going to promote a person to this job, but I am not sure that I have chosen the right person; so I want him to go there on probation for a while until I make up my mind whether he is in fact the right person for the job or not. That is what he is doing. He has no confidence in himself or in his senior officials. Where is the parallel&#x003F; There is only one parallel that we have in the Republic, where promotion is on probation.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>No, that is only a temporary appointment. That is only a temporary appointment and not an appointment on probation. Anyone who is appointed in the Cabinet &#x2026; [Interjections.] Perhaps he may like us to be appointed on probation and we can consider that. As I have said, there is only one parallel in the Republic that I know of and that is in the Railways Administration. <span class="col_5109-5110" refersTo="page_1018"/>There it is done through the Staff Association, and this point we have agreed upon. However, I do not believe that the procedure is the same as the procedure which is going to be employed by this hon. Minister.</p>

<p>The procedure there is that a post is advertised throughout the Republic and applications are invited from those who are qualified to hold down that post. An appointment is finally made and the reason why it is made on probation is so that the other applicants will have the opportunity of objecting if they feel aggrieved with the appointment. Is that the intention of the hon. Minister in this case&#x003F; Is it his intention to make these appointments on probation so that other officials and teachers can make their objections to the appointment&#x003F; Before the hon. the Minister tells me that he is not talking about officials, I want to point out that I am well aware of the fact that this deals with persons other than an officer or an employee. If one looks at the definition of an &#x201C;officer&#x201D;, and of an &#x201C;employee&#x201D; we find that they are civil servants. In other words, the people with whom we are dealing here are not civil servants in terms of the Public Service Act.</p>

<p>Why should their position be any different from that of civil servants&#x003F; They are also employees in the department; they have also been employed for some time. When they were first appointed they were on probation and having served their probationary period they obviously must have satisfied the department that they were the right type of people and that they had the right qualifications, otherwise they would not have been appointed. Having been appointed, when he wants to promote them, he wants to put them on probation or, as he has put it: &#x201C;Hulle gaan op proef,&#x201D; on trial. I am afraid that I cannot accept this at all. This to my mind is a complete vote of no-confidence not only in the staff but in the Minister himself. The Minister&#x2019;s amendment to delete subsection (4) does remove my greatest objection to this clause because this was the clause which provided for the appointment of somebody acting unpaid, something which has really annoyed employees of the State over many years and I am very glad to hear that the Minister has withdrawn that subsection.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, at a later stage I shall come back to the point which the hon. the Minister has just mentioned. In the first place, I want to say that I am glad he moved as an amendment that subsection (4) be omitted. If subsection (4) were agreed to, persons would have been placed in the position where they would have had to remain in a post for years, without their being entitled to the salaries attached to that post. I am glad the hon. the Minister moved that amendment voluntarily, and we support him in that respect.</p>

<p>To come back to the question of promotion on probation and of promotion having to take place specifically on probation. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that there is definitely a fundamental difference between the Ordinance from which he quoted and what is stated here. In this case there is no provision for discretion which may be used. In other words, every promotion must simply be on probation. After all, from what he read out to us from the Ordinance of 1962, it is very clear that certain distinctions could in fact me made &#x2014;in other words, there is some discretion. In the White Department of Education this is not the case; this is definitely not the case in Natal. Surely the hon. the Minister himself knows what the position in the Cape Province is. A person applies to the local school board. Subsequently that local school board accepts that person, and then he becomes principal at Calvinia, or wherever. We do not find the school board saying four or five months later that an error was made and that that person should be dismissed. That is the position. In my Second Reading speech I said, and I want to repeat it, that whereas the hon. the Minister now had such a wonderful opportunity for preparing model legislation on education, he should not let this opportunity slip through his fingers. I believe that, especially because it relates mainly to Coloureds, it would be an unfortunate day if we were to draw a distinction here. I am very sorry that the hon. the Minister does not want to reconsider the matter.</p>

<p>Clause 21:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause deals with the discharge of persons employed at State schools and State-aided schools. In the first place I am sorry that the word &#x201C;discharge&#x201D; is being used, i.e. that a person is discharged when, for example, he attains a pensionable age or is in poor health, etc. In the English text it reads &#x201C;that he may be discharged by the Minister&#x201D;. It would actually have been better if it were stated that a person&#x2019;s service is terminated at that stage. When a married person, particularly a married woman, is told that she has been discharged, it looks as if she was perhaps guilty of some or other type of misconduct. The actual reason for my wanting to move an a mendment here lies in clause 21 (1) (e) in particular. This paragraph deals with the discharge of a person who will, in the opinion of the Minister, promote efficiency or economy in the school in question. My amendment is as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 45, after &#x201C;Minister&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;after an inquiry by the Public Service Commission&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The reason why the Public Service Commission is being introduced in this case is that all these reasons for discharge are very clear. If, for example, a person is discharged in terms of paragraph (c), i.e. on account of the abolition of his post or a reduction, reorganization or re-arrangement of the staff of the school in question, this takes place on the recommendation of the Public Service Commission. In other words, in terms of that paragraph a person is not discharged merely as a result of the judgment of one person. If we find that a person is guilty of misconduct, particularly in terms of clauses 22, 23, etc., we find that a specific procedure must be followed. However, in this paragraph it is merely provided that if the Minister is of the opinion that the discharge of a person will promote greater efficiency or economy at the school in question, that person can be discharged. I feel that in this case a person does not have sufficient protection. I feel it would be better if this takes place after the Public Service Commission has instituted an investigation. In this case I should also like to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to the fact that when a similar amendment was discussed in 1963, his predecessor said the following in that connection: &#x201C;The hon. member for Port Elizabeth South has impressed me with his arguments. I think that certain steps should be taken to ensure that there is some form of other investigation before a person is discharged for misconduct&#x201D;. The Minister then also said that he would do something about the matter in the Other Place. Now, a number of years later, we find that in terms of this clause the necessary provision has not been made yet. The history of this amendment is that the person who moved it, withdrew it because he believed it would be put right in the Other Place. I therefore ask today that in such a case as this the Public Service Commission should first institute an investigation before the Minister decides that such a person&#x2019;s discharge will promote efficiency or economy.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in clause 21 (1) (g) we are again dealing with discrimination against a woman. It seems to me as if I am just tangled up with married women this afternoon, but unfortunately that cannot be helped because I believe that in principle this is a very important matter that we must, in fact, take a look at. From the nature of the case everything I have already said under clause 15 also applies in respect of the permanent employment of married women. I do not want to repeat this, but I just want to remind the hon. the Minister that the fact <span class="col_5115-5116" refersTo="page_1021"/>that he did not want to accept my amendment under clause 15 in no way prevents him from accepting this amendment, because the two are not absolutely related. I shall tell you why I say this.</p>

<p>Clause 15 provides that a woman shall not be appointed in a permanent capacity if she is married, and this clause makes provision for a woman who marries while she is on the fixed establishment of the department. Over and above my arguments under clause 15, we have this additional factor, i.e. that here we are dealing with a woman who already has a vested interest in her work as a result of the fact that she is permanently employed. Therefore it is perhaps even more essential that she is not discriminated against.</p>

<p>This reminds me of the general legal principle we find in Roman-Dutch law i.e. about the sanctity of marriage. I am thinking of the Law of Persons which, for example, makes provision for the case where someone draws up a will according to which an heir can possibly be discriminated against or which can make it unprofitable for an heir to marry. A person states, for example: &#x201C;I leave my farm to my daughter, provided she does not marry&#x201D;. Such a provision is invalid according to common law.</p>

<p>&#x2020;It discourages marriage, and does not protect the sanctity of marriage. That is why in our common law this is a principle which has been held high, since Roman times, not to discriminate against a woman or a man if he or she is married or is to be married. Marriage, after all, is the basis upon which our society rests.</p>

<p>*If something similar to this clause of the Bill were to appear in a will, for example, i.e. that a woman would lose certain benefits when she married, it would be invalid. I do not think we should contradict that principle. I think it is a good principle, one that has existed for a long time in our legal history. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to consider abolishing the present provision in this particular case, where a woman marries while she already has a permanent appointment, and allowing her to remain on in a permanent capacity. I therefore move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit paragraph (g) of subsection (1).</block>

<speech by="#minister_of_coloured_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I must say I have a great deal of sympathy with the sentiments the hon. member for Durban Central expressed here when he said that the word &#x201C;discharge&#x201D; does seem a little strong. The other day I myself was surprised to see, when a very senior and valued public servant retired from the Service on reaching retirement age, that the wording used was that he was &#x201C;discharged&#x201D;. But of course there is, at least, such a thing as honourable discharge. Perhaps one must regard the discharge in that light.</p>

<p>As far as the hon. member for Florida is concerned, the position in South-West Africa today is as stated here. That is what the present-day position there is. I do not feel that it is desirable to insert that provision, in respect of Coloured teachers, into an Act which is specifically intended for South-West Africa. I take it that if I accepted the proposal the hon. member would repeat the proposal in the case of the Nama and the Basters. Since this provision does not exist in the Act, as far as White teachers in South-West Africa are concerned, I do not feel it is desirable to have it in the case of Coloured teachers.</p>

<p>Although there may be merit in the hon. member&#x2019;s arguments, I do not think it desirable at this stage, and therefore I am not willing to accept his amendment, and I shall therefore content myself with the provisions of the previous clause, which has already been dealt with, under which I have a discretionary power either to retain such a woman in service on a temporary basis or to appoint her permanently in a case where she is, for example, the only breadwinner because her husband has become very sickly, is an invalid, or because he has died.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Central spoke here particularly about paragraph (e). If a person must be discharged in order to promote efficiency, or to effect economy at a school, it would in my opinion be wrong if the official who is involved there should be on the losing side. In other words, one must accommodate that person elsewhere or in another way. There are apparently certain points of view which it is not possible for me simply to take into account as I stand there. Therefore in this case I am not prepared to go further than to say that I shall go into the provisions of the Public Service Act and that I shall give further attention to this matter in the <span class="col_5117-5118" refersTo="page_1022"/>Other Place, because I actually agree with the idea which the hon. members expressed here about paragraph (e).</p>

<p>Since the hon. the Minister states that he too is not happy about the use of the word &#x201C;discharge&#x201D; (ontslag), I just want to tell him that I think a better term in that case would be &#x201C;termination of service&#x201D; (be&#x00EB;indiging van diens) as a result of reaching the age limit, or something of that nature. I think attention could perhaps be given to this in the future. I am also glad to learn that the hon. the Minister is prepared to go into this matter. He will find that there is definite justification for an inquiry before deciding upon a reduction in staff.</p>

If the hon. the Minister agrees that there is merit in my proposal, we now have the opportunity of inserting the best possible provisions into this Bill. If the Whites in South-West Africa do not have this privilege then we can, if the amendment is accepted, also give them this privilege at a later stage. If there is merit in this amendment, let us embody it in this Bill while we now have the Bill before us. I ask the hon. the Minister to consider the matter in that line</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_coloured_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit paragraph (f).</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>Firstly I want to say that I am very glad that the hon. the Minister moved the deletion of paragraph (f). It will therefore not be necessary for me to speak about that, because it means that persons can now be members of political parties. This clause contains a definition of misconduct. It is a clause covering approximately a page and a half; it concerns many matters.</p>

<p>Paragraph (i) provides that a person may not make excessive use of intoxicants or stupefying drugs. In other words, it appears to me as if a teacher can nevertheless make use of intoxicants or stupefying drugs and still be retained as a teacher; he must just not make excessive use of them. This is a matter about which teachers could argue for days at a stretch.</p>

<p>But, Sir, I want to confine myself to paragraph (e), which provides that a person employed by the department shall be guilty of misconduct if he publicly criticizes the administration of any department, office or institution of the State.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I would like to move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In lines 24 and 25, to omit &#x201C;any department, office or institution of the State&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;the Department&#x201D;.</block>

<p>This paragraph will then read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He, otherwise than at a meeting convened by an association recognized by the Minister under section 26, publicly criticizes the administration of the department.</block>

<p>*In other words, the only restriction imposed upon him is that such a person may not criticize the administration of the department for which he works, but would be free to criticize other Government departments. The hon. the Minister said that he was going to allow a teacher to be a member of certain organizations, and in his reply to the Second Reading debate the Minister mentioned that a teacher can be a member of a political party and that he can even become chairman of a branch. But as long as this paragraph remains in its present form a staff member who is interested in politics will technically be guilty of misconduct each time he takes part in politics. I asked the hon. the Minister by way of an interjection whether such a person could, for example, do recruiting work from door to door. As the clause now reads he will not be able to do so, because if he does recruiting work from door to <span class="col_5119-5120" refersTo="page_1023"/>door it could perhaps be proved that he publicly criticized the administration of some or other Department of State&#x2014;perhaps the Department of Planning, which has nothing to do with him. He could then be charged as a result of misconduct.</p>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to move the following amendment to this clause&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 19, page 21, to omit &#x201C;any department&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;the Department&#x201D;.</block>

<p>This is a very similar amendment to the one that has just been moved by the hon. member for Durban Central. It refers to a teacher who might be considered guilty of misconduct if he does or causes to be done or connives at anything which is prejudicial to the administration, discipline or efficiency of any department, office or institution or a State-aided school. The definition of &#x201C;department&#x201D; in clause 1 refers of course to the Department of Coloured Relations and Rehoboth Affairs, and no other department as far as we are concerned should be involved in this. After all, if the teacher as an individual has any kind of dispute over his income or tax with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs or of Agriculture or any other department, surely he should not in any circumstances be subject to an indictment of misconduct under this Bill. It seems to me quite extraordinary that any department or any office or institution of the State should be involved here. We are quite happy about a State-aided school or an educational institution but to include any office or institution of the State and to say that if he has any conflict with them he is liable to a charge of misconduct, is wrong. We think he should not be subject to an indictment like that under a Bill which deals in the first place with education and nothing else.</p>

<p>I want to give South-West Africa a good Bill under any circumstances, and I am therefore going to take it upon myself to say that I am going to accept the amendment of the hon. member for Durban Central, but I do so under a very express condition. I want to retain for myself the right to come back to this House, whenever I may find it necessary, and to refer to the concession I am making here today and say that I again ask for the return of the power I am relinquishing today. The intention, as already mentioned&#x2014; and I want to state this very clearly for the record, which is also read by other people &#x2014;was not that people should not be able to use their democratic right of criticism freely. But there is a difference between making use of a right and deciding to abuse it. It is very difficult to say where the dividing line is, and now one has to give the Minister an arbitrary power. Seen with a view to our wanting to give the people of South-West Africa a reasonable and fine dispensation, as far as their education is concerned, inserting nothing that detracts from their rights, I shall accept the amendment of the hon. member for Durban Central. In addition I want to say that at this stage I do not accept the amendment of the hon. member for Wynberg. From the nature of the case I must now also rewrite (s), and I shall do so properly so that it fits in with the rest of the clause. I shall do that in the Other Place.</p>

<p>Amendment proposed by Mrs. C. D. Taylor put and negatived ("Official Opposition dissenting).</p>

<p>Clause, as amended, put and agreed to. Clause 23 :</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#stephens">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. M. STEPHENS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in clause 23 we find the procedure to be followed if a person is accused of misconduct under the provisions of the previous clause. This clause coincides with the other legislation in this regard and it is a fair system. It gives any person charged with misconduct a fair chance to put his case. Therefore I have no quarrel with that. I want to quote subsection (4). It reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister or, if authorized thereto by the Minister either generally or in a particular case, the Secretary or any other officer in the department may suspend from duty any person accused of misconduct, as defined in section 22, whether or not such person has been charged with misconduct.</block>

<p>If an accusation has been brought in against a person, but he has not yet been charged, according to this clause he may be suspended. <span class="col_5121-5122" refersTo="page_1024"/>In other words, the mere fact that a person is accused of misconduct may have serious consequences, which may last for quite some time. I know that he may be given reparation after he has been found not guilty, but during a certain period the consequences of just being accused can be very serious and very detrimental. Therefore we wish to make certain that whenever a person is accused of misconduct, he is accused by written affidavit. I am of the opinion that this is absolutely essential in order to ensure that a person is not accused willy-nilly, on improper evidence or on improper grounds. We also want to make sure that he is not accused maliciously, because just the fact that he has been accused can have very serious consequences for this person. It would be very sad is a person could be accused maliciously without it being by affidavit and eventually it is proved that the person who first made the accusation was malicious or completely untruthful. Then, I am afraid, as the Bill now reads, the accused person will have no redress against that person. If it is, however, made on an affidavit and he proves that the affidavit has been falsely made, he will be able to charge him with perjury. In order to ensure that such an accusation will not be made lightly and cannot be made lightly and that the person who makes the accusation has to be certain and that he in fact binds himself when he makes such an accusation, I therefore wish to move the following</p>

<block name="quote">In line 21, after &#x201C;accused&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;by means of a written affidavit&#x201D;.</block>

<p>When amended accordingly, clause 23 (1) will read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If any person referred to in section 21 (1) is accused of misconduct as defined in section 22 by means of a written affidavit, the Secretary or any person authorized thereto by the Secretary may charge him in writing under his hand with that misconduct.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this is not the first time the provisions contained in this clause are being placed on the Statute Book. These are provisions which have been derived from other education legislation in South Africa. This long series of provisions is very complete and has stood the test of time. For that reason I feel that it is not desirable to effect any change to these provisions. I think they should rather remain as they are. I want to say that we do not proceed on the assumption that we want to smell out people, prejudice people and dismiss people from their jobs unnecessarily. I am prepared to go through with this entire clause. If there is any deficiency, we shall remove it, but the clause as it stands has already been put to the test in the other education departments of the Republic. For this reason I cannot, unfortunately, accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment.</p>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wonder whether the hon. the Minister cannot give me some further information on clause 25. On Friday I gained the impression that he might move an amendment to this clause.</p>

<p>The clause deals with the procedure that is going to be followed when a person wants to seek election as a member of the provincial council or of a legislative body. The impression I gained from the hon. the Minister when he replied to this debate on Friday afternoon, was that he, too, realized that it was unfair to expect of a person to resign from the service of a department as soon as he had been nominated by a party. I believe it would be far better&#x2014;and, what is more, there are other Government departments, such as the Railways, in which a person may get leave to seek election&#x2014;if a person were to be deemed to have resigned as soon as he had been elected. I think it would be better in this case if it were to be provided that as from the date on which such a person was nominated by the party, he would be deemed to be on long leave, or on unpaid leave, and that he would not be deemed to have resigned from the service of the department just as soon as he had been nominated.</p>

<p>A person stands to lose a great many benefits when he accepts nomination and eventually finds that he is not elected. One stands to lose benefits such as pension benefits and other benefits, for example, possible promotion.</p>

<p>I do not have an amendment at the moment, but I should just like to know <span class="col_5123-5124" refersTo="page_1025"/>from the hon. the Minister whether we cannot possibly get an assurance that he will take another look at this clause.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_coloured_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have looked into the matter and I have just spoken to my hon. colleagues behind me, and I find that this is the case throughout the Republic. If one is nominated, and one is a teacher, one has to resign. The hon. member for Germiston, for example, was a teacher and the day he was nominated as a candidate for the election he had to resign as a teacher. The position as far as White teachers in South-West Africa is concerned, is that if a White teacher seeks election as a member of the House of Assembly or of the Legislative Assembly, his service comes to an end upon nomination. I think the hon. member will concede that we cannot phrase this clause differently. In fact, it agrees with the provision contained in the existing Education Ordinance of 1962 of South-West Africa. If any teacher seeks election as a member of Parliament, or as a member of the Legislative Assembly, it is assumed that he will resign his appointment as teacher on the day on which he is nominated as a candidate. This is the position at present. The only matter that remains is the following : As yet we have not covered in this legislation the position which will obtain when the Coloured Council of South-West Africa becomes an elected body. But as yet it is not necessary today, and when it does become necessary. I shall introduce a short amendment in the House in order to regulate the matter.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman. I am aware of the fact that that is the position in Natal. I myself had experience of it. The position is as stated by the hon. the Minister. But in view of the fact that in other clauses the hon. the Minister has introduced provisions which certain White education departments do not have, I feel that this is an opportunity for the hon. the Minister to set an example. I said earlier on that this was an opportunity for the hon. the Minister to establish a model for the rest of South Africa. Establish the model for the Coloured people and then other provinces can copy this model. This is the big opportunity the hon. the Minister has. It is in this spirit that I am asking the Minister to make of this Bill a very fine piece of education legislation.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, clause 27 deals with courses for the education or training of persons in State schools and State-aided schools. In terms of this clause the Minister may institute courses. The hon. the Minister mentioned it in particular when we spoke about agricultural schools. However, we also find that he may determine the nature and length of, and the conditions for admission to, any course.</p>

<p>&#x2020;In terms of clause 27 (2) the Minister shall determine the nature and length of, and the conditions for admission to any course instituted in terms of subsection (1).</p>

<p>*It is not my intention at all to conduct a lengthy debate on this matter. It is generally known that this side of the House believes that the parents should have the right to be able to decide in which language medium their children should be instructed. However, the attitude of the members on the opposite side of the House is that the child does not belong to the parents, but in fact to the State. So the Minister may lay down conditions here for the admission of a child. Now we feel that in the conditions he is going to lay down&#x2014;and I know he has to lay down conditions&#x2014; he will at least have to take into consideration the choice which the parents should have in respect of the medium of instruction of the child.</p>

What is his intention&#x003F; In which way does he intend using these powers&#x003F; What will be the media of instruction; will there be more than one medium of instruction&#x003F; I feel that this Committee is entitled to answers to these questions from the hon. the Minister. Just to pass it off by saying that that is also a sufficient answer for the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District, is insufficient. Can the hon. the Minister tell us the answers to the questions that I have posed, or are these things which are still hanging in the future, which have not yet been decided&#x003F; If that is so, he must tell this Committee.</p>

<p>I was just taking the example of languages in South-West Africa. The Coloured people in South-West Africa are all Afrikaans-speaking at this stage. The medium of instruction is Afrikaans. As far as the Nama schools are concerned, there are not really many teachers who are able to speak Nama. All the same, we do intend offering religious instruction in the Nama language, and one or two more subjects later on. We are making provision for children to be taught in the Nama language up to at least Std. 2&#x2014;whether we shall succeed in this, we do not know. And this is in addition to the two official languages. Clause 36 provides explicitly that anything I may do and any regulation I may promulgate, shall not deprive any parent of the right of final decision regarding the medium of instruction of a child. Therefore this is laid down in clause 36 (6) in the legislation. The factual situation as far as the Coloured people are concerned, however, is that generally Afrikaans is their home language at present and that they are taught mainly in Afrikaans, although the other official language is also taught there, as in all other schools.</p>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_5127-5128" refersTo="page_1027"/>To insert the following as a paragraph (p) to follow paragraph (o) of subsection (1):</block>

<ol>

<li>(p) as to the appointment of attendance officers in the case of the application of section 29 (2).</li>

</ol>

<p>The Minister&#x2019;s powers in terms of these regulations are very clearly specified. He has the power to appoint the inspectors, to admit pupils to schools, to discharge them and to exercise control over them while they are there. All these powers are specified. Clause 29 (2) deals with the implementation of the principle of compulsory schooling, wherever that happens to be possible in terms of the buildings and the teachers available, etc. In many areas in a territory like South-West, the parents themselves may very well fall short of their duty and fail to see to it that their children attend school regularly. I would go so far as to say, since we are dealing with realities here, that some of these parents may well be illiterate and be quite unaware of the penalties that are involved in terms of the law, to the effect that they have to send their children to school. The penalties involved are very high. They are higher now in terms of this Bill than they were in Act 47 of 1963, which applies to the Coloured people of the Republic. On a first offence any parents who fail to send their children to school, where compulsory schooling has been introduced, are subject to a R50 fine or three months&#x2019; imprisonment. For a second offence the penalty is a R100 fine or six months&#x2019; imprisonment. Many of these, with due respect, may well be people who do not really understand the system; they do not really know what it is all about; they have not been accustomed to sending their children off regularly to school. I know, Sir, and you know, that the school principal in the last resort is responsible for seeing to it that the children do attend where there is compulsory schooling. But in an area such as South-West, which we are discussing now, where pupils may very well live quite a considerable distance from their school the principals will scarcely be able to rally all these pupils who may or may not turn up at school. In any event, the average school principal is so overburdened with work these days, including work of an administrative kind, that he is certainly not going to be able to see to this and deal with it adequately. I suggest that provision should specifically be made for an adequate staff of attendance officers to make compulsory schooling workable. My point is this: Who is going to enforce this law&#x003F; The last thing that should be done is to involve the Police in this matter in any way. This is why we are thinking in terms of putting it into the Statute that the Government shall appoint attendance officers. It would be most unfortunate if the Police were involved, because it could lead to trouble and unnecessary unpleasantness if, failing anyone else, they have to see that the compulsory provisions are enforced. On those grounds we would like to see incorporated in the legislation some specific provision for attendance officers.</p>

<p>In other words, it comes into operation only where any doubt exists as to the matter. The position is not, as I thought originally, that the choice is left to the parent to decide in which medium the child is to be instructed.

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I please ask for the privilege of the half-hour.</p>

<p>The first point to which I should like to draw attention this afternoon, is the position which the Prime Minister occupies in the Government of South Africa. He is undoubtedly the person who has the most power; he appoints the Ministers and he can dismiss Ministers. He is the final arbiter of national policy. It is in that capacity of his that I want to take up a matter with him this afternoon, one which I regard as one of the most important and pressing problems facing South Africa at the moment, and that is the economic policy being followed by this Government at the present time.</p>

<p>We are used to the Government&#x2019;s tactics of trying to run away from any discussion of the country&#x2019;s economic situation and to their attempts at distracting attention from it by setting up false beacons. In Brakpan, as we still remember, the false beacon was that the United Party did not want to put its heart and soul into fighting communism and terrorism, and now, with a view to Oudtshoorn, the false beacon is an attempt at reviving racial hatred and racialism&#x2014;an outrage towards South Africa, which makes every responsible South African shudder. In view of what happened here last week, the Prime Minister is called upon to clear up this matter, but we cannot allow him to run away, too, from a discussion of the bad economic situation of South Africa. He is the final authority in the Government and he has to account for the things which are so manifestly wrong in the economy of South Africa, under which so many people suffer, especially the ordinary citizen, the person with a fixed income, the aged, and the newlyweds. Before we deal with anything else, he must first discuss this matter with us. His responsibility is even greater because of the failure of his party&#x2019;s financial group and his Minister of Finance to reply to the criticism which had come from this side. [Laughter.] Sir, hon. members on that side laugh. Yesterday when the hon. the Minister delivered his reply, they sat here fast asleep. He battled for an hour, but achieved nothing. In places he revealed complete confusion.</p>

<p>For example, he tried ridiculing us because our speakers had pointed out that the economy was advancing ever more slowly, while prices were rising ever more rapidly. To him this seemed to be a contradiction, but it was not, Mr. Chairman. The biggest problem of South Africa is the very fact that economic growth is being retarded in the midst of inflation, an unfortunate phenomenon which economists strikingly describe as &#x201C;stagflation&#x201D;. If the Minister of Finance is unable to see this dangerous phenomenon, then one must wonder how competent this Government is to govern South Africa in these difficult days. Sir, I have already warned before that this Government is completely incompetent to handle our economy. On various occasions I have sounded the particular warning that unless it handled our economic affairs correctly, we would lose control of the relations question in South Africa, and this applies not only to relations between Whites and non-Whites, but also to relations between Whites and Whites, for there is one thing about which the hon. the Prime Minister and I may have no argument, whether we apply his solution or my solution to South Africa &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I warned, as I have just said, and what happened&#x003F; The cost of living has increased enormously, and it is still increasing. Our standards of living have not kept pace with the rise in the standards of living of countries in Europe from which we expect immigrants, and it is falling more and more behind. Do we have the necessary money, Sir, to safeguard ourselves in a dangerous world&#x003F; Is our economy strong enough to deter our enemies in a dangerous world&#x003F; What happened this Session&#x003F; These Budgets were presented, all with the same feature, i.e. a large unexpected deficit.</p>

<p>I say &#x201C;large&#x201D; because it is clear that the Minister of Finance tried to conceal his deficit by juggling the figures. The second feature was that reserves were either depleted or were being depleted, and all three gambled on the revival of the economy, although the Minister of Railways did not seem to be too happy about it. But what is even worse, is the fact that the main Budget left us with a series of unsolved problems. Businessmen and industrialists must plan in advance. What particulars did they obtain from the Minister&#x003F; Last year they were up against an increase of approximately 7 per cent in the cost of living which, of course, diminished the buying power of their customers, and a growth rate, not of 5&#x00BD; per cent as envisaged by the E.D.P.&#x2014;not even of 4 per cent which others anticipated&#x2014;but of approximately 3,7 per cent. Now, what is the forecast for this year&#x003F; On what basis must the businessmen and the industrialists plan&#x003F; What is John Citizen to expect&#x003F; What did we get from the hon. the Minister&#x003F; We did not get any forecast of the growth rate for this year, or of the growth rate he is striving to achieve. Neither did we get any forecast of the rate of inflation, or to what extent he believes he will be able to curb it. We did not get any dynamic plan for the future. What we got, was some relaxing here and some tightening there; there was some nibbling at the whole problem, but no vigorous action.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Now, what are the results going to be, and how do they affect the responsibility of the hon. the Prime Minister&#x003F; First of all, the growth in our living standards is not going to keep pace with the growth in living standards <i>per capita</i> in Europe, As I have warned before, it is going to become increasingly difficult for us to attract immigrants to South Africa. We may even once again lose some of our valuable people who will be drawn to higher standards overseas. Secondly, the growth rate of last year, and the sort of growth rate which seems to be envisaged at the moment for this year, are not going to be able to create work opportunities, not only for the Bantu coming on to the labour market, but also for the Coloureds coming on to the labour market.</p>

<p>Let me warn the hon. the Prime Minister. There are those who are forecasting already that unless we have a growth rate of at least 6 per cent there is going to be growing unemployment among both the Bantu and the Coloureds by next year, 1973. Thirdly, while this Budget may promote some growth I do not believe it is going to cope with the inflationary pressures adequately to prevent the country being faced with a spate of claims for wage and salary increases before the end of the year, with ever-growing burdens on the ordinary man in the street. Fourthly, the concessions made in respect of our labour pattern, and the additional use of our labour, may help us to take up some surplus capacity in industry, but it certainly will not provide a long-term answer to the problems with which the South African economy is faced at present. Fifthly, the decline in the tempo of industrial development in our existing industrial complexes is going to leave the Government with a shortage of funds, a shortage of funds for the development of the Bantu homelands, a shortage of funds for the decentralization of industry and, in fact, for the whole fabric on which this Government&#x2019;s non-White policy is based. Sixthly, the revised taxation schedules, giving with the one hand and taking with the other hand, giving a minimal relief, are going to be totally inadequate to get the best out of our entrepreneurial and executive classes in South Africa.</p>

<p>All this means only one thing to me, and that is that there is serious trouble for South Africa and all its people ahead unless proper steps are taken and taken quickly. I believe that the position is so serious that I am going to put five questions to the hon. the Prime Minister this <span class="col_5133-5134" refersTo="page_1030"/>afternoon, questions which I believe need urgent and clear replies. I believe that he, as head of the Government, cannot shirk his responsibility in respect of these questions.</p>

<p>The first thing I want to know from him is whether it is still the policy of his Government to reduce the number of Bantu in the White areas regardless of the consequences. I have already indicated that the generation of funds for the decentralization of industry, the development of the homelands and the infra-structure in the border areas depend on the prosperity and growth in the existing industrial areas. I must describe them as economic power stations of South Africa. They provide the power for development not only in the White areas, but also in the Bantu areas of South Africa. If their sources of labour are limited and their development is frozen, they are not going to develop sufficient power for development elsewhere for the carrying out of the policies to which the hon. the Prime Minister is committed.</p>

<p>The second question concerns the plans, if any, which this Government has for the rapid training of our labour forces, Whites and non-Whites, to produce an adequately trained and productive labour force to compete with sophisticated labour forces elsewhere in the world. I want to say at once that the steps so far announced are totally and utterly inadequate to achieve that objective; nor have they any chance whatever of succeeding in so far as the Bantu are concerned as long as we are trying to train craftsmen who are chained to the migratory labour system, a system which means that they are available for a maximum of 12 months at a time and then must return to the homelands before they can resume their work in the White areas. This applies to all the Bantu other than those who are protected under section 10 and those in the border industries.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. the Prime Minister now that I do not want to be put off with fatuous talk about this being the responsibility of the employers of labour in South Africa. This is a national problem which must be tackled on a national basis; it must be tackled by the Government of the day in the full knowledge that employers can only move within the ambit of Government policy.</p>

<p>There is a third question I want to put to the hon. the Prime Minister. It concerns the use of non-White labour in jobs previously done by Whites. We know that the Government claims that its policy is the controlled use of non-White labour in jobs previously done by Whites, in consultation with the trade unions. I suspect sometimes that they have tried to borrow that from the United Party. What is the control that is going to be exercised&#x003F; Is the Government going to control this problem in a weak, half-hearted manner, or is it going to go ahead in a determined effort to improve the productivity of the whole labour force, as the ultimate answer to the problems of inflation or a bigger internal market and a bigger export market&#x003F; There have been some answers from the hon. the Minister of Labour in the Other Place. We want the hon. the Prime Minister to give us an answer. There are enormous benefits awaiting this country if only it would employ all its labour resources to the best advantage. We know, of course, that for various reasons there are problems associated with the increased use and higher training of non-Whites, problems which can only be sorted out if there is proper consultation and all parties put their cards openly on the table and discussion is frank and open. I believe the success of such negotiation depends 100 per cent on a clearly defined programme of Government objectives and, in the first place, on maximum development of the economy and the increasing use of non-Whites on an orderly basis and with the approval of the trade unions in the second place. I know that Tucsa has already called for the establishment of bodies throughout South Africa, on a nation-wide basis, to gather the facts and to be in the position to help and advise with labour negotiations on these issues. Without accepting the responsibility for the guidance of these bodies under a clearly defined policy, the Government can be the instrument of chaos, chaos in the ranks of labour and chaos in the ranks of the employers as well, where similar difficulties can arise. This, I believe, is going to be the final consequence of the position as it exists now. The hon. the Minister of Finance seems to have vaguely indicated that businessmen have the responsibility of employing additional non-White labour in jobs previously done by Whites.</p>

<p>I come to the fourth question. I want to know from the hon. the Prime Minister whether at a time like this, at a time when we are faced with a slowing up in our growth rate and a time when we are falling <span class="col_5135-5136" refersTo="page_1031"/>behind in the <i>per capita</i> increase in the living standards of the countries of the Western world, the Government is going to continue to spend precious money and use even more precious labour&#x2014;particularly trained labour&#x2014;for the creation of infrastructures for the decentralization of industry exclusively for ideological purposes.</p>

<p>Fifthly, we want to know&#x2014;and I believe industrialists throughout South Africa want to know&#x2014;whether the relaxations forecast in the provisions of the Physical Resources and Planning Act, as announced by the Minister of Finance, are final, or whether further relaxations will be granted. Will those relaxations granted be temporary, or will they be final&#x003F; What is the position&#x003F; Are those industrialists who expand and who allow the greater use of Bantu labour in those areas to which the Act applies, going to be able to rely on additional use of Bantu labour in the future, or will the Act always be hanging over their heads as a source of uncertainty and as a source of frustration in the future&#x003F; I put these questions to the hon. the Prime Minister, because he will appreciate that the answers not only involve the Minister of Finance, but also the Minister of Labour, the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, the Minister of Planning, and the three or four Ministers responsible for the education of the various groups of our population. That means that lack of cooperation on the part of anyone, a lack of co-operation in a coherent and clearly defined policy, can create bottlenecks which could cause chaos, uncertainty and insecurity. This could be fatal to peaceful economic progress and the future of our country. It is no good planning for relaxations under the Planning Act if you find that the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development does not want to make the labour available. It is no good the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development making labour available where it cannot be absorbed because of the activities of other Ministers elsewhere, while there is again a shortage in the labour force needed for the development of South Africa in other regions.</p>

<p>I believe that my analysis of our problems and the questions which I have put to the hon. the Prime Minister, indicate how heavy his responsibility is to the overall co-ordinated planning and for the policies which are necessary to solve our human problems in South Africa today. His Cabinet should be a delicately attuned symphony orchestra acting in harmony under his baton. I want to tell him that at the moment they seem to me more like a rag-time band notable for their disharmony. I hope the hon. gentleman will show the nation that he is capable of accepting this responsibility by dealing with this part of our debate very explicitly and very clearly so that every entrepreneur and every trade union leader, indeed every businessman in South Africa, will know exactly what his position is and can have clear guide lines for his plans for the growth and prosperity of South Africa.</p>

<p>In putting these plans to the hon. gentleman, I want to remind him once again of three things. The first is that the success of any non-White policy in South Africa will depend on economic prosperity and increased living standards, increased living standards not in a vacuum but increased living standards in comparison with the countries of the rest of the world. The second thing of which I want to remind the hon. the Prime Minister, is that our security in a dangerous world depends upon our economic strength and the defensive instruments which that economic strength can command for South Africa. Thirdly, the greatest bulwark against Communism in the world of today is a prosperous and a satisfied community. I want to warn the hon. the Prime Minister that the widening gap between the incomes of the different races in South Africa may be the gap through which Communism will breach the defenses of South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is very clear to me that if there is one disappointed man in this House, it is my hon. friend the Leader of the Opposition. The way in which he started this debate showed me only too clearly exactly how disappointed he is. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition made the statement&#x2014;we all know it is correct&#x2014;that in the final instance I am responsible for all my colleagues. I want to tell him that I gladly accept that responsibility. He said I was responsible for the actions of my hon. friend the Minister of Finance. I want to say to him that it is a proud responsibility I take upon myself. In passing I want to say that in the years in which this Minister has been sitting in this House of Assembly and in the years in which he has handled important portfolios, he has rendered invaluable services <span class="col_5137-5138" refersTo="page_1032"/>to South Africa. I want to say to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that the Budget which the hon. the Minister of Finance has introduced once again, bears the stamp of a Budget handled by a man who not only knows what he is doing, but I am expressing it as my conviction that there are very few people, if any, who would have been able to emulate him in this. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>It is of no avail if we laugh about it contemptuously; let us reason out the matter with each other across the floor of this House like fair-minded, reasonable people.

<p>&#x2026; but I only wish you could have been sitting here in my bench to see how you looked. This is my opinion; but let us leave it at that now. I have a very high regard for the Minister, while the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has a low opinion of him. But surely we need not judge only on my opinion and on his. Surely it has been our experience in the past year in particular that the various economic interest groups in this country, whether their orientation be Afrikaans speaking or English speaking, have not on one single occasion hesitated to say candidly what they thought of Government action and what their standpoint was in respect of economic affairs in South Africa. We had a Budget which was introduced against the background of not only very difficult circumstances in South Africa, but also extremely difficult international economic conditions, circumstances which have affected all countries of the world intimately, which are continuing to do so and, as the hon. the Minister indicated, will continue to do so in the future. The hon. the Minister introduced his Budget and neither the hon. the Leader of the Opposition nor hon. members opposite, who in the past have let no opportunity pass of quoting some or other person or of citing some or other businessman against us, have been able to cite any business interests, business groups, business organizations or economists of repute against us in respect of this Budget. Surely it is my duty to take note of what the Chamber of Industries says. Only this afternoon, between one o&#x2019;clock and two o&#x2019;clock, I was listening to what the economist of the Chamber of Industries said here in Cape Town this morning, namely that as a result of this Budget there was every reason to be optimistic about the economic future of South Africa.</p>

<p>In addition, I listened to what the Chamber of Commerce and the Sakekamers had to say. I have listened to the standpoints of all possible interest groups, and what was the keynote of these&#x003F; As my friend the hon. the Minister of Finance said, some of them said that they would have liked to have seen the Budget take this or that form, but this is natural and goes without saying. However, what was the keynote of this criticism, which did not emanate from politicians who wanted to make political capital out of the matter, but emanated from economists and business institutions&#x003F; The keynote was that the Minister had not only introduced a good Budget, but had once again laid the foundation for growth in South Africa, and that South Africa had reason to be optimistic. It is probably a long time since there has been such appreciation for a Budget among businessmen as that which appears from the comments which have been made on this year&#x2019;s Budget. Who am I and the <span class="col_5139-5140" refersTo="page_1033"/>Leader of the Opposition to have a great deal to say about this Budget if these are the comments of the people intimately affected by this Budget&#x003F; It is clear to me that the Leader of the Opposition is very disappointed. After all, the Opposition prematurely took delight in saying how badly South Africa was faring. They prematurely took delight in saying in what a predicament this Government had landed the economy of South Africa. What are they doing now&#x003F; It is true that in recent years there has been a deceleration in growth. We all know this. But surely it is not the first time this has happened. It happened in 1968 as well. The figure for 1968 is approximately the same as for the year which has just passed. This has happened before too. And yet, in spite of the fact that it happened in one single year, 1968, we maintained a growth rate of 6 per cent for the 1960s, as compared with the 5 per cent for the decade from 1950 to 1960 and 4 per cent for the decade from 1940 to 1950. Surely these are the economic facts with which we are faced. On what grounds can the hon. the Leader of the Opposition presume to reproach us in this regard&#x003F; To me it is an indication of disappointment on the part of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition.</p>

<p>Since he has levelled the charge at me, let us look at South Africa for one moment now. We took over the government in 1948. Many hon. members sitting in this House know little about 1948, because they were still young then. But fortunately we still have the figures, although our memories have become vague. Relatively speaking, South Africa was an undeveloped country in the economic sphere in 1948. Not only was South Africa poorly developed in 1948, but my hon. friends sitting on the opposite side had no confidence in its industrial and economic future.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; and unfair, but I shall prove the truth of it to him. The GATT agreement was negotiated by the United Party in the 1940s. Even today we are still paying as a result of the terms they negotiated in that GATT agreement. We are paying for that because the United Party adopted the attitude that South Africa did not have an industrial future, but only an agricultural future. They adopted the attitude that in that GATT agreement the emphasis should at all times be placed on South Africa being an industrial country, and no terms were negotiated with a view to the establishment of industries here in South Africa. They regarded South Africa as an agricultural country, but they saw no chance for the industrial development on the economic front. Surely this is an obvious fact, and nobody can deny it at all.</p>

<p>I am saying that South Africa was comparatively undeveloped in those years, and in that regard we need not rely on guesswork again. We need merely look at the figures again today. I, as the responsible person in this regard, must satisfy myself whether the National Party has acted in the interests of South Africa and whether the Ministers for whom I am responsible have guided that development into the right channels. And, Sir, I have satisfied myself of that. What do the figures tell me&#x003F; The figures tell me that in 1947-&#x2019;46 we had a Budget of R349 million. That was the Budget strength of South Africa in 1947-&#x2019;48. I must point out to hon. members opposite that we were handicapped by the GATT agreement, that they rallied the world against us when we took over and that they held out no idealism and no hope for the future. Their propaganda was : Because this Government has taken over, the banks will close and the feet of the unemployed will resound in the streets. This, Sir, was the message they conveyed to the outside world about South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it is old stuff, but it is true. Bad medicine remains good for hon. members opposite. In spite of those facts which we opposed&#x2014;in fact, one can see it for oneself in the figures&#x2014; we have developed South Africa. Naturally, things developed slower initially, because there was a very great deal we had to rectify. Thus one finds that 10 years later that R349 million had become R698 million. The figure had almost been doubled, but things nevertheless proceeded at a slow pace initially. Ten years later, in 1967-&#x2019;68, a figure of R1 956 million was reached; and four years later, the figure of R3 648 million was reached. In other words, in slightly more than two decades, it has increased to that extent, but in spite of this, that side is accusing the Government of being incompetent; it is accusing the Ministers of the Government, especially the Minister of Finance, of being incompetent, and what do we find&#x003F; We find that thanks to my predecessors, and thanks to this Minister and his predecessors, we were able to increase a Budget of R349 million in 1947-&#x2019;48 to R3 648 million slightly more than two decades later.</p>

<p>Let us go further. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition levelled a further accusation at me. He accused me and my hon. friend, as well as the National Party and my predecessors, of not having ensured proper standards of living for our people. If this were true, it would be a very serious matter. But let us see how true this economic argument of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is. We have not merely remained even, if one takes 1948 as a basis; we have not merely added the cost of living to salaries. We have raised the standard of living of the people in South Africa, Whites and non-Whites, in an unparallelled way. Again it is not necessary that my word or someone else&#x2019;s has to be accepted for that. We can merely look at the figures. As a basis, we may take the figure so often used by hon. members opposite, namely that the rand of today is worth only 40 cents as compared with that of 1948. I am prepared to accept that figure of 40 cents for the purposes of my argument. In the first place I want to say this, then: It is obvious that the cost of living has risen, not only in South Africa, but throughout the world. It is obvious that the value of money has decreased; the penny is no longer the penny it was in 1900. This applies throughout the world. The point is not whether the standard of living has risen. The point &#x2014;and I must satisfy myself on this&#x2014;is not that the cost of living has increased; the point is whether salaries and wages have kept pace with the increase in the cost of living. The point is not merely whether the cost of living has increased; the question is whether the standards of living of the people have risen in spite of that increase and whether they have been able to pay it. What do the figures tell me, Sir, because I have to satisfy myself on this score&#x003F; In order to satisfy myself on this score, I examined the position in respect of different categories of people in order to see what they received from the United Party in 1948 and what they receive from this Government. We can look at any aspect whatsoever; let us look at the position of a bricklayer. The hon. member levelled the reproach at me that we are prejudicing the standard of living of our people and that, economically, we are not looking after our people. We have heard several times from hon. members opposite that we should go back to the economy of 1948.</p>

<p>Sir, I called for the various figures in order to see what the answer is. The answer is that under the United Party the average wage of a bricklayer was R21-67 per week in September, 1946. The average wage for a bricklayer in 1972 was given to me as R82-33 per week. It has increased from R21 to R82; that is the average. Accepting that the rand of 1948 is worth 40 cents now, hon. members may work out for themselves what the position is. Let us take the case of a motor mechanic. I shall leave out the cents for the moment; his weekly wage was R17 per week; now his average wage is R64 per week. I take the case of a police constable; a police constable younger than 18 years received R30 per month under those hon. members, and if he was 18 years or older, he received R33 per month. That same police constable is not receiving R30 per month and R33 per month now; he receives R110 per month and R130 per month now.</p>

In their time a teacher in the lowest category received only R45 per month; under us, a teacher in the lowest category receives R190 per month; in their time the salary of the teacher in the highest category&#x2014;this was the maximum on which one could start&#x2014;was R70 per month, and now it is R325 per month. Sir, let us see how they treated the female teachers. In their time the starting salary of a female teacher was only R36 per month; now she receives R145 per month. In the highest category they received R56 per month; now they receive R1 560 per year, i.e. R295 per month.</p>

<p>I did not say that. I said that female teachers in the highest category received R295 per month. In their time the female teachers in the highest category received R56 per month, i.e. R680 per year, and in our case it is R3 540 per year, which works out at R295 per month. Sir, let us forget about all these other people for a moment. Let us take the matriculant, who is the basic unit in the Public Service, in the banks and in all undertakings. Let us see what prospects they offered a matriculant in the Public Service, and what the position is today. In their time a matriculated male clerk received R36 per month in the Public Service. Under us he starts on R130 per month in this year of 1972. Lastly, let us look at nurses, and then we will have dealt with the entire spectrum. In their time a White student nurse received the princely salary of R27 per month.</p>

<p>I maintain that there is no unemployment in the homelands, and I maintain that there is no unemployment outside the homelands. To tell the truth, there are many people who think that we are building up a tremendous shortage as far as Black labour is concerned; there are many people who are concerned about that. I want to say to South Africa and, for that matter, to hon. members opposite that they need not be concerned about unemployment. Even they will have enough to do as long as this Government rules South Africa. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition is merely making a statement. He adduces no proof for it. He merely makes the statement that &#x201C;our living standards are falling behind&#x201D;. On what grounds he says this I do not know. He adduced no proof for it at all, and he cannot do so either. But what is the &#x201C;serious trouble&#x201D;&#x003F; Why does the hon. member use these words, i.e. &#x201C;serious trouble&#x201D; that is in store for us&#x003F; These are difficult days, most certainly, but surely the hon. the Leader knows as well as I do that, as far as these problems are concerned, the necessary measures are being taken by this side of the House.

<p>One can never do enough, but when the United Party was in power, there was nothing. [Interjections.] Let me give hon. members an example, since they are annoyed about my statement. I used to live in Brakpan. At that time it was a town with 25 000 White inhabitants. Until the National Party took over in the Transvaal in 1949, there was not a single high school for Afrikaansor English-speaking children in that town. Do hon. members know this&#x003F; Twenty-five thousand White inhabitants and there was not a high school for Afrikaans and English children in the whole of that town! Today there are no fewer than five for Afrikaans and English children in that town. These, then, are the hon. members who want to come and talk here! We are training not only the Whites, but also the non-Whites. To tell the truth, the accusation is levelled at us by the allies of the United Party that we are doing too much for the non-Whites in that regard. What is more&#x2014;and I still want to say something to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition about this&#x2014;not only do the Hertzogites, their allies, level that accusation at us, but the United Party itself does so too. Do we then not have it on record&#x2014;the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has still not replied to it, and in this Budget debate I shall insist than he give me a reply&#x2014;that the Leader of the United Party in South-West Africa, the Hon.

What nonsense is that&#x003F; In the first place, that infrastructure must be established, whether it be next to the Bantu areas, within the Bantu areas or in the White areas. Our policy is very clear, because we are serious about it and because we want to retain the non-White in his homeland. It is very clear because we have viewed the matter from all angles&#x2014;from the economic angle, the sociological angle and ethnological angle. We saw that, viewed from those angles, it is better for the Bantu to remain in his homeland and work there if this can be done. I am not apologizing to hon. members opposite or to anyone for the fact that I am spending money in order to develop the infrastructure near the homelands or within the homelands.

<p>The hon. the Leader asked me whether the relaxations were temporary or permanent. The White Paper sets it out very clearly. After all, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition can read and he heard what the Minister said in his Budget speech.

<p>The hon. gentleman says, &#x201C;Why did we then enter into the agreement&#x003F;&#x201D; The hon. the Prime Minister knows there have been opportunities for revision of that agreement over the years. Why have there not been revisions&#x003F; The hon. the Prime Minister knows that. It was taken up the other day with the hon. the Minister of Finance. The hon. gentleman knows that very well.</p>

<p>He has set out to show that when one looks at wages, people are being paid more today than they were in those days when one has regard to the value of money. The value of money is not everything. The question is: What share have those people had in the prosperity of South Africa&#x003F; Here you have a national income multiplied ten or eleven times, but where is there an increase here of ten or eleven times of what it was 25 or 26 years ago&#x003F; So, I do not think these increases reflect all that credit on the hon. gentleman and those who are working with him.</p>

<p>Then the hon. gentleman asks: Who has developed South Africa&#x003F; Mr. Chairman, who laid the foundation for the development of South Africa&#x003F; It is the United Party with the plans it made during the wax years with its economic advisory council and the wonderful reports that were put in on which this Government build.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister has challenged me to show that living standards have not risen faster in the Republic than elsewhere. I am speaking from memory, but I have the figures with me in one of these files. But as I remember the situation according to the Reserve Bank figures, in the ten-year period, 1958-&#x2019;68, the standard of living <i>per capita</i> rose in South Africa approximately 2,5 per cent per annum.</p>

<p>2,4 per annum. In Great Britain it rose approximately 2,5 per cent per annum. In the countries of the European Economic Community they rose approximately 5 per cent per annum and in Japan they rose approximately 10 per cent per annum. That is why I said to the hon. the Prime Minister that our living standards were falling behind the increase in living standards in the countries of Western Europe from which we hope to get our immigrants.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>It seems to me that with the present situation, we are falling further behind the increase in living standards of Europe at the present time. We have no figures from the hon. the Minister of Finance of his expectations for the coming year. We have no idea what he is envisaging by way of a growth rate. It seems to me that my case is made and the case of the hon. the Prime Minister lacks any proof whatever.</p>

<p>We have had our differences about unemployment. We are always in an unhappy situation when unemployment is discussed in this House. We are in an unhappy <span class="col_5151-5152" refersTo="page_1039"/>situation because we have no figures in respect of the Bantu homelands. Time and again we have asked the hon. the Minister for figures concerning Bantu unemployment in South Africa, but all we get are the figures of registered Bantu unemployed, which are the figures of those who take the trouble to register in the urban areas. On the figures given to us by one of these hon. Ministers only the other day, he believes that the population of the Bantu townships is far greater than what the official figures are. I believe he is correct; I believe that there are vast numbers of Bantu in those townships, fair above the figure which is authorized. I believe that the hon. the Prime Minister will find that he will be very surprised to see what the extent of unemployment is in some of those townships. I have visited some; I visited one outside East London which I believe is carrying 50 per cent more people in it than what the population was intended to be. I believe that a very high percentage of that extra 50 per cent are unemployed. But he will not find them in the figures of the registered unemployed Bantu in South Africa. It gives me no pleasure to take this up with the hon. the Prime Minister; it is a source of great regret to me, but I feel the time has come to say quite straightly and honestly across the floor of this House that it is no use coming to us with figures of registered unemployed Bantu, while no attempt is made to give us the unemployment figures in the Bantu homelands and of those in the townships who are avoiding registration or are in excess of the population at the present time.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister replied to my five questions. The first question had to do with the reduction in the number of Bantu in the White urban areas. He said, of course, that he was making no projections and forecasts in respect of 1978, but that there will be no removal of Bantu if it led to a disruption of industry. I understand that, but what we are worried about is not the disruption of existing industries, but about the growth of the existing industrial areas to give sufficient power and strength to the development of the future of South Africa. The second matter I took up with the hon. gentleman was the training of employees, White and non-White, in order to enable us to compete with sophisticated labour forces in other parts of the world. The hon. gentleman said that the United Party had done nothing. Has he never heard of the COTT scheme&#x003F; Has he never heard of what was done in the war years&#x003F; Did he never hear of those things&#x003F; He talks today about the tremendous amount that is being done. The last figure I have shows that there are only 3 676 Bantu in the whole of the Republic getting technical and vocational training. This figure is in respect of March, 1971. The Prime Minister then dealt with the question of non-Whites doing the work of Whites and he said that we had received a reply already. That is one of our troubles. We have had conflicting replies. I leave this matter to members of the labour group to deal with. He went on to say that no matter how difficult the situation may be at the present time, he was going to continue with the decentralization programme, because he believed in it and asked whether we also believed in the development of the Bantu homelands. Of course, we believe in the development of the Bantu homelands, but just because of this very difficulty we suggested that it should be done with private White capital. The hon. the Prime Minister and his Government would not face up to that and have now reached the stage where they talk about development on an agency basis.</p>

<p>I agree that in the life of the Government the change has been marked. It is now development on an agency basis, whatever it was before. But until the Government gets around to align development on the basis of private White capital and initiative going into those homelands, we are going to remain as we are today with minimal development and with the suspicion that there is a vast amount of unemployment in those areas. The hon. gentleman also replied to my last question and indicated that the dispensation depended upon the type of industry. I think we are at cross purposes here. The hon. the Minister of Finance talked about dispensation for industries very largely engaged in exporting &#x2026; [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, if a Leader of an Opposition ever talked himself out of a position, then the hon. the Leader of the Opposition talked himself out of one this afternoon; for what a plaintive display did <span class="col_5153-5154" refersTo="page_1040"/>we not have from the hon. Leader this afternoon! While I concede that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is a gentleman, and a good man. I sat here this afternoon wondering whether one would not feel slightly ashamed if he had to be one&#x2019;s Prime Minister. I know that is a harsh word, but it is true. What have we had here this afternoon&#x003F;</p>

<p>Last week we discussed finances in this House in the Budget debate. Yesterday afternoon those hon. members sat there as if mummified while the Minister of Finance discussed finances here. After the Budget debate and the reply yesterday&#x2014;I wonder whether this is not the first time in history this has happened&#x2014;the hon. the Leader of the Opposition stood up and tried to turn this debate into a financial debate. Why did he do that&#x003F; For one reason; he must steer clear of certain matters. He grabbed at this subject this afternoon as a fig-leaf. Therefore what you saw here this afternoon was the hon. the Leader of the Opposition running awry. While my people are asking for bread, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition offered them a stone this afternoon. His conduct here this afternoon reminded me of what Dr. Malan once said. Listen now to how applicable this is to that hon. Leader, with his feet of clay. I quote (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You have allowed yourself to be led to believe, Dr. Malan said, that to allow a people to live, it is enough to ensure them their bread and butter. You have buried your idealism. You have looked askance at what you have loved, to call it sentiment, and in doing so you have encouraged the alien who detests your own nationhood to his own advantage. It did not occur to you that a people cannot, just as an individual cannot, live by bread alone. You have forgotten that it is ideals, and ideals alone, which can inspire deeds of self-sacrifice. You have forgotten that sentiment is like cement, and that its dying out is the most certain way to national disintegration and death, for only a nation with a soul is immortal. A nation without a soul is no nation at all, and has therefore no future either.</block>

<p>Sir, if we want to discuss economic matters, I can discuss them with you. Here you have <i>Tegniek.</i> I quote (translation): &#x201C;New upsurge expected&#x2014;Budget arouses optimism.&#x201D; They say that we may expect a growth rate of 5 per cent to 6 per cent this year. But what do we have from the Opposition&#x003F; While we are asking for life for our people, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition makes this pitiful performance.</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa will never be the same after Brakpan. February, 23rd, will go down in history.</block>

<p>Now, you must hear what this person wrote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A change of Government would, of course, change every aspect of South African life. The United Party estimated it would take it at least three sessions of Parliament to repeal all the restrictive laws passed by the Nationalist Government since 1948.</block>

<p>They must still tell us which &#x201C;restrictive laws&#x201D; they are going to repeal. But that is not what I want to spend time on. Listen to this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There will be an upheaval in the Civil Service. The United Party is on record as saying that it would rid the Government of all Broederbonders; about 4 000 of them are firmly entrenched in virtually all the top jobs in the Civil Service.</block>

<p>Now, you must hear what they have to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One of the first problems we will have to deal with will be pollution, a United <span class="col_5155-5156" refersTo="page_1041"/>Party M.P. said this week. Can you imagine all the secret documents burnt in Pretoria and Cape Town that night when the Nationalist Government falls out&#x003F;</block>

<p>Sir, what does that mean&#x003F; There are people who, according to those hon. members, will be kicked out of the &#x201C;top jobs&#x201D; in the Civil Service, when they come into power. These are Afrikaners. (Interjections.] These are decent ordinary Afrikaner people for whom they have no time at all, and whom they do not care about in the least. They do not mind saying that when they come into power, they are going to put those people out in the street. They talk about the Bantu and the Indians who have to be given work, but in respect of my people, my Afrikaner people, they say that they will put 4 000 of them out of their jobs; it makes no difference what becomes of their wives and children. Sir, I think it is a disgrace to adopt that kind of attitude. [Interjections.] Sir, I shall continue to quote from this passage&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The future of Afrikaans concerns doing extensive business with the Government will be bleak indeed when the Nats are toppled. <i>Die Transvaler,</i> the party&#x2019;s official mouthpiece in the Transvaal, makes only a small profit as a newspaper; its backbone is the school books and Government printing contracts, and when the Nationalist Government is toppled, they will have a bleak future indeed &#x2026; <i>Afrikaanse Pers</i> has a R2 million printing contract for telephone directories, and <i>Nasionale Pers</i> and its subsidiaries have also made hundreds of thousands of rands from prescribed books since the Nationalists came into power.</block>

<p>Then they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa will never be the same after February 23rd.</block>

<p>In other words they say openly in this Sunday newspaper that those Afrikaans business concerns will be dealt with in this way by the United Party when it comes into power.</p>

<p>&#x2026; it is quite clear that hon. members on the other side of the House are back to the tactics which they employed in the Budget debate. The hon. <span class="col_5157-5158" refersTo="page_1042"/>member who has just sat down started by saying, &#x201C;We have had a whole week,&#x201D; and then he stopped; he was going to say, &#x201C;&#x2026; a whole week to discuss financial matters&#x201D;, and then suddenly the realization percolated into his brain that we had had only one day to discuss financial matters before the hon. the Minister of Labour turned the debate into a real &#x201C;skiet en donder&#x201D; one. Sir, as far as I am concerned, we will stick to the matter that really concerns the people of South Africa, economics, and not Oudtshoorn, which will be dead duck by Thursday evening.</p>

<p>Sir, I have listened here now to two speeches, one by the hon. the Prime Minister and one by the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education, and I ask myself what either of these speeches has contributed to the well-being of South Africa, and regretfully I have to say that they have contributed nothing whatsoever. The hon. the Prime Minister indulged in long historical surveys, going back to 1948 and going back to what Brakpan used to be, but he showed no concern for the present in South Africa and, what is worse, not only did he show no concern for the present, but he gave no thought whatsoever to the future. He praised the hon. the Minister of Finance, but as the Minister of Finance is not in the House I will leave this and deal with it under the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Vote. He then went on to say that conditions in the world were bad generally and that the hon. the Minister had produced this wonderful Budget in conditions which were bad here, as in the rest of the world. It is true that conditions throughout the world are not good, but we have told hon. members on that side of the House time and again that we are a young, developing country and that the conditions which apply to the older and well-established countries in the world do not apply in South Africa, and that if we had utilized all our resources of men and materials, we would have placed ourselves in a position to resist the onslaught from without. Instead of that, what happened&#x003F; As soon as things went sour overseas, we were completely pregnable; we could not stand up to the onslaught from without and before we knew what had happened we had to devalue. That is what the Government did to this country, and it is no good their going to the public and saying that devaluation is a wonderful thing. Devaluation is a step that you take as a last resort, and every economist knows it. The hon. the Prime Minister said that everybody had accepted this Budget of the hon. the Minister of Finance as something quite remarkable and quite outstanding and quite wonderful. Sir, what did the public really say&#x003F; They said that the hon. the Minister of Finance&#x2014;and I am giving the best construction that was placed on the Budget&#x2014; had acted as best he could within the scope of what he was able to do within the context of Nationalist Party politics. That is all he did. He did not come with a Budget that meant something to the country. He tried to flex his muscles as much as he could within the chains to which he has been bound during the past 11 years that I have been in this House. Sir, what is the question that everybody asks after they have given this faint praise&#x003F; They ask: Is it enough; will it do the trick; are things going to be better&#x003F;</p>

<p>Sir, my hon. leader dealt with certain vital economic issues and asked for certain answers. Our complaint against the Budget and the hon. the Minister of Finance is that he said much but told us little. Regretfully I have to say the same of the hon. the Prime Minister this afternoon. On the 29th of last month, until the 1st March, there was a meeting in Cape Town of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Economic Advisory Council. Following this meeting the Prime Minister issued his usual statement. This statement summed up the economic position of the country and assessed the immediate future in the following words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To sum up, it may be said that the Council is of the opinion that there are factors in the economy which are favourable to a renewed upsurge, although the problem areas indicated will continue to demand the attention of all parties. The situation undoubtedly calls for circumspection in the formulation of economic policy, but there is no reason why the South African economy should not soon show a satisfactory rate of growth again.</block>

<p>Sir, what does all this mean&#x003F; Is this a clear-cut, positive, dynamic statement of policy by the hon. the Prime Minister&#x003F; It is the same kind of verbiage that we had from the hon. the Minister of Finance &#x2014;words, words, words which are completely meaningless, which are absolute mumbo-jumbo. But there is one thing in this statement which is correct, Sir, and that is where it says on page 5&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_5159-5160" refersTo="page_1043"/>The Council noted with concern that industrial production did not perform satisfactorily during 1971.</block>

<p>This must have come as a great shock to the hon. the Prime Minister, because it was his hon. Minister of Finance who, looking at South Africa and its economy through his rose-coloured glasses, had been making optimistic statement after optimistic statement throughout 1971, until the truth became apparent to him when he had to prepare his own Budget and found that he had a deficit, which I still say amounted to R131.4 million. It is no good the hon. the Minister telling us that he had a balance of R72 million odd to begin with. Any industrial or financial company that goes to its shareholders and says, &#x201C;We have had an enormous loss this year, but don&#x2019;t worry, we have some reserves and everything is fine&#x201D;, would soon hear from its shareholder. Sir, 1971 has come and 1971 has gone, but what about 1972&#x003F; What did the hon. the Prime Minister say about 1972&#x003F; He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Council is agreed that South Africa could, with the necessary judicious economic policy, experience a moderate acceleration of growth rate during 1972, which could be the beginning of a new phase of a higher long-term rate of economic growth for the country.</block>

The growth rate in 1971 was 3,7 per cent; in 1970 it was 4,8 per cent. The projected growth rate for 1970 to 1975 of the Economic Development Programme is 5,5 per cent. In both 1970 and 1971 we have fallen behind the requirements of the Economic Development Programme. What we want to know from the hon. the Prime Minister, because the hon. the Minister of Finance will not tell us, is what his growth rate projection is for 1972. What is his projection in monetary terms, and what is his projection in real terms&#x003F; Perhaps we can get an answer from the hon. the Prime Minister to a question which I have asked the hon. the Minister of Finance five times and to which we cannot get an answer from him, and that is what he estimates the rate of inflation is going to be. By what percentage is the cost of living going to rise this year&#x003F; Sir, the public is entitled to know. We cannot work in the dark. The object of the hon. the Prime Minister is growth coupled with an acceptable rate of inflation. Sir, that is an object with which we agree but, for the benefit of the hon. the Minister of Finance, we do not want stagflation with a high rate of inflation and a low rate of growth. We want heating up of the economy to ensure a growth, with a cooling down of inflation by removing the factors that make for inflation; and that is what the hon. the Minister did not understand when he asked us about our hot policy and our cold policy&#x2014;hot for development and cold for inflation. Sir, what are the limits within which the private sector has to work&#x003F; Nobody tells us. There is no indication whatsoever from any source whatsoever as to what the projections are for 1972. What are we to aim at&#x003F; What are the objectives; what is the programme to attain these objectives&#x003F; Are we to wander around in a vacuum of ignorance&#x003F; The businessman, the entrepreneur, the financier, is supposed to sit behind his desk and plan to help the hon. the Prime Minister to increase the growth rate in this country and he wants to know what the limits are, what the guidelines are, what the boundaries are and where we are going. Not in one single word uttered by the hon. the Prime Minister or by the Minister of Finance can we find the answers. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>The hon. member, who has just resumed his seat, is resolved to continue the debate in connection with financial matters, but undoubtedly to his disadvantage. Notwithstanding all the optimism prevailing outside, the Opposition is now adopting a pessimistic tone, and I want to accuse them of doing this in a cool and calculating manner. If we look at the sad tidings we have heard from that side of the House since 1968, we find the following pattern: In February, 1968, the United Party issued notes for its speakers. I have a copy here in my hand, and they advised their speakers to concentrate on the &#x201C;White labour shortage, <span class="col_5161-5162" refersTo="page_1044"/>housing, pensions and grievances&#x201D;. That was in February, 1968, and after 1968 we had that tremendous upsurge in our economy, which they now want to use to their advantage. Again we find ourselves on the threshold of such an upsurge, and again we have these calculated sad tidings, which I say are intended to create a spirit of pessimism outside, and probably it is also being done with a view to canvassing a few votes at Oudtshoorn. I can say more about these notes that were compiled by a very intelligent and cunning person. Initially I thought it was the hon. member for Hillbrow, but to our amazement we later discovered it was the hon. member for Yeoville who compiled them. But I want to come to a much more serious matter than this one. I say that here there is calculated and cold-blooded action being taken to create a general spirit that can adversely affect the country&#x2019;s economy. I say that this borders on economic sabotage. Let us now look at the speech of the hon. the Deputy Minister, who has just resumed his seat. They asked for proof that the United Party are Afrikaner-haters. In my hand I have the minutes, the Hansard, of the debates and the Natal Provincial Council proceedings of November, 1971.</p>

<p>He is referring to Ministers who made responsible statements in connection with the danger on our borders, and he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Now if their statements are justified, and not just trying to rally the people to the cause, or whatever it may be, but if their feelings are justified then I say Mr. Chairman, unequivocally that these people are acting utterly irresponsibly. They know that their policies are driving us to a situation which we may not be able to contain, and if these changes are not made quickly and this blood is shed that the Ministers keep on telling us is going to be shed&#x2014;and remember that in the last month or so at least three Ministers have come out with this sort of blood-and-thunder stuff&#x2014;then I would say, Mr. Chairman, that certain of these Cabinet Ministers, knowing that they have created this situation &#x2026;</block>

<p>Remember, they caused the situation on the borders&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; knowing that they have driven this country into a situation of bloodshed, they may have to answer as criminals against the State of South Africa. After this last war, Mr. Chairman, there were courts to deal with criminals against humanity. And the time may come when certain of these Ministers who are driving this country into the bloodshed they keep talking about, may have to answer.</block>

<p>Now I want to engage in a discussion with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, even though I am a backbencher, I believe in democracy. If the hon. the Leader of the Opposition believes that in this country we fight matters out at the polling-booth, and if the hon. Opposition believes that in this country we rule by way of majority decisions of this Parliament, they must not only put this provincial councillor in his place, but they must get up and apologize to us for having had something like this in mind. Anxiety and suspicion crept into my mind about this matter being discussed in Natal. Mr. Waterson is a member of the Executive Committee. In all probability he would be taken up in the Cabinet if the Opposition came into power. It may safely be said that they would not have enough talent in the House and that they would consequently have to bring in people from outside. Our question to them now is whether this will <span class="col_5163-5164" refersTo="page_1045"/>take place within a month or two of the election. I want to ask this of the hon. member for Turffontein, who is sitting there with his head bowed and who speaks on behalf of the youth of South Africa. He must tell us whether this is what he is going to do with his fellow-Afrikaners. Does he endorse this&#x003F;</p>

We would very much like to be pleasantly surprised as far as this matter is concerned.</p>

<p>How is this matter presented abroad&#x003F; The debate that took place in the Natal Provincial Council enjoyed very wide publicity. For example, <i>The Friend</i> of 19th November of last year reported this debate. <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 21st November of last year also reported it. They reported what Mr. Trevor Walmer said in connection with the Broederbond. I think it is definitely the hon. member for Orange Grove&#x2019;s Broederbond, because he speaks so much about it. I shall quote from the report in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i>: &#x201C;Mr. Trevor Walmer warned that the country was heading for a dictatorship. Describing the Broederbond as &#x2018;an evil pressure group&#x2019; &#x2026;&#x201D;. So he continues. Immediately afterwards Mr. Derek Waterson&#x2019;s threat&#x2014;this N�remburg idea&#x2014;was reported. They hereby create the impression that that specific segment of Afrikaans cultural life will be eradicated and destroyed. That is the implication it embodies. If that is the case, the question immediately arises: What about all the dedicated public servants who have helped to implement this policy&#x003F; Is the Opposition also going to do a &#x2018;N�remburg&#x2019; on them&#x003F; What about all our academics and students who are dedicated people&#x003F; I want to ask the hon. member for Durban North whether he agrees with this. He must tell us what they plan to do about this. Do they agree with the statements of the provincial councillor or not&#x003F; The hon. member for Durban North is also a legal man. He knows that one does not abuse the courts in a country that is ruled democratically. What is the hon. member&#x2019;s answer&#x003F; Now he sits there! What is your answer&#x003F; Do you support the proposition of the United Party member of the provincial council or not&#x003F; Zip! No reply.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, here we find ourselves squarely within the old tactics of hon. members on the opposite side.

<p>The Prime Minister replied, and I shall say something about that in a moment. Immediately after the hon. the Prime Minister had replied, it was, as far as the hon. members on the opposite side were concerned, the end of the debate on the most important problem which South Africa faces at the moment, i.e. the vicissitudes of our people under a Government which is unfit to manage South Africa&#x2019;s economic affairs. They are running away from it because they simply dare not enter into a point-blank confrontation with the United Party in a debate on the economic conditions in South Africa and on the economic misdeeds of the Government. They dare not give us a hearing on what is happening to the income of the man in the street, to the rising cost of living, to inflation, on how the savings of <span class="col_5165-5166" refersTo="page_1046"/>our people are being eroded by inflation and how the rand is being ruined by inflation. They do not want to touch upon those matters. He has my sympathy, because I do not think he can do better. The hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education and the hon. member for Primrose, are pushed forward to revert immediately to stories about racial hatred, language injustices and I do not know what else&#x2014;everything with the object of inciting the feelings of the people and of playing with the emotions of people in the hope that they will forget what is really being inflicted upon them by an incompetent Government. I do not want to speak about these matters, because at the moment we are engaged in more important matters. However, to the face of the hon. the Prime Minister, whom I know to be a fair man&#x2014; I know he is a strong man and a hard debater, but fundamentally he is a fair man &#x2014;about the extreme lengths to which the propaganda of the Nationalist Party is going in order to stir up these stories about racial hatred. The hon. the Minister of Defence started it and then all the small fry followed suit. Here I have this morning&#x2019;s <i>Transvaler,</i> which carries one of the most flagrant and most untruthful reports I have ever read about the Parliament of South Africa and its members.</p>

<p>Dr. Fisher, the hon. member for Rosettenville. Such is the ignorance. Here the Chief Whip on the United Party side is mentioned, a person who was given a testimonial the other day by the Chief Whip on that side of the House, a testimonial to the effect that they speak Afrikaans to each other. But <i>Die Transvaler</i> does not take any notice of that. I do not have the time to mention all of them, but my friend sitting next to me here, the hon. member for Transkei, is also mentioned in <i>Die Transvaler.</i> At every session so far the hon. member has made speeches in good Afrikaans in this House. He has already done so this session. He is held up <span class="col_5167-5168" refersTo="page_1047"/>as a unilingual English-speaking member in this Parliament. The hon. member for Durban North is also mentioned here. He is a person who has often spoken Afrikaans in this House. Mr. J. J. J. Scholtz of <i>Die Burger</i> paid tribute in one of his articles to Mr. Mitchell&#x2019;s use of Afrikaans in this House. An ex-Senator. Mr. Paul Sauer, got up and congratulated him on the Afrikaans he used in the Senate. But <i>Die Transvaler</i> sends out into our country the report that he is a unilingual person, that he is a Afrikaner-hater, that he does not want to speak Afrikaans. Then there is the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District. He is an ex-public servant who, under Nationalist Party Government, received promotion time and again after having passed the language tests. He is probably the only member of this House who has a certificate of bilingualism signed by the late Dr. Verwoerd. But <i>Die Transvaler</i> says he is not bilingual, he is an Afrikaner-hater and he cannot speak Afrikaans. And so I could go on. Let me mention another one. They mention my friend the hon. member for Walmer. He comes from Graaff-Reinet. They say he is not bilingual. In my view the most beautiful and the purest Afrikaans is spoken in the Karoo. And here we have a person who speaks Karoo Afrikaans like a Karoo farmer. He is one of the most bilingual men in this House. But <i>Die Transvaler</i> does not hesitate to send out the report that he cannot speak Afrikaans and is therefore an Afrikaner-hater. What are politics in South Africa coming to if the propaganda of the Nationalist Party descends to as low a level as this, if such downright lies, such unverified, uncontrolled lies are sent out into the world purely with the object of gaining a few votes at Oudtshoorn by exploiting racial hatred&#x003F; This is disgraceful.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>No, not in Committee.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the hon. the Prime Minister just for a moment. His speech was an important one, because he obviously sat down thinking what matters the hon. the Leader of the Opposition might raise. Then he prepared a speech in reply to that. But he could not anticipate everything which my hon. Leader would raise. That is why he made certain statements which are irrelevant and which, with all due respect, are not true. For example, he said that the Budget met with general approval on the part of the businessmen or South Africa, and that we had not quoted any criticism of the Budget. But that was not necessary. The criticism of the Budget was expressed 10 days before the debate started. We came forward with our own criticism, which was well-founded and substantial. [Interjections.] Hon. members on the opposite side may as well laugh. I happen to have here one or two articles written on the Budget. Why did the Prime Minister not refer to them&#x003F; Why did he not refer to the fact that the people in the motor industry had complained strongly that this Budget was going to do the motor industry no end of harm&#x003F; Why did he not quote the letters and statements in the newspapers to the effect that the man in the street was getting nothing out of this Budget&#x003F; I have several of them. Why did he not quote the criticism of the labour policy of the Government, criticism which came from various interested parties&#x003F; There is, for example the following one:</p>

<block name="quote">A warning that South Africa may have been pushed into an almost irreversible inflationary spiral by the Budget unless the Minister of Finance, Dr. Diederichs, puts am end to ideological restrictions on the use of African labour, is given by the Chairman of Union Acceptances.</block>

<p>It goes on in this vein. This is well-founded criticism, the same criticism as that of the United Party, but the hon. the Prime Minister wants to pretend that there has been no criticism of the Budget and that it has been generally accepted. Then, to the astonishment of every person who knows the history of South Africa, the hon. the Prime Minister came forward with a wild assertion which is entirely unfounded.</p>

<p>I can speak English and I shall speak English when it is convenient. Everyone knows that I am bilingual and that I can speak English. The hon. member for Yeoville stood up here with a very finely demure face and said he wanted to protest against the blatant racialism that allegedly came from hon. members on this side of the House last week. On the eve of the Oudtshoorn election, and before 1975, I want to protest about the false idea the United Party and the English Press gave the country about the debate that took place in this House last week. It was not a debate about racism. National Party members only brought to the fore the Opposition&#x2019;s attitude to the Afrikaner and to the heritage of the Afrikaner in South Africa. They cannot mention one instance where the National Party has deviated one iota from the course it has designated from its earliest days in respect of unity in South Africa, the heritage of the English-speaking community or anything else. The National Party has revealed the United Party as being Boer haters, people who have not made a single contribution to national unity and the development of national unity and White unity over the past ten years. I am also disappointed about another aspect.</p>

<p>I want to record my disappointment at the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, not only on behalf of the people in the public gallery today, but also on behalf of the South African people generally, about the pace he tried to set in this debate today. It is unheard of that economic affairs be discussed under the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote. Why is the United Party today harping on economic affairs&#x003F; Last week they could have spoken about economic affairs the whole week. Today we are interested in matters such as relations politics, a burning question in South Africa today. We want to speak about that. About policy matters and the weighing up of one policy against another&#x2014;that is why the public gallery here was full at quarter-past-two this afternoon. At the moment, however, it is half full again.</p>

<p>Before my time is up, I want to dwell on the hon. member for Yeoville again for a moment. The United Party men do three things in politics. They either run away from a debating point, as they are doing today, they accuse the National Party of racism or they lay claim to the National Party&#x2019;s implementing United Party policy. Last week the hon. member for Yeoville again appropriated the outgoing policy of the National Party for the United Party men. He said that as far back as 17th January, 1929, in the Phoenix Hotel, Gen. Smuts explained the outgoing policy the National Party is now appropriating for itself. Let us just look at what Gen. Smuts said.</p>

<p>&#x2014;</p>

<p>&#x2026; so that one day we may have a British Confederation of Africa states, a great African Dominion stretching unbroken throughout Africa. That is the cardinal point in my policy. We shall not work for South Africa alone &#x2026;</p>

<p><span class="col_5171-5172" refersTo="page_1049"/>Do you still say &#x201C;hear, hear&#x201D;!</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; but we shall be a friend of our fellow African states and shall work for a united British Africa. When the South African Party comes into power again, it will do its best to foster that spirit of co-operation and brotherliness which will in the end lead to this great African Federation of States. The term &#x201C;South Africa&#x201D; will surely one day be dropped from our national vocabulary and there will be a united British Africa.</block>

<p>Now I just want to tell the Opposition, they call themselves &#x201C;South Africans&#x201D;. I call myself an Afrikaner. If this holistic Smuts idea were perhaps realized in future, what would they be then&#x003F; Would they then still be &#x201C;South Africans&#x201D;, in the big &#x201C;United British Africa&#x201D; where the term &#x201C;South Africa&#x201D; would have been &#x201C;dropped&#x201D; from the vocabulary of South Africa&#x003F; I see the hon. member for Yeoville is giving instructions for silence. They must probably not reply to me in the debate. They must probably continue with economic arguments. That is what they must speak about. In contrast the National Party has never, in its relations politics, ever thought of a &#x201C;British Africa&#x201D;: it has not thought of a &#x201C;British South Africa&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The National Party recognizes the autonomy and the right to self-determination, even of the smallest people, not only in Africa, but in South Africa, where everyone can have an identity of his own. Is that what comes to the fore in the United Party&#x2019;s idea for South Africa and Africa&#x003F; No, because they are still thinking in terms of the Smuts idiom, of a &#x201C;United British Africa&#x201D;, in which there would have been no room for any &#x201C;South African&#x201D;. There would not have been any room for the hon. member for Yeoville if he were still to call himself a &#x201C;South African&#x201D;. In contrast there is room in the National Party&#x2019;s politics, in our idea of multi-nationality, for a Xhosa with his own identity, an Afrikaner with his own identity, and in Africa for a Ghanaian and a Malawian with their own identities. But that party opposite thinks in terms of a conglomerate without identity, national heritage or anything that can inspire and summon up action and pride for a fatherland.</p>

<p>No, one does not necessarily agree in 1972 that the circumstances of 1929 should still prevail today. It does not make sense. But what I do want to say to that hon. member is that if Gen. Smuts&#x2019; vision were a success and such a federation of states had existed, we in South Africa would, in view of what has happened since then, have had circumstances today in which the outward policy which the Prime Minister is trying to pursue now, would have been an accomplished, successful policy. There would have been a federation of states in Southern Africa, in which South Africa would have been the leading state. The point I made at the time, and which I want to repeat here, is that it took my friends opposite 40 years to find out that Gen. Smuts&#x2019; view was the right one and then to try to echo him and imitate him.</p>

<p>Yes, reproach, that he could have made such a statement, as a statement of fact, that at the time of the change of government in South Africa after the war, the United Party allegedly did not have any confidence in South Africa as an industrial country.

Why did the Prime Minister not give some thought to the matter before saying that&#x003F; Why did he not remember that it was that Government which established the Industrial Development Corporation for South Africa in order to make capital available, not for State enterprises, as is the case today with many of the projects of that corporation, but in order to enable the citizens of South Africa financially to establish industries in South Africa; a policy which was carried out with great success&#x003F; Why did he not mention that it was the United Party of Gen. Smuts which established the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research for South Africa, a <span class="col_5173-5174" refersTo="page_1050"/>council which did a vast amount of good work at the time and still is doing so as regards research for the purpose of developing our industries on a sound and scientific basis&#x003F; Why did he not mention that it was that Government of Smuts which established the Bureau of Standards for South Africa, that he had so much confidence in our industries, that he wanted to ensure that the standard of our products could compete with that of the world&#x003F;</p>

<p>I could mention other examples. Why did the Prime Minister not first think that it was that Government which introduced the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act for our industries, which placed the Unemployment Insurance Act in the Statute Book and which modernized the Shops and Offices Act with a view to the development of the manufacturing industry in South Africa&#x003F; Why did the hon. the Prime Minister not think of the fact that in the almost 25 years during which the Nationalist Party has been in power, it has not placed on the Statute Book one new idea for our industrial development which can compare with one of these Acts&#x003F; Because the hon. the Prime Minister made such a wild statement, I now challenge him in all courtesy to rise and mention to us one new Act of similar significance to the industrial development of South Africa which has been placed on the Statute Book during the past 25 years. And I am not referring to a bit of patchwork here and there and the changing of titles of United Party Acts&#x2014;I am referring to a new idea, a new concept, a new imaginative Act, such as the establishment of the Industrial Development Corporation, to show that they have confidence in the industrial future of South Africa.</p>

<p>All that has happened, is that because of the tremendous encouragement which was given to industrial development as a result of our war effort and the effect of Acts and measures such as those I mentioned, the Nationalists were able to build on the philosophy, the endeavour and insight of the United Party, with a limited degree of success. If one pauses to think for one moment what South Africa&#x2019;s position could have been today in the industrial sphere, were it not for the restrictive shortsighted, ideological restrictions which this Government imposed on our industrial development, it takes one&#x2019;s breath away. In the Johannesburg-Pretoria-Vereeniging triangle, on the Witwatersrand, there are people today who are very keen to expand industries, but they are being restricted by the shortsighted labour policy of this Government, a policy which is so wrong that with every Budget we get very feeble steps on the part of the Minister of Finance to get away from his own policy.</p>

<p>Once again he has come forward with a statement of policy to the effect that where industries wanted to establish branches in the border areas or where they work in shifts, he would allow them to use more Bantu labour in the cities. But why has he said that&#x003F; Because my Leader is correct in saying that the power and the means for implementing any policy in South Africa, including the policy of the Nationalist Party, for the solution of our race problems, are created in the White industrial areas of South Africa. Their restriction of industries in the White areas of South Africa contradicts and impedes the implementation of their own policy. Just as correct and sound as the United Party&#x2019;s insight was, so wrong, shortsighted and un-South African are the actions of the Nationalist Party. Mr. Speaker, my hon. Leader put questions to the Prime Minister in regard to labour.</p>

<p>We have heard now that steps will in fact be taken for the <span class="col_5175-5176" refersTo="page_1051"/>training of non-White labour and for imparting acumen, know-how and skill to them. The hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration introduced a new Bantu Education Act, and in the Senate he said that the object of that legislation would be to train a large number of Native artisans in the reserves; this is apparently the policy. Here we have the contradictions : On 15th February this year the Minister of Labour made a statement in the Senate on the training of labour, and this is the crux of his speech. He himself called it &#x201C;the policy&#x201D;. He said, according to the English Hansard :</p>

<p>Yes. The Hansard says &#x201C;minimum&#x201D;, but I read &#x201C;maximum&#x201D;, because it is obviously a printing error. The Prime Minister should tell us now where the areas are in which the Coloureds and the Indians should be trained. Firstly, there is no separate area for the Coloureds. Does this mean the Western Cape&#x003F; Will the Coloureds now be given special opportunities in the Western Cape, similar to those the Bantu are going to get in the reserves in terms of the new Bantu Education Act&#x003F; It would be a good thing, but is it his policy&#x003F; What about the Coloureds of the Transvaal; what about the 40 000 or 50 000 Coloureds of Johannesburg&#x003F; Where is their area&#x003F; Where are the Indians going to be trained&#x003F; In Natal&#x003F; In Johannesburg&#x003F; Why is there an area for the Coloureds and an area for the Indians when it suits the Government to evade their responsibility and a clear statement of policy, while there is no area for the Coloureds or the Indians when we come to the crux of the problem of race relations in South Africa&#x003F; We hear such a great deal about relations politics. If the Government believes, as it said here, that these people should be trained in their own areas, why do the Prime Minister, his newspapers and everybody deny that areas of their own can exist in South Africa for these people&#x003F; Is that not a contradiction&#x003F; Will the Minister clarify it for us&#x003F; Sir, we must realize one thing. It does not matter what policy South Africa is going to accept eventually for the solution of its race problems. Whether it is the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy, the United Party&#x2019;s policy or the Progressive Party&#x2019;s policy, its success will depend on how rapidly we can raise the standards of living of all our people in South Africa.

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just sat down really vented his spleen about <i>Die Transvaler,</i> a short time ago. Now I should like to ask him also to look, for a change, at the newspapers which are their mouthpieces. The United Party mouthpiece with the largest circulation, the <i>Sunday Times,</i> reeks in its very being of hate and venom directed against the Afrikaner and Afrikaner institutions. That is why it uses Afrikaner institutions to stir up suspicion and doubt among the Afrikaner people, mainly for the purpose of presenting the hon. the Prime Minister in an unfavourable light. The propaganda must be prepared in a subtle way, in order to cause questions of suspicion and doubt to arise concerning, amongst other things, the competence of the Prime Minister, his position as leader within the National Party, his authority within his own Cabinet, and the efficiency of his administration, to mention just a few examples.</p>

<p>One of the most unpleasant and objectionable attacks on the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s leadership within the National Party and his indisputable authority within the Government came from the <i>Sunday Times</i> last Sunday.

<p>Sir, the <i>Sunday Times</i> does not tell its readers that as a result of the threats of terrorism on its borders, the U.N. pressure about South-West Africa, the world pressure about a variety of aspects, the onslaughts of sabotage in our midst and threats of communism, South Africa finds itself in the most difficult circumstances in which it has ever been. Sir, neither a Jan Smuts nor a Dr. Malan nor a Dr. Verwoerd had to face these confrontations and their intensity in the way in which the present Prime Minister has to do from day to day. The <i>Sunday Times</i> does not tell its readers that the successful handling by the hon. the Prime Minister of these problems, these confrontations and onslaughts, has shown him to be one of the most competent Prime Ministers South Africa has ever produced &#x2026; [Interjections.] &#x2026; which also benefits and protects the poison pens of the <i>Sunday Times,</i> who would long since have lost the shelter of their offices from where they can continue their work of destruction among the Afrikaner people, had it not been for the safety, the peace and order guaranteed them by these strong and calculated actions of our present Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Instead of drawing the attention of their readers to these facts, the <i>Sunday Times</i> came along last Sunday and pictured the hon. the Prime Minister as a powerless and flustered pawn in the hands of a good colleague who shares the back benches with me, merely on the grounds of a so-called position within an Afrikaner cultural organization awarded him by the <i>Sunday Times,</i> for which I would in any case have respected him if it had been true.</p>

<block name="quote">Although a mere backbencher of only three months standing in Parliament, he will now from his seat be watching the Prime Minister, Mr. Vorster, to see how he implements the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s new strategy of &#x201C;back to Afrikaner identity and exclusiveness&#x201D;. It should be interesting to see how Mr. Vorster will perform under the watchful eye of Dr. Treurnicht.</block>

<p>Sir, I have never seen as humiliating a position as that in which the <i>Sunday Times</i> wants to place the Prime Minister in the eyes of his people, but the people of South Africa know, the Opposition knows, and even the enemies of South Africa know, and that is why I find it surprising that the <i>Sunday Times</i> does not know that when it comes to matters and actions and decisions dealing with the safety and the welfare of this country and its people, to whom he is an inspired leader, the hon. the Prime Minister does not allow himself to be pushed around by anybody within or outside this House, no matter what his position within or outside the party and no matter how much esteem and regard he deserves as a result of that position.</p>

<p>I do not want to devote much attention to the hon. member, as he has apparently declared war on the <i>Sunday Times</i> and it is not my duty to defend the <i>Sunday Times.</i> He seemed to be very concerned about the position of the hon. the Prime Minister and he is now acting in his defence. But I think the Prime Minister can get someone better to do that. At the same time he is dragging in this &#x201C;cultural organization&#x201D; again, but I want to ask him just one question about this &#x201C;cultural organization&#x201D; If they devote themselves to culture, why is it necessary for them to have secret telephones&#x003F; Actually I want to return to several points made by the hon. the Prime Minister. In his response to my hon. Leader&#x2019;s introductory speech on this Vote he was very indignant about the assertion by my hon. leader that the development of our standard of living was lagging behind in comparison with certain countries of the world, and he asked, &#x201C;Where is your proof&#x003F;&#x201D; But to my knowledge the specific statistics now repeated by my hon leader have been quoted by us five times during this session. The Reserve Bank recently indicated that during the decade of the sixties, which is held up to us as one of the most prosperous periods in our economic history, our <i>per capita</i> growth was 2,4 per cent a year, which was lower than that of Britain; it was half of that of the common market countries of Europe and a quarter of that of Japan. What more does the hon. the Prime Minister require by way of proof&#x003F;</p>

<p>Then he went further and read out to us how our Budgets had increased since 1948. What did the hon. the Prime Minister hope to prove by that&#x003F; It may mean, after all, that more and more money had been wasted. But any economic student in his first year knows, after all, that in the growth process of a country there is an S-type curve and that after you have passed the initial stage, a country grows more quickly. This is inherent in the economic process. So what does the hon. the Prime Minister expect&#x003F; He also reads out to us long lists of wage increases, of what the wages were in 1948 and what they are now. This indicates, after all, that the hon. the Prime Minister really does not know what is involved. You cannot take a wage of 1948 and adjust it to the buying power of the rand and then compare it with wages today. If you want to make that sort of comparison, you must compare it with your national revenue and with your gross domestic product. But in any case, inherent in what the hon. the Prime Minister says is the idea that people will just have to be content to remain where they were a quarter of a century ago. It is universally accepted by trade unions all over the world that people may expect their standard of living to rise by at least 2,5 per cent a year. Now I ask the hon. the Prime Minister to take those figures of 1948 again and to make the necessary adjustments to the buying power of the rand; he must add 2,5 per cent a year on a compound basis and then he will see that the position of these people has not improved; it has deteriorated since 1948. His whole argument was that wages had increased. But, Sir, this is the case all over the world. He is trying to indicate that it is thanks to our good Government that wages have increased, but I can assure the hon. the Prime Minister that wages have increased in all the communist countries as well. Am I to conclude from that that they also have such good governments&#x003F; No, that sort of argument does not get us anywhere.</p>

<p>My hon. Leader indicated that there is this income gap, the wage gap, and he tried to indicate that this is a gap through which the communists may get in. I should like to return to that, because the hon. the Prime Minister also expressed himself on this matter earlier on in this session and the Minister of the Interior used very strong language in regard to this matter. In the No-Confidence debate earlier this year the hon. the Prime Minister expressed himself as follows. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As far as the gap is concerned, it is the declared policy of the Government to narrow that gap, which is an historical <span class="col_5181-5182" refersTo="page_1054"/>one. We have stated this on various occasions.</block>

<p>Then he went on and said that his Government was committed in regard to the matter. But what we find so surprising is that within his own speech, after having stated his standpoint so strongly and saying that his Government was committed in regard to this matter, he announced that the average wages of White workers had increased fourfold and those of non-Whites had increased threefold since 1948. If arithmetic means anything, if figures indicate anything, then the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s own figures indicate that the gap has not narrowed but widened. Here, then, we have another typical example of the Government which always has a policy; it has a fixed policy on every matter you can think of, but in practice and in reality it works in precisely the opposite direction. What is the use of having such a policy if it cannot be implemented&#x003F; The indications are there that this gap is steadily widening. One can quote many statistics to prove this. I may just mention that in 1948 the average wages for Bantu in the production and construction section was 25 per cent of the average wages of the Whites. At the present moment the wages of the Bantu are down to 17 per cent of those of the Whites. In other words, where the ratio used to be one as against four, it is now one as against six. So the position is deteriorating. The Government is moving further and further away from its policy, and why do we have this position&#x003F; It is because of the policy of the Government itself, because if you introduce job reservation and implement the Physical Planning Act, what are you doing&#x003F; You are placing an artificial ceiling on the economic development of the non-Whites and keeping down their wages, but at the same time you are creating an artificial shortage of White workers. This means that their wages are artificially increased&#x2014; not that they benefit by it, because as a result of inflation their own standard of living shows only a minimal improvement, and in that way the gap keeps widening. Now we ask the hon. the Prime Minister what he is going to do about this. He has now indicated his policy to us, but he is making no provision for the training of these people. When we talk about training the hon. the Prime Minister speaks of the shortage of high schools which existed in Brakpan 25 years ago. Every indication and every projection suggests that by 1980 we will need one million additional non-White workers for skilled labour of a more specialized nature. Where are they going to come from&#x003F; What steps is the Government taking in order to train them&#x003F;</p>

<p>As regards school education, it is true that three million Bantu are attending school at the moment. But as the hon. member for Johannesburg North indicated the other day, 70 per cent of them do not go beyond Std. 2. Only 4 per cent of them receive secondary or more advanced training and only a third of 1 per cent receive vocational training or attend technical high schools. How is the Government ever going to eliminate this gap if they set about it in the way referred to by the hon. the Prime Minister&#x003F; We have grown tired of all these promises and statements of policy by the Government. This House and South Africa now want to know what positive steps the hon. the Prime Minister is going to take to eliminate this gap.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Chairman, there is another important issue. Recently, in addressing the Sakekamer in Cape Town, the hon. the Prime Minister told them that some of them were trying to develop a psychosis of discontent. He referred particularly to what he called &#x201C;fair-weather Afrikaners&#x201D; and &#x201C;other South Africans&#x201D;. I find the distinction he draws most interesting in view of the kind of discussion we have had recently. Apparently Afrikaners, and certainly &#x201C;fair weather&#x201D; Afrikaners, are not South Africans. Be that as it may, he then indicated that these people were asking for more labour and concessions. These are his words as reported in the local Press:</p>

<block name="quote">They are propagating something which will lead to the creation of a social welfare State in South Africa.</block>

<p>This is a very important pronouncement by the hon. the Prime Minister. He is now trying to indicate that South Africans want a social welfare State, while at the same time suggesting that his Government is implacably opposed to it. These, again, are not the facts of the situation. They work in directly the opposite direction. We have today a state of socialism in South Africa &#x2026; [Time expired.]</p>

Because the hon. member for Yeoville has told the voters in Oudtshoorn that it is the United Party&#x2019;s policy to give every man in South Africa a pension under a national participation pension scheme. He said that even Mr. Harry Oppenheimer would draw a pension under their Government, but he would have to pay in more than he would get out of it. This is the sort of absurdity which hon. members on that side of the House spread in the country in order to draw votes. When the hon. member who has just spoken comes along with these stories of his we are not impressed. The election in Oudtshoorn takes place tomorrow; what is said here today will no longer have any effect on it. The moment of truth for all time has come for that side of the House. For too long they and certain newspapers which support them have conducted a campaign of mud-slinging directed against leading Afrikaners, trying to humiliate them and stirring up suspicions about them in the minds of the general public.

If they take exception to the fact that we say that there are elements&#x2014;and I am not saying that it is always the case in the outside world, but I am referring to this House&#x2014; in the United Party side who have no respect for the Afrikaner and his institutions, they must bear in mind that we are only saying what has already been said by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. He is the man who first said that there is no place for an Afrikaner in the United Party. Our memory is not so short, after all. On 2nd June, 1960, Mr. Christopher Kavannagh wrote an article about the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. It appeared in the <i>Cape Argus.</i> He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_5185-5186" refersTo="page_1056"/>I asked him : &#x201C;Why did you leave the United Party&#x003F;&#x201D;</block>

<p>That was way back in 1949.</p>

<block name="quote">He replied: &#x201C;I believe in the national unity of English and Afrikaans-speaking people. I still do. That is what National Union is working for, but you would not believe me what the attitude towards Afrikaans and Afrikaans institutions was in the United Party in those days.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Then the hon. member went on and told how he had walked into one of his own party&#x2019;s offices&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I greeted the man in Afrikaans. He said : &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t talk that language here in this office&#x201D;.</block>

<p>But that is not all. I want to read out to hon. members what was written by a person who is not an Afrikaner, but an editor of one of the newspapers which support hon. members opposite, Mr. Gerald Shaw, who wrote in the <i>Cape Times</i> on 21st June, 1969&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Historically the United Party was a party of the British and Commonwealth connection. This provided the underlying ethos; so the advent of the Republic left the party in something of a psychological vacuum. Perhaps this is because so many United Party speeches on the theme of national unity still seem to suggest that the real South African nationhood must necessarily mean the disappearance of a distinct Afrikaans identity.</block>

<p>That is also the theme of the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town, who said that he would give up his Afrikanerhood. The writer went on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Perhaps this is what the United Party requires more than anything else, just at present; a truly compelling vision of a South African nationhood. Could the United Party then not try to restore to non-Nationalist South Africans some sense of belonging in their own country&#x003F;</block>

<p>I want to issue a challenge today to hon. members on that side of the House. Every hon. member in the House must be able to speak both official languages. When I say that, I do not expect every South African to be able to speak both official languages.</p>

<p>because circumstances may be difficult. But the moment a man becomes active in public life it is as important for him to be able to speak both official languages as it is for a diplomat to learn the language of the country in which he is going to live.</p>

<p>Do you see what the hon. member is playing at again&#x003F; We are concerned here with a question of attitude. I want to challenge them and say that any member on this side of the House can be asked to make a speech in English anywhere and he will do so. [Interjections.] Mr. Chairman, I want to go further. I want to guarantee, on behalf of this side of the House, that, even without there being any intervention by our Prime Minister or party authorities, no person will be elected as a member of this side of the House if he is not bilingual.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Sport and Recreation often speaks Afrikaans. [Interjections.] Mr. Chairman, I want to ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition whether he is prepared to guarantee, in the first place, that if he should ever come into power and have to compose a Cabinet, every member of that Cabinet would be able to use both official languages. I want to ask him a further question: Is he prepared to guarantee that any candidate who stands for that party in future will be able to use both official languages&#x003F; The point is not whether you can speak the one as fluently as the other; we are basically concerned with an attitude. I want to allege that that attitude is lacking on the part of some members on that side of the House. Because that attitude is lacking on their part, I say that this side of the House has every reason to tell the people of South Africa: You know now that if this party which is aspiring to come into power were in fact to succeed, you would be back where you were in 1939, with a Government <span class="col_5187-5188" refersTo="page_1057"/>which includes a large number of members who are unable to use the other official language and to serve the people in their own language.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when the hon. the Leader of the Opposition started, he asked me certain questions to which I replied. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition also levelled certain accusations to which I want to come back now, for those accusations were also echoed by the hon. member for Yeoville. According to the note I made, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition accused this side of the House of stirring up racial hatred. I waited for the Leader of the Opposition to embroider on this accusation. Apparently he does not want to do so. The accusation levelled by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition against me and this side of the House, i.e. that we are stirring up racial hatred, would stand if I did not reply to it now. Now I want to say at once that we in South Africa can afford many things, but there are several things which we cannot afford. One of them is that we cannot afford hatred to prevail between English- and Afrikaans-speaking people in South Africa. Secondly, we cannot afford hatred to prevail between Whites and non-Whites. Thirdly, we cannot afford feeling to be aroused between town-dwellers and country-dwellers. In other words, I want to make the statement that no matter how important other things may be&#x2014;at a later stage I shall come back to the economic aspects mentioned here&#x2014;it is and remains a fact that in a country such as South Africa the question of relations is of cardinal importance. If there are political parties and if there are individuals that are stirring up feeling between the two language groups, they must be pointed out.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>If the blame lies with my side of the House, with my party, those members must be pointed out. If the blame lies with members opposite, they must be pointed out. If it lies with the Afrikaans-language newspapers, we must say so, and if it lies with the English-language newspapers, we must say so too. As far as I am concerned, I have been pointing this out ever since the first day I took over this office, in the very first speech I made. I am in earnest, and I challenge any member on that side of the House to point out any act committed by me over the past years since 1966 and before that as a Minister, which was calculated to stir up feeling between Afrikaans and English-speaking people. If the hon. member for Yeoville or any other person wants to point a finger at me in that regard, I challenge him to do so. With me it was not merely a question of words. I have shown by way of actions, and so has my party, what our attitude is in this regard. I did not hesitate to use strong language in public, as I did in Heilbron because there were people who wanted to take away English language rights. I did not hesitate to join my colleagues in taking a strong stand against Dr. Hertzog and his people who wanted to violate the English language rights in South Africa. I stated my point of view in respect of English-speaking South Africa in the presence of several members on the other side of this House on the occasion of the laying of the foundation-stone of the monument to the 1820 Settlers. In that regard we have taken an unshakeable stand. During the course of the last elections I said, and I want to repeat it in this House today&#x2014;and this is also my reply to the accusation made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition&#x2014;that even if I had known that no single English-speaking person voted for the National Party, I would still take the stand as I had stated it in this House. My concern is not with whether or not people vote for one; my concern is with the principle which one has to accept in that regard. This is what I said and this is what I did. I want to tell the Leader of the Opposition that what we want from him is not words. I have stated my point of view on co-operation, and he has stated his. However, in this regard we do not want words only. We want actions. We want respect for each other&#x2019;s language.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall come to the report in <i>Die Transvaler</i> in a moment. In fact, I am still coming to many things which will embarrass the hon. member. I made an appeal to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, but he did not even condescend to reply. I made an appeal to the hon. member for South Coast, courteously across the floor of this House, but he did not even condescend to give me a reply to it. How often have I not asked the Leader of the Opposition to join me in making an appeal to our people to respect each other&#x2019;s language in practice, in making an appeal to people to the effect that language incidents of this kind, where a person refuses to serve another person or speak to him in his language, should not take place&#x003F; And yet the Leader of the Opposition had the audacity to level the reproach across the floor of this House, and the hon. member for Yeoville indirectly associated himself with it, that we were stirring up racial hatred. I think we may now, because I said that we could not afford hatred being nourished between White and White and between White and non-White, very profitably give our attention to this matter. The actions of the leadership of the United Party create that position between White and White. The newspapers which support it, are helping with a lavish hand in that regard. The hon. member for Yeoville and other hon. members may tell me now, &#x201C;Yes, these are merely the accusations you are levelling against us, but we are levelling the same accusations against you.&#x201D;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has just done so. Now. I do not want us to debate this matter on the basis of the attitude I adopt or the word I give, because I see the hon. Opposition before me from the outside and they see my party from the outside. If we want to have a fruitful discussion on this matter now, I think it is fair, and that the hon. member for Yeoville will grant me this, that we hear the evidence in this regard as to who is guilty of this matter, and call in a person who knows both parties well, who knows the inner workings of both parties. He is a person who is fond of putting himself on the pedestal of an &#x201C;elderly statesman&#x201D;, a person who is fond of lecturing to us on how we should speak the truth, on how we should not make exaggerated statements, and a person who is regarded by the English Press as a crown prince on that side. I am referring here to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. Now let me say at once that in respect of this question, namely who is responsible for arousing racial hatred in South Africa between White and non-White&#x2014; which I want to condemn with all the power at my command&#x2014;I am prepared to acquiesce in the judgment not of my side of the House, but to stand and to fall by the judgment of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. Because, Mr. Chairman, I want to repeat, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout knows this party from the inside and he knows that party from the inside. To tell the truth, this is his second acquaintance with that one.</p>

<block name="quote">Before concluding &#x2026;</block>

<p>So said the hon. member for Bezuidenhout&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; I just want to say this: I regret that in the short debate we have just had, we again had the same type of language used by the Opposition as we had since last year and right through all the recent debates. The hon. the Minister of Finance quite correctly said that we are now accustomed to it. It is a striking feature that right through the history of South Africa one finds that same hate, the same expressions of horror and suspicion against the Afrikaner. Since his earliest existence the Afrikaner has been stigmatized as a breaker of the law, a dictator and an immoral person.</block>

<p>Then he went on to quote what Gen. Smuts had said in this regard. Continuing, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That is nothing new to this side of the House. Even today, if one watches the Press of the United Party, the English Press, what language does one find being used there&#x003F; It is the sort of language one finds in <i>White Man Boss,</i> and the language one finds in <i>After Smuts&#x2014;what then&#x003F;</i> and the sort of language one finds in <i>In Face of Fear, Twilight in South Africa,</i> and the type of language one finds in books of the calibre of <i>Mistaken Land.</i> The fact is &#x2026;</block>

<p>I want hon. members to note that, and particularly the hon. member for Yeoville&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The fact is that the United Party today makes itself guilty of those extravagances, not only as regards the Nationalist Party but in regard to Afrikanerdom (because in effect the Nationalist Party is not only a party; it is a national movement embracing 80 per cent of the Afrikaans-speaking people in the country).</block>

<p>&#x2020;This is what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said. Then he went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I say that the fact that the United Party makes itself guilty to such a degree of that sort of thing is the best proof to me that the United Party has become the successor to that imperialism which through all the years was responsible for the feeling of hostility against the Afrikaners in South Africa. I want to state that the Opposition in adopting this course, is taking a tremendous responsibility upon itself. They are today engendering racial hatred in the country and inciting the English-speaking people against the Afrikaans-speaking people.</block>

<p>He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They are today engendering racial hatred in the country and inciting English-speaking people against the Afrikaans-speaking people, which will delay good relations between the races for 20 or 30 years in this country. But it is fortunate that the Government, the Nationalist Party, is not doing the same from its side. They know the Nationalist Party and ought to know that if this side of the House wants to start inciting&#x2014;and it has an enormous quantity of ammunition with which to do it&#x2014;the Afrikaners against the English-speaking people, the attempts of that side of the House will look like playing with dolls and like the work of amateurs in comparison. It is fortunate that this side of the House withholds itself from that course of causing a cleavage almost forever between the language groups in the country.</block>

<p>And then my hon. friend the hon. member for Yeoville, Mr. Marais Steyn, made an interjection; he said, &#x201C;oh;&#x201D;. After he had made that interjection, according to Hansard, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<p>&#x2026; and even when he left our party. Then I want to make this point, in view of the fact that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition accused me and my party. When the hon. member for Bezuidenhout left our party, he said many things, but there is one thing he could never say, and that is that hatred was being stirred up by this side of the House. He could not say that, nor was it the case. That was not the case in Dr. Malan&#x2019;s time; it was not the case in Mir. Strydom&#x2019;s time, and it was not the case in Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s time, and it is most definitely not the case in my time.</p>

<p>Sir, I am not dealing with a debating point. [Interjections.] Hon. members should not ask a question and then react in this manner while I am replying to it. Elementary decency requires one not to behave like that. To me this matter is very important because with me it is not merely a question of words, but because this party has shown by its actions that it wants to perpetuate the goodwill between Afrikaans and English-speaking people; that it wants to bring Afrikaans and English-speaking people together. But this party continually finds, in everything it does, that English-speaking people are being roused against it. I could confirm this to you in so many ways. We may just as well take this example, and I simply picked it at random while going through my files in this regard. Take the appointment of my friend Mr. Frankie Waring and that of the late Mr. Trollip. My predecessor saw in them two people who could be included in a Cabinet on merit.</p>

But while we are on that point, I want to state it very clearly here that on numerous occasions the accusation was levelled against us, and the hon. member for Yeoville was one of those who did so, especially at the time of the referendum, that we did not want to establish a Republic for the reasons for which we said we wanted it. No, allegedly we only wanted a Republic here in order that we might interfere with the rights of the English-speaking people. That accusation was levelled against us, and now I state here categorically that this Government has now been in power for 24 years and that in those 24 years there has been no interference with the rights of English-speaking people, and I stand here fully realizing my responsibility as the leader of this party, and I am telling the hon. member for South Coast that I shall not allow anybody to interfere with the rights of English-speaking people as long as I am in charge of this Government.</p>

Whether a man, who becomes a member of this House, is unilingual or bilingual, is the problem of his voters who elect him to this House.</p>

<p>You see how ridiculous the hon. the Prime Minister is making himself, Sir. What about Culwick whom they nominated against Harry Lewis in Natal&#x003F; He had been in South Africa for just over two years, not even five years. He was disqualified because he did not have the necessary qualifications. Was he bilingual&#x003F; Did the Prime Minister veto him is a candidate&#x003F; What about Senator Peterson, who was elected as a Senator in Natal&#x003F; Was he bilingual&#x003F; Let us draw a veil over that sort of thing. We want to build South Africa together. I believe that when a man comes up for Cabinet rank he should be bilingual. I believe he should be able to serve the people of both races in their own language. I agree with the Prime Minister. What else does he want&#x003F; How else must a man be a good South African other than vote for the Nationalist Party&#x003F; That is what we want to know. The tragedy is that as a result of the activities of this hon. Minister of Defence, he has caused a bitterness in South Africa which is going to take years for the Nationalist Party to live down, despite what I accept as the genuine attempts by the hon. the Prime Minister. The hon. gentleman said that the time has come for us to put an end to incidents of this kind. I accept that. Let us put an end to incidents of that kind. Will he talk to the Minister of Defence; will he talk to the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions and will he talk to the Minister of Mines&#x003F; I will assure him that people on my side of the House will show respect for both languages and both language groups as we do at every single one of our congresses where there is infinitely more Afrikaans and English spoken on the basis of nearly 50/50, than ever happens in their congresses. This happens time and time again. One must look to the body of the party. Take the percentage of English speaking in their party and the percentage of Afrikaans speaking in our party. You will then find that Afrikaans- and English-speaking persons in this Party are very nearly fifty-fifty. I give the assurance that since I have been leader of this party there has never been one incident between English speaking and Afrikaans speaking in the ranks of the United Party.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, how did this debate originate; what gave rise to this afternoon&#x2019;s debate&#x003F; Nothing more than the demanding of their primary rights, within and outside this House, by Afrikaners. Nothing more, and nothing less, than the fact that the Afrikaner asks that he be respected and that his rights be respected. The hon. member of the Opposition wants to dismiss the matter with the words &#x201C;stupid propaganda-making&#x201D;. He says that it is &#x201C;stupid propaganda-making&#x201D; if this side of the House asks that the Afrikaner be respected. I want to associate myself with what the hon. the Prime Minister stated so very effectively here. Sir, every previous leader of the National Party may be quoted on his standpoint in respect of this matter. Every single leader of the National Party has on some occasion or other expressed an opinion on this particular matter. <span class="col_5207-5208" refersTo="page_1067"/>Gen. Hertzog began by doing so when he was still speaking Dutch, in the old days. At the first opportunity he had expressed an opinion on this matter as long ago as 1912, but I am not going to quote his words now. I was present on one occasion in the City Hall of Durban, when Dr. Malan was speaking there. He said on that occasion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To the question regarding the direction in which South Africa&#x2019;s safety and happiness lie, there can be but one single and simple answer, which can thus be summarized : First of all there must be a serious and determined effort to consolidate the two White races into a national] unity, not by artificial means, but by the creation of ever more common ground between them. This is only possible on the basis of equal rights ungrudgingly conceded and faithfully applied, as well as full and common participation in our South African nationhood.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to come to what the present Prime Minister said when he was speaking at the Settler Monument. I should like to quote for the record what he said on that occasion. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And today the descendants of the Voortrekkers and the Settlers again, I believe, have come to an understanding, an understanding which flows from the fact that they both accept, not only that the Republic of South Africa is their only home and fatherland, which claims their undivided loyalty and love, but also that there is room for both to work and to live for the fatherland.</block>

<p>Over the years we had the express desire from leaders of that side. What do we find on this side of the House&#x003F; The hon. the Prime Minister said this and it deserves to be emphasized. Because the Afrikaner is insisting on his rights, he is denounced as an inciter of racial hatred by that side of the House. I want to quote from the same source, and the same authority which the hon. the Prime Minister quoted from. I am quoting from Hansard of 5th February, 1953, col. 706. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I do not want to state that every man on that side is un-South African but we have noticed that the ruling spirit on that side is anti-South Africa.</block>

<p>In col. 707 he goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The truth of the matter is that these attacks stem from a dislike of him because he is the man who introduced bilingualism where there was unilingualism in the Defence Force &#x2026;</block>

<p>He was referring to the then Minister of Defence. He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; what was foreign he changed to something South African, and what was red he changed to orange. He gave to the South African Defence Force the uniform, the language and the colour of South Africa. That is why the other side of the House is so hostile towards him.</block>

<p>If you insist on what is your own then you are not accepted by that side of the House; then you are regarded as being a race hater. What did the hon. the Minister of Defence say&#x003F; He replied in this debate to a point of dispute raised by the hon. member for Durban Point. The hon. the Minister said he wanted to know why these hon. members could not also go and address meetings at Oudtshoorn during the by-election there. Then the hon. member for Durban Point attacked him. What did the hon. the Minister of Defence say&#x003F; I challenge any hon. member to tell me where he made an attack on English-speaking persons in South Africa and where he insulted them. Where was he inciting racial hatred in what he said here&#x003F; Sir, we had the problem that we have certain members in this House, such as the member for Zululand&#x2014;whom I cannot call the &#x201C;hon. member for Zululand&#x201D;, but the member for Zululand&#x2014;who rose in this House in the process of this hatred-inciting campaign, and said, &#x201C;Mr. Chairman, death by torture is becoming commonplace in South Africa.&#x201D; That is what the member for Zululand said in this House. On that occasion he implicated South Africa.</p>

He said that for world consumption <span class="col_5209-5210" refersTo="page_1068"/>and to stir up hatred against this side of the House. If there is anything which stirs up hatred, then it is that attitude. He said this with reference to the Bultfontein case in which the police were involved. If there was ever a hate-fomenting process, then he is the greatest instigator thereof. Sir, have you ever heard more offensive words in this House than those which the hon. member used on that occasion&#x003F; But if we on this side react to that and insist on our rights, then we are told that we are stirring up and instigating hatred. [Interjection.] I shall repeat it for the hon. member if he did not hear what I said. I quoted what he had said from Hansard. I stated that he had said : &#x201C;Death by torture is becoming commonplace in South Africa&#x201D;. I hope it has penetrated to him now. It seems to me as if he has problems, and cannot hear what I am saying to him. Sir, I maintain that this is the greatest instigation of racial hatred which he has ever made himself guilty of, and which I have ever heard in this House. These are examples of what we have from that side of the House. The hon. member is not reacting to that, Sir.</p>

<p>Let me tell the hon. the Prime Minister immediately that my attitude in this Parliament has always been that what has been said has been said. I do not think that he or any <span class="col_5211-5212" refersTo="page_1069"/>other member will find me running away from anything I have said at any time. What is more, it does not worry me either that quotations are made from speeches that are on record and which reflect one&#x2019;s considered and honest opinion of the situation at that time. If the hon. the Prime Minister thinks that he is embarrassing me with that, he must simply keep on thinking so. I can assure him that that is not the case. Sir, I was a member of the United Party in the days when fusion took place under Gen. Hertzog, and let me say&#x2014;I have said it in this House before&#x2014;that it was the best party which South Africa has ever had; that was probably the happiest time in the political history of South Africa. I am very glad that I already had the opportunity to be interested in politics in those days. We all know that when the war broke out, a very sharp and bitter division occurred. My own feelings were on the side of Gen. Hertzog as a leader and a person; but I was strongly anti-imperialist, and on the grounds of my opposition to Nazi imperialism I supported Gen. Smuts. I was against all forms of imperialism&#x2014;communist imperialism, British imperialism, Nazi imperialism. I was against all forms of imperialism and I still am today, and if my country is threatened by a form of imperialism, I will fight it.</p>

But, Sir, I would be dishonest if I should get up here today and say that the Nationalist Party still thinks so.

Sir, I have been sitting as an M.P. on this side under the present leadership for the past ten years. I would definitely not have been sitting here if the situation which applied during the war years still applied in this party today. I would not have been sitting here, and if my word is not taken for it, I could quote anything which any of those members, from the Prime Minister to the Minister of Community Development, in the National Party said 20 or 30 years ago, and then I am entitled to say it still applies to that party. No, I may say that in the years I have been sitting in Parliament on this side of the House, in each case where the interests of the Afrikaans-speaking people were concerned, whether it concerned universities that were to be established or any other matter&#x2014;there was the fullest co-operation from the English-speaking people in this party; and in many cases, let me say, where, for example, the establishment of an Afrikaans university or the real cultural interests of the Afrikaner were concerned, it was men such as those sitting immediately behind me, men such as the hon. member for Durban North and the hon. member for Musgrave, who often came forward most strongly and joined me in supporting the promotion of these matters.

<p>I want to add this, that I do not know of anybody who is in his right mind and who objects to the principle of bilingualism. There is certainly no such person on this side of the House. As regards the principle of equal treatment of the two languages in the public sector, I may say that it is firmly established in South Africa and I do not know of anybody who is threatening it, except the section that broke away from that party and pretend to be the real Nationalists today. But now a campaign is suddenly started which really has nothing to do with the interests of the two language groups, but which has everything to do with the interests of the party opposite. And now a terrible injustice is suddenly being done to the Afrikaans language. Sir, my point of view has always been that a person who goes into public life must either be bilingual or make himself bilingual and from that point of view I will not diverge &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#hartzenberg">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. HARTZENBERG</person>:</from>

<p>I am very pleased that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout admitted, after he had been challenged by the hon. the Prime Minister, that he had, in fact, spoken the truth in 1952 when he said that the United Party discriminates against Afrikaners, and I say that the hon. member, in saying that, implied that the hon. member for Durban Point did not speak the truth today when he said that this was not the case in 1952. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout today gave the hon. member for Durban Point the lie in this House. The second point I want to mention is the following. When the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said in 1952 that this was the case in the United Party, it was denied just as vehemently by those hon. members as they are doing today and as it was denied by the hon. member for Durban Point today. I am asking you now, Sir, if they denied it in 1952 and if they are still denying it today, what guarantee do we have for believing that their denial means anything today&#x003F; I want to quote somebody else who has belonged to several parties in South Africa. Since the Prime Minister said that that member was in the National Party initially and saw the United Party from the outside and that he was subsequently in the United Party and therefore saw both parties from the outside, I just want to say that this member now belongs to the United Party once more, and I wonder whether he <span class="col_5215-5216" refersTo="page_1071"/>is able to see them objectively now. I want to quote Mr. Serfontein&#x2019;s article which appeared in the <i>Sunday Times</i> on Sunday. He made precisely the same statement the hon. member for Bezuidenhout had made in 1952. He said that this was still the case in South Africa and that it is surprising that there are not 1 000 language incidents in South Africa every day on account of discrimination against the Afrikaner. The hon. member said that he had spoken 20 years ago, but he did not speak 20 years ago and then stopped speaking. In the <i>Cape Argus</i> of 2nd June, 1960, he adopted the same standpoint, and that was eight years later. This question is one of the most important questions in the history of South Africa, and I now want to tell hon. members that the hon. member proved today that the attitude of the United Party is to discriminate against the Afrikaner. Since he adopted that standpoint in 1960 we have had no evidence from the United Party to prove that they have changed their attitude; on the contrary, we have had evidence that this is still their attitude. In order to put this matter in its true perspective I should like to quote briefly to hon. members from two speeches made by two South Africans. The first quotation comes from a speech made by President Steyn at the National Convention. In that speech he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But, gentlemen, we may just as well leave the work undone, leave as it is, unless we try at the same time to unite or re-unite the two White races of South Africa. If we do not do that we shall not achieve unification in the true sense of the word. This is not an impossible task. Look at the two races. They lived together for a whole century and yet remained divided. Something must have been wrong. We must resolve to place the two races on an absolutely equal footing in the Constitution. If we are not going to do that, we may just as well not tackle the rest of the work. There can be no unity without equality. As long as one race feels that it has to occupy a position subservient to that of the other the feeling of being treated unjustly will remain, and this feeling will form a barrier between these two races. I have said that the two races agree on most issues. Language constitutes the major exception. In this respect there has to be absolute equality in Parliament, in the law courts, schools, public service, everywhere&#x2014;in other words, Dutch must be the official language of South Africa together with English. Gentlemen, we ask this not as a favour, but as our right. Our language has lost its official character solely as a result of force. We had to yield to force. The Constitution we are in the proses of drafting now will be our own doing and nobody can expect us to place our language and our nation in a subservient position. If we were to do that, our people would never approve of it and instead of unifying South Africa, we would be dividing her even further.</block>

In that ideal union, certainly in their minds, unilingualism and not bilingualism was the ideal when they went to the Convention.

<p>I now want to make the point that the difference between the Afrikaners in that party and Afrikaners such as President Steyn is the following : President Steyn delivered a passionate plea for unity to the National Convention but he insisted on his rights as an Afrikaner, and those Afrikaners of that party say that they are relinquishing their Afrikanership. They do not insist on their rights in that respect. [Interjections.] I now want to go further and say that the difference between the English-speaking hon. members on that side and Dr. Jameson is the following: When the Afrikaner in the person of President Steyn rose to plead for his rights, he was magnanimous enough to admit that he did not comprehend the situation and therefore conceded that President Steyn was right. The only policy we have from members of that party and from the leader of that party, is the policy of those Afrikaans-speaking people who say that they have to relinquish their Afrikanership. Not one of them rose to say that that was not the policy of the United Party. I suggest that the United Party are using those Afrikaners. Jameson happened to be a Sir and once again there is a Sir in that party. I want to say that he is using those Afrikaners in his party to do things he is not prepared to do himself. The Afrikaner rose in the person of President Steyn and demanded his rights, and those rights were granted. I will accept that the United Party is honest when it says that its policy is what it is when the leader of that party rises and says that those members who, on behalf of the United Party, say that they have to relinquish their Afrikanership, are wrong and that it is his policy that the Afrikaner has the right to fight for his rights. He must call those people to order when they continue vehemently to attack, smear and insult Afrikaner organizations as much as they can.</p>

In view of what that hon. member said the other day, one has to accept that he is also ashamed of President Steyn and what he did at he National Convention. When one considers the past of this English-speaking person, Sir Jameson, he cannot be regarded as a South African who was inspired by a mighty spirit of South Africa first.

<p>Mr. Chairman, it was quite interesting to hear what the hon. member read to us. It seems to me that it has slipped his mind that the late President Steyn was the first chairman of the old South African Party. [Interjections.] He has also forgotten that President Steyn&#x2019;s son was a Cabinet Minister under Gen. Smuts and that he remained in that party until his death, and that his grandson is one of the regional chairmen of the United Party. And yet the allegation has been made that the Afrikaner in the United Party is asked to give up something. I want to put it quite clearly that we are asking no one to give up any part of his Afrikanerhood or of his rights as an English-speaking person. The only thing he has to realize is that he gains something additional, and that is to become a real South African under the United Party. [Interjections.] The hon. the Prime Minister was still saying that he wanted to test the United Party against its actions. He referred to the Executive Committee in Natal.</p>

<p>Dr. G. F. JACOBS; Mr. Chairman, before I proceed I just want to say something on this issue. The hon. the Prime Minister says that he wants deeds and not words, but I want to ask him just one question. If national unity is so meaningful to him, and I accept his good faith in this regard, why does he not permit us to have bilingual schools&#x003F; Why has that party artificially separated all our children at school&#x003F; How can we ever acquire the measure of bilingualism we are seeking to get if our children are artificially separated at school&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>No, you can reply later. Earlier in the day I raised the question of the wage gap with the hon. the Prime Minister. I pointed out to him that the policy of his party as stated by him specifically was that the wage gap must be closed. I gave him facts and figures; in fact, I quoted his own words to show that that gap is in fact widening. The hon. the Prime Minister today spoke for an hour and a half, but he has not yet given us an answer to that particular issue. We would like to think that he will do so tomorrow.</p>

<p>The second issue I tried to raise is that the hon. the Prime Minister, in addressing the Sakekamer earlier this year, indicated that fair-weather Afrikaners and other South Africans were propagating something that would lead to the creation of a social welfare state in South Africa. What I am trying to suggest is that it is not these gentlemen who want Socialism in South Africa, but that it is established fact. We have galloping socialism; all the insidious aspects of Socialism are there. The trouble is we have not got the welfare side of it. This has a long history. In 1942 certain gentlemen drew up a so-called draft Republican Constitution, and in that particular document, and I gather that certain hon. gentlemen who sit here played a leading role in its drafting, it was said that ultimately the State would have all economic power in its hands. That is precisely our charge; the Government is usurping more and more economic power, and this manifests itself in 101 different ways. There are the giant State enterprises, which operate virtually outside the parameters of jurisdiction of this House, which are not answerable to shareholders and which are getting a bigger and bigger slice of the national economic cake. We have more and more controls. The availability of labour is controlled; the use you can make of labour is controlled; credit is controlled, interest rates are controlled; also where you site your industry. That kind of control to anybody else in the world would suggest Socialism. That is why some of our industrialists and top businessmen are throwing up their arms in despair and are saying, &#x201C;Let us return to the free market mechanism in South Africa&#x201D;. Dr. Hupkes is on record, and I can quote dozens of others who have taken exactly the same line. So we have Socialism in this country; it is an established fact.</p>

<p><span class="col_5223-5224" refersTo="page_1075"/>No, I am not interested in questions asked by that hon. member.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I mention only that in 1970 the public sector&#x2019;s share of total investments in South Africa came to 46 per cent. Now, if nearly half the national investment in a country is controlled by the Government, then you have Socialism. From 1960 to 1970 expenditure in the public sector on both capital and loan account grew at the annual rate of 12 per cent. This is three times more than the growth of our GDP. Right at the moment, a quarter of our GDP. is taken up by public spending. If ever you want an example of Socialism, there you have it. As I have indicated we have all the elements of Socialism. There is bureaucratic control. We have more control boards per head of population in South Africa than in any free enterprise system anywhere in the world. We have excessively high taxes. All these factors are indicative of a very considerable degree of Socialism in South Africa. But as I indicated earlier on, the unfortunate part is that in South Africa we do not have the welfare side. We talk about Britain very often as a social welfare state. There a pensioner, irrespective of the colour of his skin and irrespective of a means test, receives R60 per month, which is appreciably more than a pensioner receives in this country. When we talk about White pensioners, that is one thing; but the Black pensioner in this country gets one-seventh of that amount. I think in a country which claims that it is one of the most affluent societies in the world, that is a national disgrace. My charge is that the Prime Minister is wrong. It is not the people who are seeking the establishment of a social welfare state here. We have Socialism, foisted upon us by the Government; but we do not have the compensatory welfare services to go with it.</p>

<p>I want to return to one other issue.</p>

<p>*This concerns the independent Bantu homelands which are now going to come into being; but this is no longer an academic question; this has now become actual. The Government has made promises that they are going to become independent, and now we see Chief Kaizer Matanzima taking up all these promises. Recently, when the hon. Prime Minister had an interview with the periodical <i>To the Point,</i> he indicated very clearly that, as far as he was concerned, &#x201C;if they want to go the way of Moscow or Peking&#x201D;, they could do so.</p>

<p>&#x2020; He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have said it more than once: I should not find it attractive nor wise, but if they want to become left-orientated &#x2026;</block>

<p>We all know what that means to the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; then it is their concern. I should regret it. I should warn them against it but for the rest it is their concern.</block>

<p>This is very explicit what the hon. the Prime Minister had in mind. Obviously they could find there are no limitations. They could establish treaties with communist states. I want to know whether this is Cabinet policy. I wonder whether that has been condoned and approved by the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s caucus. The hon. the Minister of Defence who is, after all, responsible for the defence of South Africa, when talking at Newcastle, as was reported in the <i>Cape Times</i> of the 14th March, 1970, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United Party candidate was telling voters that the independent Bantustans would negotiate with communist countries and form alliances with them. This would never be allowed to happen.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, who is right&#x003F; The hon. the Prime Minister has now repudiated his Minister of Defence on a most serious issue. How could he conceivably keep him in his Cabinet if there is this clash of views on a fundamental question of this kind&#x003F; The hon. the Prime Minister said they could form alliances with communist states; he would virtually wash his hands; he would be unhappy about it, but there was nothing he could do about it. Yet, his Minister of Defence takes a diametrically opposite line. I think the country wants an explanation on this issue too.</p>

<p>Yes, this certainly is a scandal. This is the biggest scandal in the history of this Government. Is that not so&#x003F; [Interjections.] I do not know whether I am wrong; I say: &#x201C;Up to the present this is the biggest scandal.&#x201D; Hon. members must tell me whether I am wrong.</p>

<p>&#x2020; Mr. Chairman, when I raised this matter, the hon. the Prime Minister invited me to raise the matter during his Vote, and I do so now. I accept his invitation. I want to say that this has been the concern of the hon. the Prime Minister ever since this matter first began. He was the person who in fact appointed the commission of inquiry into this matter. This he did as a result, <i>inter alia,</i> of the &#x201C;skinderstories&#x201D; and the gossip which were going around in the Boksburg constituency, on his own evidence. According to the Minister of Police, it was he, the Prime Minister, who set up the Police inquiry about September of 1970. That inquiry is still going on. Now, 18 months later, it is not expected to be concluded until June. In the course of his investigation this ugly scandal has suddenly become &#x201C;a delicate matter&#x201D;, in fact a &#x201C;very delicate matter&#x201D;, according to the hon. the Minister of Police. Perhaps the hon. the Prime Minister can tell us why it has become delicate.</p>

</speech>

<p>It is not the Agliotti affair, but the investigation which is delicate.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Oh, the investigation has become delicate&#x003F; Why has it become delicate&#x003F; It is &#x201C;very delicate&#x201D; according to the hon. the Minister, and &#x201C;delicate&#x201D; according to the Commissioner of Police. Now we are told that the investigations are not going to be completed until June of this year. The hon. the Minister cannot tell us; perhaps the hon. the Prime Minister can tell us which Minister is in fact in charge of the Agliotti inquiry. Sir, I think we are entitled to ask this question, not only because the hon. the Prime Minister first initiated the Police inquiry&#x2014;he ordered it, according to the Minister of Police&#x2014;but also because of the strange events which have occurred since then.</p>

<p>The strangest event is that event where Gen. Danie Bester, the Deputy Commissioner of Police and the investigator into the Agliotti matter, was investigated behind his back by the Police in respect of a statement he is alleged to have made, that there was interference by the Government in his investigation into the Agliotti scandal. The Commissioner himself conducted this investigation. He even asked a witness for a sworn statement himself. One can only believe that this investigation into Gen. Bester took place either as a result of a sworn statement being placed before him, or on the instruction of someone else. The only people, as I have said before, who could have done this can be the hon. the Prime Minister or the Minister of Police. It was not the Minister of Police; that much we know, because he knew nothing about it.</p>

<p>There are three very unusual things which strike one immediately. In the first place, when this is investigated, Gen. Bester is not told; in the second place, the Commissioner wanted sworn statements. This was not a departmental inquiry; there is provision for that. It was also not a criminal charge. As I have said, even a common thief is confronted with a charge, and the matter is then investigated. The most unusual thing of all is that that Minister of Police did not know that this was going on. It was as a result of my raising this matter that the hon. the Prime Minister invited me to raise it on his Vote. The question I put to him then he did not answer. I now ask him again: Would it be possible that he, as the Minister of Police, <span class="col_5227-5228" refersTo="page_1077"/>would not know that an investigation was being conducted into the Deputy Commissioner of Police by the Commissioner himself, requiring sworn statements about what he said&#x003F; The only explanation is either that this Minister of Police should be sacked for allowing this to happen without his knowing anything about it, or that he did not know anything about it because the hon. the Prime Minister himself ordered that inquiry.</p>

<p>I am not excited. What I want to say is this: When we want to talk about this matter and when we raise the matter in the Budget debate, what happens&#x003F; The hon. the Minister of Police does not answer; he puts in the hon. member for Prinshof. Why the hon. member for Prinshof&#x003F; It seems that the hon. member for Prinshof knows a lot more about this than the hon. the Minister of Police, because in the <i>Transvaler</i> on Monday, 20th March, this year, a report appeared of a speech made by the hon. member for Prinshof. He was asked a question about the Agliotti matter, and he said it was a &#x201C;pluimpie in die hoed&#x201D;, a feather in the cap of the Government, and so on. This sort of thing, he said, happens in other countries and it is not always followed up; here it is being followed up. Then he said the most significant thing&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Toe die Eerste Minister, mnr. Vorster, verneem het van die moontlike oneerlikheid met die aankoop van die grond van Agliotti, het hy onmiddellik &#x2019;n kommissie van ondersoek gelas.</block>

<p>That must mean the &#x201C;polisie-ondersoek&#x201D;. What does that mean, and what does he know about it&#x003F; And why should this &#x201C;eintlik&#x201D; have happened&#x003F; Surely that is enough to make people wonder. Sir, what is going on in this Agliotti case&#x003F; Having regard to the nature of the allegation which was being investigated, can one wonder that <i>Hoofstad</i> in a leading article on Friday, 25th February, 1972, after the Brakpan disaster for the Nationalist Party, wrote what they wrote&#x003F; I have not got time to read it all out, but I will pass it along to the hon. the Prime Minister if he wants it.</p>

<p>Apparently the hon. the Minister of Transport has got it. What they say, Sir, is that there are people within the Nationalist Party who are helping themselves to grow bigger and richer through their positions. Surely, Sir, that is going to be investigated, too. But do not say that these are &#x201C;skinderstories van die Sappe&#x201D;. This appeared in <i>Hoofstad.</i></p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Prime Minister what it is that causes this investigation to be so delayed. Surely it is very important, on the Prime Minister&#x2019;s own statement of his attitude towards this sort of thing. Is this no more important than whether Albert Hertzog said that R50 million was going to be spent on BOSS&#x003F; Is it not more important to the country and the integrity of the Government&#x003F; But what does he do about this&#x003F; Nothing, Sir, It has been going on for 18 months and he is going to allow it to go on until June. Why until June&#x003F; Why cannot this matter be brought to a head&#x003F; What is involved; who is involved&#x003F;</p>

<p>Sir, I raise those questions in regard to these two matters because they warrant answers which we have not had, and I believe that the hon. the Prime Minister is the only one who can give us the answers.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of the payment by the State of the costs of the hon. the Minister of Community Development. This was obviously a Cabinet decision. According to the hon. the Minister of Justice, these costs were paid by the State because the Cabinet accepts that when the Minister of Community Development uttered this defamation he acted in the course and scope of his position as a Cabinet Minister, and on that basis the State decided to pay his costs. But that is not the case of the hon. the Minister of Community Development. In the offending article which gave rise to this action the hon. the Minister of Community Development said&#x2014;</p>

<p>Sir, if the hon. member for Durban North stands up we see an Agliotti standing up. We are tired of Agliotti and of him. The hon. the Minister of Police gave an explanation of the matter here, and the hon. member and I both listened to it. I was satisfied by the hon. the Minister, and I think that hon. member is again just sinking to the usual level the Opposition sinks to when they cannot get any further with their case.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to come back briefly to the speech of the hon. member for Hillbrow yesterday afternoon. I want to point out that the idiom and the content of the speech of the hon. member for Hillbrow was as close to that of the Progressive Party as it could possibly get. What the hon. member had to say about the &#x201C;wage gap&#x201D;, about the gap between the pensions of Whites and non-Whites, appears almost verbatim in a letter I received this week from the Young Progressives here in Cape Town. There is virtually no difference between what he said here last night and what the Young Progressives said.</p>

<speech by="#reinecke">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. REINECKE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Hillbrow is the last person to accuse the State, as he did last night in his speech, of playing an ever greater part in the commercial sector. As an intimate authority on the Anglo-American Corporation, such as that hon. member is, he ought to know better than to say the kind of thing he said yesterday afternoon in his speech here. Sir, he speaks of growing socialism. Surely that is what he and his party are continually asking for&#x2014;a welfare state. He is the last hon. member to speak about that. The hon. member speaks in disparaging terms of control boards. Sir, what control boards did he mean&#x003F; What was the hon. member referring to so scornfully&#x003F; A characteristic of the hon. member&#x2019;s speech yesterday was that it was simply a lumping together of a lot of generalizations, a kind of emotional defence. Sir, this is not the hon. member we know. We ask ourselves whether the slaps he got from the <i>Sunday Times</i> about his &#x201C;White backlash&#x201D; speech so unnerved him that he has not yet regained his self-confidence. As former crown prince of the United Party and former political prophet, the fact that his own newspaper and his own party&#x2014;both his parties&#x2014;discredited him must have been a bitter pill for him to swallow. I really advise the hon. member for Hillbrow to stand up and walk across to his rightful bench&#x2014;the seat next to the hon. member for Houghton. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I should very much like to come back to the Vote under discussion and to a matter very dear to my heart, i.e. State security and our Prime Minister&#x2019;s role in it. Sir, when the circle round the old Transvaal Republic was closed by Rhodes and Jameson, the spiritual forefathers of the United Party and of the hon. member for Houghton&#x2019;s party &#x2026; [Interjections.] &#x2026;</p>

<p>President Paul Kruger did not come along with lamentations, dirges and federation plans. He saw through them. He said at the time that the foreigners did not want the right to vote, they wanted his country. When he saw his country was being threatened, what did President Paul Kruger do&#x003F; In good time he prepared his country militarily to defend it against whatever odds; he steeled his people to resist. Sir, what is the position in this country today&#x003F; The communists&#x2014;the yellow communists from the East and the red communists from the Kremlin&#x2014;have their eyes mercilessly fixed on Africa, particularly Southern Africa, and specifically South Africa. What is more, the communists are not concerned about any Whites in this country, whether United Party, National Party of Progressive Party men, whether English, Afrikaans or German-speaking. The communists are not concerned about integration or non-integration. So, Sir, they want this country, its riches and its open spaces for their masses which they cannot accommodate. International Communism wants this strategic sea-route around the Cape, because in the coming conflict between themselves and the West control of this strategic sea-route is going to be of decisive importance. For what other reason do we ever so often have reports of Russian submarines and warships sailing here round the Cape of Good Hope&#x003F; That, Sir, is the harsh reality facing the Republic, and the United Party men are too blind to see that they are continually playing into the hands of those powers. [Interjections.] Sir, my Afrikaner people, who have now for a long time walked the path of prosperity, who have <span class="col_5231-5232" refersTo="page_1079"/>begun to yield before the economic onslaught so that they are building up a grievance vote for the United Party, have begun to forget how to notice how this communist octopus is curling its tentacles round Southern Africa; how to notice that within the foreseeable future the communists, upon completion of the Tanzam railway line, would bring heavy weapons, i.e. artillery and tanks, up to the banks of the Zambezi, close to Katima Mulilo; but then, dramatically and suddenly under our very noses, near Potgietersrus, on a quiet Good Friday just the other day, a passenger train was hurled off a railway bridge and dozens of innocent Bantu were flung to their deaths. Sir, further attempts at sabotage are taking place in our midst, directly and indirectly. There are terrorist trials in progress in our country in which the Police are bringing diabolical aspects to light. [Interjections.] Sir, all at once my people dug in their heels and were joined by every responsible person in this country, including the law-abiding Bantu. The red warning lights are flashing everywhere. This is not merely a case of more shock reports about our brave policemen who died in the Caprivi in a dastardly fashion. Everyone on a train or in an aircraft is now continually anxious, wondering whether it is not going to happen again. Everyone realizes that the red saboteur is now in our midst; he is no longer far away. Now the urgent warnings of our hon. Prime Minister and our hon. Minister of Police have come strongly to the fore in recent months and years. All at once this whole picture is fully and clearly before our people. What is the picture&#x003F; This Government is prepared for what is now happening. State security and the safety of the country are at this moment the Republic&#x2019;s top priority. All at once, while that hon. member, the prophet who was silenced, was sitting and mumbling, it was brought home to the people that the red saboteurs are here, and the time for cheap political games by anti-National elements, such as those of that party, is past, because this people is tired of it.

<p>Were it not for the serious aspect of what the hon. member for Pretoria District has just said, I would have treated him and what he has said with complete contempt. His attempts to smear this side of the House and this party in regard to their loyalty towards the security of South Africa is a disgrace which we reject with the contempt which it deserves. But what is important is that this hon. member raised this afternoon the dangers facing South Africa, dangers which we on this side of the House recognize, and in the combating of which we play our full part, and towards the fighting of which we are dedicated, and in the physical combating of which our sons are playing their part. These dangers are dangers facing all of South Africa and in fighting them, all South Africans are taking part&#x2014;all South Africans, and not just Nationalists as that hon. member implied. I repeat&#x2014;not just Nationalists, but all loyal and patriotic South Africans. And the man under whom they have to fight, the man who is responsible for our security, is the hon. the Minister of Defence.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I am not prepared to answer any questions in a ten-minute speech. The hon. the Minister of Defence is the Minister responsible for maintaining the dedication of our youth in the fight against Communism. He is the Minister responsible for the <i>esprit de corps,</i> the morale and the loyalty of our troops, in the defence of our fatherland against assault from outside. Yet how does he maintain that morale and that dedication of spirit&#x003F; By getting up in this House last week and accusing anyone who does not speak the one language of being an &#x201C;Afrikaner-hater&#x201D; and not a good South African&#x003F; What was the test he applied&#x003F; He said that any person who did not speak Afrikaans in this House was an &#x201C;Afrikaner-hater&#x201D;. But he went further and he said that any person who could speak Afrikaans and did not, was an even worse &#x201C;Afrikaner-hater&#x201D;. In other words, he places as the test of patriotism and of South Africanism the language which you speak.</p>

<p><span class="col_5233-5234" refersTo="page_1080"/>Sir, I am not prepared to let the hon. the Prime Minister get away with his pious appeal yesterday for unity. He is the Prime Minister of South Africa and his Minister responsible for our security has, I believe, done South Africa a grave disservice. We have the Prime Minister&#x2019;s pious word : &#x201C;I am pure.&#x201D; He challenges us on this, that and the other, and then he goes back twenty years to find a speech to prove that this side of the House has &#x201C;Afrikanerhaters&#x201D; and is not truly South African. We can all do that. I have a speech here, signed, a message which says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As Afrikaner in murg en been het ek een onuitwisbare ideaal en dit is die bou van &#x2019;n verenigde Suid-Afrikaanse nasie, bestaande uit sowel Afrikaans- as Engels-sprekendes. Ek is oortuig daarvan dat ons hierdie ideaal kan gebruik met die volgende beleid, wat die beleid van die Verenigde Party is, en dit is die beleid wat ek beloof om te ondersteun.</block>

<p>That is by a member of the Cabinet, Mr. Blaar Coetzee, and was signed by him&#x2014; and this was after the speech which the hon. the Prime Minister quoted. We can also prove anything this way. But what I believe is significant in this debate on unity, is the fact that whilst this side of the House has reacted strongly to the allegations, we have not retaliated in kind. That is the test of South Africanism. We have been angered, and I want to say to the hon. the Prime Minister that many of us have been embittered and we have been hurt not only in this House, but throughout South Africa. We have been hurt by what has been said. We remember broken meetings, broken up when Nationalist Party organizers have screamed : &#x201C;Praat Afrikaans; ons wil nie die rooitaal hier h&#x00EA; nie.&#x201D; Under this Prime Minister we know of circulars that have gone out to public servants, instructions to them, that they may not write an internal letter in English in their departments. The hon. the Minister of Finance, when I raised the matter, said that he had gone into it and it was correct and he has instructed that it be withdrawn. [Interjections.] It was in the Department of Customs and Excise, and I have the actual instruction, written by the Secretary of the department, and it stands in Hansard. The Minister had to have that instruction withdrawn. Where do we get with this sort of accusation&#x003F;</p>

<p>I want to say that the Nationalist Party has no monopoly on feelings. It is not only their feelings that can be hurt. They are not the only people who are sensitive, neither has any language group a monopoly of being hurt or not being hurt. When things are said in this House as they have been said by the Government recently, then I want the hon. the Prime Minister to know that people are deeply and bitterly hurt. I want to say to him that it is the United Party and not the Nationalist Party which has fought jingoism in South Africa. It was the United Party which fought the Dominion Party. It was the United Party which fought that Dominion Party, a party which later supported the Government on race policies. It was the United Party which fought the Federal Party in Natal, the party which wanted to secede from South Africa. Where is there any member on that side of the House that fought against it&#x003F; [Interjections.] No, the hon. the Chief Whip can get up and make a speech later; I will then reply to it. Mr. Chairman, it is this side of the House, this party, the United Party, who in the past taught people who were jingoes. Admittedly there were racialists on both sides&#x2014;but it was the United Party which has taken that out of our national life, and out of our politics. We had jingoes, of course we did; and what caused it&#x003F; The bitterness, the extremism of the Nationalist Party. Mr. Chairman, steadily and responsibly we have fought against extremism. We have fought in the United Party, Mr. Chairman, until there was no iota left.</p>

<p>*We were the ones, Mr. Chairman, we in this party, who had to fight English-speaking people in order to make good South Africans of them. [Interiections.] What makes us feel bitter, Mr. Chairman, and I want to conclude with this, is that the years of work, of persuasion, to destroy jingoism and racism between White and White, are undone here within a few hours, a few hours of acrimonious, short-sighted and vindictive speeches. I demand, and we demand, that the Prime Minister repudiate the Minister of Defence as well as the other Ministers who spoke in that vein, in the interests of South Africa. It is not enough to make appeals &#x2026; [Time expired.]</p>

<p>This is what the hon. member says. He says it very clearly. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout does not say it is his opinion; according to the Hansard of 22nd April, 1952, he said (Volume 78, column 4165)&#x2014;</p>

<p>It is not an opinion; he said &#x201C;today the U.P. makes itself guilty of those extravagances &#x2026; "</p>

<p>Now I should like to know from the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, who so piously dictated to us in the <i>Sunday Times</i> what the relations should be and who levelled accusations at the National Party in that pious article of his, whilst we have it on record now that this was the spirit and atmosphere of the United Party up to 1960, whether this is still the case.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Durban North has put this question to me. The hon. member has not only been a member of this House for many years, but is also a senior member of the Bar. To my surprise, referring to the Bester incident firstly, on Sunday before last I had to read the big black headlines: &#x201C;Mitchell names Vorster&#x201D; on the front page of the <i>Sunday Times.</i> The hon. member did not, as one would have expected from a senior member of this House, ask me across the floor of this House by way of a question or otherwise whether I knew anything of this matter at all. Without any iota of evidence, the hon. member ran along to the <i>Sunday Times</i> and made this accusation against me.</p>

Without a shadow of evidence at his disposal, the hon. member, in his bid to seek publicity and to get publicity on the front page of the <i>Sunday Times,</i> dragged me into this. Now he comes along and he repeats that accusation, in spite of the statement by the Commissioner of Police that I had nothing to do with this whatsoever.

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, you did not ask a question; you made this accusation across the floor of the House. You made it in the <i>Sunday Times</i> and later on you also made it across the floor of the House. What was the position as I gathered from the explanation of the hon. the Minister of Justice&#x003F; A certain rumour came to the ears of the Commissioner of Police. It was not only a rumour about Gen. Bester, but also a rumour about the Government in regard to the investigations into the Agliotti affair. The Commissioner of Police has told us that he saw it as his duty to have it investigated immediately. I, for one, am very pleased that the Commissioner of Police did see it as his duty. I would have been disappointed if he did not see it as his duty to have it investigated immediately. What is there then to say further about the matter&#x003F;</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But, Mr. Chairman, the Commissioner of Police has told us that he would have investigated the matter himself. He was seized of the matter himself. He deputed a brigadier to go and investigate this matter, because, as I have already said, I can readily understand it. It is not only a question of General Bester, but it is an imputation against the Government.</p>

<p>Sir, it was a question of the same day and the same morning. What more does the hon. member want in this regard now&#x003F; I would not know. What is more, I do not care whether or not he is satisfied with the explanation; but what does matter to me, is that I shall be glad if in his search for publicity the hon. member would not drag me into this matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member now wants to make propaganda out of the Agliotti affair once again. In that case we may as well restate the facts in that regard across the floor of this House for the umpteenth time. The facts of the matter were that that land had been purchased through the instrumentality of an official on the valuation of two geologists and what could be deduced from the surrounding circumstances. I think it is fair to have been able to deduce that the land was in fact worth much more than that price. Furthermore, there was evidence by people who held that view. The moment it became known that that price had been paid for the land&#x2014;and I reported that here to this House&#x2014;the hon. member for Boksburg brought certain matters to my notice.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Gossip.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, Sir, they were not gossip. They were of such a nature that I took notice of them, and I most certainly do not take any notice of the hon. member for Durban North. I took the necessary steps in that regard. I did not merely speak about it, but hon. members will remember very well that I said I would have this matter investigated and that I did go further than that. Because a contract had been drawn up, I said that even if it would be necessary to annul that contract by way of an Act of Parliament, I would do so, immediately. What more does the hon. member want from me now&#x003F; But I did not merely leave it at that either. I appointed a commissioner to investigate that matter. I even stepped in by having advocates with specialised knowledge appointed while the investigations were in progress already, because I wanted the best evidence to be put forward in regard to this matter. I want to tell hon. members now that if I had not appointed those advocates, the possibility would by no means have been ruled out that the commissioner <span class="col_5243-5244" refersTo="page_1085"/>would have found that the price paid for that land was a fair one. That would not have been ruled out. Because I wanted to make absolutely sure that nothing would go wrong in this regard, I had senior as well as junior advocates appointed, persons with a knowledge of the expropriation of land, and they entered the case. I know I am quite justified in saying that it was as a result of their intervention that the case took the course it did, and that R5 million came back to the State. But what further steps did I take&#x003F; If there are people who want to make propaganda out of this, they are free to do so; if that is the case, there is nothing I can do about it. All I know is that this Government and I personally did the correct thing at all times.</p>

<p>What further steps did I as the responsible Prime Minister take&#x003F; I immediately gave instructions that the report of that commissioner be sent to the Attorney-General. Because it was fair to deduce that an offence had been committed somewhere, I instructed the Police to look into this matter. What more can I do&#x003F; I want to know this now. The Police did not merely leave the matter at that. Who decides on prosecutions in this country&#x003F; Every now and then I gain the impression that if that hon. member had to become Minister of Justice, he would interfere with prosecutions. I gained this impression as a result of certain statements made by him to the effect that he would interfere. It has always been the practice in South Africa&#x2014;and may it always remain the practice&#x2014;that the prerogative to decide whether there should be prosecutions rests with the Attorney-General.</p>

<p>I know what I am talking about; the magistrate&#x2019;s name was Mr. Johannes, and the person who replaced him was Mr. Swart. The hon. member need therefore not tell me anything about that case; I know much more about it than he does. I can give him all the particulars, if he wants them. That is what happened in the United Party&#x2019;s time, but I am leaving it at that. I say: The Attorney-General decides what prosecutions are to take place and what prosecutions are not to take place. I brought the records of the case to the notice of the Attorney-General. The Police have been instructed to investigate the matter from beginning to end. It is not merely the Police on the one side and the Attorney-General on the other side; after all, I told the hon. member that two officials from the office of the Attorney-General are cooperating with the Police in this regard. What more do hon. members want now&#x003F; After all, it is the Attorney-General who has all the information at his disposal, to whom information is made available by those two officials from time to time, and who has to decide whether or not a prosecution is to be instituted. It is he who has to say: &#x201C;I have enough evidence now,&#x201D; or: &#x201C;I do not have enough evidence yet to charge a person.&#x201D; [Interjections.] The Heller case went on for years.</p>

<p>The hon. member is a senior advocate; surely he knows just as well as I do that no Attorney-General would charge a person simply because he wants to do so. He knows that if one charges a person prematurely, before one has all the evidence, and he is acquitted, one cannot charge him again, even if one obtains the evidence later on. Surely the hon. member knows this. Does he now expect the Attorney-General simply <span class="col_5245-5246" refersTo="page_1086"/>to charge people without having the evidence which he may bring against them&#x003F; Now I want to know this from the hon. member: I tell him now that the Police have been instructed to investigate the case as far as it is possible to do so, and that the case is in the hands of the Attorney-General. Is the hon. member making an insinuation, not only against the Minister and against me, but also against the Attorney-General and the Police who are investigating the case, that the Minister, the Attorney-General, the Police and I have laid a plot to the effect that this case should not be brought to finality&#x003F; I now ask the hon. member, since he dragged me into this matter, not to leave it at insinuations.</p>

<p>In the third instance, the hon. member asked me about the costs of the case of the hon. the Minister of Community Development. Surely he got the statement from the hon. the Minister of Justice. We examined the legal position in this regard very thoroughly; it was not an arbitrary decision we took to act as we did. From the submission we received in that regard, it became apparent that the Minister would not have landed in that trouble if he had not been a Minister, and that it resulted from the fact that he had held the office of Minister at that moment.

What did he tell us&#x003F; What was his answer&#x003F; Did he, or did he not, know it&#x003F; You see the sort of thing that we are up against here, Sir. The hon. the Prime Minister did not know of this rumour. What was the rumour&#x003F; Let us forget for a moment that nobody on this side of the House had ever heard of the rumour; no Pressman in the country had heard of this rumour; nobody that I know of had ever heard of this rumour, but it existed apparently. Sir, can you imagine a more serious rumour than the one that is alleged to have been spread; can you imagine a more serious rumour than the allegation that the Government was placing restrictions upon the investigation of this case&#x003F; We asked the hon. the Minister of Police the other day, but he declined to say anything about it. We now ask the hon. the Prime Minister: What were the restrictions alleged to have been placed on the investigation&#x003F; You see, Sir, the hon. gentleman is very good at putting questions to us, but when he is in a corner he gazes at the ceiling. He will not answer that question either. That is question No. 2. Let us deal with questions instead of jokes for a change. The hon. gentleman will not tell us what the alleged restrictions were.</p>

<p>Sir, let us deal with the hon. the Prime Minister a stage further. I do not believe that you could find a more serious allegation than the allegation that the Government placed some hindrance or other upon the investigating officers in this case. That is the allegation that the hon. the Minister of Police says was being bandied about. What steps have been taken against the source of that rumour&#x003F; We have asked the Minister of Police on a number of occasions whether the investigation was based upon a sworn statement and, if so, who made it; and we have asked him further, in view of the seriousness&#x2014;and I emphasize this&#x2014;of the rumour which is alleged to have been spread, what steps have been taken against the persons who brought that information now that we know it was false. It is difficult to conceive of a more serious allegation against any Government, and yet we are to understand apparently, on the facts as known to us at the present time, that nothing whatever has been done in that regard. The hon. the Prime Minister cannot complain, if we are to continue with the present situation where he refuses point-blank to give either this House or the country the facts&#x2014;and the same applies to the hon. the Minister of Police&#x2014;if people begin to draw their own conclusions.</p>

<p>&#x2026; the sort of conclusions that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own Press has begun to draw already and which were referred to by the hon. member for Durban North. Sir, this is not an everyday occurrence. It is one of the greatest frauds ever perpetrated in this country, if the facts as established by the commission of inquiry are subsequently proved to be correct. Having been left in the dark as to the facts, as we have been once again, let us come to the question of the investigation, that is to say, the investigation which we hope will lead to a prosecution. The hon. the Prime Minister has given us no reason for the delay in this matter. We hear that it is delicate. I cannot imagine why it is delicate, but we are not told; we are just told that it is delicate. The hon. the Prime Minister stands up proudly and says that he should take great credit because he appointed advocates on the commission of inquiry who knew what they were doing. I should have thought that that would be the most elementary precaution to take. Sir, where else do you have a Police investigation into a set of facts where most of the facts are already in black and white as the result of a lengthy inquiry by a commission&#x003F; You know, Sir, one has only to read the evidence which was given before that commission of inquiry to come to the conclusion that there is already a <i>prima facie</i> case of fraud established on the facts of that inquiry alone. What additional facts are needed to found a prosecution&#x003F; If there are additional facts, why are they not available&#x003F;</p>

Is the hon. the Prime Minister saying to me and to the House that from those sources no information is available upon which a prosecution can be brought&#x003F; Sir, this matter has been left by the hon. <span class="col_5249-5250" refersTo="page_1088"/>the Prime Minister in a thoroughly unsatisfactory state, and since the hon. gentleman is constantly exhorting us to have some deeds and not just to be satisfied with words, this is something which the hon. the Prime Minister ought to reply to himself.</p>

<p>Then there is another point. In regard to the investigation into Gen. Bester, the hon. the Minister of Police told us the other day that that investigation was not yet concluded and that he was not yet satisfied with the findings in that regard. Why has that investigation not been concluded&#x003F; We are led to understand that it is now accepted by everybody&#x2014;indeed, it was accepted by Gen. Joubert from the beginning&#x2014;that the allegations against Gen. Bester were unfounded and a lot of nonsense. Having got two sworn statements, both from the suspect, Gen. Bester, and from the newspaperman concerned that this was a lot of nonsense, why is the hon. the Minister of Police now prepared to say that that investigation is not yet complete&#x003F; What still remains to be investigated&#x003F;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to follow the same path that hon. member followed. In connection with the Agliotti matter I want to content myself with what the hon. the Minister said, i.e. that he must wait a little; he will get his reply. I do not know what more the hon. member wants. That is surely enough. But I want to come back to what the hon. member for Hillbrow said yesterday and partly to what the hon. member for Parktown said in his Little Budget speech. What these two members had to say in successive debates is in my estimation, very dangerous because this matter has the very closest bearing on <span class="col_5251-5252" refersTo="page_1089"/>South Africa&#x2019;s economic development and the confidence the outside world has in capital investment in South Africa, and the closest bearing on our Bantustan policy.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parktown said in his Little Budget speech that the Government must come back to earth, and he mentioned a whole string of aspects we must put a stop to. For example, the Government must stop interfering in private initiative. But yesterday the hon. member for Hillbrow came along and stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This is precisely our charge. That is what is happening. The Government is usurping more and more economic power. We have more and more controls. That kind of control to anybody else in the world would suggest Socialism. That is why some of our industrialists and top businessmen are throwing their hands up in despair and are saying: Let us return to the free market mechanism in South Africa.</block>

<p>And then he states&#x2014;&#x201C;So we have Socialism in this country. It is an established fact.&#x201D; I cannot imagine anything more dangerous and more irresponsible at this juncture, particularly at this juncture, than what the hon. member for Hillbrow had to say. Let me point out to the hon. member that at the moment there are two big economic super states in the world, Soviet Russia and the U.S.A. According to projections, from the year 1980 to the year 2000 Japan will become the international super-economic state. Let us look at what is happening in Japan. There they state&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Even in the beginning &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is after the humiliation of Japan by the bomb attack on Hiroshima toward the end of the Second World War.</p>

<block name="quote">Even in the beginning Government direction and intervention were very skilful. In effect the Japanese were using government control as a method of getting monopoly, gains and other bargaining advances. According to the <i>London Economist</i> Japan has the most sophisticated and most closely controlled economic system in the world.</block>

<p>Let us look at what they say in <i>Time.</i> I have it here. This is the &#x201C;Time Essay&#x201D; of 14th February, 1972. What does <i>Time</i> have to say&#x003F; It states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United States is universally recognized as the capital of Capitalism, the land of free markets and the home of resourceful entrepreneurs. Americans have done much to strengthen the two pillars of free enterprise, private ownership and unfettered competition. Only in the United States are airlines, radio, television networks, the telephone system, power companies and other major industries owned primarily by private individuals. Japan is a corporate State in which Government and industry are so closely interrelated that it is difficult to tell which segment is in control. Half of France&#x2019;s motor industry is owned by the State; 35 per cent of Italy&#x2019;s industrial production is State-controlled. Now, recently, free enterprise in the United States has been under very heavy pressure, not so much from the new Left or the critics as from some of the system&#x2019;s primary defenders, namely the Republican Party and private businessmen. By ordering controls, Nixon made one of the boldest encroachments so far on the free enterprise system. Nixon&#x2019;s new economic policy is in fact only the latest and most dramatic in a series of events that challenged the principle of free enterprise. In business the role of the government in the United States is fast growing larger as saviour, subsidizer, owner, regulator and decision-maker.</block>

<p>Now, Mr. Chairman, these members come along one after another&#x2014;and we must pay attention to that&#x2014;and they gradually drag it in. Every year they come along here and make just a slight allegation that this country is on the road towards Socialism, that here in South Africa free initiative is taboo. They allege that with a series of control measures this Government is killing private initiative in South Africa. I want to allege that to make such a statement is irresponsible.</p>

<p>Firstly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; Washington&#x2014;will involve itself more and more as a goal-setter, a rules-maker for business, largely because many business leaders want it to do so.</block>

<p>Thirdly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government is likely to continue some form of surveillance over wages and prices.</block>

<p>Unlike other countries of the world, any entrepreneur, any man having the capital, knowledge and experience can come to South Africa, and here he is free to exploit his knowledge, experience and capital. Those hon. members have never said that. I blame them, Mr. Chairman, for dragging in elements such as the Agliotti mess in a debate of this calibre.

<p>Mr. Chairman, here in South Africa, from a total expenditure of R3 604 million on local fixed investment in 1971, our public corporations had a meagre amount of R320 million in capital. Contrary to what the hon. member said yesterday, i.e. that only 46 per cent of investment belongs to the private sector, my findings in this connection are that the private sector&#x2019;s share amounts to R1 986 million.</p>

<p>Every year hon. members come along here and want to know what the public corporations are receiving. Year after year they sit here and say that the Railways must be handed over to public initiative. They have advocated this year after year; now for the first time they have stopped doing so. This is not the way an Opposition acts. Two super states, the one totally communist controlled, and the other one, America, where the Government, as I have quoted, is gaining ever greater control. Japan is a co-operative State in which one cannot separate the parts played by the Government and private initiative. Here is South Africa with its remarkable and unique circumstances, a country where any man can come and invest capital. We are the complete and perfect blend of the concept of Capitalism and Socialism. This is in consequence of the National Party because it is manned by the Afrikaner, who is completely attuned to the blending of Capitalism and Socialism.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I can&#x2019;t reply to the hon. member for Carletonville in detail as I have other matters to raise, but I do want to say that it is a very extraordinary capitalistic country where over 40 per cent of the gainfully employed White people are in direct or indirect State employment. Not even in Mr. Wilson&#x2019;s socialist England was the number of people in State employ anything as high. I leave the hon. member at that. I must say I am grateful to him for one thing, namely that he has diverted the debate from what <span class="col_5255-5256" refersTo="page_1091"/>was going to be a repeat performance of previous days of this &#x201C;rassehaat&#x201D; and &#x201C;boerehaat&#x201D; business we have had over the last few days. I want to say that I have seldom witnessed a more unappetizing spectacle. I wonder if any single member in this House on either side, has given a thought to what the 17 million citizens of this country who are not White are thinking about this very unappetizing spectacle. Quite clearly this is old ganging-up business, the national unity of the White people for the purpose, of course, of coping with the Black, Coloured and Brown majority in this country. Because of Oudtshoorn, and thank Heaven it is nearly over now&#x2014;so that with a little luck we won&#x2019;t have any more of this&#x2014;the Government has gone back to beating the old tribal drum in order to try to get a few more votes. I do not think it is going to work. I am sure it is not going to work amongst the younger voters, and I am not even sure that it is going to work among the older voters. Only today I received in the post a letter containing two torn-up National Party membership cards. The accompanying card read: &#x201C;We hope that many thousands will take the same step.&#x201D; Torn-up cards, this is what these people think about the debate that has taken place in this House.</p>

<p>I want to raise other matters with the hon. the Prime Minister. First of all, it was a pleasant change to hear him protesting about people making accusations against him without a shred of evidence, because when that gentleman was Minister of Justice and of Police he did not have the slightest compunction in locking up hundreds of people without any evidence and keeping them in detention without trial for months on end. It is therefore a pleasant change to know that he believes that there should really be evidence against people before accusations are made. I would say that it is time, for example, that he told the country and this House something about what is going on in Owambo. I raised this matter during the no-confidence debate and have had nothing at all from the hon. the Prime Minister We have had statements made by Dr. Waldheim but nothing from the hon. the Prime Minister. Does he not think it is time that he took the country into his confidence and gave us some information about what is happening in Owambo&#x003F; What we do know is that many people have been locked up without trial in Owambo as well and that at the present time something like 83 people are locked up under Proclamation R17 and that, in all, over 200 people have been taken and put in detention without trial in Owambo. I think he owes some explanation to this country as to what is happening in Owambo.</p>

<p>Then I would like to ask the hon. the Prime Minister when this vendetta against Nusas is likely to cease. At the present stage practically every single member of the executive of Nusas over the past two years has either had his passport snatched from him without good reason or had his or her application for a passport refused. I believe this is blatant intimidation of young students in South Africa, and not only of young English-speaking students, but also of Afrikaans-speaking students at Afrikaans-medium universities who are now beginning to show an interest in contact across the colour line with the students at other universities. I would like to know whether the hon. the Prime Minister does not think that this is holding in contempt the Select Committee that he called to be set up to investigate the affairs of Nusas. Even before that Committee has completed its investigations, even before it has reported, punitive measures have been taken against executive members of Nusas. I do not believe that you can divorce the individual members who are running Nusas, those who are in the leadership category, from the organization itself.</p>

<p>The third question on which, I hope, we will get some answers from the hon. the Prime Minister, is whether he would like to tell us what is happening to his famous outward policy about which we have heard so much over the last two or three years Has he made any progress at all&#x003F; We heard a great deal about what the hon. the Prime Minister was going to do as far as the other African states are concerned.</p>

<p>It is more than the hon. the Prime Minister has managed to do, despite all his big talk. We in fact were admitted for one reason only and that is because our record for fighting against race discrimination is wellknown. Let me tell hon. members that every one of those states and indeed, every one of the 40-odd independent Black states in Africa are dead against apartheid, even those countries which economically are bound to us, our immediate neighbours. They are against apartheid. Unless this country is prepared to make some concessions in the racial field, dialogue will begin and end at square one. We will not get any further at all. I also think it is time that hon. members realize that Black African states do not demand the hand over of White South Africa to Blacks. What they do demand is the removal of race discrimination and they demand equal opportunities for their own brethren. This is a question of human value. That is all it is. Whether we like it or not, they do identify themselves with the fate of the Black people in this country and their lack of opportunity. I think it is a scandalous situation that in the year 1972, when there are something like 43 independent states in Africa including ourselves, we have exactly four diplomatic missions: In Rhodesia, in Malawi, in Angola and in Portuguese East Africa. In the others we have not so much as a consul-general, not so much as a <i>charg&#x00E9; d&#x2019;affaires.</i> I think this is an unbelievable situation that South Africa, the most Westernized, the most industrialized and by far the most important country in the whole of the continent of Africa does not have any connections. Hon. members should start asking themselves why. It is not what I say, it is what the Government does. That is what the young hon. member for Waterkloof does not realize. What I say does not mean anything, does not carry any weight. I have no power and I am well aware of that. My views are wellknown and those are acceptable, but I have no power. But the Government does have the power. Dialogue will not mean a thing&#x2014;I can tell the hon. the Prime Minister this right now. There are many who would like dialogue.</p>

Those interests will be discussed in this House whether she likes it or not.</p>

<p>I get the impression that the United Party tries to make great play of the question of national unity and that they are actually trying to outbid the National Party in the emphasis they place on national unity. I may say at the outset that there are a few aspects about which we do not argue at all. We do not argue at all about the question of loyalty to South Africa and a common patriotism. I accept the patriotism of my English-speaking fellow-citizen in South Africa who is loyal to the Republic of South Africa. We do not differ on the question that if South Africa were attacked by aggressors and if it became necessary to defend South Africa&#x2014;there is no difference of opinion on that&#x2014;the young Afrikaner boy and the young English-speaking boy will stand side by side in the Caprivi Strip or wherever the interests of South Africa.</p>

<p>Neither do we argue about the cultural and national plurality in South Africa. I take it that the Opposition accepts this plurality in South Africa, but I am not so sure that they are able to follow through all its implications to the end.

That is where the difference of opinion comes in, and I shall try to indicate it in a few words.</p>

<p>Even though it may be familiar ground, I want to start off by nevertheless referring to the standpoint as it was put on the part of the National Party by my Leader, Adv. Vorster, our Prime Minister. He explained this matter from various angles, various angles which are fundamentally part of the same view. Then may I refer to a facet of this matter which is of the utmost importance to us. I want to point out to hon. members the emphasis he placed on a matter which in actual fact is an irritation to many people, and that is the question of Afrikaner unity. The hon. the Prime Minister did not hesitate to speak about Afrikaner unity, because he knows its significance in our set-up in South Africa. On 6th July, 1968, he stated this matter very clearly at Upington when he said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This unity, I want to tell you today, must be preserved by you and by me, and I, as Leader of the Party, must see to it that that unity is preserved under all circumstances.</block>

<block name="quote">I want to make it very clear here today that for the people who are not prepared to accept that unity, the people who do not believe in it, there is no place or room within the National Party.</block>

<p>I do not think you are able to prescribe to me on Afrikanership I say it is the standpoint of the National Party that it does not have eyes for Afrikaner unity only but that it realizes how important Afrikaner unity is to South Africa and to our Afrikaner people. That is not all that the Prime Minister said. He also spoke about the question of co-operation. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to make it very clear that I am in favour of co-operation, provided that I am accepted as an Afrikaner with all the implications it has.</block>

<p>And then I can prove, furthermore, that he gave a practical demonstration of it when he spoke in Grahamstown at the laying of the foundation stone of the 1820 Settlers Monument. Then he gave living, concrete proof of the respect in which he holds his English-speaking fellow-citizen in South Africa, while at the same time declaring where he personally belonged culturally, i.e. as an Afrikaner. He thinks and speaks from that basis. But in that capacity he can also show respect to those who speak a different language in South Africa. Now, in contrast to the Leader of the Opposition, who says that on the National Party side we are seeking national unity only because of a motive of fear&#x2014;this was said in his speech last Thursday&#x2014;the Prime Minister said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Today I believe they understand each other better than at any time since 1820, not because, as some are wont to say, outside circumstances are forcing them to stand together, but I sincerely believe because they want to stand together. They want to stand together for the simple reason that they belong to the same soil because both have taken root, and they want to grow and not to die.</block>

<p>That is our view, Sir. May I just mention the following little incident&#x003F; When I was fighting an election in Waterberg, I had the Herstigtes opposing me. Opposing me I had Mr. Jaap Marais, with his party&#x2019;s demand that there should eventually be only one official language in South Africa. At a meeting someone asked me in English&#x2014;apparently one of his supporters, however strange this may be&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Why can Britain have one official language, and that is English&#x003F; And why can Holland have one official language, and that is Dutch&#x003F;</block>

<p>In this way he mentioned quite a number of examples. Then he asked&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And why cannot we in South Africa have only one official language, and that is Afrikaans&#x003F;</block>

<p>&#x2020;He asked me why the Afrikaner does not have the guts to claim this right and to demand one official language, and that is Afrikaans. I told the gentleman, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you teach me something about Afrikanerdom. Don&#x2019;t you try to be a better Afrikaner than I am.&#x201D; I told him this party, the Nationalist Party, promised to the English-speaking person to safeguard and guarantee his cultural and language rights in South Africa. We are going to do that, and we are doing it.</p>

<p>*Sir, this is because the Afrikaner knows &#x2014;he knows this from his history&#x2014;what it means when the rights of others are interfered with. After all, he has personal experience of this. That is what the previous Prime Minister, Dr. Verwoerd, called to mind when he said the following on 18th September, 1958 (Hansard, column 4152)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We, who have had experience of the oppression of our language and who know what resistance such treatment evokes, would be the last to deny another man his language rights. Indeed, we know that the development of a united nation in South Africa, as well as the promotion of peace and happiness in the Republic of South Africa, will have to be based on the absolute recognition of the two languages and the equal treatment of these two languages, without the slightest suggestion of any discrimination.</block>

<p>Sir, if I have the time, I want to ask something. I do not want to be presumptuous from the back bench, but I do want to ask with the necessary humility what the Leader of the Opposition understands by his &#x201C;one nation&#x201D;. I read in <i>Die Burger</i> of 6th March, 1970, that when the Leader of the Opposition spoke at Keetmanshoop, he said that the South African nation could not continue to be half Boer, half British. He said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_5263-5264" refersTo="page_1095"/>If the White man wants to maintain himself&#x2014;and we say &#x201C;Hear, hear!&#x201D; if he wants to maintain himself&#x2014;the most important requirement is that a united South African nation should be built up. That is why national unity is of the greatest importance.</block>

<p>But now we ask, what is the meaning of that concept of &#x201C;national unity&#x201D;&#x003F; Now listen what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This evening I am telling the South African nation &#x2026;</block>

<p>And it is not always clear to me what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition understands by that, because sometimes he says it is the Whites, and then again he speaks of 21 million. He is not very certain. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You cannot continue as half Boer, half British. The destructive and tiring conflict of the past should not be extended, because the problems and dangers of the future call for unity.</block>

<p>This is now a very simple question: If we are not to be half Boer and half British, what must we be in this South African set-up&#x003F; [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it was very interesting to hear from that hon. member who, we understand, holds a very important position in Afrikanerdom, that he has no doubts about the loyalty of the English-speaking section or the United Party towards South Africa. I hope that that will satisfy all the members on the other side as to what their attitude should be towards us, and that we will stop hearing this nonsense about the United Party not being loyal and patriotic. Very interesting in his address was also the part where he dealt with &#x201C;Afrikaner-eenheid&#x201D;. We must deduce from what he said that an Afrikaner is only regarded as an Afrikaner if he belongs to the Nationalist Party. [Interjections.] Yes, that is what he said. He said that unless you were a member of the Nationalist Party, you could not be an Afrikaner.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>He just said so. Then he went on to say that the Nationalist Party guarantees the cultural and language rights of the English-speaking section. It was very interesting to hear him use those words, because those were the very words over which Gen. Hertzog left the Nationalist Party in Bloemfontein, in November, 1940. He insisted that they write into their Constitution a guarantee for the political rights of the English-speaking section too, and that side of the House refused to do so; that is why Gen. Hertzog left. The hon. member also referred to the attitude of the hon. the Prime Minister towards the English-speaking section. This debate has revolved around the hatred of the English-speaking people and the United Party for the Nationalists. That is the debate that was started here. If we are to talk about national unity, I appeal to everybody in this House to look at this side of the House and see the composition of the United Party, and then look at that side of the House and see the composition of that party. Then they can say which party seems more likely to have national unity as its policy. I should like to remind the hon. member who has just spoken that the Minister of Defence complained that there were haters of the Afrikaner in this party. He named them, and what was the basis of his judgment&#x003F; It was that they did not speak Afrikaans in this House. Then he went further and said that if they can speak Afrikaans and do not do so, their crime is a bigger one and their hatred is the greater. The hon. the Minister is unfortunately not here at the moment; I wanted to put a question to him. I do not remember him ever having made a speech in English in this House until he became a Minister, whereas I and other members, in the second session after we came to Parliament, made speeches in Afrikaans. I see the Minister of Sport looking at me in surprise. Has he made a speech in Afrikaans in this House&#x003F;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>He is the best example of an Afrikaner-hater, if you must use the definition of the Minister of Defence. In any case, Sir, I should like to get back to the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister&#x2019;s troubles do not come singly; they are falling upon him fast. The latest is a demand for independence from the Transkei. The Prime Minister <span class="col_5265-5266" refersTo="page_1096"/>should welcome a request of this nature because he invited the leaders of the Africans in the reserves to approach him and discuss independence with him. He said his door was open at all times. But I do not think he welcomed the present request, in the form in which it was put to him. Sir, he seemed to be on a pretty good wicket before, because the only homeland which could aspire to independence was the Transkei, and the Chief Minister of the Transkei had made it quite clear to his own party that he would not ask for independence because, he said, you could not have meaningful independence until the state was viable. The Prime Minister was able to assure his critics here and abroad of his <i>bona fides,</i> by truly stating that he was prepared to negotiate and to carry out his promise to give independence to the reserves, but that the Bantu preferred to stay as they were.</p>

<p>But now, Sir, the climate has changed and there seems to be a chilly wind blowing over the Nationalist Party. No longer are the non-White supporters of the Government speaking about separate development as they used to do, in the pretence that it satisfied their ideals and their wants. Now that they are installed as leaders of their separate groups they are more outspoken, without fear of intimidation or of being accused of being Leftists or instigators.</p>

<p>The Government has long had difficulties with Chief Buthelezi, and it is no secret that they would have preferred another leader for the Zulus. Recently we have read of criticism from other sources, for instance, from Chief Mangope of the Tswanas, last month when the Minister of Police was in his area. Still later, the Shangaan head, Chief Ntsanwise, at the opening of his Assembly, spoke in similar vein.</p>

<p>*By the way, I want to say that I was surprised to see that the Government had sent the hon. the Minister of Health to open that Assembly. They would not dare to send him as their representative to a White Assembly : why should he be forced upon the poor Shangaans&#x003F;</p>

<p>&#x2020;The complaint of the Chief was that separate development &#x201C;is generating in security, uncertainty and frustration&#x201D;. That criticism is, I think, an excellent reflection of what all communities are now thinking of this policy. There is uncertainty amongst the Coloureds, including Coloured supporters of self-determination. We saw the statement of Mr. Swartz after his congress at Port Elizabeth, that his people were not satisfied. We saw the correction this morning, a statement from the Minister of Coloured Affairs, that Mr. Swartz says that he and his party still agree with the Government&#x2019;s policy and that they accept it. The Ministers are going to try to satisfy him with statements before the next sitting of his council.

<p>Well, at any rate, they certainly will not be satisfied. There has been trouble on the borders of the reserves; the White people are not certain as to their future. I see that a meeting of farmers was held at Franklin in East Griqualand. They called upon the Prime Minister again to give an assurance that that area will remain White. The Prime Minister will probably get up and say that he has given them the assurance before.

<p>You can tell me after I have sat down. There is uncertainty amongst the White industrialists in the city and on the part of the Black man, not only in the cities, but also in the reserves. Last week the gauntlet was thrown down by Chief Kaizer, for so long the champion of separate development, and also of the Afrikaner against the Hugheses and the Mitchells whose ancestors, he claims, were the land grabbers. What is this complaint now against the Government&#x003F; It concerns land. When the Transkei Constitution was passed in 1963 and when the Bantu Homelands Constitution was passed last year in this House, we, the United Party, warned that it was folly to set the homelands on an independent course before finalizing their boundaries. Those constitutional measures allow for alteration of the boundaries by the State President, and it was obvious, before the Transkei Constitution was discussed in this House, that there were going to be squabbles about land, because the year before, in 1962, two resolutions were introduced in the Transkei Territorial Authority, calling upon the Government to transfer the neighbouring White-owned districts to the Transkei.

<p>I do not want to respond to the speech the hon. member has just made. I leave him in the hands of the hon. the Prime Minister. However, I just want to refer to one reference he made in connection with national unity when he mentioned the name of the late Gen. Hertzog. In 1933, when coalition took place, the late Gen. Hertzog was under the impression that together with the late Gen. Smuts he had probably brought about the greatest national unity in South Africa that any leader ever could. In 1939 &#x2014;and that the hon. member forgot to mention&#x2014;when the break came between the late Gen. Hertzog and the late Gen. Smuts, it was Gen. Hertzog who said: &#x201C;There sit the traitors, the people who stabbed me in the back.&#x201D; [Interjections.] Sir, what happened in 1940&#x003F; The thoughts I want to express here also have a bearing on national unity, but they also have a bearing on race relations in South Africa, because race relations in South Africa again have an effect on White relations in South Africa. During the Second Reading debate on the Appropriation Bill an hon. member of this side gave the United Party well-intentioned advice. That advice was that the United Party should think again about its non-White policy. Sir, that is not the United Party&#x2019;s problem. The United Party&#x2019;s problem is specifically that it thinks too often, because every time it thinks, there is a new policy on the way. However, I want to say something to the United Party&#x2019;s credit, i.e. that every time they come to light with a new policy, it contains one principle which is unassailable; it is a principle they carry through in every policy they present to the people, and that principle is one of giving the non-Whites of South Africa a bigger share in the administration of the country. I say that I am stating this to the United Party&#x2019;s credit. They remain consistent as far as this particular principle is concerned; they just wrap it up in new wool every time in order to hide it or for a reason I cannot fathom. But what happened as far back as 1954&#x003F; The United Party does not like the past, but I am now going to quote what they said in 1954, not to the detriment of the United Party, but for its benefit. I am quoting it for its benefit to illustrate the statement I made, i.e. that as far back as 1954 this was a continuous thread in the United Partys&#x2019; trend of thought with each policy declaration. After their central congress, where they discussed their non-White policy, a policy <span class="col_5269-5270" refersTo="page_1098"/>document was issued by the United Party in connection with the decision taken at that congress. Section 1 (b) of their Native policy read as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The party acknowledges that the Natives must be trained to develop democratic responsibility and that as they move in the direction of the standards of Western civilization their acceptance of a greater share in the administration of the country will become essential for the maintenance of harmony between the races.</block>

<p>In other words, the United Party proceeds from the standpoint that its policy determines the harmony of the races. Now, with its present policy&#x2014;we must now simply make a projection on the basis of what the policy is at present&#x2014;the United Party gave effect to this principle by their non-White representation in Parliament&#x2014;Coloureds by Coloureds, and Bantu and Indians by Whites. I say they are giving effect to this decision they took in 1954, and I think hon. members will be grateful if I give them the credit for remaining faithful to this principle. That representation, given to the non-Whites in Parliament, is not all the administration of the country entails. The Public Service is a very important aspect of the country&#x2019;s administration, the administration in which they want to give the non-Whites a greater share together with the Whites in Parliament. This also accords with the United Party&#x2019;s policy, which they have already announced here, and I want to mention two aspects of that. Firstly: the United Party is not opposed to the fact of a White person working in the same job situation under a non-White person. The United Party has not yet expressed itself as being opposed to that; on the contrary, it accepts the fact that non-Whites can achieve promotion posts where Whites will work under their authority.</p>

<p>If that is not the case, they need not interrupt me. In that case they may stand up and say it is not so. The second aspect is that it is the United Party&#x2019;s policy that the non-Whites may sell their labour on the markets that are the best for them. Is that so, or is it not&#x003F;</p>

<p>With this share in the country&#x2019;s administration which the United Party wants to give to the non-Whites, this part they want to hide, they cannot stop the non-Whites if they decide for themselves and say the Public Service is the best market in which they want to sell their labour. This accords with the policy of the United Party. [Interjections.] The other day the hon. member waxed lyrical here about the policy of the United Party, but that was when he was still under the impression that he is an angel. I want to tell him that the other day the hon. Leader of the House was making a joke; he did not really mean that he is an angel. I say the other leg of the United Party&#x2019;s policy&#x2014;i.e. that they want to bring non-Whites into the House of Assembly&#x2014;seen in the light of their policy in respect of national administration, will be the first step, the interim period, the starting point, as far as it affects Parliament. From that starting point there will subsequently be negotiations. This present number of non-White representatives is the proposal the United Party makes, but from that point they are going to negotiate with the non-Whites, and when they have negotiated and completed their consultations, at the level they have created here for consultations, they will hold a referendum in which they will say either that there are enough of these representatives or that their numbers must be increased. And now I ask the United Party this: If the White electorate has expressed its opinion, and the White electorate does not agree to the non-White representation being augmented, or that the Bantu should be represented by Bantu, are they so na&#x00EF;ve as to think that in the Public Service, where by that time non-Whites will already be occupying influential positions and numerically be in the majority, the non-Whites will come along and say: Thank you very much for this referendum you have held; we are satisfied and we acquiesce&#x003F; No less a person than the leader of the United Party said in 1959 that numbers would decide South Africa&#x2019;s future; leadership will be determined by numbers.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just sat down, has made certain statements in regard to our labour policy. I have no hesitation, Sir, in saying that every allegation he made with <span class="col_5271-5272" refersTo="page_1099"/>regard to our labour policy is wrong. [Interjections.] There were other things as well. I say that he was doing this mischievously, because no member on that side, no member of this House, can be so ignorant as to what our policy is. I say he did this on purpose. Why he is doing this now, I do not know, for it is too late to get it to Oudtshoorn. [Interjections.] He is quite right when he says that we are consistent in our acceptance of the principle of representation in this House for all groups. In that respect he is quite correct. We stand by that; we do not jump about as the Nationalist Party has done over the years. Who have altered their policy more with regard to representation in this House than the Nationalist Party&#x003F; I want to say something about this a little later on when I am talking to the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Sir, when I was dealing with the request for independence which we see has now come from the Transkei, I pointed out that it should be obvious&#x2014;it was obvious&#x2014;to this House that the land matter would be come a squabble because of the two resolutions passed the year before by the Territorial Authority of the Transkei asking for certain land and districts adjoining the Transkei to be added to the Transkei.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, when the Constitution was submitted to that Authority for approval first, before it was submitted to us, they raised this matter and asked that the whole district of Matatiele be included in the area which was to come under the jurisdiction of the Transkei. They were advised by senior officials&#x2014;and that was confirmed by Mr. De Wet Nel, who was then a Minister in this House&#x2014;that this was a matter for negotiation. They accepted the Constitution on that understanding. They should have been told then&#x2014;and the Constitution should have made it quite clear&#x2014;where the boundaries of the Transkei were to be. Sir, it is no use being wise after the event; we warned the Government beforehand that this would happen.</p>

<p>Chief Kaiser Matanzima has made several claims for more land, and has stated what areas he wants. We remember well the clash which occurred with the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration at Umtata on this very issue. Subsequently Chief Matanzima said that he would not ask for independence until the land claim had been settled. He made this claim on purpose, I feel, in order to put the Government on the spot. For, Sir, the moral justification for it&#x2019;s policy&#x2014;the deprivation of fundamental rights of citizenship in the Republic in exchange for those rights in the reserves, in the independent homelands&#x2014;disappears and is no longer valid if the homelands do not become independent.</p>

<p>The Chief Minister knows this only too well. I say that he is now holding this Government to ransom. The Leader of the Opposition in the Transkei, Mr. Guzana, has disclosed the terms of a resolution which the Chief has put to this Government. The Chief has not denied it; all he said was, according to the newspaper reports, that it was confidential. But the fact is that if we have it now it must have come to the Government. The Prime Minister can tell us whether he received this request or not. This is what he is supposed to have said, and this is what is called the &#x201C;ultimatum&#x201D; by Chief Kaiser Matanzima:</p>

<block name="quote">We do not see our way to ever requesting a declaration of independence if part of our land still remains in the Republic and we shall oppose any endorsement out of our people from the cities if sufficient land as claimed is not provided before then. To us this is fundamental to our acceptance of the policy of separate development as against a multiracial society in South Africa. Should the Republican Government refuse to meet our request, we shall be reluctantly compelled to abandon this policy and to join our brethren in the cities in championing a reversal to a multiracial Parliament in Cape Town on the basis of &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D; in order to share equally with the Whites the wealth of our common country, South Africa.</block>

<p>There are two points of interest in this so-called ultimatum. The one is that they will join forces with their brethren in the cities in championing a reversal of the policy of separate development. It is a clear statement that the Bantu, the Transkeians in the cities do not accept this policy, although we have been led to believe before that they did. The second is that they would then want representation in this House, and meaningful representation. Quite clearly, he intended to put the Prime Minister on the spot. He said that unless the Prime Minister meets him on this question of land good relations will deteriorate. He has now put the ball right in the court of the Prime Minister by submitting <span class="col_5273-5274" refersTo="page_1100"/>a resolution in his Assembly for the Transkeian Government to consider the advisability of requesting the Republican Government to grant independence to the Transkei including the districts of Elliot, Maclear, Mount Gurrie, Matatiele, Umzimkulu and Port St. Johns.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister has frequently stated that his policy is one of self-determination. If the Bantu now decide not to take independence on the terms offered by the Prime Minister, what happens then&#x003F; Does self-determination only mean the determination of the Whites or does it include Blacks as well&#x003F; This is becoming important now that the leaders of these people are more articulate and outspoken as to what they think self-determination means.</p>

<p>Generally, the problems raised by them are land matters. Chief Buthelezi said that he has a nowhere country and he too wants to know where the boundaries of his land are to be. Chief Ntsanwise tells us of the unsatisfactory boundary dispute he is having with the Government.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister is reported to have said last year that some of the Reserves would become independent within four years, that is before 1975. There is not much time left for that and instead of relations between the governments in the Reserves and our Government becoming better they are becoming more strained. As they become more strained we become more worried about something else, namely what the future relations will be with other Stales. In an interview with <i>To the Point,</i> the hon. the Prime Minister said that the separate Bantu states can align themselves with Moscow or Peking, that he cannot stop them. He would advise them against it, but he could not stop them if they were to go that way. But we know that the hon. the Minister of Defence has said something different. In addressing a meeting before the election in April. 1970, at Newcastle, he said that the United Party candidate was telling voters that independent Bantustans would negotiate with communist countries and form alliances with hem. He then said: &#x201C;This will never he allowed to happen.&#x201D; This question was raised last night by the hon. member for Hillbrow. The Prime Minister has spoken since then and I am surprised that he did not reply to the request from the hon. member for Hillbrow and explain what exactly the position is. We cannot have a Cabinet divided on this issue, especially if we have on record that the hon. the Minister of Defence admitted in this House that he was a party to a deception by the late Dr. Verwoerd in regard to the Coloured people, when he promised them that they would keep their Coloured vote, that they would never lose their representation in this House. Yet he knew, he was Minister of Coloured Affairs at that time, that Dr. Verwoerd intended all the time to take away that vote. There is a difference of opinion in the Cabinet. The Prime Minister has told us one thing and the Minister of Defence has told the electorate another thing. Who is right, and what is the position&#x003F; Will they be allowed to go their way&#x003F; No one can claim at the moment that the relations between this Government and the Transkeian Government are good. It is quite possible, in the fit of pique, that one of these Governments could, to show its hostility towards this Government and its resentment of the policies of the Government of the Republic, form some alliance with a foreign State. We want to know now before we go any further, what the position is and what the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s attitude is in respect of the question of independence. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, before I reply to the important matters raised here by the hon. member for Transkei, I want, just in passing, to reply to two matters, the one to which the hon. member for Hillbrow referred and the other to which I was unable to reply last night because the hon. member for Parktown asked to be excused, and I did not want to reply to him in his absence.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note, since this matter of a welfare state has now been raised and since a reproach has from time to time been levelled in regard to the taxes taken by the Government in proportion to the national income, what the position in South Africa is in comparison with the position in comparable countries. We find that in South Africa the Government takes 24 per cent of the net national income. In France it is 49 per cent, as against the 24 per cent in South Africa. In Germany it is 45 per cent; in Sweden 48 per cent; in the Netherlands 47 per cent and in Italy 38 per cent of the net national income. In other words, if it is argued, as the hon. member for Hillbrow wanted to argue indirectly, that we are a welfare state, the actual state of affairs is of course not being taken into account at all. We would then <span class="col_5275-5276" refersTo="page_1101"/>have to take almost twice as much from the population as we are in fact taking from them at the moment. This is also my reply to hon. members who make the statement that we are now falling behind European and other countries. Just recently a survey was made of the standard of living in South Africa and that in comparable European countries. South Africa ranked very highly in that survey.</p>

<p>Among the Whites.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, and as the White standard of living rose, so did that of the non-Whites. The Government, in spite of the propaganda which, when it suits hon. members, is made against the Government, is doing its duty in respect of the non-Whites.</p>

<p>The second question put to me by the hon. member for Parktown is whether we are prepared to make an estimate of the future growth rate. Because of his profession the hon. member for Parktown&#x2014;I readily concede this&#x2014;probably knows far more about these matters than I do, because of my profession. However, I think that the hon. member for Parktown will concede to me that one can visualize the growth rate approximating 5 per cent, and that it may even exceed 5 per cent. But the hon. member for Parktown will also agree with me that one has to be careful that it does not rise too much because, on the other hand, we have to watch inflation as well. But one can be optimistic about the future growth rate, because we have far better agricultural prospects now than we had last year and there is every reason to hope that the mineral market will in future be better than it has been in the recent past, and particularly if one takes into account that there is a greater upsurge in the offing in the industrial sector. One sees all the signs in this regard. Let me add that we, particularly if one takes into account that we have a very responsible labour force in South Africa &#x2014;for that I want to express my gratitude and appreciation&#x2014;a labour force which realizes that it must proceed very circumspectly in regard to wage demands else we will find ourselves in that spiral again which we have all heard of so frequently, may, if these circumstances are taken into account, look to the future with confidence. If, in the immediate future, we proceed with the greatest circumspection in respect of wage matters, in the interests of South Africa, and if we make a point of utilising the labour which we have to better effect and stimulating productivity, then I think I am right in the view I have just expressed to the hon. member for Parktown. I think the hon. member for Parktown will to a large extent agree with me in that connection.</p>

<p>I come now to the hon. member for Transkei. The hon. member put certain questions to me in that regard. I want to say to hon. members that I think I have in the past two to three years held more talks with the Bantu leaders of South Africa than all my predecessors put together. This was brought about by circumstances, and I therefore do not want to claim the credit for this for myself. I can say this. I can say that I am as fully conversant with their aspirations and their wishes as any other person. I also want to say to hon. members, and to the country in general, that those talks were held as candidly as any talks could possibly be held. Then I want to say to hon. members that I held talks with Bantu leaders, Coloured leaders and Indian leaders, for let us make no mistake about this&#x2014;any man who holds the position that I hold, and any man who succeeds me in this position, must be prepared to meet with those leaders at a round table conference and to thrash matters out with them.</p>

<p>I say it must be accepted as axiomatic that a man who is in this position must be well-informed and must hold talks with those people. I told the Bantu leaders, each and every one of them, that I know enough about human nature to know that we would not always agree. I said to all those leaders: &#x201C;There will be times when we differ with one another, but one thing you will always get from me: I shall at all times give you my standpoint candidly and openly, whether you like it or not.&#x201D;</p>

<p>One of the matters which keeps on cropping up during the talks&#x2014;this applies not only to the Chief of the Transkei, but to the others as well&#x2014;is land, land and land again. Land is always a point of discussion, and one can understand very well why this should be the case. I have stated unequivocally to all the leaders, and I want to repeat in this Parliament now, that the National Party Government stands by the 1936 Act. The National Party Government deems itself committed to keep the promise given by Gen. Smuts and Gen. Hertzog to the non-Whites. I have told them that we shall give them the land which the 1936 Act states they should have. Beyond the 1936 Act I am not prepared to go. I hope we understand that. That is also what I said to Chief Matanzima. He said to me : &#x201C;Sir, my people feel very strongly about those districts.&#x201D; I told him that I am not prepared to give him those districts for the historical reasons he advanced. That was my full and final answer. He said to me: &#x201C;Sir, my people feel very strongly about this matter; will you again submit it to your colleagues that I have made this request&#x003F;&#x201D; In all fairness I said to him : &#x201C;Yes, I shall again submit it to my colleagues, coming from the leader of the Transkei.&#x201D; I went further and I said to him: &#x201C;I am not holding out any hope to you, but it is my duty. You as leader are asking me to submit it to my colleagues, and I shall do so.&#x201D; And I submitted it to my colleagues, and I sent him the reply of my colleagues: &#x201C;I am sorry, but we cannot do so.&#x201D;</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<p>I am coming to that now. I pointed out to him, <i>inter alia,</i> and the hon. member for Transkei is aware of this, that there are still small areas of commonage and other land in the Transkei, plus-minus 50 000 ha in extent. I said to him: &#x201C;That land you shall have; it will be added to the Transkei.&#x201D; But to complete the picture: The hon. member is aware that the 1936 Act stated that we must give the Bantu 7&#x00BC; million morgen of White land. We must purchase this for them.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, Sir, 7&#x00BC; million morgen of land. I do not know now whether the hon. member wants to get out of this or whether he wants to give them less; I am going to give them 7&#x00BC; million morgen. I think that is the spirit of the promise that was made, and I shall keep that promise; I shall keep the promise of the White man, the promise given by Smuts and Hertzog, to the Black man. I go further, Sir, Some of that land has been purchased over the years. The total extent still outstanding is 590 954 ha in the Transvaal, 235 798 ha in the Cape, and 63 359 ha in Natal. The position in regard to the Free State has been finalized. Now hon. members must understand that, as far as the Transvaal is concerned, the land still <span class="col_5279-5280" refersTo="page_1103"/>outstanding has to be subdivided. Let me rather put it like this: Various Bantu peoples have a claim to that land. There are the Venda, Prof. Ntsanwise&#x2019;s people, the North Sotho, and so on. In the Cape Province it is not only the Transkei that has a claim. The Ciskei has a claim, and the Tswanas as well in the Mafeking area. In other words, in the Cape Province there are three peoples whose circumstances have to be taken into account. In the Transvaal there are various peoples and in Natal it is the Zulus who have to be taken into account. Because this is all the land that is left, it is the aim of the department and the Minister in particular and of the Government to achieve maximum consolidation with the land still remaining. The hon. the Minister has given notice of certain proposals in regard to the Ciskei. I say there is still land which may fall to the Transkei and there is still land which may fall to the Tswanas out of this quota which still has to be purchased. Now the hon. member for Transkei has asked a question which has already been put frequently : When will the boundaries of these areas be finalized&#x003F; My reply is: The boundaries of these areas cannot be finalized before the last land has been purchased. Surely that goes without saving. When you have purchased the land or when you have come to a definite decision, you can say approximately where the boundaries are going to be and how the areas will be demarcated. I want to make one thing very clear in this connection: This land is being purchased and the Bantu are being consulted in regard to the matter. Naturally they have to be consulted, but the final say rests with the Government, for it is the Government that has to provide the money; it is the Government that has to keep the promise given by Smuts and Hertzog to give White land to the Black man, and the final word in that connection therefore rests with the Government. I spoke candidly along these lines to all the Black people. I said to them, and I want to repeat it here in Parliament, that there will always be people who want more land: there is no nation in the world that would not like to have more land, but I said to the Black leaders that their present problem was not so much that they should receive more land, but the better utilization of the land they have. I am not only saying this here in Parliament now. I said this to them, and I was very serious when I did so. They must utilize the land they have to better effect. This is the general view of the Minister, the department and the officials, and all our planning is geared to this. I went further and said to them : The position is the same in regard to the Whites. I have no land. There are many hon. members in this House who have no land. I mentioned the examples to them and said that we cannot all have land on which we can farm. Some of us have to be satisfied with a small plot in town.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Or a flat.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, or a flat; we cannot all have land on which to farm. There is simply not enough land for all of us, and the Bantu must realize this as well. The Bantu must adapt themselves as well to the demands made on us as Whites. The point I want to make now, is that I discuss matters openly and straightforwardly with these people around a conference table, without beating about the bush in any way. We understand one another and we respect one another. I do not want to say that we will always agree, but I do want to say that all the talks we have held up to now took place in a spirit of the greatest candour and goodwill, and I do not foresee it being any different in future. I want to make it very clear to hon. members today that in my discussions with the Bantu leaders I have found up to now that they are highly responsible people. As long as we discuss our problems at a round table conference as we have done in the past, we will have differences of opinion, but I believe that we will discuss our problems and we will simply have to agree to differ on certain matters. This we have already made very clear to one another.</p>

<p>I stated my standpoint here in the House. I said: If there is a Bantu people that believes the time has arrived for it to become independent, it can come and discuss the matter with me, and then my door stands open to it. I repeat that today. To hon. members who speak disparagingly about this and who want to raise matters in this regard, I say that when I speak of independence, I mean independence in the normal sense of the word, the independence which Botswana or any other country has. In regard to my interview with <i>To the Point,</i> I want to say that it would have been extremely easy for me to have evaded the question.</p>

<p><span class="col_5281-5282" refersTo="page_1104"/>Hon. members know me well enough; I can talk around a point if I wish to! But I deliberately did not want to evade it, because I wanted to illustrate for all the world to see that when we say &#x201C;independence&#x201D;, we mean just that. As far as I am concerned--and I am saying this to hon. members now across the floor of the House&#x2014;if any of our Black peoples become independent, they will become independent in the same way as Lesotho or Ghana or Gabon or any other country in the world.</p>

They can say: &#x201C;Look, we are not going to become independent until such time as we have received all our land&#x201D;&#x2014;that is a fair attitude to adopt and it is their affair&#x2014;or they can say: &#x201C;We are going to become independent, for we have reason to trust that the Government will subsequently give us the other land that we have to receive,&#x201D; and the Government will give it to them. That it can do very easily. It is a question of transferring the land, for this land is owing to them. All that stands in the way of your being able to give it to them immediately is the fact that you do not have the money to purchase the land immediately, for there is a tremendous amount of money involved.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is necessary to purchase land in some cases because with the land that is still outstanding, one wants to achieve the maximum consolidation one is capable of achieving, and for that reason this is necessary.</p>

<p>But, Sir, since I am speaking now, I want to say a few words in that connection to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I want to discuss with him his policy in respect of Black representation and Coloured representation in this House. I think we must give this matter very serious thought. I want to begin by saying this to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, and this is my heartfelt conviction : Nothing which one can do in this country is going to stir up so much emotion and unleash so many forces which my hon. friend will not be able to bring under control again as bringing Coloured representation into this House of Assembly again. My hon. friend must understand this very clearly. Against this background I want to debate this matter with him this afternoon, and if it is possible, I want to make an urgent appeal to him to abandon this plan on which he is engaged. I do not think it is in the interests of anyone. It is not in the interests of the Whites; it is not in the interests of the non-Whites. This plan on which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is engaged is a dangerous one, and I shall tell him why. Sir, if one accepts the principle that the Black man, the Indians and the Coloureds have the right to be represented in this House&#x2014;and there is no doubt whatsoever that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition adopts the standpoint that they do have the right to be here&#x2014;then I really cannot see how one can refuse to concede that they should be represented here by their own people. That is the only moral thing to do. If one has accepted that they have the right to be here, then one must do what is the moral thing to do by saying that they should be represented here by their own people. But, Sir, I also want to submit this to the hon. Leader for his consideration : I know these people, all of them, probably better than any hon. member on the opposite side, and I am absolutely convinced that those people are not going to accept the insult which it implies. Not only is one going to cause frustration among these people, but one is also going to engender a terrible hate among them if one accepts the principle that they should be represented here but tells them that they cannot exercise such representation here themselves. But I want to go further.</p>

<p>If one concedes the principle to them that they may be represented here, the demand is bound to be made that they should be represented here according to their numbers, and one is going to have a perpetual gnawing at one; one is going to have perpetual frustration; one is going to have perpetual demands, for then one is responsible for their having come here. They will not have come here of their own accord; they will not be here only by invitation, but one says to them that they have the right to be represented here, and one will have to pay for that, and that account which one will have to pay will grow by the day.</p>

<p>Sir, surely that goes without saying. I do not know why the hon. member is putting that question to me. But Sir, I want to go further. I want to say to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that this plan is nowhere near implementation, and I cannot see how it will ever be implemented either, but let us, for the sake of argument, accept that <span class="col_5285-5286" refersTo="page_1106"/>it can be done, then the Leader of the Opposition is not even going to have unanimity within his own party in regard to these matters. After all, there are people within his party who do not subscribe to that standpoint that these representatives should be Whites. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout said in his characteristic way that it is a fool&#x2019;s paradise to accept that, and I want to know from the hon. the Leader of the Opposition where he stands, for he has not yet told us where he stands in this connection. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition must tell us whether he agrees with the hon. member for Bezuidenhout that it is a fool&#x2019;s paradise. But let us take a look now at all that it entails.

<p>I should like to know now. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition went even further when he said here, in his presence, that that was only the opinion of the hon. member, and that also appears in Hansard. Now the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is pretending not to know, but surely the Leader of the Opposition was himself for a long time in favour of these representatives being Black representatives. He himself conceded to this, and he told us that he had done so because he had been under pressure at the time. I was even kind to him; he will remember it. I asked him whether the pressure had come from this side, and he said no, his own people had exerted such pressure on him that he had had to concede that these representatives should be Black people. But I want to debate the perniciousness of this matter further with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition along these lines. Suppose he were to win the election, with a majority of five. One of the first things he would do, I take it, would be to pass, with that small majority, that legislation to bring those 16 representatives into the House of Assembly in order to increase his majority to 21. And when they are here &#x2026; [Interjections.] But he is bringing them in here. The hon. members must not interrupt me now. They can debate this matter. It is their policy, and I can reply to them one by one, but I cannot reply to an entire chorus. But I want to go further. The hon. the Minister of Information quoted to him what Gen.

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I hope, Sir, that the situation will be reconsidered by the hon. gentleman, because he is embarking on an extremely dangerous course.</p>

<p>His course is dangerous in many other directions. He must try to attack the proposals of this side of the House in respect of non-European policy because his own policy is so indefensible in so many respects. You see, Sir, there are two aspects of his policy in particular which he cannot defend, and in respect of which it appears that he cannot see the end of the road. The first concerns the Cape Coloured people. The hon. gentleman knows that there is a great deal of dissatisfaction amongst those people at the present time. He knows that there have been warnings&#x2014; even by those nominated by him to the Coloured Persons Council. He knows that there have been warnings from the Police. He knows that many social workers in the country have already indicated what the dangers are in respect of that group of the population.</p>

<p>I say, Sir, that I have some sympathy for the hon. the Prime Minister; he is in a dilemma. He and his party have always said that there were only two alternatives in respect of non-European policy in South Africa. The first alternative is complete integration. The second alternative is separate development, and complete separation.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, which alternative is he following in respect of the Cape Coloured people&#x003F; He tells us that there is going to be no Colouredstan; and I agree with him. I think that that is a very wise decision, even if the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare is not always with him on that subject, even if we do not have his word as a member of the Cabinet that he believes a Colouredstan is impossible, and even if, until the day before yesterday, he was perhaps the alternative Prime Minister designate. People do not know what the policy of the party is.</p>

<p>Well, Sir, if it is not a Colouredstan, is it integration&#x003F; Is that the policy of the hon. gentleman in respect of the Cape Coloured people&#x003F; Some of the people in his party talk about a Colouredstan; some talk about moving further apart, and some talk about &#x201C;voller vennote met die Blankes&#x201D;. Of course this leads to a great deal more confusion, upset and unhappiness. By contrast, we have always accepted that there could be a third alternative. Our federal solution applies to that third alternative, which is neither integration nor a Colouredstan; it is a federal arrangement based on a common understanding and a common loyalty to one State. The trouble with this hon. Prime Minister is that he is making the same mistake as the hon. member for Houghton. They are trying to develop ultimate blueprints, but they are neglecting the present problems and are squabbling over things that may happen in the future, without having proper regard to the hurts and the problems of the present time.</p>

<p>Let us, in the light of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s remarks this afternoon, compare his plan and our plan for the Cape Coloured people. Obviously, if there is not going to be a Colouredstan, there must be representation for those Coloured people in this House at some time or other. Or does the hon. the Prime Minister say no, they won&#x2019;t&#x003F; Does the hon. the Prime Minister rule out for all time the representation of the Cape Coloured people in this House&#x003F; Then it is the most immoral and the most dangerous policy that could be followed by any party in South Africa. He talks about the dangers of my policy, about the danger of six representatives for the Coloured people in this House. But what of the dangers of never giving those people representation in this House or in any central Parliament&#x003F; Does he think that they are going to be satisfied with that&#x003F; The hon. the Prime Minister asked me whether they would be satisfied with six. But I want to ask him if they would be satisfied with none. His reply to me will be that he has never conceded the principle. What does that matter&#x003F; Does that make them any less unhappy&#x003F; How can they say that they have never conceded the principle&#x003F; Was it not they who took the Coloureds off the common roll and put them on a separate roll&#x003F; Was it not they who had separate representation in this House&#x003F;</p>

<p>I am not arguing about the hon. gentleman having changed his policy. I am sure he is going to change it again. I am sure he is going to find that his policy is a dead end, and <span class="col_5291-5292" refersTo="page_1109"/>that he cannot get any further with it. If ever there was a policy to lead to unhappiness, rebellion, revolution and trouble in South Africa, it is the policy of that hon. gentleman in respect of the Cape Coloured people. Let us look at what is happening already in respect of the Cape Coloured people. When he established the Coloured Representative Council, we told him to make it wholly elected, but he would not listen. We told him to give it responsibility by way of taxing powers. We also told him to arrange for a liaison body with this House and not to liaise from the Cabinet to the appointed representatives that he has in that Coloured Representative Council. We told him that there were going to be frustrations, and we told him that it was going to lead to more and more difficulties. What is happening&#x003F; What have we had from just one Coloured leader in the last year&#x003F; That very Coloured leader nominated by the hon. the Prime Minister was dissatisfied with us because we did not give him &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D;. Our policy was a great disappointment to him. Only a week or so ago he was talking about the necessity for representation in the central Parliament for his people, but this morning we see a statement in the Press that he stands by separate development. Can this lead to any sort of continuity and certainty&#x003F; What will happen in time&#x003F; Is the hon. the Prime Minister going to give that Coloured Representative Council greater powers&#x003F; He is being urged on every side to go further &#x201C;om die einddoel van sy beleid te bereik&#x201D;. His own newspapers are writing about that sort of thing. There has never been more unhappiness amongst the Coloured people than at the present time. The frustration is building up to a degree that it is becoming quite explosive. The provincial council here in the Cape has deprived the Coloureds of a municipal franchise before ensuring that they have a proper alternative. I can go on with the various things that are irritating these people. What irritates them more than the sharp contrast between the treatment given a non-White from overseas and the treatment handed out to local non-Whites&#x003F; They talk about it. I do not know whether the hon. the Prime Minister knows. This raises the whole question of petty apartheid that is being applied at the present time. I do not like the phrase; I talk about public amenities. I believe that we have to reach a stage where there will have to be more local option and more freedom to the individual and less dictation from Pretoria as to what the situation should be in that regard. We have the situation again where the hon. the Prime Minister talks about their opportunities, but we still sit with the difficulties of job reservation in so far as it applies to them. We hear from the hon. the Minister that it is the Government&#x2019;s policy to limit the wage gap between Coloureds and Whites. We have had it from the hon. the Minister last session and yet no Government has ever done more to increase the disparity between the salaries paid to Coloureds and Whites in South Africa than the present Government.</p>

<p>I want to take the matter a little further with the hon. gentleman, because he knows as well as I do that one of the very big problems that arise with these people is the question of adequate training and adequate education. Is it his policy to assist to make funds available for compulsory education to be phased in for the Coloured people&#x003F; What steps is he prepared to take in that regard&#x003F; I can tell him that this is one of the big grievances, and he knows it. He has had discussions with them. I want to know whether he will allow the hon. the Minister of Community Development to go on moving Coloured people in terms of the Group Areas Act when there is still a vast shortage of housing for them and when the disparity in the numbers of Coloureds moved as opposed to Whites moved is so great that they feel that they have a legitimate grievance. They are talking about it to the hon. the Prime Minister. How does he think he will get these grievances settled&#x003F; How does he think he will get a situation in South Africa where he keeps the loyalty of those people, keeps them with us against the communists and against the terrorists&#x003F;</p>

<p><span class="col_5293-5294" refersTo="page_1110"/>I want to know from the hon. gentleman where this dead-end policy is leading us. He talks about the dangers and the limits of representation in this House. What is the danger involved in the policy of the hon. the Prime Minister&#x003F; Does he really think he can go on getting away with this sort of thing over the years&#x003F; Look at the tragedy of the Cape Coloured people at the present time. Their leadership class, their professional class, is becoming frustrated. It is becoming more and more anti-White; more and more of them are wanting to emigrate. There is an appalling brain drain amongst these people as they go overseas in search of opportunities for themselves and for their children. Tragically, they are not accepting responsibility towards their own people. What about the middle-class Coloureds at the present time&#x003F; They are having a vast lack of economic opportunities, because they cannot get their children apprenticed even though they are qualified. What artisans on the whole will not accept Coloured apprentices. They are limited to the few non-White artisans who are trained. If they are paid the rate for the job, they are certain that they are paid the minimum; they do not get the same wage for the same work. They resent very much the sitting of various commercial ventures near their areas. Then, tragically, there is a very big section of them, a section which I call the lower class or the less fortunate amongst the Coloured people. Unfortunately I think this group must represent round about 30 per cent or more of the Coloured population. There you have all the symptoms of the poverty syndrome in South Africa. You have degradation, alcoholism, illegitimacy, a high birth-rate, and you are heading for trouble unless something is done, and done quickly. What is the situation in which they find themselves&#x003F; They sit with the Coloured Representative Council, which does not have the power to take the necessary action; they sit with the Government which is frustrating them at virtually every turn and around every corner, and yet there are members on that side of the House who sit back and think of the days when Dr. D&#x00F6;nges spoke of &#x201C;five million hearts beating as one&#x2014; Coloured and White&#x201D;. This is one group in respect of which the hon. the Prime Minister is upon a dead-end road. However, it is not the only one.</p>

<p>There is yet another group, and that is the urban Bantu. Here again the hon. gentleman is on a dead-end road. I want to challenge him on this. Yesterday I said to him that the widening gap between the incomes of the different races might well be the gap through which Communism will breach the defenses of South Africa. I want to put to the hon. the Prime Minister the question of the policy of his party in this regard. I regard the urban Bantu as the flash-point of race relations in South Africa. Hon. members know what the situation is amongst them. They have seen this gap developing, but it is amongst them that the result of this gap is seen at its worst in South Africa at the present time. It exists with them more than with anyone else because of the policies of this Government which force them to work and to live under conditions which make it difficult for employers, either individually or collectively, to improve their situation, and in which the Bantu gets the worst of two worlds. He gets the worst of the world of being a labourer in a modern industrial society, and he gets the worst of the world of an unsophisticated citizen of an embryo homeland-state working in a foreign country. The experiences in both these worlds lead to resentment, resentment which is building up and of which the hon. the Prime Minister must be informed if he does not have knowledge of it yet. It is a very dangerous matter and I do not believe that we have ever had a satisfactory reply from either of his Ministers on the question of the urban Bantu in South Africa. I know why we have not had a reply. It is because it is the area in which his policy is falling down the worst, and they do not have an answer for it.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>There are three types of people involved, and I want to deal with them very briefly in the time at my disposal. Firstly, there is the Bantu living permanently in the White areas in townships where they have the right to stay for one reason or another. What does the policy mean to that Bantu&#x003F; It means to him that in most cases he has insecurity in his job. He may be allowed to do one of the better jobs while there is no White man available to do it, but the moment the White man turns up he may lose that job. He has no home ownership and in an overwhelming number of cases he has no real stake in the maintenance of law and order. He has no executive or administrative involvement in respect of the wellbeing of his own people in these areas. He <span class="col_5295-5296" refersTo="page_1111"/>has no adequate training for his jobs because there are no adequate training facilities available in the urban areas. The Government gives training of a kind in the homelands, but not in the urban areas. There is seldom adequate schooling for his children, and certainly not secondary schooling for his children. What is his position at the end of his working life&#x003F; He has no security that he can stay in that area where he has spent his whole life, because all sorts of pressures are being brought on him to force him to go back to the homeland, some of which he has probably never seen. His experiences mean that while he has been here, this wage gap has increased and he feels it is because of the restrictions which have been placed upon him. What are we offering that man to make him proof against communist propaganda and the sort of stories the agitators are telling him&#x003F; You are telling him he is going to get the vote in the homeland! That is the say he has in what is happening to him today &#x2014;a vote in the homeland. Does the hon. the Prime Minister really think he is going to keep those people satisfied with that sort of promise and that sort of political power&#x003F; Then he talks about the dangers of my policy in this House. The only dangers he really sees in my policy in this House are to the Nationalist Party, not to the White man in South Africa.</p>

<p>But there is a second type of man in the Bantu townships. That man is the contract labourer, the migratory labourer. That is not the man we are using on the frontier at the moment. The man we are using on the frontier at the moment is the permanent resident in the township. This is another type of man. He is here on contract; he is a migratory labourer. What does this policy mean to him&#x003F; No security, because he is here for his contract; that is all. No proper training, because there is none available. He is never sure whether at the end of the contract period he is going to be able to come back to the same boss. I know it is supposed to be guaranteed to him, but we know how often it does not happen. All the evil results of the migratory labour system are known to every church in South Africa and historically, have been the focus of all the trouble we have had in South Africa. There is a lack of mobility in offering his labour; his wages are low because nearly always employers have to employ more than they actually need because of the difficulties of getting replacements in times of pressure. There is little or no possibility of advancement. That could damn this policy right away.</p>

<p>But now, what does this policy mean to the employers of labour in South Africa and to South Africa itself&#x003F; First of all, the employer is faced with uncertainty and inefficiency in his labour force. That means low productivity and the inhibiting of wage increases. It means, as I have said before, having to employ more than he really wants to employ; it means a higher cost of production and cost of living to everybody in South Africa. Why is this security being denied them&#x003F; It is being denied them because the Government wants to try to push industries into border areas, where they really cannot protect these industries from overseas competition, except by giving them advantages, enabling them to compete unfairly, very often, with established industries in other parts of South Africa. What is the result&#x2014;check on the rate of development in South Africa; check on the growth of standards of living in South Africa; lower standards of living for everybody in South Africa and the prevention of that rapid economic development, which is so vital to South Africa to build up its strength to be able to stand up against the outside world that is threatening it at the present time. I want to say to the hon. the Prime Minister that the greatest bulwark against Communism in South Africa is a satisfied community. I relate that to his political plans in respect of these people. The hon. the Prime Minister seems to think that he has more chance of keeping these people satisfied with no representation in this House, as opposed to the limited representation which I am offering as the second stage to create machinery for consultation. Sir, what is the worry of the hon. the Prime Minister&#x003F; Sixteen representatives will come into this House, he says, who will all vote against the Nationalist Party.</p>

<p>Is that his faith in the policies that he has applied to the Bantu, Coloured and Indian people in South Africa in the 24 years that this Government has been in power&#x003F; Does he really want to tell me that that is all the confidence he has in the success of his policies&#x003F; We know, of course, that the real reason for putting the Coloureds on to the separate roll was that they did not vote for the Nationalist Party, and we know, of <span class="col_5297-5298" refersTo="page_1112"/>course, that the real reason for removing the four Coloured Representatives in this House, was that the Nationalist candicates who stood in those seats almost always lost their deposits. But, Sir, it is not necessary that it should always be so. There was a time when the Coloured people divided their political allegiance. Why should it not happen again if we can only get that party on the other side to adopt decent policies in respect of those people instead of keeping them on a dead-end road&#x003F; The hon. the Prime Minister has such tremendous confidence in the success of his policy in respect of the Bantu people; he has set them on the road to independence. He is going to offer them self-determination. I have told him that if they have reached the stage where, having been promised independence and having been prepared for it, they want it, we on this side of the House will not stand in their way. Does the hon. the Prime Minister despair of any Bantu representative coming to this House supporting his Government&#x003F; Is that the admission that I had from the hon. the Prime Minister this afternoon&#x003F; Is it not a shocking state of affairs&#x003F;</p>

<p>As far as this side of the House is concerned, we have said that we want to apply our policy in three stages. In the first stage we are going to deal with discriminatory legislation and legislation involving the rule of law and other matters, and we will try to raise the standard of living of all sections of the community. At the same time we will set about creating the machinery for consultation as to a federal constitution for South Africa. That will be done chiefly through the communal councils which we propose to create for each of the various groups. The Coloureds will have one; the detribalized urban Bantu who have lost their tribal affiliations will have another, and the various so-called homelands will have councils as well. We will have a proper machinery for consultation between them and this House, in which they can sit round a table to hammer out a future federal constitution for South Africa. Sir, there is no question of making any changes here, apart from what I have set out and guaranteed to the hon. gentleman, without a referendum of the White voters in which there is a substantial majority for the changes concerned.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. VAN B. VILJOEN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition spoke mainly about the Coloureds and the urban Bantu. We shall speak about these matters again in due course, but I would at least like to ask this question : When has so much ever been done for a people as the National Party has done for the Coloureds during its period of rule&#x003F; More has been done for them by this Government than under any other political dispensation in South Africa. Sir, the hon. the Prime Minister asked the hon. the Leader of the Opposition a few very important, fundamental questions, to which he gave no reply whatsoever. But the Prime Minister will deal with him again at a later stage. A party which presents itself as an alternative government must, of course, be able to pass the test, and therefore, in the first instance, we expect the United Party to pass the test of having the necessary responsibility and honesty, just as the hon. the Prime Minister has, with great honour, passed this test throughout the years. There are only two ways one can test an alternative government, and that is by asking what plan they have for exercising authority in South Africa if they should ever come into power. What do they believe&#x003F; What is their philisophy of life&#x003F; The second question we can ask here in South Africa is how they rule in Natal. If we asked these two questions we shall quickly find that their plan would have disastrous consequences in South Africa, as very clearly indicated here this afternoon by the hon. the Prime Minister. A few days ago the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said that race relations and racial separation would be left to the public to a large extent. Sir, let us ask this question : How does that party rule in Natal&#x003F; It is very clear why hon members on that side are so sensitive about this language question. The United Party&#x2019;s record in Natal in respect of relations between the language groups and the neglect of Afrikaans, is not a pretty story.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. VAN B. VILJOEN</person>:</from>

<p>The serious neglect of the Afrikaans language and of Afrikaans-speaking people in Natal, I myself have experienced. It took me five years of fighting and of threats on a city council before I could even bring them to acknowledge my language, and that in a United Party-controlled city council in Natal. Sir, uniligual documents of the Natal Provincial Administration are still legion today. We must take note of the fact that on statutory boards appointed by the provincial administration, Afrikaans is neglected to a serious degree; that only a few Afrikaans-speaking people serve on statutory boards, and usually we find that they only have Afrikaans names and cannot speak Afrikaans properly.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#greyling">

<p>That is what we call a renegade.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#viljoen">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. VAN B. VILJOEN</person>:</from>

<p>With only a few exceptions, there are quite a number of statutory boards in Natal which are exclusively uniligual; there is not a single Afrikaans-speaking person on those boards.</p>

<p>But let us look at Natal&#x2019;s poor financial position Natal has been in throughout the years. For 60 years the Natalians have been paying the highest taxes in South Africa. Before this new dispensation came into operation, the provincial taxes were in the region of 40 per cent. In the other provinces they were more or less 30 per cent. In spite of the fact that Natal&#x2019;s revenue increased by 44 per cent, before the advent of the new dispensation, in no way did they succeed in establishing any capital throughout the years. If we look at the other provinces we shall find that the Cape could establish 8 per cent of its own capital, the Free State 16 per cent and the Transvaal up to 30 per cent. We hear so frequently from that side of the House that this Government now wants to adopt autocratic powers for itself. Are they aware of the fact that in no other province is there a system of committees of inquiry existing where evidence is taken in secret and no legal representation is allowed&#x003F;</p>

<p>But let us look for a moment at how that party handles education in Natal. It is their declared policy to have dual medium or parallel medium education. In the first place, if one were to look at the White <span class="col_5301-5302" refersTo="page_1114"/>population ratio between the Transvaal and Natal, one would find that it is four to one as far as the training of teachers is concerned. But as far as the training of teachers is concerned, the Transvaal trains ten teachers for every one teacher trained in Natal. In other words, throughout the years Natal has been living off the other provinces as far as the training of teachers is concerned.</p>

<p>This so-called dual medium education policy of theirs, which they have wanted to implement throughout the years, has never come into its own. The fact remains that 74 per cent of all English-speaking children in Natal attend single medium private schools. This shows how sincere that side of the house is in respect of their declared policy. In the five years up to 1970 they built 19 single medium schools in Natal and only one parallel medium school. How does this compare with the rest of the country&#x003F; In the Free State 84 per cent of the schools are parallel medium schools and in the Cape the figure is 46 percent. As far as the planning of schools is concerned, the story is a tragic one. The whole province is crowded with prefabricated classrooms. With Newcastle now on the threshhold of this tremendous development, there was recently the tragic situation of the provincial administration having to go to Iscor to negotiate for the building of their schools. This is a situation we can no longer tolerate in Natal. That party comes along with a flourish and speaks of the voice of the parent. Parents have no say whatsoever in education in Natal. The parent advisory bodies cannot act in any executive capacity. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>It seems to me the hon. the Prime Minister cannot make a new speech without dragging in a few old speeches of mine, but seeing that he has done so now, I merely want to rectify a few matters. Firstly, there is the question of loading and deloading. I just want to put the record right by saying that I never referred to the question of loading or deloading; that is not what it was about. My objection is not to loading or deloading. I stated a standpoint based on principle&#x2014;I shall come to the standpoint of the party in a moment&#x2014;namely that a parliament (and this applies to our Parliament) should be a real reflection of the wishes of the electorate which sends the people to Parliament. In other words, it should be truly representative of the wishes of the people who vote. I think this is the essense of a democratic parliament, and I want to ask the hon. the Prime Minister: Does he not accept that&#x003F; Does he not believe that this Parliament should be a true reflection of the votes of the electorate&#x003F; I would be glad if he would say whether he rejected it. There was a time when he rejected democracy.</p>

<p>That is another matter. The loading is a way, a method, of dealing with the matter I want to put it like this to the hon. the Prime Minister; I admit we have a problem with large constituencies; but you have it in a country such as Germany as well, and although I do not want to suggest now that we must necessarily follow other countries, Germany, for example, has a system whereby, in an election, one votes on a constituency basis&#x2014;they also have large and small constituencies&#x2014;but in addition to this there is a panel, so that when voting has taken place for the constituencies with their loading and deloading, there is a way of compensating the parties if necessary; the various parties have a panel of candidates so that, if a party has gained a greater proportion of votes than seats in terms of the system of constituencies (with loading and deloading), it is compensated from the panel.</p>

<p>My argument has never concerned loading or deloading as such. You may retain loading and deloading, and there are methods in other countries where you have this, but over and above this you have is a supplementary system of voting which makes Parliament a true reflection of the wishes of the electorate. This is the principle I support, namely that this Parliament should be a true reflection of what the electorate wants. And I think it is a very legitimate standpoint. I was prepared to give the Prime Minister a frank reply, but I should like him to be so kind as to give me a frank <span class="col_5303-5304" refersTo="page_1115"/>reply to my question. Does he agree that this Parliament should be representative of the true wishes of the electorate&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I understand all that, but I want the hon. Leader just to accept this point of mine, i.e. that in other countries there are various models according to which one may ensure that one&#x2019;s parliament is truly representative of the wishes of the electorate. Germany, for example, has the most modern constitution, because it got a completely new constitution after the last war.</p>

<p>Other countries have old constitutions and we also inherited the old British Constitution. But I do not want to quarrel about that. As the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said here, the two sides of Parliament can get together and work out a system. I only want to put one question. I have pleaded that this Parliament should at all times be a true reflection of the wishes of the electorate. And I would be suspicious of a person who told me he rejected this.</p>

<p>I want to go further now and say to the hon. the Prime Minister that he should reply to us in this regard. It is a matter we are discussing in the United Party, and at the moment it is the standpoint of the party that it supports the present system, and I accept that. But I still believe that, without abolishing the loading and the deloading because of the geographical circumstances of the country, we should devise a system which would make this Parliament a true reflection of the wishes of the electorate. [Interjections.] I simply cannot see how a person who calls himself a democrat can really oppose this standpoint of mine.</p>

I am a strong supporter of the federal idea.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. BOTHA</person>:</from> 

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to react much to what was said by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. His argument concerning the fool&#x2019;s paradise was not very convincing; it was rather vague and I believe the Prime Minister, in his competent way, will in fact react to that. As regards the hon. member&#x2019;s story of loading and deloading, I can merely say that I think the deloading which is going to take place, as going to be the deloading of the United Party in Oudtshoorn.</p>

<p>Listening to this debate, classic as it was, I was reminded of a recent leading article in the <i>Sunday Times</i> which dealt with &#x201C;the U.P. Shake-up&#x201D;. It stated that &#x201C;this shake-up marked a clear shift in the policy of the United Party&#x201D;. After this &#x201C;shake-up&#x201D; had taken place, there was, according to the <i>Sunday Times,</i> a dramatic &#x201C;far-reaching statesman-like decision&#x201D; by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. He &#x201C;dramatically&#x201D; accepted the independence of the homelands as an accomplished fact. I think we have come to a second political &#x201C;shake-up&#x201D;, and in my opinion the Prime Minister and other speakers have shaken the United Party in an extremely competent way and successfully. I think it has been shown here indisputably in the interests of national unity that the United Party is the one who incites and is responsible for racial hatred between party and party in this country. It is not only the National Party and its speakers who say this, but none other than the <i>Sunday Times</i> and the writer Serfontein also endorse and confirm that Boere-haters are undoubtedly sitting on that side of this House. It is said that one cannot get rid of a member of the United Party in the Free State, that one can never convert him; he must die out. I believe that a Serfontein with the <i>Sunday Times</i> is possibly something worse than a member of the United Party in the Free State. I do not know how much Afrikaner blood Serfontein still has in his veins, but the little he has, perhaps 0,015 per cent, made him talkative and evoked a reaction from him on this occasion. What did he say&#x003F; He said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For decades most English-speaking South Africans and influential sections of the Opposition have been doing a grave injustice to Afrikaans culture. The actions and attitudes of many English-speaking South Africans are nothing but an insult to the Afrikaner.</block>

<p>We know it is true. Mr. Chairman, we remember. It is true. We remember how the Afrikaner had to go about with his hat in his hand during the war years. To whom did we have to go&#x003F; We had to go to collect the alms handed out by the high <span class="col_5307-5308" refersTo="page_1117"/>and mighty leaders of the United Party. The United Party should remember that it lays claim to serving as the alternative Government of this country. It should remember that it in fact represents the majority of the English-speaking people in this country. It should remember that what it says as well as the example it sets, manifests itself outside. That is what the people outside see of it; that is what they believe and that is where the example comes from. As a result of that example set by the United Party, we already have the phenomenon in South Africa that there is a type of arrogant jingo for whom the National Party has been governing this country too well for too long. This type makes his appearance and talks continually, in season and out of season, in derogatory terms of the Afrikaner in this country. We have an example of that in the most recent edition of <i>Commercial Opinion.</i> Here we have an article by Dr. R. Jordan, chairman of the Johannesburg Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Dr. R. Jordan. This is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The overwhelming majority of decision-makers in the Public Service, on statutory boards and in State-owned corporations are selected from those who unconditionally support official Government policy.</block>

<p>That is a disgraceful reflection on the Public Service. But he said more than this. He also said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is too little brain-power available amongst the elite that runs all these boards and wields all this authority. There are just not enough outstanding men to do all the necessary jobs. Many have grown up in rural surroundings and long for the country life of their youth. Urban life and its problems remain alien and unwelcome to them.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the only thing that is insinuated here by Dr. Jordan, is that the Afrikaner is a &#x201C;backvelder&#x201D; and that he does not fit in. He said this because he knows that the composition of the Public Service is mainly Afrikaans. That is why he made this statement. I say that this is the statement of an Afrikaner-hater and that it is nothing but a deliberate, purposeful dig at the Afrikaner in this country. The National Party has learnt one thing. That is that as a result of the United Party&#x2019;s incapacity and sterility, its political conviction is situated just below its gullet, and that it no longer has any conscience. I am referring to the 1970 election in the constituency of Ermelo, when the United Party fought that election in very close alliance with the H.N.P. and in which Dr. Hertzog, a political weakling with whom they made common cause, was exploited. Some traditional U.P. supporters of whom there are many in the Eastern Transvaal and who have not yet heard that Jan Smuts is dead, joined the organization of the H.N.P. in an active capacity. In a systematic and impudent way they went from house to house to visit Nationalists and they said that they had resigned from the United Party and had joined the organization of the H.N.P. The one and only idea was to sow dissension in the National Party. In a shameless way they used the slogan from house to house that the National Party was the party which was doing too much for the kaffir and that for that reason they had left the United Party and joined the H.N.P. When people say now &#x201C;Vorster faces a new challenge to leadership&#x201D;, I want to say I think it is precisely the other way round. After listening to the debate conducted in this House, I must say that if there is a leadership which is in question, it is that of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I think the question we are asking ourselves is only how long it will still take. I believe that the entire United Party will go to the Progressive Party without a bequest or a will.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I find great difficulty in reacting to the speech of the hon. member who has just sat down because it was inaudible. However, I got the impression that he was trying to revive the debate on &#x201C;Afrikanerhater&#x201D; so eloquently introduced into this House by the Minister of Defence. That gives me the opportunity of making an appeal to the hon. the Prime Minister. I want to make this appeal very seriously. He has given us an assurance on more than one occasion that he wants unity and better understanding, less bitterness and less vilification, I take it, between the Afrikaans and English-speaking people of this country. I take it that he will condemn <i>ex-parte</i> <span class="col_5309-5310" refersTo="page_1118"/>accusations, accusations without any foundation, by the one race group against the other. I want to appeal to him to have a look at the speech of the hon. Minister of Defence, who started this whole unhappy argument.</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I shall tell you that. I want to refer to p. D. 2 of the Minister&#x2019;s typed Hansard. He wanted to know whether &#x201C;die koningseun van Musgrave&#x201D; could speak Afrikaans. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Kan die agb. lid dit doen&#x003F; Ek daag die agb. lid, mnr. Emdin, uit om op te staan &#x2026; As huile dit nie doen nie en tog nog Afrikaans kan praat, dan s&#x00EA; ek dat dit erger is. Dan doen hulle dit nie uit minagting &#x2026;</block>

<p>*Is it a principle which the Prime Minister accepts, i.e. that if members of this House are able to speak another language and do not do so, they are doing it out of contempt&#x003F; Let us have clarity about that, because Hansard shows that the majority of the members opposite have never spoken English in this House. When I speak of members, I am referring to the members outside the Cabinet. Are they doing so out of contempt for English&#x003F; Is this the principle, the basis on which we build race relations in South Africa, or do we respect each other&#x2019;s rights to use ones&#x2019; own language or the other language as one thinks fit&#x003F; The hon. the Minister went further. On p. D.3 he said the following of the English-speaking members of this House&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In daardie party sit daar elemente in hierdie Raad en daarbuite wat die Afrikaner haat.</block>

<p>I deny it. I know my colleagues in the United Party in this House better than any Nationalist does. There is not one whose attitude in respect of the Afrikaner is not sound and good. Then the hon. member for Musgrave rose on a point of order. He felt hurt by the insult and asked Mr. Speaker whether it was permissible. There was a long discussion on that, after which Mr. Speaker ruled that it was not a point of order. It was his right, but then the Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ek herhaal dat die agb. lid wat daar sit &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is the hon. member for Musgrave&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; Afrikaans so minag dat hy die Afrikaner nie kan toespreek nie.</block>

<p>It is untrue, because the hon. member for Musgrave can speak Afrikaans. Perhaps he cannot do it as well as the hon. members opposite, but it is perfectly passable. Therefore it is untrue. Why should that accusation be levelled against an English-speaking member on this side without any justification except that he does not address this House in Afrikaans&#x003F; Then followed what was the culmination. Another discussion took place between the hon. member and Mr. Speaker. When it was over, the hon. the Minister of Defence said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die agb. lid vir Durban Musgrave is &#x2019;n Afrikanerhater.</block>

<p>This is on record, and goes into the world like that. The only justification for it is that the hon. member for Durban Musgrave does not address this House in Afrikaans, while the same thing applies to hon. members opposite as far as English is concerned. Now I want to ask something of the Prime Minister, something which may help us a great deal. He is the man who said he wanted deeds. Here is an opportunity for him to prove that he is willing to do deeds. I do not want the hon. the Prime Minister to repudiate the Minister; all I am asking of him is to rise and to say whether he agrees that if a person addresses this House in his language and does so often or regularly, then he hates the other language. Let him tell us that he does not agree with what was said, i.e. that the hon. member for Musgrave, to be specific, is an Afrikaner-hater for the reasons advanced. If he does not do so. I would have to say to my regret that all his protestations and fine sounding words of yesterday mean nothing to me, and I am sure to the people of South Africa. He has the opportunity now.</p>

<p>We come now to the second question I want to put to the Prime Minister. Last year, in the third or fourth quarter, a prominent public servant was relieved of his post. It was Mr. Gouws, who was in charge of the Third Party Motor Vehicle Insurance Fund. We would be very glad if we could get information on the present situation there.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Will you just give me a chance, please&#x003F; I should like to raise it on the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote only in regard to one point. It is said in insurance circles in Johannesburg that the matter was brought to the attention of the Prime Minister in 1969 and in 1970. Steps were taken only in 1971. I merely want to know now whether the people who maintain that they brought it to the attention of the Prime Minister, are telling the truth or whether the facts they brought to his attention, were not important enough for the Prime Minister to react to them. I merely want him to tell us why, if the matter was raised with him, it took two years before any steps were taken. That is all. I want to raise this on the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote.</p>

<p>Thirdly I should like to register a protest because the Prime Minister neglects to reply to questions of fundamental importance to the people of South Africa, and because he is doing what he did last year as well, and that is to try to avoid pointed, responsible questions put to him by introducing into the debate new matters, usually of a highly controversial nature, which, because he holds the office he does, will enjoy attention from the public and distract attention from the actual matters we raise.</p>

<p>I am referring specifically to the question of labour and the use of South Africa&#x2019;s manpower which was raised by the hon. member for Hillbrow and myself&#x2014;who happen to be the chairman and the secretary of the labour group of the United Party. I want to complain particularly about the fact that the Prime Minister did not reply to the questions of my friend, the hon. member for Hillbrow, concerning the wage gap existing between White and non-White. In my opinion, and in the opinion of the United Party and of the businessmen of South Africa belonging to both parties and of all race groups, this is one of the bottlenecks, one of the danger points in South African life.</p>

What are we going to do to narrow this wage gap, this income gap, because it is becoming explosive, and the hon. the Minister of the Interior is a witness to that. The Prime Minister dealt with this matter at the International Press Conference he held last year. He gave his reply. I take it that he believed what he said; and what he said, is true, as far as it goes. But he also showed that he did not understand the position fully. I am not saying this to be derogatory, because I am seeking clarity for him, for myself and for all of us.</p>

It is a great pleasure for me to say that I think the hon. the Prime Minister meets with those expectations; in fact, he did more than is expected of him in the handling of this Vote.

He said they would become independent and that subsequently negotiations would take place in respect of their final extent and their final borders, and by those means the hon. the Prime Minister wants to cast a bone of contention between independent Bantu countries and an independent South Africa, something for which the people will perhaps have to suffer for their next 10 generations. It was the most irresponsible statement I have ever heard. But I do not want to go into it. With reference to the speech made by the hon. member for Wolmaransstad, the hon. the Prime Minister should tell us something more than he did when he spoke recently, after my hon. friend next to me had put a question to him about the borders of the Bantustans and the land which would be allocated to them, and referred to the schedules of the 1936 Act.</p>

<p>No, I am seeking information. Would the Prime Minister, when he speaks again, tell us in what respect the Schedules to the Act help us to determine the borders of the Bantustans, because as far as I remember, the Schedules to the Act&#x2014;I must admit that it has been a very long time since I studied them&#x2014; deal with the released and scheduled areas, but do not define any borders. They define territories and areas, but not borders. The hon. the Prime Minister must admit that in terms of the Schedules to the 1936 Act, the districts of Maclear or Elliot may become part of the Bantustan. The uncertainty of the Whites in these districts has by no means been resolved by the Prime Minister&#x2019;s statement. Sir, unfortunately I cannot pursue this matter, because I was engaged in a discussion with the Prime Minister which I should like to finish.</p>

<p>In one sentence the hon. the Minister of Planning has now described the biography of the Nationalist Party. Sir, I want to speak to the hon. the Prime Minister again about the question of the wage gap, the income gap, between Whites and non-Whites in South Africa, which in my opinion and in that of every economic student in South Africa, is the greatest danger-point of all in South Africa. At his International Press Conference on 22nd November of last year, he replied to a question. I have already said that the Prime Minister had to reply off the cuff, therefore I am making many allowances for that. He said, for example&#x2014;I am reading from the official report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There must be no discrimination as far as the wage or salary&#x2014;if you want to call it that way&#x2014;is concerned between White and non-White.</block>

<p>He was referring to the provisions of the Industrial Conciliation Act and the Wage Act. He said that in terms of those Acts no discrimination was allowed&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">So there is no difference between the two races whatsoever.</block>

<p>I assume he was referring to the provisions of the legislation; that it was not a general statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A non-White Coloured bricklayer in the Western Cape, a Coloured carpenter, receives exactly the same wages according to the Industrial Conciliation Act as any White person.</block>

<p>It is perfectly true. This is the principle of equal pay for equal work (the rate for the job), which was written into the Act by the old South African Party when the Act was passed in 1924, and it still forms part of the Act. The Prime Minister was perfectly correct. Then the Prime Minister said there was no ceiling as far as the wages of non-Whites were concerned, and that he wanted to grant that thousands of non-Whites were earning more than Whites. That may be true. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is not a question that all the Whites earn better salary and have a higher standard of living than all the non-Whites in South Africa. You know that is not the position at all.</block>

<p>Sir, what the Prime Minister said there is perfectly true, it would be perfectly true if it were the whole story. But did he want to suggest that in real life there was not in fact a tremendous gap between the wages of Whites and non-Whites in South Africa&#x003F;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>The point I want to make is that in practice, as a result of the reclassification of jobs and the awards that are made under the Wage Act and under the Industrial Conciliation Act, the non-Whites are paid much, much less than the Whites. The hon. the Prime Minister himself recently&#x2014;I think in this debate&#x2014; said that their had been an increase in the wages of Whites over the past few years of 400 per cent and, in the case of non-Whites, an increase of 300 per cent, so the gap must be widening. That is my point. I want to concede that if we can make proper use of our labour force in this country, of all our resources, we cannot immediately pay everybody the rate for the job, except where there is a danger of immediate competition between White and non-White for the same job; then you must pay the rate for the job. But under the system of job classification or job determination, you can have discrimination.</p>

I want to quote from a speech which the hon. member concerned, that same hon. member, the hon. member for Potchefstroom, made in Parliament the other day, namely on 1st February, 1972. I shall quote from the Hansard of 1st February, column 165. According to the Hansard, the hon. member for Potchefstroom, Mr. Le Grange, asked whether we could mention the names of non-Whites who accepted the policy as far as representation in this House was concerned. He said we could not mention any such names. Then he went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is because the Bantu of South Africa know that the United Party is being politically dishonest with them. I challenge them here to quote any responsible Bantu who is prepared to accept the policy of the United Party. But it will not be accepted, for the simple reason that no Bantu &#x2026;</block>

<block name="quote">Today one has those revolts and petitions for civil rights. Now I say there are only two ways open to the Bantu in South Africa, i.e. the way advocated by the National Party and the way advocated by the hon. member for Houghton.</block>

<p>The hon. member said there, in the first place, that no Bantu supported our policy because we were politically dishonest. From that we are entitled to conclude that the Bantu support the policy of the hon. members opposite, because they are supposed to be politically honest. In that case, what are they scared of&#x003F; Surely the test is whether they have confidence that their policy will receive the support of the people.

<p>May I ask the hon. member a question&#x003F; Mention the name of one Bantu leader who accepts your policy.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Very well, let us say for the sake of argument that I cannot mention the name of any Bantu leader. In that case, what does it mean when the Prime Minister says that that bloc of 16 representatives would keep the Nationalist Party out of power for the rest of the existence of this Parliament&#x003F; No, one must be consistent. The Bantu either support the United Party, or they do not support the United Party. The Prime Minister&#x2019;s argument is that they would support the United Party. At least, they would not support the Nationalist Party. That is the point. The hon. member for Potchefstroom is my witness, because it is recorded here in Hansard. It is also recorded in Hansard that he said there were only two alternatives. If that is the case, I want to ask him now what we are debating this evening. What is the significance of the major speech the Prime Minister made before dinner this evening&#x003F; At that stage the subject was the third choice, namely the alternative of the United Party.</p>

<p>That is the dangerous one.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says now it is a dangerous one, but it cannot be dangerous if it does not exist. After all, he said in January that there were no alternatives except his and that of the hon. member for Houghton. Now I have to hear that our policy is dangerous, <span class="col_5329-5330" refersTo="page_1128"/>but it is supposed to be something that does not exist. What is one to think of the Nationalist Party which is scared out of its wits by something that does not exist&#x003F; I want to come back now to the Prime Minister, because this is a very serious matter. At the International Press Conference he said the rate for the job applied in South Africa. That is true. He said there was no ceiling on what the non-Whites could achieve in South Africa. That is true. However, earlier in this debate he said, if one analyses the figures he gave, that White wages had increased fourfold and non-White wages threefold. Therefore the gap is becoming wider. Up to now he has evaded the question put to him by my Leader and the hon. member for Hillbrow. He ran away from it and spoke about 16 Bantu representatives, and now he should tell me and the people frankly whether he regards it as a sound or an unsound situation that this tremendous gap should exist and should be getting wider and wider under the Nationalist Party&#x003F;</p>

<p>But he says his policy is to narrow it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>He says his policy is to narrow it, and he should tell us now what he is going to do in order to narrow it. The Industrial Conciliation Act and the Wage Act do not narrow it. The Industrial Conciliation Act was passed by the United Party in 1924, and the old S.A. Party placed the Wage Act on the Statute Book prior to the passing of the Industrial Conciliation Act. These are United Party Acts, and we know them. They are doing splendid work, but it is not their function to narrow the gap. No provisions are contained in those Acts for narrowing this gap. What is the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy for narrowing that gap&#x003F; There is only one way of narrowing the gap. We cannot decrease the wages of the Whites; we must increase the wages of the non-Whites. We should make them more productive so that they may earn higher wages. We should train them, educate them and coach them. What is his policy in that respect&#x003F; He must not tell me it is his policy to achieve those things in the reserves or on the borders of the reserves. As long as the Prime Minister and I and our children are alive, the reserves and the border areas will not be able to make the contribution to the employment of non-Whites which the White areas of South Africa are able to make. I want to come back to the question I put to the Prime Minister in my previous speech &#x003F;.nd which was not replied to, namely what use is it to us if, according to the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education, the Bantu are trained as artisans in the reserves &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>According to the Constitution they are the reserves, and I confine myself to the Acts of South Africa, and not to the visions and fantasies of the hon. the Deputy Minister. According to him they will be trained to become full-fledged artisans under more favourable conditions than those that apply in the case of White apprentices. I want to know where they are going to work. If they are to work in the reserves or on the borders of the reserves, it would possibly be a contribution towards solving the race problem in South Africa, but this would be useless and meaningless for solving the problems which arise from the wage gap. In my lifetime and in our lifetime there will be no real change in the pattern of industrial development in South Africa so that the reserves and the border areas may make a significant contribution towards eliminating the wage gap in South Africa. We are not dealing with what is going to happen in a 100 years&#x2019; time. What are we going to do in our lifetime, and the Prime Minister is as old as I am&#x003F; These are the questions from which the hon. the Prime Minister is running away from, and instead of facing them, he came forward with an emotional speech to the effect that he was afraid that the non-White representatives in this Parliament would not support him.

<p>I say the hon. member knows absolutely nothing about this, or is he trying to conceal this matter in this House and to bring this House under a wrong impression as far as the provisions of the Industrial Conciliation Act and the Wage Act are concerned&#x003F; The fundamental principle is that there may be no differentiation on the basis of race or colour in the determination of wages and conditions of service. In other words, it is laid down that the policy to be followed is the one that hon. member is supposedly in favour of, and that is the rate for the job. In both these Acts the wages and conditions of service are laid down for the work which is done and not for the person. The hon. member ought to know this. What the hon. member does not know either, is that as far as the Bantu are concerned, virtually the whole of the engineering industry &#x2026; He must listen now and not sit there conducting a conversation. He should at least display the courtesy of listening when I reply to him. I say he does not realize that 90 per cent of the semi-skilled labour in the engineering industry on the Witwatersrand is done by Bantu : In terms of an industrial agreement they are paid for the work they do and not on the basis of race or colour.

How must the Bantu be trained&#x003F; The usual way in which an artisan is trained is that he is enrolled as an apprentice, serves his period of apprenticeship and is then accepted as a skilled artisan. When I was Minister of Labour I laid down provisions for the first time and put a Bill through for Bantu to be trained as building workers in their own areas, where they can then be used. These hon. members do not know what they are talking about. It is all very well to say, &#x201C;Train them, give them the necessary training and then all the Bantu will have the opportunity to become artisans and then they will be able to enter the labour market.&#x201D; I repeat that the hon. member makes statements which he cannot substantiate.

<p>Yes &#x2026; [Interjections.] But I know we still have people in this country today who do not like an Afrikaner. I heard that during the last election. I heard how they voted in Sea Point. Certain people of the Progressive Party said, &#x201C;Vote against the Afrikaner&#x201D;. That is true. I raised objections with the highest authority in that party, who will still be able to remember this. I did so openly. [Interjections.] No, wait a minute, but I also heard that Afrikaans-speaking people had acted in a similar way on various occasions. I am thinking particularly of Port Elizabeth. There was an Afrikaans-speaking person with an English name who stood for the United Party, and the Nationalist Party shouted, &#x201C;Vote against the Englishman&#x201D;. All I want to say, is that there are such English-speaking people who do not like the Afrikaner, but they are not in the United Party. [Interjections.] There are Afrikaners who do not like the English. I believed that they were not in the Nationalist Party either. I thought they were with Albert Hertzog. But it seems to me Albert Hertzog does not have all his people with him yet. Some of Albert Hertzog&#x2019;s people are still to be found in other places. I have listened to this debate, and what the hon. the Minister of Defence said did not worry me a great deal. He and I grew up in politics together. In 1936 he was appointed organizing secretary&#x2014;and so was I, in the same area. You can imagine, Sir, what went on there. When I first stood for election, Sir, who do you think the Nationalist Party put up against me&#x003F; It was the Minister of Defence! And who do you think got a hiding&#x003F; He did! So the two of us grew up together. His politics do not worry me. I want to say today that I am grateful that the sum total of this debate amounted to this. I accept the word of both these two great men, the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, that they are going to make it their aim through word and deed to bring the people of South Africa, the English-speaking people and the Afrikaners, closer together. [Interjections.] Do you hear the objections we get from some people, Mr. Chairman&#x003F; I did not discriminate. I did not say my Leader was better than the Prime Minister, but do you hear what is being said, Sir, even from Ministerial benches&#x003F; When I said that, there were objections. I shall tell you why, Sir, and I want to say this to the hon. the Prime Minister. There was something that worried me more than anything else. We are living in a time in which the White man in South Africa finds himself in what is perhaps the most dangerous position since South Africa was founded. If we do not have national unity now, when will we have it&#x003F; What is the use of some of the members opposite becoming &#x201C;verlig&#x201D; on the colour question, but becoming &#x201C;verkramp&#x201D; on the English-Afrikaans question&#x003F; I listened to the hon. the Minister of Health. Is he here&#x003F; I am sorry he is not here. Do you know, Sir, what he said and did&#x003F; I think he did far more harm than the Minister of Defence. I cannot see how he can stay on in the Cabinet. Do you know what he said, Sir&#x003F; He referred to the hon. member for Turffontein and said, &#x201C;There sits a Fourie for whom Jopie Fourie is no hero&#x201D;. &#x201C;Who is his hero&#x003F;&#x201D; he asked; &#x201C;A Louis Botha!&#x201D; We had a remark from one of the Nationalist Party members in reply to that statement. I do not want to mention his name. He said Louis Botha was a traitor.</p>

<p>What must the civilized nations of the world think of us when the two greatest South Africans, heroes of the Boer War, the first and second Prime Ministers of South Africa, can so easily be held up as traitors to their own people&#x003F; What then about you and me.

His anchor is Jopie Fourie.</p>

<p>I have the greatest respect for the courage and heroism of Jopie Fourie. But, Mr. Chairman, when a Government finds itself in a time of crisis, I will never be able to <span class="col_5339-5340" refersTo="page_1133"/>approve of its officers committing treason against that Government. It does not matter what the circumstances are.</p>

<p>I now want to put a question to the hon. the Prime Minister. I am sorry I have to do this, but I think it is necessary that this be said in public. We are today using persons of different colour in the Caprivi Strip and elsewhere. Let us leave aside for a moment what the circumstances were as far as Jopie Fourie was concerned; I do not accept the story that he hoisted the white flag. But I am asking any Nationalist now : Is that the example, are these the heroes whose example you want the coloured races in South Africa to follow&#x003F; When this country is in danger, when one wears the uniform of this country, should they be able to defect to the enemy&#x003F;</p>

Mr. Chairman, the whole motive and motivation of those people is to denationalize, to divide and rule. They cannot and may not represent the Afrikaans-speaking people; neither the English-speaking people, because they also bring about division between the English-speaking person and the Afrikaner in this country. What was the remark made by the hon. Minister of Sport by way of interjection when he said : &#x201C;I am an Englishman with National convictions&#x201D;&#x003F; The hon. member for Zululand then asked him, &#x201C;But do you call yourself an Englishman&#x003F;&#x201D; [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, they can decide whom they want to insult.

Is the hon. member not ashamed of himself&#x003F;</p>

<p>Sir, I want to deal with their labour policy, their policy of simply throwing open the flood-gates. If we need one non-White labourer, why should nine of them be at the ready&#x003F; So that keener wage competition may be brought about, and so that we may perhaps, with less trouble and effort and by making use of automation and whatever the case may be, be able to do a little profitable business again. Sir, and then hon. members on that side come forward here and talk of a wage gap. Our standpoint is control of the non-Whites entering our labour market, but they want to throw open the flood-gates so that keener competition for wages may come about.</p>

<p>That is for a genera] worker. Take a boiler attendant, a man who has to get up in the middle of the night. Does he think that a boiler attendant is able to live and support his family on a minimum of R7,50 per week&#x003F; Sir, let us leave labourers out; let us take the sample attendant: R9,40; Let us take the night watchman, who works 14 hours: R5,35. The minimum wages are also laid down here for waiters and female clerks. This was signed by the Minister of Labour, of his own free will. I want to ask whether that is the way in which we guarantee the future harmony, and therefore the future security, of the White man in South Africa, and I want to ask the Minister of the Interior whether he agrees with these wages. After all, he shares joint responsibility with his colleague, the Minister of Labour. As a Cabinet Minister he shares the responsibility for this minimum wage of R3,80 per week. The hon. the Minister of the Interior has made noises about closing the wage gap; he has made noises about the danger of revolution and bloodshed and yet he sits in the Cabinet, Sir, when the Minister of Labour approves of these wages, a Minister of Labour who believes that people can live on R3, R5 and R7 per week; that they can live and feed themselves and clothe themselves and pay their transport from way out in the bundu where they are pushed by the Minister of Planning and the Minister of Community Development, and then still retain their respect on a wage of R3,80 to R7 or R9 a week.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of the Interior owes South Africa an explanation because he shares responsibility, just as he shares responsibility with the Cabinet and with his colleagues who follow the line which that hon. member took and which has been taken on and off for two weeks by the Government, of trying to stir up feelings between White and White and White and non-White in South Africa. I want to say to the hon. the Minister of the Interior that he owes this House and South Africa a speech to justify his frequent and, I believe, his sincere appeals for national unity, his appeals for us to find the things on which we can agree, his appeals to find the things on which to build a better South Africa. I ask him to reconcile that with the speeches we had last week from the Ministers of Defence, Community Development and Labour and Information. We have heard hard things. I said this afternoon that the Nationalist Party has no monopoly on sensitivity. Other people have feelings too. English-speaking people have feelings, as the hon. the Minister of the Interior knows. I want to call as witness to the patriotism and loyalty of South Africans who speak English and who live in Natal, the following words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Natal is an integral part of South Africa and makes a large contribution to our nationhood. The people of Natal are good patriots.</block>

<p>That was said by a gracious lady, by the first lady of Natal, the wife of the then Administrator of Natal. I hope the Minister of the Interior will support that view and will restore some sanity to the bitterness which his Cabinet and his colleagues are sowing in South Africa.</p>

<p>Last week the hon. member for Durban Point really regaled the House, so to speak, with his sport stories and his rugby stories and I must say the metamorphosis that has taken place in the meantime is remarkable. It seems as if the hiding the Opposition has received is only beginning to take proper effect now. [Interjections.] The difficulty with the hon. member near me here who is making such a fuss is that he can spell the word &#x201C;banana&#x201D; but does not know when to stop. I want to start off by quoting from a newspaper article, and then it will be interesting to note the date. But let us first take a look at what the article says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_5347-5348" refersTo="page_1137"/>A number of United Party M.P.s are going to Parliament this session determined to settle once and for all the question of the Party&#x2019;s colour policy. Although all members of the Party accept the broad programme of principles, there is a noticeable difference in the way it is interpreted&#x2014;and put over in public&#x2014; by members of the two main schools of thought. The so-called liberal group, which draws most of its support from the Rand and the Western Cape, believes that the Opposition should take a firmer stand against the Government and interpret the Party&#x2019;s colour policy in a much more progressive manner. The conservatives complain that they suffered during the general election when platteland audiences asked them to explain statements in the cities by members of the liberal group.</block>

<p>He is one of their kindred spirits. The interesting thing about this is the following. What was said of this party in 1959, is more true than ever today. After all, they say, &#x201C;We have a horse for every course and a course for every horse.&#x201D; An old gentleman told me outside this House the other day that he was inclined to believe that the United Party had a &#x201C;horse for every course&#x201D;, but that he would like to know when they were going to withdraw the donkeys from the course. The hon. member for Durban Point was very sporting the other day. The National Party was supposed to have formed a scrum and then he had all kinds of jokes about &#x201C;Haak-Haak&#x201D; when the ball was put in, etc. But there is something he does not realize. Imagine if one had to choose a rugby team from their ranks. One would not know whether to laugh or to cry about this spectacle. One would probably have to start off with the scrum, but in a scrum one needs two props and usually they must have some backbone. Therefore one cannot choose anyone on that side for those positions. That is out of the question. Secondly, there is the position of hooker. Where is one going to find one&#x003F; Because they can only kick and bite&#x2014;they cannot hook. But the most interesting thought is that if such a United Party rugby team has to go on to the field and they are awarded a penalty kick out of compassion&#x2014;for a referee is human too&#x2014; just think what is going to happen. They are so used to kicking left and right at the same time that they will kick the ball with both feet at the same time. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Hillbrow is very talkative. He reminds me of the English rhyme we learned at school&#x2014;</p>

<p>He came to the House last week and said that it should be noted that the United Party does not come to the people of South Africa with a slogan or with a warcry. This is the statement thrown at the National Party from his side. But what did they come forward with&#x003F; &#x201C;You name it, we have got it.&#x201D; To which may be added. &#x201C;And now we have had it.&#x201D; That is the kind of slogan with which they came to the public of South Africa. He is the Black-danger man. He sees dangers in everything. In the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 30th January, 1972, there was an amusing headline. &#x201C;Dr. Jacobs has done it again&#x201D;, and then the report went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I grieve to say that Dr. Gideon Jacobs, United Party M.P. for Hillbrow, has done it again. Last year, you might recall, the <i>Sunday Times</i> found cause to rap Dr. Jacobs over the knuckles for certain &#x201C;swart gevaar&#x201D; remarks he had made about the Bantustan leaders.</block>

<p>Their big problem is that everything is a danger to them; it is the red danger, the black danger and all sorts of dangers. But on this planet in 1972 it goes without saying that a state, a government or a country is surrounded by dangers. Modern technology has made this planet smaller, in the metaphorical sense. Where can one live or go on this planet today without there being any danger&#x003F; Dangers there are but they can be faced by means of sound principles. Surely a principle which is difficult to implement is not less sound because it is difficult to implement, and that is what they do not appreciate. They tell us they will join us in defending the country and <span class="col_5349-5350" refersTo="page_1138"/>we accept that. They are concerned that some of these Bantu states may possibly turn communist. They are concerned about a whole series of things, but what they lose sight of completely is that the biggest danger to South Africa is contained in the very essence of their policy. That is where the biggest danger to South Africa lies, and we get no reply to that. The hon. member for Wolmaransstad asked for replies in respect of the practical implementation of that policy. We are still waiting for them. One can enlarge upon that. Imagine the policy of the eight, the six and the two &#x2014;I suppose one sometimes has to imagine the impossible for the purposes of one&#x2019;s argument. Imagine for the sake of argument that the Bantu, Indian and Coloured representatives are in this House now in terms of the U.P. recipe. Just think of the one aspect of the numerical rates. Do not think only of the question of the White-Black confrontation. It goes further than that. If, according to their arbitrary allotment of representatives, the number of Coloureds is to be exactly the same as the number of Bantu, then, according to that dispensation, the Coloured people would have to have 45 representatives here. In other words, the Bantu representatives would ask: &#x201C;What is wrong with us; are we so bad that we are so much worse off than you are&#x003F; We get eight representatives, but on the basis of the numerical strength of the Coloured people there should be 45 of us here.&#x201D; If one makes a population projection for the future and accepts that there will be approximately 32 million Bantu, consisting of the various Bantu peoples, in South Africa by the end of the century, will they still have eight representatives here then&#x003F; These are the cardinal facts to which the United Party simply must reply. They refuse to believe and to see that man is bound to a group and that the individual&#x2014;reference was made here, <i>inter alia</i> by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, to more freedom for the individual&#x2014;can ultimately realize his fullest rights and freedom only within his national and group context. Man in general cannot orbit in space like a meteorite; he realizes himself, culturally and otherwise, within his national context.</p>

<p>With reference to this I should like to refer to the conclusions reached by a gentleman by the name of Michael Wright, a graduate of Oxford, who went to the Evelyn Hone College of Further Education in Lusaka, Zambia, as a lecturer. Recently, when he could stand it no longer, he left that country. With reference to the people who attach no value to the significance of the differences among peoples and ethnic groups and who pay no regard to the organic life of the group, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They deny to individuals fulfilment through their own separate communities. Denial of the existence of these separate communities leads to conflict and struggle as different groups war to preserve themselves. No group can see the denial of its own separate existence as valid in itself. It sees the denial only as the attemp by another group to destroy it.</block>

<p>Then he comes to the big question and says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">How can there be uniform community development when there is no uniform community&#x003F; Should we not rewrite the ideals of democracy for the individual in terms of a free recognition of each inividual&#x2019;s communal affiliations&#x003F;</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Wonderboom tried to make a speech here this evening, but I think he used his entire ten minutes in quoting from different newspaper cuttings. Then he spoke about rugby. As I am concerned with a different sport, I think I will leave the matter there and not reply to the talk he gave us here on rugby.</p>

<p>It has been very, very noticeable indeed during this debate that, after my hon. Leader made some very pertinent references to the problem of the urban Bantu in South Africa, not a single speaker on the other side of the House up till now has referred to the urban Bantu. This is easy to understand because. I believe, that never in the history of the Nationalist Party has there been more uncertainty and confusion in regard to the future of the urban Bantu than there is today. With the year 1978 just around the corner, that wonderful year when by a miracle the ever-increasing flow of the Bantu into the urban areas will be reversed, and with the chances of the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s pipe-dreams as remote as ever, we find of course that today many Nationalists are reluctantly agreeing that the Bantu in the urban area is a very integral <span class="col_5351-5352" refersTo="page_1139"/>part of our economy and that, as such, he should be recognized as a permanent citizen of South Africa. Unfortunately for South Africa, there is no doubt that the current concept of separate development, as seen through the eyes of the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, is still the idyllic one of a number of separate nations, White and Black, with clear and neat geographic boundaries, in other words, as independent sovereignties with all the trappings that go with any state. It is also perfectly obvious that the hon. the Prime Minister is still so enamoured of this concept of separate development, because he believes that South Africa has a lesson for the world in this respect, namely a lesson of how people of different languages, cultures and colour can live together in peace and harmony in one country. So certain is the hon. the Prime Minister of the eventual success of this policy of separate development that he even envisages the day when people will come from afar to watch the workings of separate development at first hand. I agree that separate development for the hon. the Prime Minister and his Government is indeed a wonderful concept, not that it will change a single fact of life in South Africa, and not because it has the remotest possibility of succeeding, but as a wonderful concept because it provides the hon. the Prime Minister and his Government with a rationalization for treating millions of Bantu who work and live permanently in the urban areas as aliens without citizenship rights and to expose them to all the irritations and restrictions of apartheid.</p>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>I will tell you. Sir. I want to say that for the hon. the Prime Minister separate development may be a very wonderful and noble thing, but for the millions of Bantu who live and work in South Africa and who are making a vital contribution to the economic progress and the safety of South Africa, this noble thing has a very false and hollow ring. I et us make no mistake about this. For the Bantu who are living and working in the urban area, separate development means just one thing, namely, apartheid in perpetuity which in turn means segregation without equal facilities, a fugitive fly-by-night existence for many, lack of job opportunities, passes and constant surveillance by the Police, and political impotence. There are a host of other irritations, far too many to mention, and which are part and parcel of this policy of separate development. I want to put a question to the hon. the Prime Minister: Does the hon. the Prime Minister really believe that the millions of Bantu living and working permanently in South Africa and who are kept here because of the policy of separate development physically while they are politically expected to be somewhere else, will abandon lightly their social and political aspirations in the country in which they live and work permanently&#x003F; Surely the hon. the Prime Minister must know that these people will still want political and social rights in the country which they serve with their presence and their labour. I want to say this to the hon. the Prime Minister : Does he really realize the degree of bitterness that is building up in the minds of the urban Bantu because of the effect that separate development has upon them&#x003F; There are many reasons for this feeling. I would say that the one that stands out above all of them is the feeling of insecurity and frustration. The Bantu in the urban areas is not allowed to own land. Yet his homeland, hopelessly under-developed, offers no compensatory rights to him. The result is that the urban Bantu is hopelessly suspended between two worlds, with his only security a piece of paper that can be removed for any mumber of reasons. To put it bluntly, certificates of citizenship mean nothing and solve nothing, because you cannot expect the Bantu who lives and works in White South Africa to be overjoyed at having to carry a certificate of citizenship of some homeland which he in all probability has never seen or never will see. I believe that for the past 25 years the Nationalist Party has been so busy trying to defend and justify the policy of separate development, that they have not &#x2026; [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#palm">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. D. PALM</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have only seven minutes at my disposal, and I should like to deal with one matter which has already been mentioned many times today, i.e. the federation policy of the United Party. I have tried to glean historically what the term &#x201C;federation&#x201D; embraces, and what lessons we can learn from the past with respect to such a policy. I read that Federalism has one of two objectives: The first objective can be to create a political <span class="col_5353-5354" refersTo="page_1140"/>situation from which there can develop, in the course of time, one nation built up of the various component parts. This happened in America, Germany, Italy and also in other countries. There is also a second type of federation which tries to string together various national groups in one political homeland. The first group of attempts at federation all succeeded, and the second group all failed. My question now is which of these two federation attempts the United Party envisages. I think it envisages not the first kind, but in fact the second. But all attempts at bringing about this second type of federation failed. There are eight reasons why these attempts at federation failed. I should like to mention them in the few minutes at my disposal.</p>

<p>The federation attempts I am speaking about were tried on three occasions in Africa, and also in Indonesia. As a result of these eight reasons or requirements, those four attempts at federation failed. Therefore I also want to add that I believe that this federation plan, which the United Party speaks about, will not succeed either. The first requirement laid down by all the national groups was that each component pant must be granted equal opportunities in respect of decisions and the determining of policy; in other words, they all wanted to be equal partners. The second requirement that was laid down was that there must be joint loyalty in respect of their history, their language, tradition and nationalism. The third requirement for success was that in none of these component parts should there be a striving towards individual independence. The fourth reason, and this is very important, why the attempts failed, was because people said that the White minority group in this federation plan was a minority group that wanted to give permanence to its own leadership. A fifth factor that contributed to the failure of those four attempts at federation was the requirement laid down that all individuals of those various component parts of the federation must have complete freedom of movement and complete freedom in respect of labour negotiation. A sixth causative factor in the failure of this federation attempt, which I have mentioned, was that there was too great a numerical disproportion in population between the various component entities and also too great a difference in the level of development between them. I have two names I should like to mention to hon. members. The first is that of the Chief Justice of the Rhodesian Federation, Sir Robert Tredgold, and the second is that of the Attorney-General of Senegal, Monsieur d&#x2019;Arboussier. These two people, together with several others&#x2014;and they were all involved in some of these federation attempts &#x2014;said that their experience in connection with why the federation attempts failed was, and I quote :</p>

<block name="quote">If the component units show too great a disproportion in population or in development, then association in such circumstances would evidently be tantamount to authorizing a hegemony of the strongest unit over the others.</block>

<p>Then I should like to mention the following. This is very important, as far as I am concerned, because the hon. the Leader of the Opposition speaks continually of &#x201C;communal rights&#x201D;. A seventh reason why those federations attempts failed was because, as the people I have just quoted also said:</p>

<block name="quote">In any federation there must be total integration and recognition of the equal status of each citizen. There must be no question of minority or communal rights.</block>

<p>The final reason for the failure of these four federally-orientated attempts, which I have mentioned, was because all the non-Whites in all the four cases said: &#x201C;Federation&#x003F; Fine, but give us a Black Prime Minister&#x201D;. What was the result&#x003F; The federation attempts in these four areas, i.e. Central Africa, East Africa, West Africa and Indonesia, failed. The eventual outcome was that this same Rhodesian Chief Justice, Sir Robert Tredgold, said that the 64 000 dollar question that cropped up for them in the course of time, after the attempt at federation, was &#x201C;How to unscramble federation&#x201D;, because it appeared to be a complete failure. I am sorry, I had to sketch this very rapidly, because my time was very limited.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the time allotted for this debate has almost expired. I therefore want to reply to the few matters still outstanding. Before doing so I do just want to refer to another matter. If one considers what may be discussed under a Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote and <span class="col_5355-5356" refersTo="page_1141"/>what is normally discussed under a Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote, if I consider that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has the benefit of two half-hours and that he has as much additional time at his disposal within the fixed period as he wishes, and if I consider what matters he raised here, I cannot but regard it as a special compliment under the circumstances. Then I must regard my handling of all the matters which are normally raised under this Vote, and which were very carefully avoided, as being irreproachable and insusceptible to criticism. Sir, if there was criticism to be levelled at it, the Opposition has been disgracefully neglectful of its duty in not bringing it to the attention of the House.</p>

<p>But before I reply to those matters still outstanding, and because the Leader of the Opposition has another opportunity to speak after me. I want to ask him to clarify two matters which have for a very long time been waiting to be clarified, questions which have from time to time been put to him. The Leader of the Opposition has told us once again now that his policy comprises three stages. The one will to a certain extent overlap the next. The first stage is the revision of the legislation passed by this Government and which they do not like. At the beginning of every session private members have ample opportunity. I want to give the Leader of the Opposition this suggestion to reflect on for next year: Why should we simply leave these matters hanging in the air&#x003F; Why not instruct or ask his members to put to us those things they would like to have revised&#x003F; They can do so by way of motions; they can do so by way of the other machinery established for that purpose by the House. Then we will not have to guess. Then it will not be necessary for these things to be stated in vague terms. Then we will have something tangible in front of us.</p>

<p>But the hon. the Leader of the Opposition also speaks very vaguely about the &#x201C;third stage&#x201D; about which he will negotiate during the second stage, and that is the stage which will actually bring us to the federation. Now, it goes without saying that in any country in which the current system is a federal one, and in which to a greater or lesser extent there are sub-autonomous bodies in the provinces or regions, there has to be an allocation of power between the federation on the one hand and the provinces or other bodies on the other. I have been hearing about this federation from the hon. member for many years, but I have never yet heard him making any attempt to say what powers will be delegated to the federation. After all, one cannot play around with the idea of a federation for such a long time without having it clear in one&#x2019;s mind what the powers are which that federation should have. Not only the non-Whites, but also the Whites of South Africa would be particularly interested to know what powers that eventual federal government would have. What power would it have in its hands to decide on the fate of <i>inter alia</i> the Whites&#x003F; But what is even more important than this power aspect&#x2014; and in this respect we have not yet heard anything from the hon. the Leader either &#x2014;is what he has in mind in regard to the composition of that federation. According to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition there has to be an overall federal Parliament. We have now heard that in the interim stage the usual Whites, who are now sitting here, will still be sitting here, plus the 16 non-White representatives. But the prospect of an overall Parliament is being held out to us, and I should like to know from him&#x2014;I think he owes this House a reply&#x2014;what the racial composition of that race federation will be. To how many White representatives will the Whites be entitled; to how many representatives will the Coloured people be entitled, and to how many representatives will the Bantu and the Indians be entitled&#x003F; For this will be the super-Parliament which will have the final say over everyone. This will be the super-Parliament which will have the greatest authority and the greatest power. I do not think the hon. the Leader of the Opposition should allow us to remain in the dark any longer in respect of this fundamentally important matter. I should very much like to hear what he has to say in that regard.</p>

<p>Sir, I notice here, according to my notes, that the hon. member for Hillbrow once again levelled the approach that our school system is what it is. When he spoke about national unity he once again levelled this reproach at us. I now want to tell him once again&#x2014;and I want to say this to him with particular reference to the candidate in Brakpan&#x2014;that it surprises me how frequently leaders of the United Party voice opinions in regard to this matter and how piously they discuss it, but when one comes to deeds, one finds exactly the opposite. <span class="col_5357-5358" refersTo="page_1142"/>Recently we heard the same story again from the United Party candidate in Brakpan. It so happens that Brakpan is a town which I know very well, and happen to know that there is a parallel-medium school in Brakpan for those parents who want their children, Afrikaans and English speaking, to attend school together. I would have expected the United Party candidate, who, together with the hon. member for Hillbrow, advocates parallel-medium schools so earnestly, to have sent his child to that school, but one does not find that happening. He boasts of being a super-Afrikaans-speaking person, but his child is attending an English medium school, not even a parallel-medium school. He has every right to send his child to whichever school he wishes, and I am saying nothing about that, but, Sir, why should we profess to advocate parallel-medium schools and charge the Government with not seeing to this matter, although it does do so, and then refrain from sending our children to those parallel-medium schools&#x003F; It so happens that I know what I am talking about here. When I was living in Brakpan my eldest child attended a parallel-medium school. Do you know, Sir, that that school subsequently became a single-medium school because the English-speaking parents took their children out of that school and sent them to single-medium English schools&#x003F; In my own constituency, Nigel, there was for many years a parallel-medium high school for English and Afrikaans speaking children, and the English parents&#x2014;and they have every right to do so and I am in no way condemning their doing so&#x2014;came to my provincial councillor and to me and said, &#x201C;We want you please to make arrangements with the province so that we may have our own single-medium English school.&#x201D; I expressed their wishes. We submitted their case to the provincial authorities and today, at their request, there are two schools in Nigel&#x2014; a single-medium Afrikaans school and a single-medium English high school. Why do we profess one thing and then do something else&#x003F; I have an intimate knowledge of the Transvaal, and I can state that there are hundreds of parallel-medium schools which are indicated on the books as being parallel-medium schools. [Interjections.] No, these are not merely little farm schools; these are high schools and big schools which are indicated on the books as parallel-medium schools, but are in fact Afrikaans-medium schools because the English parents prefer to send their children to English-medium schools. That is, after all, the practice. Why do we profess something we know our people do not want&#x003F; Surely we achieve nothing whatsoever by doing that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Johannesburg-North discussed the matter of the urban Bantu with me. I just want to tell him that during the past recess I went out of my way to attend conferences with the urban Bantu, where they stated their needs and problems very candidly.</p>

He then raised the question of those people who do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Government.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>In the one case wages are negotiated, and in the other cases minimum wages are determined by independent boards and the employer. The employer can do one of two things now. He can pay only the negotiated wage, or only the minimum wage, or he can pay his employee more, according to what he is worth to him. That is all he can do. Must I now say to the employer, and how is one going to do this now, that what he is paying the employee&#x2014;which in most cases, if not in all, is more than the minimum wage&#x2014;is not enough and that he must pay his employees more than that, and that he must pay his Bantu in particular more, so that they receive more or less the same wages as the Whites&#x003F; Surely it goes without saying that Whites are receiving more than the negotiated wage today, firstly because they are worth more to the employer, and secondly, because there is a scarcity factor as far as they are concerned.</p>

<p>Yes, but I do not know what story the hon. member heard in this connection.

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is interesting to note that the hon. the Prime Minister is worried about certain subjects we did not raise under his Vote, but let me give him the assurance that we have several rods in pickle for his Ministers which will be discussed during the course of this session.</p>

<p>The Prime Miniter set out by asking me two questions and he suggested that I should arrange with members to deal by way of private motions and private Bills with those sorts of amendments we should like to see to legislation which is on the Statute Books. One can just see the hon. the Leader of the House giving time for a discussion of those old battles we have had in the past over section 6 of the Terrorism Act, over the unlimited powers without recourse to the courts given to Ministers in <span class="col_5363-5364" refersTo="page_1145"/>certain legislation, over the autonomy of the universities, over job reservation and a large number of other Acts! The hon. the Prime Minister has heard these set out before and so have members on the other side of the House.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, the hon. gentleman wished to know from me what the position will be at the third stage of the United Party&#x2019;s race federation plan and what the allocation of powers will be between the Federal Government and its components. He has also wished to know what the representation will be in that federal parliament. I should have thought that I had made it very clear that in the second stage we create the machinery for consultation. Does he want me to anticipate the result of the consultation before consultation takes place&#x003F;</p>

<p>I want to know what your ideas are.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>SIR <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. gentleman wants to know what my ideas are. That is perfectly fair. A central parliament in which White leadership will be accepted and entrenched, a central parliament in which there will be defined representation for the various groups, which will not have regard to numbers, a federal constitution with entrenchments for the rights of various groups, individuals and perhaps geographical areas. The hon. gentleman is, of course, entitled to ask for any details he likes. He need not think that I am going to be led into those traps.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>What will be the composition of the Federal Parliament&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>SIR <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>That, Sir, will be decided as a result of consultation, but those will be the three characteristics of that parliament. Before it is put into operation, it will be submitted to the White electorate by way of a referendum. Even the hon. the Minister of Transport will probably be able to vote.</p>

<p>The hon. gentleman has obviously asked these questions because he wants to run away from a comparison between his policy and our policy in respect of the future of the White man and the future of this Republic in South Africa and its safety. The danger that he points to all the time, is the danger of 16 representatives in this House holding the balance of power and preventing a Nationalist Government from getting into power again. First of all, that shows a complete lack of confidence in his own policies or the possibility that they will ever attract support from non-Whites in South Africa, and&#x2014;something much more serious&#x2014;it shows a lack of confidence that the electorate will never by way of a referendum allow us to take a step here in South Africa which will mean the end of the White race or the end of proper constitutional government and law and order in South Africa. Sir, if you want to look at a policy that really brings danger into the centre of South Africa, a policy that can undermine law and order, and the future of civilized living here in South Africa, look at the policy of the Nationalist Party. Look at the independent states that can come under communist influence. Look at the sort of situation you can end up with if you have Peking, not in Zambia, but in Zululand; if you have your Russian communist influence not in Botswana, but in the Transkei. What does the hon. gentleman think he is doing, taking risks of this kind with the future of South Africa&#x003F; The only thing that really worries hon. gentlemen on that side of the House is not the future of Western civilization here, it is not the future of the White race, it is not civilized government here and the maintenance of law and order, the only thing that worries them is that they believe that there will be less chance for the Nationalist Party to get back into power and stay in power. I do not blame them having those worries after their record since they came into power. Look at what they did to ensure that they could stay in power over the years by removing the rights of other people one by one from this Parliament always with the excuse that it was going to be a White Parliament which was going to protect the interests of civilized government in South Africa. It is just this Parliament that is creating the greatest dangers with which South Africa has ever been faced.</p>

<p>I want to go on, because I am by no means satisfied with the replies of the hon. gentleman in respect of the urban Bantu. I believe that this is the flashpoint in South Africa today. As the hon. gentleman knows, we have been trying for several sessions to bring this matter to a discussion with the relevant Ministers, and they have always postponed it for another time. They always deal with something else. Never do <span class="col_5365-5366" refersTo="page_1146"/>we get down to the real centre of the thing &#x2026;</p>

<p>We never get down to the real guts of the debate which is the dangers of the position of the urban Bantu under the policy of this Government at the present time.</p>

<p>Nor have we had any satisfactory reply from the hon. the Prime Minister on the question of the Coloured people in South Africa. Are we really going forward again, for another year, on the sort of basis that the Coloureds have a semi-representative council with no say in the Government which controls their destiny, with no proper planning done for their training to increase their productivity and with no socio-economic schemes of upliftment&#x003F; Can we really go ahead in this way&#x003F; Has the time not come for the hon. gentlemen to look reality in the face once more and to realize that the one thing which will protect us against Communist propaganda in this country is rising living standards, living standards that rise faster in South Africa than in other parts of the world&#x003F; What plans are there really for the training of Whites and non-Whites; for Whites to take a bigger responsibility and for the non-Whites to take their place&#x003F; We have heard a little talk about training of Bantu in the homelands to do certain work which apparently they are only going to do in the homelands, but we are sitting with a labour force that needs training now. We are sitting with a shortage of skilled labour in South Africa at the present time. Our rate of growth is falling behind the growth rate of the countries of the Western World. There is a backlog in living standards. Instead of our catching up and moving forward as a young country should be doing, we are falling further behind because of the lack of foresight, because of the prejudice and because of the inability which this Government is evincing at the present time to face up to the problems of this country. We have raised this question of the wage gap and pointed to the difficulties. What do we hear&#x003F; We hear a lot of technical stuff, about Wage Boards and about industrial conciliation agreements. That is not the answer. The answer is : What example is the Government going to set to the private industrialists throughout South Africa to close that gap&#x003F; What did we get from the Government&#x003F; The gap is bigger than it was when they took over 24 years ago. It has become bigger and bigger and that is why we ask these questions. We ask them in the interests of South Africa because we want satisfied workers, workers who are proof against Communist propaganda and workers who are going to maintain civilized government here in South Africa.</p>
