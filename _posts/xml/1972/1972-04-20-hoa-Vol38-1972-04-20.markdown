<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I will not ask for the half-hour because there <span class="col_5367-5368" refersTo="page_1147"/>are many members on this side of the House who would like to participate in the debate. There are a few things that I would take up with the Deputy Minister.</p>

<p>First of all I want to put on record that there are considerable differences between the two parties on transport policy for South Africa. I do not wish to debate or enumerate those differences today. They are known, and our point of view is represented by the majority report of the Marais Commission. We accept all of those findings and they will be part of the programme of action which the United Party will adopt when they come into power. When I put that on record, I want to mention specifically that one of the recommendations of the Marais Commission was that action should be taken in order to overcome the congestion of traffic in our urban areas. Some of our cities are being snarled up and throttled by the tremendous growth of motor vehicular traffic in their industrial life, especially towards and in the centre of the city. During the Railway debate, the hon. the Minister made the point that he felt that the solution of the problems of our greater cities would be in underground railways. Therefore I should like to know what the policy of the Department of Transport would be if our greater cities, one or more of them, wanted to build an underground railway to ease this congestion. Would the department be willing to negotiate and give financial assistance&#x003F; Obviously in the case of an established city, the building of an underground railway will be a matter of tremendous expense. I will not take it further except to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister to state the policy of the department towards assisting in the financing of an underground railway or other measures that may be necessary to relieve the traffic congestion in our big cities.</p>

<p>Then I want to ask just one or two questions about road safety. We have had debates and Bills about road safety during this session of Parliament. I will therefore not go into detail. I think one of the major difficulties which any campaign against road accidents must deal with, is the failure on the part of the motorist and the pedestrian to appreciate the danger that exists for himself. Somebody has said that until the imagination of the people catches up with the deaths on the road, it will be very difficult to apply road safety measures efficiently. I therefore wish to ask the hon. the Minister whether part of the road safety campaign in South Africa will be, more than before, a campaign of education. In that connection I would like to know whether it would not be advisable to publish statistics of the consequences of road accidents in greater detail. We do get statistically an account of the number of deaths on the roads and of the number of people injured. I think more details should be given of the extent and the nature of the injuries. I think the public should be made aware of the people in South Africa who go around without eyes, arms and legs as the result of motor accidents.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I think so, Sir. I have got a point there because I believe that it is necessary that the imagination of the people should catch up with the deaths on the road. It is for that reason that I mention this. According to experts, one of the major causes of road accidents today is the lack of communication between driver and driver. The driver in a motorcar is isolated from his fellow-users of the road. He does not understand what the man intends, what he does or what he has observed. As a result of ignorance resentments grow up, wrong attitudes develop, courtesy suffers and accidents become more likely.</p>

<p>Then I wonder whether the department will be interested if it could adopt some device that will make known better than the present electronic and electrical devices, what the intentions and the thinking of motorists are. There are inventions available that I would like to tell the department about. I have no interest in them. By means of these inventions motorists can perceive how another driver reacts for example to road signs, danger signs and things like that. These are very simple and cheap instruments. I take it that the Road Safety Council and other agencies with which the Department of Transport has contact, would be interested in conducting a research campaign into the possibility of making communication between motorist and motorist actually using the road and understanding each other&#x2019;s plans and reactions. If these things are more readily available to one another, I think the department would be interested in conducting a research. I do not think one can say more than that at this moment.</p>

<p>Then I would like to know from the hon. the Deputy Minister what is happening <span class="col_5369-5370" refersTo="page_1148"/>to Jam Smuts airport. Could we have the progress report in respect of Jan Smuts airport&#x003F; When is it expected to be completed and when can we expect the teething troubles which it is experiencing at the moment, to end&#x003F; I think, for example, of the tremendous delays which very often occur in delivering luggage to passengers. I had that experience myself and passengers often have to wait longer than it takes to fly from Durban to Johannesburg for the receipt of their luggage at Jan Smuts airport. A similar difficulty does not seem to exist with the new development at the D.F. Malan airport. There the delivery of luggage is remarkably efficient. I have not experienced anything like it except at a few of the other aerodromes in the world that I have been to. Of course D.F. Malan is not yet a fully-fledged international aerodrome and its difficulties are fewer.</p>

<p>In regard to Jan Smuts, are you referring to the international or domestic section&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>To both. It has happened on the international section that passengers arrive there while there is no staff to receive them. That is probably something which has happened more than once. It is a Customs responsibility and apparently not that of the Minister. I have seen people wait there for half an hour before the Customs people come on duty. I am not being unduly critical of this. I am not trying to get any joy out of this. It is a question of teething troubles but I think the travelling public would like to be reassured.</p>

<p>There is one grievance at Jan Smuts aerodrome that I think the department should know about, and that is the new parking garages and the tariffs charged. There is tremendous resentment. Private enterprise had a garage there and you could park there for R1 a day. I am not quite sure what the tariff is but it comes to about R2 a day, more than double the amount charged by private enterprise. The businessman feels this. He goes to the airport, which has to be some distance from the city, in order to support the South African Airways; to avail himself of the facilities and to be a customer of the South African Airways, and he feels that he is being fleeced if he is charged at this rate for parking his motor-car while he is using the services of the South African Airways I want to suggest that the hon. the Minister should consider the suggestion that where a person has a ticket, especially a short ticket to fly to, say, Cape Town in the morning and back in the evening, he should be given some reduction in the charges for parking. I think that is a fair suggestion and I hope that the hon. the Minister will consider it.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, I want to ask the hon. the Minister, who is responsible for the transport of the nation and the co-ordination of the various means of transport, to indicate to us what the attitude of the Government is to the motorist of South Africa. Does the Government regard the motor-car as necessary for transport in South Africa&#x003F; With all the problems that the motor-car creates, it plays the most important part in the social, industrial, commercial and agricultural activities of the country. It is a vital link between the producer and the consumer. Our transport could not function in South Africa today without good roads and without vehicles. There are a great many motorists in South Africa, remarkably many considering our population and the income of our population. In June, 1961, we had a total of 1 081 000 motor vehicles in South Africa; by June, 1970, that number had risen to 2 247 000. Private motor-cars alone over the same period increased from just under 800 000 to 1 654 000 in 1970, an annual increase in each case over the past 12 years of 12 per cent, which is quite remarkable. It is something of which South Africa should be proud, because it is an indication of the standards that we have achieved in this country. If you take our total population, Sir, there is one motor vehicle for every 13 of our people. If you could take Whites alone&#x2014;this could only be a calculation&#x2014;I think you would find that there is about one motor vehicle for every two White people in South Africa, a ratio that can only be compared with the ratio in the United States of America. The ratio here is higher than in any country in Europe with which I have been able to compare the figures. This industry directly, through its motor assembly plants and its servicing plants, employs 160 000 people earning R200 million a year, and if one includes all the associated industries, one finds that the motoring industry employs 2 million people, 9 per cent of our population. I want to know what the attitude is of the Government to the people who do this for South Africa. [Time expired.]</p>

<from><span class="col_5371-5372" refersTo="page_1149"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville raised a few matters here with the hon. the Deputy Minister. One of those matters concerned what the Minister&#x2019;s attitude would be if one of the local authorities decided to give serious thought to constructing a tube railway line. Sir, today there is, in fact, not a city in South Africa that can afford or justify such a tube railway line for the number of urban inhabitants. [Interjection.] That is my view; the hon. the Minister may say what he thinks about that. I think that investigations have already been instituted in that connection. Our urban populations are still altogether too small for such an undertaking in South Africa. The only city that can perhaps be considered in future, in that connection, is Johannesburg, but the general opinion overseas, and the impression with which our people who investigated this matter overseas, returned to South Africa, is that if a city&#x2019;s population is less than five million it is uneconomic and unjustified to construct a tube railway line. The hon. the Minister may, however, give his own view in that connection. There are, of course, aspects that must be borne in mind with a view to the future. In Johannesburg I think that one should be planning such routes, even at this stage, and be thinking about that with a view to the future.</p>

<p>The hon. member said something here about road safety and our approach to it. I do not have much to say about that. All I want to say is that I do not believe we shall be able to do much to reduce the death rate on our roads until such time as we have much better control on our roads. Sir, I know there are people who will be harshly critical of what I am going to say now, but I do not think that with our present control set-up on our roads we can ever achieve anything in this connection. There is also a great deal of criticism about the way in which control is exercised on our roads today. As far as this matter is concerned, I think we can only make progress if we go to the root of the trouble. I think we can only make progress if there is one central authority which takes over the control on our roads. I think the Department of Transport must do this. There will be a row about that. There will again be people who say that we are depriving other bodies of their rights, but in this connection the decisive question is what is in the national interest. I say today that it is in the national interest that control on our roads be taken over by one central authority.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member spoke about our airports. That is an interesting subject, Sir. I sometimes wonder what goes on in the back of the minds of people moving about in our airports, people who are frequently critical because they sometimes find they are not treated as smoothly as they expected. I wonder whether those people have ever asked themselves what problems and tasks are involved in the handling of the mass of people and freight at our airports. Great expense is now being incurred at two of our most important airports, i.e. Jan Smuts and D. F. Malan. At the moment there is also a programme in operation at Johannesburg which will eventually cost South Africa R49 million. At our various airports in the next five years, apparently no less than R60 million will have to be spent to create the necessary facilities to be able to carry the increasing traffic on our airports. I think it is a good opportunity today to sketch a picture for hon. members of the activities at our airports, and to compare the present position with what it was about 10 years ago. I cannot go into all the aspects, but I just want to tell hon. members that in 1959-&#x2019;60 only about 146 000 international passengers were handled on our State airports.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am now speaking about passengers. There were 146 000 international passengers. Sir, 10 years after that, in 1969-&#x2019;70, the number had increased almost fivefold to 674 000. There was an increase of 16,5 per cent per year, on the average, as against the world figure of 12,5 per cent. On our domestic routes the number of passengers increased from 580 000 ten years ago, in 1959-&#x2019;60, to 2 389 000 in 1969-70, an increase of almost 400 per cent in a decade, or an average of 15,5 per cent per year, as compared with an average of 10 per cent in world air traffic. When we come to air freight, we find that in 1959-&#x2019;60 7&#x00BD; million kg were handled on our airports, while in 1969-70 49&#x00BD; million kg were handled, ie., seven times as much freight as a decade ago. Sir, if we suppose that over the next 10 years our domestic passengers will increase in number by an average of 16 per cent; that our international traffic will increase, by an average <span class="col_5373-5374" refersTo="page_1150"/>of 18 per cent per year and that the airfreight will increase by an average of 20 per cent per year, then it is calculated that in 1979-&#x2019;80 our airports will handle no less than 3&#x00BC; million international passengers and 12&#x00BD; million local passengers. Jointly this is no less than 15,75 million passengers on our airports, and they will have to handle no less than 300 million kilos of freight.</p>

<p>I say that if one takes these aspects into consideration, one gains a slightly different view of the activities on our airports and one gains a new perspective. If one thinks of the fact that the S.A. Airways decided that they should acquire the most modern jets for the purpose of expanding our airways, and they are acquiring Boeing 747&#x2019;s, our airports must be ready to receive these new jets and the mass of passengers involved. There are also growing pains, and sometimes there is a bottleneck here and there. But when we come along with problems and are critical about what is going on at our airports, we must always bear in mind this tremendous expansion and the tremendous extent of activities taking place, and then we must also think of the terrific amount of capital we must continually invest in these airports so that they can keep pace with the growing air traffic.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned that at the moment there are gigantic development plans at each of these State airports, with no less than R49 million for Jan Smuts Airport and R5,9 million for D. F. Malan Airport. The other airport handling international traffic is the J. G. Strydom Airport. There we are now engaged in developments costing R2,9 million. It is calculated that within the next five years it will cost us a capital amount of no less than at least R60 million to keep pace with the activities of our airports. Therefore it is essential for us to look at these aspects and view in a new light the tremendous problem that arises in the handling of this increase in freight and passengers. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I crave the indulgence of the House just to complete what I was saying in regard to the problems of the motorist. I believe that the Department of Transport should be aware of the fact that the South African motorist is in a most disadvantageous position compared with motorists elsewhere in the world. I just want to mention the fact that directly or indirectly this industry gives employment to two million South Africans or 9 per cent of the population, according to a calculation made by the Automobile Association, to whom I owe most of the statistics I have quoted. It is interesting to know too, that as far as the maintenance and the repair of the motor-car in South Africa is concerned, we are probably worse off than most countries in the world. They are expensive. The cars are delivered from the assembly factories very often in poor condition, because the onus is put on the distributor to get them into final shape, and very often the distributor is not up to the standard required and the motorist suffers. When repairs have to be done, the motorist must pay high costs and get not only poor service but often also slow and tardy service, because we do not have enough motor mechanics. In the United States and Europe there is an average of one mechanic for every 50 motor-cars, but in South Africa there is one mechanic for every 96 motorcars. So one can imagine what the difference must be. If you want to buy a car in South Africa, you pay more than you pay in most other countries. Dr. Griffiths, of the University of Sussex, recently wrote a survey of the motor industry in South Africa, and I want to quote one paragraph from that very interesting document&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Car prices are higher in South Africa than in other manufacturing countries. The differential is an average of about 40 per cent but it was frequently up to 100 per cent. To take three random examples among manufacturing models, the Volkswagen Beetle is 43 per cent more expensive in South Africa than in Germany, where it is made. The Toyota Corona is more than 100 per cent more than in Japan and the Ford Capri between 25 per cent and 35 per cent more than in Britain.</block>

<p>That is what motorists have to pay. Again, it is not directly the Minister&#x2019;s responsibility, but he should know what is done to us through taxation. The South African motorist, the 2 million people who own vehicles in this country, pay R1 million a day in various forms of taxation and costs. About R350 million to R370 million it will be this year according to the Estimates. Of that Customs and Excise account for 52 per cent, registration and licence fees 19 per cent and the sales tax 13 per cent and the <span class="col_5375-5376" refersTo="page_1151"/>excessive profits made by the Railways on the transport of fuel and oil 16 per cent. Then take insurance. The hon. the Minister can be happy to think that third-party insurance in our big cities has not increased over the past ten years, a most commendable effort, but in the case of the rural areas third-party insurance has increased from 30 per cent to 47 per cent in the past 10 years. The comprehensive policy, which a sensible motorist will always have, has increased by 120 per cent to 130 per cent in the past ten years. The cost of repairs has gone up by 188 per cent over the past ten years. To pile misery upon misery, the Government has now embarked upon a policy to build in a larger local content in our motor cars in Phase III of this development which faces South Africa with a simple choice. If we want to have reasonable motoring costs in this country, this phase will have to be modified&#x2014;perhaps abandoned, but certainly modified because many people today have made heavy investments with a view to the development of the local content. If that does not happen, we face the unhappy alternative&#x2014;and the hon. the Minister of Transport should note this&#x2014;that we will have to reduce the number of models of motor-cars available in South Africa. We shall have to exclude a large number of makes from the South African market and we shall have to be satisfied, as has been proved in the case of South America, with motor-cars which are technologically and mechanically and even as far as safety measures are concerned, years behind the models produced by the mother factories in the larger countries of the world. Our small market will not justify the re-tooling that is necessary year after year to keep a motor-car model up to date. That is the unfortunate choice before South Africa. I think I have said enough to indicate that the motorist today suffers under many disadvantages. He is an easy fiscal target; he does not get in the cities the assistance to which he is entitled in order to be more mobile, because of differences of opinion between the Government and the municipalities. This is why I hope there will be an agreement as far as relief of congestion is concerned, so that so many motor-cars are not dumped into the centre of our cities every morning and taken away every evening. The motorist suffers because of the shortage of manpower; he suffers because of taxation; he is at a disadvantage in every possible way. I now want the Department of Transport; to tell South Africa what the attitude of the authorities, of the Government, is towards the motorist. Do they regard the motor-car as an evil which must be taxed and burdened and, as far as possible, pushed out of existence, or do they look upon it as a necessary economic and social amenity to which the people of South Africa are entitled&#x003F; If so, will they use what influence they can to make the life of the motorist tolerable and to achieve the greatest possible results and the greatest possible efficiency in the transport organization in South Africa&#x003F;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. F. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member must excuse me if I do not follow up on what he has just said because in the few minutes at my disposal I have another matter of fundamental importance I should like to raise here. It actually concerns the saving of lives and the prevention of the loss of life. Since the hon. the Minister of Transport is making a big contribution, under this Vote, to the prevention of the loss of life on our roads, I want to say that we are grateful for what is being done. Thousands of rand are being spent on direct contributions. For example, a contribution of R120 000 per year is being made to the Road Safety Council. A contribution of R20 000 is being made to flying clubs, etc. We are grateful for that contribution, but as far as I am concerned the question arises as to whether we can say that there is a physical saving of lives as a result of this money which is being made available to those bodies, or whether this only embodies prevention. I am actually asking that question because in another sphere lives are actually being saved in the physical sense, which is legally necessary and for which very little is being done by the department. When I say &#x201C;very little&#x201D;, let me immediately state that I am very grateful for that little which is being done, but I would very much like a great deal more to be done. The contribution being made in respect of the physical saving of lives at sea is actually minimal, and that is why the thought struck me that we should ask the State to do more. If hon. members now ask me why I am advocating such a matter, though I myself come from the interior, let me immediately say that I am doing so because I have experience of these matters. Years ago I had the privilege to lodge pleas for contributions in the provincial council so that buoys could be placed along the coast. I had the privilege, and I still do today, of being the vice-president <span class="col_5377-5378" refersTo="page_1152"/>of one of the big fishing clubs of the Western Province. For that reason I therefore had the privilege of advocating this matter in the provincial council. Even today we still get a meagre contribution from the provincial administration for maintaining the buoys that we put up with our own money. Let us come back and think of the angler himself. This is a big sport, which probably has more participants than any other sport in this country. It is an open sport for which not a single cent can be collected. One feels that something must be done, and who can do it other than the State&#x003F; The people who live here in the vicinity of the coast and furnish this service, must do everything voluntarily. If one looks at the figures of what has been done over the last few years by sea rescue, one would find that more than 50 per cent of those people, who landed up in trouble, came from the interior. Is it the sole right and the duty of our people on the coasts to also look after them alone. In the first place I want to say that we must and will look after everyone. I was a very enthusiastic angler for many years, and I myself took part in this rescue work. I have already seen young people falling into the sea and drowning and nothing could be done about it because there were no sea rescue buoys. Now we have set up buoys. I am the fortunate owner of a boat, and I too have already seen people getting into trouble at sea. I myself have helped people out of the sea, and that is why this is a sore point as far as I am concerned. For that reason I am asking the Minister and the department to do something for these people of the Sea Rescue Institute. In the past four years, since the Sea Rescue Institute of South Africa was established, no less than 400 lives have been saved. I am speaking of the saving of lives in the physical sense. One hundred and fifty boats also got into trouble at sea and were brought to safety. Do hon. members not think that those 400 human lives are worth money to us&#x003F; Hon. members will find, in most cases, that the people who go out to sea constitute South Africa&#x2019;s young manpower. They are the people who are physically healthy and who can go to the sea. They are the people who are full of life and eager for living and for the sea. If this Sea Rescue Institute were not there, there would have been 400 less people alive in South Africa. Can we afford to lose 400 people, people who are actually at the peak stage of their lives, at the stage where they can do a great deal of work and produce a great deal&#x003F; In this respect I now want to ask the State for assistance. Since the department is already giving R24 000 per year to those people, hon. members and the Minister may perhaps feel that this is a great deal of money, but I can tell them that in fact it is minimal.</p>

<p>Five years ago we began with one single boat 16 feet in length and with two engines mounted. Those engines cost R1 500 to R2 000 each and must be replaced every year. We cannot do so at present, and we therefore do it only every third year. The people who man those boats are volunteers; they do not get a single cent for that work they are doing. They take their own lives in their hands to save those of others. Is it not our duty to ensure that those people will have a little more convenience and security on those boats&#x003F; Today there are 16 stations manned by 16 boats. Because we have had this tremendous navigation round our coasts in recent times, because so many individuals land themselves in trouble on our coasts, individuals which the Sea Rescue Institute must then hasten to assist, and because we have already had to coast around for 20 hours to help the State in the search for survivors after one of their aircraft disappeared over the sea, I think the State has an obligation to make a bigger contribution to these people. Because these boats cannot go out further than 8 or ten miles, while at times rescue work must be done 20 to 30 miles out to sea, the Institute has decided to acquire larger boats. This year two boats are being built for the Institute. These boats cost R35 000 each and have a range of 200 miles instead of 10 miles, as in the case of the small boats. Because we cannot obtain a subsidy on the outboard engines, it has now been decided to purchase larger diesel engines on which purchase tax is not levied. We are now going to obtain these two boats which are under construction. Shelters must be built for them. That will cost about another R10 000 each. Now you will be able to see that the purchase of those two boats will cost us R100 000 this year. The State contributes the meagre amount of R24 000. Therefore I want to ask the hon. the Minister today whether he cannot help us this year by pushing up the subsidy of R24 000 to R50 000. That will then provide us with 50 per cent of the amount we need. The rest we shall have to find ourselves. In America every cent of the cost of these <span class="col_5379-5380" refersTo="page_1153"/>life-saving endeavours is carried by the State. In other countries of Europe 50 per cent of the costs are borne by the State. In South Africa at present only 25 per cent is carried by the State. We have already saved 400 lives, and therefore I ask the hon. the Minister if he would not be so kind as to help us this year. Even if the subsidy is not increased, we ask for an extra grant so that we shall be able to pay for those two boats which we must take delivery of one of these days. Thereby we shall be able to help in sea rescue, which is so essential. Now that navigation round our costs has almost quadrupled, it has become essential that rescue attempts be extended. We can only do a small portion of the work with the meagre few rand we ourselves can collect from people. I want to drop this point now by mentioning an instance where we saved three lives, i.e. those of a father and his two sons who clung to a boat for nearly 24 hours. A month after they were saved and had regained their health, we went to them to ask for a contribution. What does the House think was that man&#x2019;s contribution&#x003F; It was R5. It can now be seen what we are faced with. Who can help us other than the State&#x003F; Today I want to make an urgent appeal to the Minister to increase that subsidy to R50 000 this year so that we shall be able to buy these boats to enable us to save lives at sea.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to support the hon. member who resumed his seat a moment ago in his praise for the excellent service performed in respect of the protection of life at sea. I want to support his plea, because this service is invaluable to South Africa.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I want to proceed, firstly, to a matter which gives me serious concern. This Vote which we are debating this afternoon, dealing with the Department of Transport, should deal with the affairs of the Department of Transport over the last year and, in the normal course, should deal with the report of that department. Only after 2 o&#x2019;clock this afternoon was the annual report of the department put on our desks for the first time. I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister if he regards that as the way to treat Parliament. When we are obliged to debate a departmental Vote in which money is asked to run that department for a year, we as Parliament are entitled to have the latest information available to us. This report is dated October, 1971. It was submitted to the hon. the Minister by the department in October, 1971. It has taken from October until the 20th April, at 2.15 p.m. as the debate was starting in Parliament, for this report to be laid on the Table for the information of members. I submit that this is contempt for Parliament. It is typical of the attitude of the Government towards Parliament. It treats Parliament as a rubber stamp which must say &#x201C;yea&#x201D;, &#x201C;ja&#x201D;, &#x201C;ja baas&#x201D;, &#x201C;ngiyabonga &#x2019;Nkosi&#x201D;, &#x201C;ja en amen&#x201D; to everything which the Government does. I want to protest at this insult to the institution of Parliament and to the responsibility of Parliament. If the hon. the Minister wants to blame the Government Printer, I suggest he fights it out with the Minister of Finance, because it should not take six months to print a simple report, a report running into only 52 pages. The hon. the Minister had it in October last year. What has he been doing with it&#x003F; Has he been sitting on it like his airport terminal&#x003F; In any public company the annual reports must be before the members at least two weeks before the Annual General Meeting. If not, that board of directors would be dealt with. This board of directors, this hon. Minister, should therefore be dealt with for treating Parliament with this contempt.</p>

<p>Now I want to deal with the matter dealt with by the hon. member for Yeoville, and followed up by the hon. member for Parow, namely the question of airports. The hon. member for Parow quoted figures which I am now for the first time, after 2.15 p.m. today, able to check in the latest report. He correctly showed the vast increase in traffic through our South African airports. I find, for example, that Louis Botha airport in Durban handled 619 000 passengers, excluding transit, compared with 1,7 million at Jan Smuts, leading all other airports in South Africa. The hon. member for Parow said that we must recognize this tremendous growth in air traffic and in transit. It is true. From 1966 from under a million through Jan Smuts, the figure rose to nearly 1,8 in 1970-&#x2019;71. I do not know where the hon. member for Parow got these figures. Did he have a prior copy of this report&#x003F; It will be interesting to know.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I accept that the traffic has gone up tremendously. Then I look at the Loan Estimates for this year. Take a guess what has been voted for Louis Botha airport, which handles one-third of the traffic that Jan Smuts does, the second-highest in South Africa. There is the magnificent sum of R50 voted for Durban airport. R50 would not even be enough to sneeze with at the present cost of travelling on the Airways. Then the hon. member for Parow said that we must put up with a little bit of inconvenience. He said we must put up with inconveniences sometimes. But what sort of planning is this when Durban airport, with its growing traffic, the second-highest in South Africa, is only voted a token R50&#x003F;</p>

Despite all the assurances and the final definite statements &#x201C;This is now our final decision&#x201D;, I challenge the hon. the Deputy Minister to get up there and to say that they have finally decided on La Mercy, and to give us a date when that airport is likely to be operating. I say here, and I challenge the hon. the Minister to contradict me, that there will not be a new airport in Durban in this decade. There will not be a new usable airport in Durban in operation for at least a decade from now on, if not two decades. That being the situation, is it any wonder that we have inconvenience and shambles&#x003F; If one looks at the airport at Durban and sees the conditions under which the South African Airways staff has to operate it is an absolute disgrace. There are no facilities for the number of people.</p>

<p>Let the hon. member make his own speech. What is the trouble with this Government&#x003F; It is more interested in Oudtshoorn than in the passengers of the South African Airways. That Government is more interested in winning votes and playing politics than in running the country and looking after the needs of South Africa. That is why we have a token Vote of R50 for an airport which cannot possibly cope with the requirements. That is why the hon. member for Parow has to plead for tolerance. &#x201C;Let us put up with the mess,&#x201D; he says, because his Government is not interested in planning. It is not looking ahead. I challenged the hon. the Minister last year. I said that Jan Smuts would not be ready for the Jumbo jets. It was not ready, and it is still not ready. Not only Jan Smuts not ready, but we have gone through similar chaos here at D.F. Malan. I do not have the time to deal with it now, but the hon. the Minister knows that I asked him a question a week or two ago about arrivals at D.F. Malan. He gave me answers which were incorrect.</p>

I ask the hon. the Minister specifically, will he give an undertaking that something will be done to assist <span class="col_5383-5384" refersTo="page_1155"/>the staff who have to work at Louis Botha Airport in Durban&#x003F; Because at the moment it is in such a state that it is not only inconvenient to passengers, but it is putting an inhuman strain on the personnel who have to work there.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. VAN BREDA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is remarkable what a cloud of dust this hon. member for Durban Point has kicked up today. You saw how cantankerous he is. I do not know whether the report he complained about is the major reason for the cantankerousness he has displayed here today.</p>

<p>But daily we also have the other situation, i.e. the United Party continually attacking us about State spending, which we are supposed to curtail, etc. Consequently this report was, for a change, printed by the State Printer at a cost probably lower than if it had been tendered for. I believe the hon. the Deputy Minister will reply, giving reasons why it has only appeared today, and indicate that this is not in contempt of this House. But I should have liked to hear the hon. member for Durban Point if a report had been tabled in which there were perhaps a few mistakes in the English text; then he would again have said it is contempt of the English language to table such a report. He complains here about the information that is not at his disposal. Then he asks whether the hon. member for Parow obtained a report in advance. Today I want to tell you that the Department of Transport is probably one of the most accessible departments as far as information is concerned. The hon. member knows as well as I do that he could have obtained any information, statistical or otherwise, from the department if he had wanted to take the trouble. But no, he chose to stand round here today speaking about the airport in Durban, challenging this person and then that person. Do you know where his cantankerousness comes from&#x003F; It comes from his challenging various individuals in the lobbies the past 14 days, and he knows the hour of reckoning has drawn near.</p>

<p>In the short period left to me I should briefly like to deal with another matter. You will remember that we passed legislation this year establishing a National Road Safety Council for which every motorist must pay an extra premium of 50 cents per year. People being what they are, it is natural for the general public to expect a great many results for that 50 cents. Therefore I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister to ask that National Road Safety Council, when it comes into action, to give very urgent attention to the whole question of drivers&#x2019; licences for those driving heavy vehicles. We expect this council to reconsider the whole standard and basis relative to the issuing of heavy vehicle licences. They will definitely have to set very high standards. Statistics will probably indicate that the accidents in which heavy vehicles are involved are accompanied by an alarmingly high percentage of deaths. One is gripped emotionally and filled with horror when one reads certain reports in the Press, such as those we have again read recently. I want to refer hon. members to a report which appeared on 13th April, last week, as a result of a similar accident. A large front-page report read : &#x201C;Pregnant mother and two daughters killed in accident.&#x201D; The report reads, <i>inter alia</i> (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Last night on the national road near Phillipi this mother and her children were killed when the car hit a stationary lorry from behind.</block>

<p>In the next day&#x2019;s newspaper there was a follow-up of the report which read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A young Bantu was taken into custody by the Police after the accident. According to a Police spokesman a Bantu will appear in the magistrate&#x2019;s court on a charge of culpable homicide in connection with the incident.</block>

<p>As a result of the increase in our standard of living we hardly see any White lorry-drivers on our roads today. That this will be the case in future, to an increasing extent, is probably not ruled out either. The result is that to an ever-increasing extent we are dealing with Bantu drivers as far as these heavy vehicles are concerned. Hon. members must not misunderstand me now and think I am a racist who states that a Bantu cannot drive. However, I think it only logical that the Bantu with his particular background does not have the same traffic instinct as we do who have grown up in a car, as it were. Therefore I want to advocate today that not only the driver, but also the owner of that vehicle should be held liable in cases where negligence can be proved. This National Road Safety <span class="col_5385-5386" refersTo="page_1156"/>Council will be in a position of enforcement. Therefore I think they will be able to make out a very strong case for the principle of vicarious responsibility being implemented much more strictly by the Attorney-General in criminal cases of this nature. This is the only way we shall also be able to compel the owners of heavy vehicles to take note of the standard of the drivers of their own vehicles.</p>

<p>Then I want to make the additional allegation that a very great percentage of the accidents on our roads today are also caused indirectly by heavy vehicles. To be able to illustrate this you only had to drive the short distance between Sir Lowry Pass and Bot River during the past Easter week-end. There was an absolute crippling of traffic behind the heavy vehicles trundling up the hills. Dozens of cars were moving behind them at a snail&#x2019;s pace. This results in the drivers of those cars sometimes trying, in their frustration, to pass those heavy vehicles at the most difficult places. I am aware that a minimum speed cannot be implemented in practice. The majority of these vehicles use almost the entire roadway and never make any attempt to drive on the side of the road, even where this is made possible for them, so that the traffic can again flow normally. It struck me that vehicles of one particular furniture transport company and also of a certain petrol company were not guilty of this dangerous inconsiderateness. This proves to me that those drivers act upon instruction they receive from their employers. I therefore believe that if my hint is acceptable we will not only obtain better equipped drivers of these heavy vehicles, but also that the employers of those drivers will inevitably have to be more particular about the conduct of their drivers on the road. If we could rectify that, the 50 cent premium we have to pay annually would be fully justified.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Tygervallei made excuses for the late delivery of this report. I however should like to join the hon. member for Durban Point in saying that this report should have been in our hands already at the beginning of this session if not before. I made inquiries as to when the report would be on hand and was told that it would be available at the beginning of this week. It is very necessary for us to have this report. This is an important department and we should have this report in order to get up-to-date figures and to know what is happening in the department, otherwise it is absolutely useless. It is no good receiving this report at such a late stage as it simply becomes out of date. Although we may say that we could use it next year, it would still be out of date.</p>

<p>Well, I do not know whether that hon. member is interested in the information contained in the report. I do not know whether he has ever read the report. When the hon. member does get the time he should read it and he will find some very interesting information.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville and other hon. members have dealt with the question of road safety. The hon. member for Tygervallei also dealt with the subject. We are all &#x201C;experts&#x201D; on traffic and we do cur best to advise the authorities as to how we can overcome accidents. I am not convinced that all the fault lies with the Black drivers. I think that a lot of our drivers are at fault. I also think that a lot of us in this House at times commit offences and get away with it. The only way in which one could really watch bad driving is to have better policing methods. At the present moment, in so far as traffic control is concerned, we find that our traffic officers, especially in the rural areas, seem to use cars. Apparently motor cycles are uncomfortable. But if they were to get round on cycles and if there were more of them I think there would be a considerable drop in accidents caused by motor vehicles that are not roadworthy.</p>

<p>I should like to deal with our airports. The hon. member for Yeoville was comparing the D. F. Malan airport with the Jan Smuts airport. He said that things were very much better there. Things must really be very bad at Jan Smuts because the position at D.F. Malan leaves much to be desired. When one goes there on a Sunday afternoon when the 747 is there, and the airport is crowded, one finds absolute chaos. I have been out there several times and I have put questions on the Order Paper to the hon. the Minister about doing something to relieve the position. Sir, I have said over the years in this House that there has been this lack of long-term planning as far as our airports are concerned. Although we have the 747s in use today, our airports <span class="col_5387-5388" refersTo="page_1157"/>are still not up to date. We knew that the 747s were coming and we knew how long they would take to build. We should have been ready to cope with the traffic. One does not know when the D. F. Malan will ever be completed, because the work seems to go on and on there. As has been said here, airports are never really completed, because as the traffic increases, so they have to be extended. Sir, all over the world there has been long-term planning as far as airports are concerned. Having regard to the fall-off in air traffic, it is important that we should be able to offer every type of comfort to air passengers at our airports. Passengers cannot be expected to be satisfied with what they have to put up with at Jan Smuts and at D. F. Malan Airports. Just recently when I was at the D. F. Malan Airport, I watched the staff trying to pack containers, in spite of the crowded conditions, for the 747. As they got the containers on to the vehicles, the public were pushing the vehicles over. There are no proper facilities whatever for handling these containers. As I said, we knew that the 747s were coming and we knew that they would have to be used for 24 hours a day in order to make them pay, but the runways were not started timeously; they are just being finished at the present moment. We were told that the runways were long enough, but that they were being lengthened for reasons of safety. They have not been finished yet, however. This all shows a terrible lack of planning. Sir, the trouble is, as I said before, that the South African Airways, the Railways, run the planes, while the National Transport Commission runs the terminals and the runways, and then you have a third department coming into the picture; the Department of Public Works constructs the buildings. You have this muddle of three departments trying to handle this one major function. The hon. the Minister of Transport knows very well that he does not go to the Public Works Department to build his stations or his harbours; he does not allow another department to interfere with the running of the Railways, and it is high time our international airports were placed under one control, under the control of the South African Railways. The planning department of the Railways could then supervise the future planning of our airports. You cannot have this divided control. Sir, air travel in this country has grown out of all proportion; the growth in air travel has exceeded everybody&#x2019;s expectations. The old methods that we used to control airports have become out of date, and I would like to suggest that the hon. the Minister should give serious consideration to the question of handing over the whole of the building and the running of our airports to the South African Railways. I do not belittle the work that has been done by the National Transport Commission, but our major airports should be run by the Railways, because we cannot have this muddle that we have at the present moment. One has only to go to the D. F. Malan Airport on a Sunday to see what absolute chaos there is.</p>

<p>Sir, another item that one is very worried about is the increase in the number of private aircraft accidents. It is a good thing that we art training so many pilots in this country, but I feel that the Minister ought to go into the question of better control of private flights. Just recently we have had some tragedies in which families have been wiped out. One does not know who was to blame, but there is no doubt about it that there must have been an element of carelessness somewhere. I feel that the hon. the Minister should give consideration to going into the whole question of the better control of private flying, because as it is becoming more popular, we will find that there will be more accidents. The hon. the Minister has various airfields round about the cities and there is intense traffic in the air at times. You have the military training craft and we have the planes operated by the S.A. Airways. There is an element of danger there and very much greater control should be kept over private flying than there is at the present moment.</p>

<p>I should like to pay tribute to the very fine work being done by our research ship, the R.S.A. and the crews that go down to the South Atlantic, to Sanae, and the work that is done there. I do not know whether it is really appreciated but this research has an effect on the weather forecasts and agriculture, as well as being used internationally. I do not know whether that is really appreciated, but I would say that it is money well spent and one must pay great tribute to those people who go down there year after year. Do not let us lose sight of the fact that it is a dangerous occupation. There is an element of danger. Every time a crew goes down to this weather station they run the risk of serious injuries with fatal results. We have had our losses there. There is always an element of danger <span class="col_5389-5390" refersTo="page_1158"/>when you deal with ice and snow in the Antarctic. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Salt River, who has just resumed his seat, also referred to the airports, <i>inter alia,</i> to D. F. Malan, but I think the hon. member loses sight of the fact that the chief purpose of these 747 Jumbos Jets is to serve the South African public on the external flights. As a result of the interest there was on the part of the public, the Department was also prepared to use these aircraft on domestic flights for the sake of the public. I think we must be prepared to make sacrifices up to the end of this year in connection with D. F. Malan, which will subsequently be one of the most efficient airports, not only in South Africa, but also in the world.</p>

<p>I think I am correct in alleging that today it is actually the first time that we have the opportunity in this House of discussing weather modifications subsequent to their practical implementation in South Africa. Here I am referring to the &#x201C;Water-hail&#x201D; operation which was launched in the Eastern Free State with Bethlehem as the centre-point. I do not believe that it has been often in the past that a project has been tackled in that part of the world which the people have treated with as much suspicion as specifically this &#x201C;Water-hail&#x201D; operation. Some of the reasons why the people were so suspicious of this scheme was, firstly, the lack of knowledge amongst the public about the scheme itself and its implications, and then also, perhaps, as a result of the mistaken use of a word, &#x201C;rainmaking&#x201D;, by the Press and public. Rainmaking it definitely is not. I hope that in the future we shall also do justice to this very delicate, scientific research project and that we shall also describe it as weather modification.</p>

<p>Wanting, as I do, to interpret the feelings of the people in the Eastern Free State in respect of this scheme&#x2014;and I am referring particularly to its inception&#x2014;I think I am correct in saying the feelings and words of my people can briefly be rendered as follows, i.e. that we do not like clouds being tampered with. I want to say at once that initially I did not like this tampering around in the clouds either, if I may use this term. But I immediately want to add that after I made contact with the chief meteorologist there, Mr. Du Toit, he not only made me and many others collaborators in this scheme, but he also made us students in this extremely interesting scientific field which is now being tackled in all seriousness in South Africa for the first time. Today I should like to pay tribute to Mr. Du Toit, the chief meteorologist, and his team, who launched this scheme at Bethlehem. The leader in particular, Mr. Du Toit&#x2014;and I am not forgetting his team&#x2014;is not only a brilliant scientist but also a man of virtue. I shall come back to that at a later stage. I also want to mention in this House that Mr. Du Toit is not only regarded in South Africa as an authority on weather modification, but that in the United States of America he is also regarded today as one of the world authorities in the field of weather modification, something we in South Africa can rightfully be proud of.</p>

<p>Now perhaps something in lighter vein. I do not know whether this department realizes what a saving this official has brought about for the department. When feelings were running a bit high at one stage, and there were even threats that these aircraft would be fired on, it was this very person who calmed feelings down. I just want to mention that while feelings were running quite high, and just afterwards, it so happened that the Boeing 747, one of our new aircraft, was frequently engaged in training flights above Bethlehem. That aircraft was frequently wrongly viewed as the offender as far as weather modification is concerned. Fortunately, this official of the <span class="col_5391-5392" refersTo="page_1159"/>department also brought about this saving for us.</p>

<p>When I say that I, who was initially sceptical about this project, also want to advocate here this afternoon that more assistance be granted to this scientific team, it indicates the esteem and respect those people have already commanded from us. One now does not want to imply that the American pilots who assisted there and have already gone back to America to return next year, in all probability, only did negative work in South Africa. But we must realize that these pilots from America are not meteorologists or scientists, neither are they scientifically orientated. These people are more interested in the spectacular changes that can be brought about by pollinating our clouds with silver iodide. We should like to ask the hon. the Minister that everything in our power be done to create the opportunity for the meteorologists to qualify themselves as pilots and also, vice versa, that the opportunity be created for our pilots to train themselves as scientific meteorologists, there already being a course for them at the University of Pretoria. For this purely scientific research project, it is of the utmost necessity that the scientific touch should not only be related to ground-work, but that the relative persons should also specifically be able to do research and make observations from the air.</p>

<p>There is another aspect that will also be of great help to these people. Today I do not want to speak about the scientific background to weather modification. I believe that with the two Bills we expect in this connection, we shall have the opportunity to discuss the scientific aspect in greater detail. It is of the utmost necessity, however, that the changes in the weather conditions brought about by the silver iodide polination should immediately be observable and it should be possible for those observations to be transmitted to a central point. It is not practical to observe from an aircraft what happens when pollinization of a cloud takes place. A tremendously spectacular reaction takes place. A cloud, which appeared to be a threatening thunder cloud, changes in size, volume, depth and colour, but what is actually of the utmost importance is the reaction that takes place in the nucleus of the cloud itself, such as the difference in temperature, the rate at which the temperature changes, the change in rate at which the air rises and whereby the moisture, which concentrates round the nuclei, moves downwards to fall through the cloud and form rain. We should like to ask the Minister to consider also providing this team with a glider that can move reasonably slowly within the cloud and which, in practice, can also turn very quickly to return to the original point. Not only are the data they obtain of importance, but it is also an urgent necessity that that data can be transmitted very quickly to a central point. In this connection we are reminded of the new automatic, small type of weather stations that have already been developed. I think they cost about R6 000 each. I should like to ask that this team also be given that equipment, so that after reactions take place they can very quickly be aware of the signals as they reach them.</p>

<p>I believe that in South Africa we have also reached the stage already where we can do practical research on mist clouds at our airports. We know that in the United States of America and in Russia a great deal of research has already been done in this connection. We know that in some countries it has apparently been too expensive in practice to implement methods in that connection. From a scientific point or view D. F. Malan as an airport has not been situated at a very ideal spot. With the temperature we find in these clouds, and with the salt concentration and compounds in the air that cause corrosion, practical use can perhaps be made of the pollination, with calcium chloride solutions, so that the mist can be combated. In this way we can safeguard our airports to a greater extent. I see that my time is up and I want to conclude with the following thought. Since there have been so many discussions in South Africa about this whole scheme I, who live in that part of the world where this took place, want to say that I am satisfied in my mind that Mr. Du Toit, who is a brilliant scientist, is also a humble person and that he does not think to use the forces that man has no right to use, but that he wants to use the talents the great Master has given him in the service of men, animals and plants.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I have the privilege of the half hour&#x003F; The hon. member for Bethlehem has referred to yet another of the exciting research projects of the 1970s which have been tackled by scientists in South Africa. I am certainly not qualified to comment on these technical matters and therefore he will <span class="col_5393-5394" refersTo="page_1160"/>forgive me if I do not follow the line which he has taken. However, I simply want to say, and I think it is common knowledge and known to this House, that we on this side of the House have always supported the maximum amount of investment in research because we believe that it is wise and sound investment.</p>

<p>This afternoon I want to discuss certain matters with the hon. the Minister, matters which I believe it is necessary to air in connection with the administration of the Motor Vehicles Insurance Fund. In order to do that, I think it is necessary that we should go back to the history of this fund and to have clearly in our minds what legislation has been passed by this House, and what changes have taken place in regard to the fund itself. In 1942 the original Act was introduced and approved of by this House and was to provide compensation for persons who were caused loss unlawfully by motor vehicles&#x2014;in other words, as a result of the negligence of some person in control of a motor vehicle. This insurance was then handled exclusively by the private sector of insurance companies who were prepared to undertake this type of business. That position pertained and continued until 1964, when this Government introduced certain amendments to the Act. Among other things, they established the Advisory Committee on Motor Vehicles Insurance, and also what is termed a Premium Committee. This enabled them, the representatives of interested persons, to approach the Minister and to make representations to him and it also gave the department representation from 1964-&#x2019;65 onwards on the control of the fund then established by these various insurance companies. The next stage in the handling of this insurance came in 1966, when the consortium agreement was entered into whereby the carrying of this insurance was placed in the hands of some 16 insurance companies, companies which had been selected by the Minister. Thereby these companies, and no others, could undertake this insurance unless approved of and admitted to the consortium. At this time the gentleman who subsequently became manager of the MVA Fund, became associated with the administration of the insurance fund, as what I might term an inspector of the insurance companies who were taking part in this type of insurance and subsequently became members of the consortium. In 1969 we had a most interesting debate in this House when drastic changes to the Motor Vehicle Insurance Act were introduced. I think the nature of these changes and some of the aspects of the debates that took place, are most material to what I suggest is happening in this fund at the present time. First of all, the M.V.A. Fund, which had been registered as a reinsurance fund, as a company, by the insurance companies concerned, no longer stood in the position of a registered company under the Companies Act, but became a corporate body to be known as the M.V.A. Fund. The M.V.A. Fund was then given, as reference to the principal Act will show, considerable powers, particularly under section 25C of the Act. One of the powers which is enshrined in the Act, is the power I quote, &#x201C;to investigate and settle claims, to commence, conduct, defend or abandon legal proceedings&#x201D;. With these wide powers the fund then fell under the control of one individual, namely the manager, a manager to be appointed by the Minister. The fund was then no longer to be controlled by a representative body of the insurance companies concerned with motor vehicle insurance. Mr. Gouws was then appointed as manager of the fund. Under section 25D the power was given to the Minister to appoint a committee Which could be consulted by the manager and which could make representations regarding the business of the fund to the manager. I think it is important that we have that particular power quite clearly before us. Section 25D (2) (a) reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister may, if he deems it expedient, appoint six persons in accordance with paragraph (b) as a committee which the manager of the M.V.A. Fund may in his discretion consult about any business of that fund and which may make representations to the said manager in connection with any such business.</block>

<p>Although that power was given to the hon. the Minister in 1969, as far as I am aware, that committee has never been constituted. The manager was however appointed, and left without an advisory committee which he could consult and which, in turn, could make representations in regard to the business of the fund. What happened after the 1969 Act&#x003F; We find that Mr. Gouws was given unfettered control, except when he was asked to come to the Secretary or to the Minister, unfettered control of a fund of some R50 million including the investment <span class="col_5395-5396" refersTo="page_1161"/>thereof as also to exercise all those powers which were enshrined in and given to him under the 1969 amendments. I want to come to those amendments and particularly&#x2014;this is material&#x2014;to the right of the fund through its manager to deal with any litigation as regards damages arising from motor cases. I want to refer to Hansard of 27th February, 1969. I want to say that the matter was raised in debate with the hon. the Minister and the hon. the Deputy Minister under clause 9. Certain categorical assurances were then given by the Deputy Minister, assurances which were accepted by this side of the House. I want to deal with them now. I raised the question of what the intention was with this fund and the power to litigate, to settle claims and what claims it would handle. I said the following in Hansard (vol. 25, col. 1526) of 27th February, 1969&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The simple issue we want the hon. the Deputy Minister to clarify is that while the companies retain 25 per cent of the premiums, of which they pay 5 per cent commission to the various agents, the companies will investigate claims which are made against them and that they will finance the staff, the investigation, the assessors and everything else that is brought into such an investigation when a claim is put in. Apparently the State is not going to perform that function, although it has the power to do so through the fund and the insurance companies will continue to do that.</block>

<p>Order! The hon. member for Parow must resume his seat, and not stand in the passage.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Later the Deputy Minister agreed and I want to quote his words in the same volume, col. 1527 in referring to what I had said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Chairman, it is just possible that the hon. member did not follow me yesterday. I then stated that the investigation of claims would remain as it was at present. The only claims that would be investigated by the personnel of the fund would be those claims against the fund itself, claims connected with motor-cars not insured and unidentified.</block>

<p>In other words, it would be limited entirely to claims of motor-cars which are uninsured or are unidentified. While I am dealing with that debate I would also like to deal with the question of the investment of funds. In column 1523 the hon. the Deputy Minister said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The hon. member also referred to paragraph (j). which reads as follows&#x2014;</block>

<block name="quote">Subject to the Minister&#x2019;s approval in every case, to lend money on such conditions as it (the fund) may deem advisable.</block>

<block name="quote">I want to inform the House that the fund has an accumulated amount of capital and that the fund must see to it that the money is handled in two ways. A certain amount must be kept liquid with a view to claims being made &#x2026; If hon. members look at the reports they will see that large amounts have already been invested with municipalities and building societies &#x2026;</block>

<p>That was the position in 1969. Here in passing I want to draw attention to the fact that the Clerk of the Papers of this House is unaware of any report of the M.V.A. Fund being Tabled in this House. No such report has been Tabled in this House. Now what happened&#x003F; Almost immediately after Mr. Gouws assumed responsibility, and I understand that the Minister must have been aware of these facts, because he is now aware of them, he openly acted contrary to the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s specific undertaking to Parliament as to what the meaning of that clause was in regard to litigation. This manager requested certain insurance companies to instruct a specific attorney nominated by him to do their legal work. He intervened at will to settle cases which were in the course of litigation between companies and with payments which had nothing to do with uninsured or unidentified vehicles. Finally, this official appointed by the Minister, went so far as to issue an instruction circular to insurance companies. This circular was issued by him on the 29th April, 1971. At this stage he was going to appoint the assessors, the lawyers, and he would also consult the doctors for every M.V.A. claim for amounts of more than R20 000. In this circular, No. T.P. 56/20 of the 29th April, 1971, the following is stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Companies are expected to do the necessary investigation themselves and to make use of the services of an assessor <span class="col_5397-5398" refersTo="page_1162"/>only when absolutely necessary in order to determine the merits of such claims without any doubt. The necessary medical evidence must also be obtained in order that consideration may be given to the quantity. In other words, the fund must be enabled to independently determine the merits and quantum of such claims.</block>

<p>This is in the face of the assurances given by the hon. the Deputy Minister. The first point which immediately arises is: Where is the control, the efficient control, the effective control by this Cabinet over officials appointed to high office such as this particular official&#x003F; Because, Sir, the questions which have been asked indicate that as far back as 1969 investment entered the grey money market. There were investments then being made with private concerns. If I consult the section mentioned in the Act, then those investments were made with the consent and approval of this Minister. Sir, it was not one investment; there were eight separate amounts paid out into the private sector for investment in what is termed the &#x201C;grey market&#x201D;, and in respect of which, I will come back to this later, certain commissions were paid. I have referred to the position at the time the debate took place, but who was the gentleman who was appointed as manager&#x003F; What had been his activities while he was connected with the fund under the supervision of this Deputy Minister&#x003F; What did he do between 1965 and 1969, when he was appointed manager&#x003F;</p>

<p>Let me give you some of his activities, this man selected by this Government to manage a R50 million fund, without control. On the 6th September, 1967, a company was incorporated under the name of Nohenno Assuransiemakelaars (Eiendoms) Beperk, consequently known as Profinkor (Eiendoms) Beperk. When this company was registered on 25th March, 1968, Mr. Gouws became a director of this company, according to form J lodged in the company&#x2019;s office. On 2nd May, 1968, he had a thousand shares allotted to him, representing 20 per cent of the capital of this company. On the 17th September, 1968, a form J was then lodged in the company&#x2019;s office stating that, though he was appointed director on 20th March, 1968, he resigned on 15th May, 1968. This company, as you can appreciate was connected with insurance. One of its main objects was &#x201C;om besigheid te doen as versekeringsadviseurs en in die algemeen elke aanverwante handeling uit te voer&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, I must hasten on. The actions of this man are numerous. On 5th February, 1968, another company was registered, the &#x201C;besigheidsassessore van Suider-Afrika (Edms.) Beperk 68/1088&#x201D;, of which company Mr. Gouws was a director. He subsequently resigned. But, Sir, on the file of the Registrar&#x2019;s office is this interesting note:</p>

<block name="quote">Indien die maatskappy binne die volgende dag geregistreer word, sal kontrakte tussen die maatskappy en Staatsdepartemente en munisipaliteite gesluit word. Indien die maatskappy nie geregistreer word voor 6.2.&#x2019;68 nie, sal die genoemde kontrakte nie meer gesluit kan word nie.</block>

<p>So the company was duly registered on that date, to make it possible for the contracts with the State Department to be finalized. The same gentleman enjoyed the complete trust of the department and was apparently able to act in this way without any surveillance from the department. Apparently, the Minister did not know what he was doing in handling various claims. On 27th October, 1967, Mr. Gouws purchased a farm, Rietfontein 485, for R22 000. He took transfer on 23rd January, 1968, in terms of Deed No. 1869/1968, registered in Pretoria. On the same day two bonds were registered, ranking <i>pari-passu,</i> each for R11 750, to two of the companies who are members of the consortium.</p>

<p>A 100 per cent loan.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>My hon. friend from Yeoville says it was a 100 per cent loan. It was a 100 per cent plus. It was a loan to pay the purchase price plus all the transfer costs. These bonds are registered. This type of activity was going on. Now, Sir, according to the Press reports the hon. the Minister of Transport on 28th July, 1971, confirmed that the Police were invesgating certain aspects of the Motor Vehicle Assurance Fund&#x2014;no doubt following the action referred to in the statement made by the hon. the Prime Minister yesterday, when he said :</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; dat, toe pertinente klagtes gemaak is in verband met hierdie persoon, ek dit onmiddellik na die Minister van Vervoer verwys het, en dat hy die saak verder geneem het.</block>

<p><span class="col_5399-5400" refersTo="page_1163"/>I should like to know when the hon. the Minister was informed of these irregularities. On the information that I have this information was passed to the Government some two years ago, and not in 1971. The hon. the Minister could perhaps tell me when he was first informed by the hon. the Prime Minister of the irregularities. But in July, a few days earlier, the Secretary for Transport&#x2014;here I want to say that the present Secretary for Transport, Mr. Driessen, was appointed to this office in 1969; he was not there at the time of the original appointment of this gentleman on the inspectorate and later to the management&#x2014;announced that the investigations were of a purely domestic nature. And then on the 1st August, 1971, after the Minister himself had said that there was a Police inquiry, we find an announcement by the Secretary for Transport that the manager of the fund has been transferred for organizational reasons to the Department of Civil Aviation. That was on the 1st of August, 1971.</p>

<p>I am not concerned at this moment with the investigation of the criminal and other acts of Mr. Gouws or anybody else; what I am concerned with is the alarming extent of Cabinet inefficiency again in this instance as in the case of Department of Lands, in the control of expenditure and in the handling of vast sums of money. I want to put some pertinent questions to the hon. the Deputy Minister: By whom was Mr. Gouws appointed manager and on whose recommendation&#x003F; Was he appointed on the recommendation of the Public Service Commission or was this a decision of the hon. the Deputy Minister himself&#x003F; When did the hon. the Minister of Transport and the hon. the Deputy Minister become aware that the manager was not acting in accordance with the assurances, the solemn assurances, given by the Deputy Minister in this House as to how the Act would be implemented in so far as interference with litigation was concerned&#x003F; When did he receive a report that that interference was taking place&#x003F; I should also like the hon. the Deputy Minister to advise the House whether each and every investment made by this fund was approved by him personally, in terms of the Act, before the investment was made and before the money was paid out. My fourth question is whether in respect of the loans to the private sector&#x2014;eight separate loans were made and they were big ones of R1 million or more, totalling R6,5 million&#x2014;there was an agreement to pay commission or accept commission after consultation and with the approval of the Treasury. When the hon. the Minister of Finance was asked in the Other Place whether he had approved of this type of investment, he said he did not want to cross swords with a colleague. I want the hon. the Deputy Minister to tell us whether he consulted with the Treasury. In the committee that was established in 1964 to advise and control this fund the Treasury was represented. The next point I come to is the question of commission. Is it Government policy that when money is advanced by the Government, invested by the Government, that commission should be paid and that the lender should be in a position of being paid or enabling somebody else to earn commission on the investment of Government money&#x003F; In the private sector commission is charged to the man who is borrowing for the services rendered, and I want to know whether the payment of commission is permitted on moneys belonging to and invested on behalf of the State. The hon. the Deputy Minister, in reply to a question by the hon. member for Parktown, said that commission was paid in respect of some of these deposits. Will he please inform this Committee who received this commission, what the amount of the commission was, and why it was paid in consideration of an investment of State funds made by the Government&#x003F; Why was it approved by the hon. the Minister&#x003F;</p>

<p>Then, Sir, I want to know from the hon. the Minister why he has never appointed that committee under section 25D. Why has he never appointed a committee to control the manager of this fund and to advise him on business matters&#x003F; My final question, to which the hon. the Minister of Transport will perhaps be able to reply, is why there has been this delay in the investigation. The control of the funds was in the hands of one person. The Police have been dealing with this matter since July of last year. There is only one person to be investigated, and that is the manager of the fund. We are now near the end of April and there is still no sign of a prosecution or a report. Has the hon. the Minister received a report from the Police&#x003F; Has a report been placed before him or his colleague, the Minister of Police&#x003F; Sir, these are matters which concern the public, and I want to say in conclusion why the public is so concerned, apart from the culpable inefficiency of the Deputy Minister in the discharge of his duties. The consortium companies retain 25 per cent of the premiums <span class="col_5401-5402" refersTo="page_1164"/>to finance the handling of claims, the investigation of claims, the employment of assessors, legal advisers etc. But, Sir, that has not been done, at the cost of the ordinary man in the street who pays MVA premium every year, because it has been taken from the fund itself by this manager himself appointing and remunerating the assessors and the legal representative. Sir, let me give you one example, a case in the Free State, where a company was busy with litigation. It had tendered R50 000 in respect of damages and costs to the date of tender. The pleadings were closed and the matter was about to go to court; then the manager intervened and settled on behalf of the fund at R98 870, almost double what had been tendered by the company. He agreed to pay all party costs and in fact, in generosity, also offered to pay R1 000 towards attorney and client costs in respect of this particular claim. The Minister knows of other occasions where petitions have been prepared to obtain consent to sue in the case of uninsured cars; the Minister has then given consent to sue where it had been refused. Sir, another point that I want to make in this matter is that the same fund is now going to be credited with another 50 cents per motor vehicle for road safety expenditure. What confidence can the country have that this money will be properly handled&#x003F; The hon. the Deputy Minister owes it to this House and he owes it to every motorist in South Africa to compel companies doing insurance to disclose what their profits are and have been, because they have not been called upon to expend the 25 per cent of the premiums which they retained, because of the amounts expended by the manager appointed by the Deputy Minister out of the capital funds of this motor vehicle insurance fund. I believe that this matter is in the same category as the other matter in regard to which we found it necessary to put questions to the Minister of Agriculture. Here we have a complete lack of control over officials appointed by Ministers. In this case also the hon. the Deputy Minister has shown himself completely incompetent and, I believe, not fit to carry on in his present position.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to deal with only one aspect of the matter. I want to tell the hon. member that he has the fullest right to express criticism in this matter.

There is no scandal whatsoever as far as the Government is concerned and as far as the Ministers are concerned.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, it is not lack of control. It is simply impossible for any Minister to control the individual activities of an officer in his department. It does not happen. [Interjections.] Sir, before hon. members start making interjections they must first listen; they know nothing about this matter and they will not know until I have explained what the position is. The position in regard to this individual is the following, but first of all, let me say this: I think that I rendered one of the greatest services to the motorists of South Africa with the establishment of this consortium. Hon. members who were in the House at that time knew what the position was after the collapse of Parity. They know that a number of companies refused to insure the motorists because I would not agree to an increase in the premiums. I received a request from she insurers to increase the premiums by a substantial amount, and I refused to do so. In retaliation they refused to insure the motorists, and as a result of this the consortium was formed. As a result of that action of mine, I have saved the motorists of South Africa literally millions of rands. If that consortium had not been formed and if the funds of the consortium had not been lucratively invested, the third party insurance premiums of motorists would probably have been double the present amount today, and there has been no increase over the past six years. That is the position as far as the consortium is concerned. In regard to the 25 per cent administration fee, that was the percentage upon which all the insurance companies worked before the formation of the consortium; they charged a 25 per cent administration fee, 5 per cent for commission to their agent and 20 per cent for administration. It is less now, but that was in force before the formation of the consortium.</p>

<p>Let me now come to the fund itself. Sir, not one cent of the motorist&#x2019;s money has been misappropriated. Every cent paid into that fund has been invested. I am not now discussing the claims that have been paid out; I am speaking about the money invested.</p>

<from><span class="col_5403-5404" refersTo="page_1165"/>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to make that clear so that the House and the country can know that not one single cent that has been paid in premiums has been misappropriated; it has all been properly invested. The original instruction was that the money must be invested with financial institutions and in building societies, etc. The Deputy Minister will deal with this matter in greater detail.</p>

<p>Let me now come to the position as far as Mr. Gouws is concerned and as far as I am concerned. I am, of course, responsible for the Deputy Minister and for the department; I am not running away from my responsibility. If there is any reflection on me, and if hon. members have any evidence that throws any doubt upon my integrity or honesty or my efficiency, I am quite prepared to hand in my resignation to the Prime Minister. Hon. members must know that. Mr. Gouws&#x2019;s personal activities, outside the scope of his work as manager of this fund, first of all came to my attention on 19th April last year. I received a letter from the Prime Minister, which had been sent to him by Senator Van Rensburg, accompanied by a number of documents, in which certain allegations were made that Mr. Gouws was receiving commission from certain institutions where money had been invested. I received this letter which contained certain allegations that Mr. Gouws, as the manager of the insurance fund, was receiving commission from certain companies. They had no right to pay him commission and they are as guilty as Mr. Gouws is. They knew that they were not compelled to pay any commission but they did pay commission, and Mr. Gouws was putting that commission into his own pocket. He had certain companies that he had established, two of which have been mentioned here by the hon. member. When I received that letter on 19th April, I immediately handed the matter over to the Police for a thorough investigation, as it was my duty to do. I instructed the Secretary for Transport to deal with Mr. Gouws. On 29th June, after more evidence was submitted in regard to his activities, he was placed on compulsory leave and on 1st September he was suspended and he is still suspended.</p>

<p>May I ask a question&#x003F; The question of commission arose because of the change from the normal treasury basis of investment.

<p>He was entitled to lend it with the approval of the Minister, but all the funds that were invested were thoroughly guaranteed and there was no danger of those funds going astray. There was no question of the money not being safe, although it was invested at a very high rate of interest. I think I have given a list of the institutions where the money was invested. Hon. members have that in their possession. There is nothing to hide. It was said in regard to a particular company that the investment was guaranteed by the banks. But it was a high rate of interest and the reason why a high rate of interest was charged was to assist the motorist of this country; because the higher the rate of interest, the greater would be the income of the Fund, and the less chance there would be of an increase in premium, despite the fact that the claims were much higher than the receipt. That is what actually happened. I say categorically that I did not receive any information in regard to Mr. Gouws&#x2019; activities, as was maintained by that hon. member, two years ago.</p>

<p>Then why does the hon. member shake his head&#x003F; I am telling him what the position is. The Police inquiry is into Mr. Gouws&#x2019; activities, not into the Fund&#x2019;s. There is nothing wrong with the Fund. Why should the Police investigate the Fund&#x003F; Not a single cent of the Fund has been misappropriated. Why should the Police investigate the Fund&#x003F;</p>

<p>The Police are investigating Mr. Gouws&#x2019; activities. The fact that Mr. Gouws received commission for investments he made out of the Fund, and that he put that commission into his own pocket, is what they are investigating. I can give the hon. member the assurance that I am as anxious as any other member is that those Police inquiries should be completed. The Secretary for Transport has spoken to the Police a number of times and asked them when they were going to complete the inquiry. However, there is nothing to hide; good heavens! That is the position in regard to Mr. Gouws as far as I am concerned. I want to repeat again that if there is any reflection on me, my integrity and honesty, or my efficiency as Minister, I am prepared to hand in my resignation to the hon. the Prime Minister.

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I will gladly do that. Mr. Chairman, I do not think that the Committee would expect that the Minister, the Deputy Minister, or even the Secretary of the Department, should act as a policeman in regard to the activities of individual members of the department as such. It is not the Minister&#x2019;s task to go to the Registrar of Companies and check on the registration of each and every company to see who the directors are and whether they are members of the Department. How could a Minister or Deputy Minister get this information other than through the public&#x003F;</p>

<p>*Mr. Chairman, because my notes are in Afrikaans, I am going to deal in Afrikaans with certain parts of the questions put by the hon. member for Green Point. In the first place, I think that in order to reply properly to this matter, it is necessary that this Committee should see the M.V.A. Fund in its entirety. The Committee should see how that fund is and was handled and what action was taken. Firstly, the hon. member asked me why section 25D was never applied, and the advisory committee was never constituted. The functions of that advisory committee are defined in that Act, and these were mainly to advise the Minister on statistics in regard to tendencies in motor vehicle insurance, motor car accidents and motor vehicle insurance claims. That same work was done by the Premiums Committee, which analyses accident trends, the increase of claims as against premiums and the circumstances surrounding them, and advises the Minister in that respect. In other words, it would merely have been overlapping to use the advisory committee for that as well.</p>

<p>It seems to me there was.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>In the first place, the hon. member made certain accusations in regard to the investments of the M.V.A. Fund. He made the accusation that commission was paid on the investments. The hon. the Minister has already told the hon. member that the State does not allow commission. Such cases have come to notice. Let me first tell the hon. member how it happened. The chairman of the fund submits to the Minister the list of premiums which he has already received and which are available for investment and, together with this, the recommendation in what institutions it may be invested. The Act provides that investments may be made in financial institutions, in building societies, in semi-State institutions like Escom, in municipalities, etc.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>That is all and it is stated in the Act.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it is all. When the Minister has approved it, the chairman has the opportunity of making the investments according to that approval. I am not going to elaborate further on the investigation which took place after that, but I may say that one of the matters being investigated is what he did in regard to the investment after he had received approval. Some of these accusations made by the hon. member for Green Point may possibly appear in that. In the first place we must examine the investment aspect as such. In this connection I first want to tell the hon. members what would have happened if the investments had not been made as they in <span class="col_5409-5410" refersTo="page_1168"/>fact were. I have made an analysis of what the comparative statement with loss of interest would have been if all these investments had been made only with the Public Debt Commissioners. In that case the fund would have shown a loss of interest of R6 537 000 to date.</p>

<p>No, I mention it because it is one aspect. The hon. member says it was not expected to do so. Let me say to this House that we have been reproached by the Opposition over there and especially in the Senate because not all these amounts were invested with the Public Debt Commissioners, but with private institutions as well. In order to put this matter clearly, I want to mention to hon. members what the difference in the earnings of the fund would have been if it had invested only with the Public Debt Commissioners. The loss of interest would have been more than R6,5 million.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>But the Act does not require that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I know the Act does not require it, but this is the propaganda aspect which the United Party used. I now come to the second matter which I want to put very clearly. If we look at the fund as such&#x2014;and I must mention this&#x2014;we shall see that if investments were not made in such a way that a buffer was built up between the premiums and the claims against premiums, the fund would have been insolvent already. The fact that one can invest and earn interest of up to 9 per cent, as the hon. the Minister said, is all that enables one to build up a buffer between the premiums and the claims experience. If it is necessary, and if hon. members want to know it, I am prepared to submit to them what the claims experience as against premiums has been. By so doing I could show them how far they are exceeded.</p>

<p>I must add that the hon. the Minister has already mentioned how the motor vehicle owner in South Africa has been saved millions of rands in the past as a result of the establishment of this fund. In the first place, I want to mention the amount which the public was saved by the refusal of the 20 per cent increase requested by the insurance companies in 1965. If one takes it over the period from 1965 to 1972, the amount which the motor vehicle owner was saved because this Act was introduced by the hon. the Minister, comes to more than R41 416 000.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>There would have been many more increases if that one had been granted.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>This is based only on the request for a 20 per cent increase which was submitted by the insurance companies as far back as 1965. If one looks at ordinary insurance, one can see what the tendency would have been. That increase would not have remained at 20 per cent, but would have become more and more. I think we may rightly say that, if one takes the present position into account, more than R100 million has been saved.</p>

<p>After overhead expenses and agents&#x2019; commission have been subtracted, the net income of this fund amounts to between R28 million and R30 million annually. As hon. members know, the income is collected by the insurance companies and paid over to the M.V.A. Fund.</p>

<p>I should like to explain the method of investment to hon. members now. As a result of the facts which came to our attention and in respect of which an investigation is being carried out now, an investment committee was established which considers applications and makes recommendations in this regard to the Secretary for Transport for submission to the Minister, who then exercises his discretion. That investment <span class="col_5411-5412" refersTo="page_1169"/>committee consists of the senior Deputy Secretary for Transport, the Chief Accountant of Transport, the Manager of the M.V.A. Fund and the Registrar of Financial Institutions. That is the reason why such a committee was appointed. A few moments ago I mentioned the statement of the fund&#x2019;s investments as at 30th April. I now want to say to hon. members that the Motor Vehicle Assurance Fund is not subject to Parliamentary control. Hon. members opposite said a few moments ago that they have never received the figures. These too are not subject to the control of the Controller and Auditor-General. The fund appoints auditors annually, and audit inspections are then carried out by private auditors, who submit reports to the Minister.</p>

<p>I now come to the complaint raised by the hon. member for Green Point. The hon. member asked by whom Mr. Gouws had been appointed and where he came from. Mr. Gouws was an official of the Department of Transport. The appointment of Mr. Gouws, like that of any official, went through the channels of the Public Service Commission.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>His appointment as manager as well&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, his appointment as manager as well. At a certain stage the hon. the Minister and I discovered that an investment had in fact been made by Mr. Gouws in respect of which the applicants who had borrowed from the fund had paid an amount in commission to the fund as such. Immediately after this had come to our attention, the Minister issued an instruction that there was to be no such thing as commission. We realized immediately that there was a loophole and that if the fund were offered commission, other commissions could also be offered. When the Minister discovered this, that instruction was issued and a circular was also sent out so that all persons could know that there was no such thing that the State or the fund received commission for investments.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Was that money paid back&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That money was not paid back to the two institutions, because it was money that had already been paid to the fund. Now the hon. member for Green Point asks what confidence the public is to have in the handling and the investments of this fund. I want to say to him that in the same way as the Minister said that if his integrity were questioned he would resign, I say so as well. Here I have the auditors&#x2019; reports and nowhere is there any shortfall in any of the moneys of the fund as such or has any such money been wrongly invested or invested with institutions which do not have the necessary security. The fund has suffered no loss whatsoever. The hon. member also made out a case against the treatment of claims as such. He said that in the treatment of claims discriminatory and therefore wrong action was taken. I want to analyse the procedures to some extent so that the Committee may see how claims are dealt with.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>It was contrary to your undertakings in this House.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it was contrary to them. Certain other things had to be taken into consideration subsequently. I briefly want to mention a few points now in regard to the treatment of claims. I want to point out that, according to the experience which has been gained, claimants should be kept out of the courts as far as possible. The simple reason for this is that court charges, lawyers&#x2019; fees, etc., are so high that they almost take up the eventual award which is made by the court. In this case I may mention the example where the court made an award of R57 000, while the total legal costs amounted to R44 000. In other words, the poor claimant received virtually nothing. Secondly, it is essential to deal with these claims as quickly as possible in order to gain clarity sooner. In this respect this fund has taken remarkably successful action and I want to mention figures which I have taken from 25 claims which were settled directly by the fund or on the instructions of the fund. In this regard a total amount of R2 417 000 was claimed initially. The total amount proposed by companies with a view to settlement and in respect of which approval was requested, amounted to R1 138 000. However, after the fund itself stepped in and determined to what extent these claims could be settled, they were settled for R961 000. In other words, in this case, where I have only made an extract of these 25 claims, there was the tremendous saving of R177 000-58. Let us now look at the <span class="col_5413-5414" refersTo="page_1170"/>number of claims dealt with like this, and in respect of which the hon. member for Green Point is dissatisfied. Of the 146 claims referred to the fund, the fund itself settled 26, while 28 were settled by companies on the instructions of the fund, and 29 were referred back to the companies for further action as they saw fit. Only two claims were settled by the court in this regard. Of these 146 claims, as a result of the actions and the guidance and leadership given by the fund, only two were settled by the court, while the others were settled by the fund itself. If this is the position that I can put to the hon. member, I cannot see how he can make the accusation that the fund is acting illegally here and wasting money. Even though, in terms of the agreement, the insurance companies receive 25 per cent, while the rest goes to the agents &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>What about the increase, which was double the previous amount&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to that now. In this regard the department made a very thorough analysis, for example, of the way in which insurance companies use assessors, of the way in which they use attorneys, of the relationship between attorneys and companies and between the companies and the assessors, in order to pinpoint the unnecessary or the hidden income which companies may possibly have via those channels, and in order to pinpoint and eliminate unnecessary costs. By taking such action the Management of the fund as it is handled now has already saved motor vehicle owners thousands, as it has also done in respect of the claimants, who, in any case, had to pay the legal costs, etc., from their income.</p>

<p>Lastly I want to mention something else; the hon. member did not do so, but I think I should do so straightaway, because I expect it will still be mentioned. I want to point out that we have even investigated the reason why certain of the claims become prescribed, thereby creating a deficiency. I made the disturbing discovery that in respect of the 58 attorneys&#x2019; firms which have to handle claims and settle matters, the average prescription amounted to only one over a period of one year, while five of them allowed 10, 6, 9 and 5, respectively, to become prescribed. In other words we are also investigating which legal firms are not carrying out their duties in this regard properly in respect of claims as such.</p>

<p>I want to conclude with this apsect by pointing out to the hon. member that we have already given notice of an amending Bill on compulsory third-party motor vehicle insurance. Hon. members will see in that notice that there are going to be quite a number of amendments, because, as a result of the departmental investigation we ourselves instituted, and as a result of the details ws gathered in this way, we have now pinpointed the various hoopholes and places in the Act &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>It should never have happened.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says it should never have happened, but this Parliament gave me the Act to administer. In that Act I found deficiencies which opened loopholes which made these things possible. I want to mention only one example. Parliament approved that there would be a M.V.A. Fund with a manager, without making provision for an assistant manager or an acting manager. In other words, Parliament approved an Act &#x2014;the hon. member is guilty of that together with us&#x2014;which did not provide for a person to act as manager when the manager was on leave or being used elsewhere. We had to take special steps to rectify this. I mention this so that hon. members may see that a very thorough scrutiny has been made of the way this fund and the Act have been administered, in order to ensure that one may render only the best services to the motoring public and people involved in accidents, and that their money is safeguarded. This relates to the fund as such.</p>

No allegation has been made by me or anyone on this side of the House against the integrity of the hon. the Minister of <span class="col_5415-5416" refersTo="page_1171"/>Transport or of the Deputy Minister. But certainly our allegations have been of incompetence so far as the Deputy Minister is concerned.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>In what way&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>That is the point which I made and I want to make it quite clear. The Deputy Minister commenced with a startling admission. The reason why he did not appoint a committee which should have been there to advise him and the manager, was because of the fact that the work was already being done by the premiums committee and the other committee. Those committees were in existence when the 1969 legislation was brought before this House. Why did the Minister ask for this further committee if the work was already being done by the existing committees&#x003F; It seems to me&#x2014;I cannot get away from it&#x2014;that the Minister somehow or other failed to carry out his responsibility to appoint the committee. First he said that it was not appointed, then he said it was appointed, but that it never met. Perhaps he will tell me when that committee was appointed in terms of section 25D and who were the members of that committee.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister said that the State does not pay commission in respect of loans. I agree 100 per cent. I agree with him entirely. But every investment made by this fund must carry his approval. The hon. the Minister himself said that in respect of investments with Iscor, the Eastern Province Building Society, and Santam Bank, commission was paid because it was arranged. I wish to refer to his answer to a question on 7th March this year. When he was asked about commission, he answered and then asked that a further question should be tabled. He then said, in column 477, that commission was paid when it was a condition of the investment. Sir, he asks what we are getting at&#x003F; Did he unintentionally approve of loans which involved commission being paid, whether it was to the fund or to anybody else&#x003F; Because if so, then he is obviously not fit to be put in a position to approve of the investment of funds by this particular committee.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister went off at a tangent which was irrelevant to the debate and asked what the income would have been had he invested with the Public Debt Commissioners. While the Minister of Finance is appealing to the country to bring down interest rates this Minister enters the grey market with 9&#x00BD; per cent loans, with commission being paid as well. Sir, he says &#x201C;no money of the fund was lost&#x201D;. Every cent paid to assessors and legal advisers by the M.V.A. Fund itself is a loss to that fund if the cases were not those of uninsured or unidentified vehicles; because those costs and investigations should have been at the cost of the insurance companies concerned. Could the hon. the Deputy Minister answer this question for me: Who approves of the settlement of claims which are handled by the Fund, for example whether the amount is to be increased from R50 000 to R89 000 or R99 000&#x003F; In whose hands is the settlement of the amount to be paid for damages&#x003F; The Deputy Minister now indicates that he wants to build up a whole department of managers and under-managers to deal with work which can be done hy the insurance companies who are qualified and experienced and who know how to handle and settle cases of claims for damages. The hon. the Deputy Minister now wants to appoint assistant-managers, his own assessors, lawyers, counsel and so on, to deal with these particular cases. I am afraid that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s replies to the points which have been raised do not satisfy us. They certainly do not satisfy me. The Minister has failed lamentably, first of all, to see that assurances given by him as a Minister of the Government in this House, are observed&#x2014;which they were not&#x2014;in regard to the matters to be handled by this Fund.</p>

Secondly, I want to say that the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s reply still leaves it perfectly <span class="col_5417-5418" refersTo="page_1172"/>clear that he failed in his duty to appoint a committee to advise him and to control the manager. He failed in his duty to do that. Thirdly, these investments which he made and approved of to Monkor and these other companies, are investments which I believe do not bear the approval of the Treasury; they were contrary to Government policy. They were entering into the grey market and doing exactly what the Minister of Finance did not want to be done, namely spiralling the interest rates and supporting increased interest rates.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am very sorry that this thing about Gouws happened. Gouws was a very efficient official. Gouws was an official of the Department of Transport for many years. He came up right from the bottom until he reached the position which he occupied as manager of the Fund. Mr. Gouws saved the Fund and the motorists of this country very many millions of rand. Unfortunately, as very often happens, temptation comes in the way of an officer or individual, who then falls prey to such temptation.</p>

<p>But the hon. member speaks about the control of an official. Over the years there are many cases of thefts and fraud on the Railways. These cases are reported by the Auditor-General every year. Surely the hon. member does not hold the General Manager of Railways, or the Minister, responsible for that. You cannot control the activities of every individual.</p>

<p>The committee does not control the manager. The manager really had excessive powers. The manager controlled the funds of the insurance fund as well as they could be controlled. The manager of the insurance fund invested certain of these funds and received commission through companies that he formed. Thereon he received commission. That is actually the crime. Then of course it came out afterwards that he received bonds from certain members of the consortium, bonds that were more than 100 per cent of the price that he paid.

<p>As I said, Mr. Gouws was an efficient official. He was led into temptation and he fell prey to such temptation. We did what we could. When it came to my attention, the matter was immediately handed over to the Police. They are still busy with the investigations. The fact remains that the companies who paid him commission are as guilty, in my opinion, as he is. They knew that it was not necessary to do that. Why they did it will be established by the Police. I believe that one <span class="col_5419-5420" refersTo="page_1173"/>of the reasons why the Police investigations are so protracted is to get the necessary evidence from all the companies which actually paid commission to Gouws. They could have made voluntary admissions. That is probably one of the reasons why the investigations have not been completed. I can give the hon. member the assurance that I am as impatient as he is to have this investigation completed. Whether it is a criminal offence I do not know. It remains to be seen whether it is a criminal offence for any official to receive commission. That is a matter to be decided by the Attorney-General.</p>

<p>In regard to this grey market that the hon. member referred to, I have a list here of all the financial institutions in which money was invested. I have gone through the list, and there are only three institutions to which exception may be taken, namely Monkor Trust, Protocol Construction and Tuckers Land and Development Corporation. These are the only three, out of almost a few dozen institutions, such as the Sentrale Nywerheidsaksepbank, Santam, Sasbank, Trust Bank, National Industrial Credit Corporation, Bank van die O.V.S., etc., which are all banks, building societies and municipalities. These are not institutions in the grey market. As I have said, out of the whole list there are only three to which exception could be taken and to which I took exception when the list came to my attention, namely Monkor Trust, Protocol Construction and Tuckers Land and Development Corporation. Mr. Gouws had no right to invest any of the funds in those private companies. Unfortunately Mr. Gouws took it upon himself to invest this money before obtaining approval from the Deputy Minister.</p>

I repeat that I am very sorry this happened, because Mr. Gouws was an efficient officer of the department. There was never any suspicion that he had done anything wrong until I received the letter sent to the Prime Minister on behalf of the Law Society, I think, together with a number of documents, and then action was immediately taken. But to think that any Minister or Deputy Minister or head of a department can control the outside activities of any officer of his department is simply nonsense; you cannot do it. You do not find out that anything is wrong until it is brought to your attention. If one of these companies had complained that they had to pay commission to Mr. Gouws, action would have been taken immediately, but they did not do that so nobody knew about it.</p>

<p>*If there are any loopholes in the Bill, hon. members may move amendments in order to close all the loopholes. At the moment, however, we are dealing here with something which has happened, which is an accomplished fact. Good investments have been made at high rates of interest, all of them in safe institutions. Even the three companies mentioned here, are absolutely safe; there is nothing wrong with them, although I think it was wrong to have invested in them. Good interest was paid which saved the motorists of this country millions. Had it not been for that high interest, there would have had to have been an increase in the premium.</p>

<p>Sir, this is all I can say in regard to the whole matter.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Before concluding the matter, I just want to refer the hon. member again to his question in connection with the committee. We have three committees, the premium committee and the advisory committee, and section 25 (D) quoted by the hon. member reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister may, if he deems it expedient, appoint six persons in accordance with paragraph (b) as a committee which the manager of the MVA Fund may in his discretion consult about any business of that Fund and which may make the representations to the said manager in connection with any such business.</block>

<p>In other words, this committee had no advisory function to the Minister as such. It was a committee to be used by the manager of the MVA Fund. It says that each member of the committee shall be a person nominated by the registered company, after a request to that effect by the Minister to each registered company as a person suitable to represent registered companies on the committee, and shall be appointed for such period and on such conditions, if any, including a condition as to payment of allowances &#x2026; as the Minister may determine. In other words, this committee had no control whatsoever in connection with the investments. This committee could be called on by the MVA Fund manager at his own discretion. This committee was appointed.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member put another question to me, as to who approves of the claims. I have already given him the figure and of the different claims, of the 146 claims, which were referred to the Fund, 26 were handled by the Fund itself. The others were referred back.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>My question was who in the fund decides whether they are going to pay R5 000 or R50 000, as the case may be&#x003F;</p>

<p>The amount of the claim to be paid is decided by the manager alone.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister said that had they found that commission had been paid this would have been stopped. That is not the information the House received from the hon. the <span class="col_5423-5424" refersTo="page_1175"/>Deputy Minister because in column 476 of 7th March, 1972, the Deputy Minister was asked whether commission was paid in connection with investments made by the Motor Vehicle Assurance Fund and if so on what basis. He replied that commission was paid where it was offered as a specific condition of the investment. Then he was asked by whom&#x003F; and he mentioned lscor, the Eastern Province Building Society and Santam. Then he was asked how much commission was paid in 1971&#x003F; and he mentioned R3 500. Asked who approves of the investments, he answered that it was the Minister of Transport. Now if the investment is offered and commission is a condition of the investment, the Deputy Minister must have approved of the investment and of the commission being paid. Then he was asked what procedure was followed in making such investments. The reply was that quotations received from interested bodies were considered in the light of the availability of funds for investment, rates of interest, security and terms of repayment. Sir, I am simply saying that according to this reply from the Deputy Minister he was aware, whoever approved the loan, that commission was being paid at least in these three instances.</p>

<p>Sir, the first I heard about commission was when that question was put and I saw the replies drafted by the department. It came before me for approval and I saw that commission by certain of those companies had been paid to the Fund. I then said it was wrong. But when approval is given for an investment nothing is said about commission being paid or not. A list merely comes before the Minister of certain companies, municipalities or building societies in which money was going to be invested, but when that approval is given nothing is said about commission. Nothing is said to the effect that any offer has been made by any company. That is the usual submission which comes to the Minister. Then it is approved that a certain amount will be invested with certain financial institutions and building societies. But the first we heard about commission being paid, was when that reply was drafted. Then I said that must stop because it is not the function of the Fund to receive commission on any investments made of Fund money.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#winchester">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>There is just one further matter in regard to this question of commission. Last session I asked the hon. the Minister, in regard to investments, why he moved certain moneys from one institution to another, and his reply was simply because he got better interest rates. Well, that was fair enough. It was only natural. But if one looks at this particular issue we have been discussing this afternoon, these three companies &#x2014;and I do not want to go into the pros and cons of that again&#x2014;but if you look at the reply given by the Minister in so far as Monkor Trust is concerned, the commission earned there was 8 per cent. In reply to another question to the Minister, also this year, he told me that the average rate of commission earned by investments of the Fund, was 8,02 per cent. I am sorry, I mean interest. Here obviously the first investment to Monkor Trust was at a lower rate of interest than the average interest earned by the Fund. I want to point that cut to the hon. the Minister, that this certainly made that a particularly bad investment.</p>

<p>I would like to say this to the hon. the Minister of Transport. He mentioned earlier on, when he got up to speak, that he did the motorists of South Africa a tremendous favour by establishing the consortium. I do not want to go into all that again, but I would like to remind the hon. the Minister that if he had offered the same conditions to the insurance companies, with which he had differences at that stage, which the consortium now enjoys, there is not one insurance company in South Africa which would not have jumped at the opportunity to do business on that basis.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, they all want to come in now and the only person who is stopping them is the hon. the Minister himself. I would say to the hon. the Minister, as I have said to him before, that if he lets them all in, the Fund would be a good deal better run and claims would be a good deal better handled, and the public would get a better service than they get at present.</p>

<p><span class="col_5425-5426" refersTo="page_1176"/>Dealing just very briefly again with the Fund, I would like to put a question to the Deputy Minister, in reply to another answer he gave me to a question earlier this session. He told me what the premium income of the Fund was. The Deputy Minister gave me the premium income for the last financial year, 1972, the claims paid and the estimate of outstanding claims. This is the figure I would like to bring to the attention of the Deputy Minister. He gives the figure for outstanding claims of R54,9 million, or almost R55 million. This in itself is fair enough but the previous year the Deputy Minister gave me the figure as well, but then it was R35 million less than in 1971. I know that outstanding claims form the basis of working out any insurance figure, but I would like to say this to the hon. the Minister, that in my experience the increase from R20 million odd to nearly R55 million in outstanding claims shows that there is something radically wrong, either in his estimates for the previous year, or in his estimates for this year under review; and if that is so, I wonder how the Minister could have talked about the necessity of having to increase insurance premiums. There can be no necessity to increase premiums unless your arithmetic is a good deal better than it has been up to now. I can say to the hon. the Deputy Minister that he will have to come with far more convincing figures than he has come with up to now to convince me that this Fund is running into financial difficulties. I said to the Deputy Minister some time ago that it was my opinion that the consortium companies were doing very well out of this Fund, and the Deputy Minister must have agreed with me because he reduced the commissions shortly thereafter. I would say to the hon. the Deputy Minister that it is no good talking in this House, as he has done on previous occasions and in this session too, about threatening that motor vehicle insurance premiums may have to be increased if the accident rate continues. I would say to the hon. the Deputy Minister that he should do his homework a great deal better than he has done, if he wants to convince me of that argument, because the estimates of outstanding claims are either very wrong this year or have been very wrong in previous years.</p>

<p>I want to turn very briefly to the matter of road safety and I hope I can draw the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s attention to this particular aspect. I have addressed a number of notices to the new council bringing certain matters to its attention and I should like the hon. the Deputy Minister to draw the new council&#x2019;s attention in particular to the use of heavy vehicles on the roads. It would be very nice if I could have the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s attention.</p>

<p>There was recently a report on African ferry drivers between Durban and Johannesburg which showed that these drivers, who are driving for periods of up to 17 to 20 hours out of every 24, earn a salary of not more than R25 per week. I would ask the hon. the Deputy Minister to draw the new Road Safety Council&#x2019;s attention to this matter, because obviously the Durban-Johannesburg road today is more dangerous than any Grand Prix circuit in South Africa. While he is at it, he might also bear in mind the recommendation of certain authorities in Natal who suggest that heavy vehicles have a disc at the rear showing the speed at which they are authorized to travel. This would then show the public whether that vehicle is exceeding its regulated speed. While he is at it, the same thing might apply to passenger vehicles. Buses which travel between Durban and Pietermaritzburg certainly travel far in excess of a speed at which it would be safe for them to travel. I think in their case too a disc should be displayed at the rear of the vehicle or in the vehicle so that the passengers themselves could see the speed at which that vehicle is supposed to travel. I bring these matters to the attention of the hon. the Deputy Minister, because I believe these are matters of urgency and I wish them to be brought to the notice of the Road Safety Council.</p>

<speech by="#pienaar">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. A. PIENAAR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the matters raised here in connection with the Motor Vehicle Insurance Act, are matters about which the Minister and his department have a special knowledge, and he therefore will best be able to reply to them. I just want to mention that we shall have an opportunity in the near future of discussing in this House the whole question of the administration of the Motor Vehicle Insurance Fund when we deal with the amending Bill in question.</p>

<p>But I want to refer to a different subject. <span class="col_5427-5428" refersTo="page_1177"/>This concerns certain remarks which were made in the course of the recent hearing of the application for an increase in bus fares in Cape Town. I hasten to add that this hearing took place in public. It took place under proper control after the local road transportation board had received reports from cost accountants and due consideration had been given to all aspects of the matter. So I do not want to say anything whatsoever about the merit of the case. In the course of the hearing however, mention was made of three factors which contributed towards the increased bus fares in the Cape. These three factors are briefly as follows : In the first place, we have the development of the Coloured residential areas on the Cape Flats which are situated quite a long way from railway connections. The second factor is the question of the staggering of working hours during peak hours, and the third factor is the question of the congestion on our roads during peak hours. To my mind these three factors are probably the most important ones which have led to an application for higher bus tariffs and this was recognized by the local road transportation board. I take it that this was also accepted by the objectors because they did not appeal against these aspects.</p>

<p>As far as the last mentioned factor is concerned, that is the question of the congestion on our roads, I want to say that this is not a matter we can deal with here, because this is a matter which has its proper place in the negotiations between the bus companies and the local authorities concerned in the matter, namely the Cape Town Municipality as well as the other municipalities concerned in the area. I should imagine that it would ultimately lead to the local authorities, in their wisdom, deciding to establish, say, bus roads or bus lanes on which the buses would be able to travel at greater speeds and not be held up as a result of the excess traffic. More consideration could also be given to the possibility of these large buses travelling on freeways to avoid their having to stop too frequently at traffic control points. As a matter of fact, these aspects may be properly dealt with during negotiations between the bus companies and the local municipalities and do not really concern us in this House. We also have to bear in mind that if we were to continue building roads which can cope with the traffic during peak hours, we would be placing enormous costs and an enormous burden on the tax payers of this country. In addition, the building of these roads would necessarily lead to all kinds of side-effects such as the expropriation of valuable properties and the demolition of other properties which may be of historic value, or to other detrimental effects which are usually the result when these bigger and wider roads are built in our cities. If I had to build roads I would much rather build them in the border areas where our new industries have to be established. I mention these matters because we cannot simply allow these roads to be built in an uncontrolled and unlimited way, roads which are built merely to cope with traffic during peak hours. That is one factor I should like to mention.</p>

<p>The second factor is the question of the development of the Coloured townships on the Cape Flats and the establishment of these residential complexes from where the workers have to be conveyed to the various factories and places of employment. Apparently it is a fact that a road transport bus company functions at its best when it has to convey people over short distances. When the distances over which it has to convey people increase because there is no train traffic available, it becomes less economic. The reason for it is that buses cannot be used again and again during peak hours, that they cannot be used on the roads more than once and that, relatively speaking, the fares for short distances are higher than those for long distances. Surely the ultimate object of bus traffic is to get the people to the trains. The facts that our suburban train network on the Cape Flats has not been developed yet to the stage to provide for this, and the result is that the buses have to travel long distances.</p>

<p>To my mind the third factor is the most important one. This is one to which we are, at this early juncture, able to give attention to a certain extent. I have been informed on good authority that if we could have succeeded in staggering the starting times of our places of employment so that they extend over a longer period than the one and a half hour period which our peak hours last, if it could have been staggered over, say, three or four hours, it would even have been possible to avoid this increase in bus fares in the Cape. It would then have been possible for the bus companies to accept the increased costs. It has also been put to me on good authority that if we could succeed in staggering our working hours properly we would have been able to avoid this increase, the stagering <span class="col_5429-5430" refersTo="page_1178"/>of working hours naturally means that fewer vehicles have to be commissioned and used during peak hours. There would not have been such a busy time during which these vehicles had to be kept on the roads. There would be less traffic on the roads, and this would lead to a reduced cost structure as far as operations were concerned. We would even need fewer roads. In paragraph 357 of the report of the Marais Commission of Inquiry I notice that the staggering of working hours was one of the recommendations made by that commission. Paragraph 357 on page 46 reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The morning and evening peak periods for workers proceeding to and from work has become an urgent problem and, to relieve transport demands over two comparatively short periods of the day, the staggering of working hours has become a pressing necessity. In countries such as Japan, where public transport is utilised largely for the conveyance of workers concerted efforts have been made to spread out starting and finishing times. The support of public bodies was solicited and committees formed in different areas of large cities with the object of exploring all possible means of co-ordinating working hours not only of commerce and industry, but also of State departments.</block>

<p>The commission goes further with its recommendation and particularly in paragraph 358 it is suggested that certain promotional committees be established in our major centres which are in a position to negotiate with commerce and trade and other major employers in order to achieve such staggering of working hours. When we consider that approximately 84 per cent of our White population are at present living in our cities and that 97 per cent of our White population will be living in the cities towards the end of the century, we must appreciate that this will become more and more of a problem. I also studied that part of Hansard in which this report was dealt with in 1970, and it seems to me as if this is not a novel idea as far as the department is concerned. I suggest that the authority which should bear the responsibility of establishing these co-ordinating committees should be the Department of Transport because, in terms of the Motor Transportation Act, it is the responsibility of this Department to ensure that proper transport services are established and &#x2014;in my humble opinion&#x2014;to ensure that they function properly. I suggest that the initiative in regard to the establishment of this class of committees is the function of the Department of Transport, and that it may serve a useful purpose if this work could at least be initiated in some way or another.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Bellville has given us a very thoughtful speech. I think that on most of the matters that he mentioned, if not all, we have common cause. We are well aware of the problems raised by him. If one only looks at the biggest single item under the Transport Vote, namely the subsidization of railway non-White passenger services to and from the non-White townships, one sees that it has risen by R2 200 000 for the coming year to R16 300 000. This represents the loss upon the rail services only and it gives us some idea of the sort of problem that we are up against. It was interesting to hear him talk about such things as special bus lanes. I do not know whether he is aware of it, but this has been done with some success in Johannesburg. It is a very good idea if you can provide them. For the rest I would suggest some caution on the question of staggering working hours. It is a very nice thought to have and from the purely transport side of things it sounds very good. But one must remember that our entire commerce and industry rely to a very large extent on synchronization, and this includes the synchronization of working hours. I want to raise two questions with the hon. the Minister this afternoon.</p>

<p>The first one is in regard to the national road to the South of Johannesburg, from Johannesburg to the Orange Free State border. A few weeks ago I put a question to the hon. the Minister which was replied to by the Deputy Minister. I asked what the position was with this new road. He told me that the planning of the road had been completed with the exception of a short section in the vicinity of Baragwanath airport. He also told me that construction was not envisaged to commence before the 1973-&#x2019;74 financial year. He then went on to say that if the construction continued as planned, the road would be completed by 1977. I want to remind this hon. Minister that what we are dealing with here is one of the most important and heavily used trunk routes in the country, especially when one <span class="col_5431-5432" refersTo="page_1179"/>considers that it bears virtually the entire traffic not only between Johannesburg and Pretoria and the South, but also that between Johannesburg and Vanderbijlpark and areas such as that. Not only at peak hours, but at any time during the day or night, this road is totally unsuited to the density of the traffic and I think that those who have travelled on it are aware that it can be positively dangerous. I would like to know from the hon. the Deputy Minister why there have been these tremendous delays in planning the road and also why we have to wait this length of time for construction to begin. This is important, especially when one sees other areas of the country with very good access roads to major towns like we have in the Cape. The Cape Town/Paarl road is a very good one and the new road to Somerset West is outstanding. The road between Johannesburg and Vanderbijlpark can fairly be described as the Cinderella of our national roads. I hope the hon. the Minister will be able to tell us that something is being done to speed things up.</p>

<p>There is another matter I would like to touch on, and that has to do with the application of the National Road Safety Act, which was passed this session. I want to ask the hon. the Minister, and I am doing this by way of a probe, whether this National Road Safety Act is goin to be applied to the Transkei. Will the National Road Safety Act be applied to the Transkei&#x003F;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>Perhaps the hon. the Deputy Minister will just bear with me for a moment. Part B of the First Schedule to the Transkei Constitution Act, No. 48 of 1963, says that &#x201C;The regulation and control of road traffic, including the licensing and control of vehicles and the drivers of vehicles in the Transkei, but excluding all matters dealt with in the Motor Vehicle Insurance Act of 1942, shall fall within the purview of the Transkei Government.&#x201D; I do not think it can be argued that the 50 cent levy being imposed in terms of the National Road Safety Act, has in fact got anything directly to do with the Motor Vehicle Insurance Act. In fact, it is simply being collected along with third-party premiums. I would suggest that this House, in fact, might not have had the power to legislate in respect of road safety and in respect of this levy as far as the Transkei is concerned. We should get clarity on this, particularly now, as levies are in fact being collected in the Transkei along with the third-party premiums.</p>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it has now become almost a routine for the aspect of road safety and related matters to be raised every year under the discussion of this Vote. This has been done this year as well by hon. members on both sides of the House. It is a fact that there is a great measure of agreement in this connection when this matter in regard to road safety is debated. There is not only agreement among us in this House, but also among the public outside in regard to this matter. We know that this matter enjoys a great deal of public attention. Public attention is constantly being focussed on road safety, to such an extent that to some people it has, in fact, become commonplace. We know that particularly during long week-ends, at a time such as the Easter week-end, when people want to travel quickly from places such as Pretoria and Johannesburg to the coast to benefit from the short break, the roads get busier and the offices emptier. On occasions such as these the motor cavalcades move bumper to bumper at a rate of between 800 and 1 000 per hour on certain of our roads. It is particularly in this heavy traffic that it is necessary for the person behind the steering-wheel to have the correct approach from a scientific and psychological point of view and to have the right attitude and frame of mind as far as road use is concerned. These things have been said on numerous occasions and this <span class="col_5433-5434" refersTo="page_1180"/>is just by way of repetition as far as this matter is concerned. It is actually being said that the person behind the steering-wheel should be educated. It is quite difficult to educate a grown-up person who has been driving a motor vehicle for a long time. Nevertheless, this is a task one should never relinquish and with which one should keep on.</p>

<p>From time to time the public is called upon to give its considered opinion as to how road accidents are caused, and in what way road accidents should be counteracted. Such an opinion poll was conducted in the Transvaal some time ago and shed quite interesting light on the public opinion in regard to accidents and their causes. Suggestions for counteracting accidents may be divided under the following categories, expressed as a percentage. To me this is quite interesting. This is what the opinion poll has shown : 39 per cent of the people want the law to be applied more strictly; 29 per cent want driver&#x2019;s licences to be controlled more strictly; 10 per cent want better road conditions; 7 per cent want sterner steps to be taken against liquor and drugs; 6 per cent want sterner action to be taken against speeding; 3 per cent want sterner action to be taken against unroadworthy vehicles, while 6 per cent have requests of a miscellaneous nature. When analysing this information we find that approximately 80 per cent of the suggestions relate to the people who regard the driver as the major cause of road accidents. In other words, the human factor remains the uncertain factor in road usage. When speaking of education, it has been recommended here in the past that a subject of this nature be introduced in schools, whether in primary or in high schools. I think that apart from the fact that elementary lessons are being given in regard to road safety in primary schools, it is more essential that this be introduced in high schools. Sir, I am very grateful that something in this connection is now going to take place in high schools in the Transvaal. I think this is being done in the high schools here in the Cape Province as well, and most probably throughout the whole of the Republic, namely that a subject called &#x201C;Youth preparedness&#x201D; is now being introduced. In regard to this subject, specific attention is being given to road use and vehicle maintenance. I am going to quote just one sentence from this curriculum which is being recommended. It reads as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the educational sphere we are compelled once more to take cognizance of this &#x2026;</block>

<p>&#x201C;Of this&#x201D; relates to the death-toll on account of road accidents.</p>

<p>&#x2026; and confront ourselves with the question whether enough is being done, particularly in secondary schools, to try and avoid our people from bleeding to death on our roads.</p>

<p>I am particularly grateful&#x2014;and I have noted this with gratitude&#x2014;that it has been mentioned here today that this aspect has, indeed, been introduced in this subject of &#x201C;Youth preparedness&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Sir, people have a saying that immature driving and driving under the influence of liquor are the major causes of motor accidents. As far as driving under the influence of liquor is concerned, there are strict regulations and rules. Throughout the whole world severer measures are being taken in this connection. As far as immature driving is concerned, I should like to make a few comments. This does not only apply to people who, as young people, obtain their driver&#x2019;s licences but to anybody who obtains a driver&#x2019;s licence. I feel that the young person and any other person who obtains a driver&#x2019;s licence should be subjected to a trial period&#x2014;I am raising this matter in order to have the principle accepted&#x2014;of six months or a year. To my mind there should be some indication on the back of the vehicle that the person has been subjected to a trial period, as we have the indication in the case of a learner driver who is learning to drive a motor vehicle. In case an offence is committed during that time, the trial period for that particular person recommences. Let us be practical in regard to this matter. A person arrives at half past eleven in the morning at a test centre. Until half past eleven he is subject to the regulations and rules of a learner driver. He obtains his driver&#x2019;s licence at 12 o&#x2019;clock and he then has the same rights and privileges any driver of a motor vehicle has. In other words, he is allowed to travel at the same speed in the towns or wherever it may be. This is being applied in various other states and countries of the world, and I think some attention should be given to this idea to see whether this cannot be done in our country.</p>

<p>Further, Sir, I think that the requirements laid down for obtaining a driver&#x2019;s <span class="col_5435-5436" refersTo="page_1181"/>licence should be much stricter. I believe that, <i>inter alia,</i> a written test should be passed by anybody applying for a driver&#x2019;s licence. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Sir, over the years I have raised the problem of the national road linking Port St. Johns with the rest of the Republic. I have received no satisfaction. I raised this matter last year under the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote, hoping that I would get some assistance from him, but all he did was to refer me to a reply which a deputation had received from the hon. the Deputy Minister the year before. I am glad that the hon. the Minister of Finance and the hon. the Minister of Transport are here, because I want members in the Cabinet to hear what I have to say.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, both Ministers will know, especially the Minister of Finance, what the position is, because he, in another capacity, once appointed a committee to go into the question of the development of Port St. Johns. He and Mr. Haak were the Ministers responsible for development at that time. The report which that committee brought out was that there could be no development at Port St. Johns except for tourism. That was the only development they could visualize for Port St. Johns; the Minister of Finance will remember that. Sir, there are two roads to Port St. Johns, one from Natal, via Kokstad, and the other from Umtata. Both these roads are supposed to be national roads. In 1965 I spoke to the hon. the Minister of Transport in this House about these roads and asked him what was being done about them. The reply that I got from him was this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The National Transport Commission has already approved the appointment of consulting engineers for the planning, design and preparation of contract documents in respect of the section of road from Baziya to Umtata and Libode &#x2026;</block>

<p>I might point out that Libode is on the way from Umtata to Port St. Johns&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; which will be built by contract. In regard to the location of the road from Port St. Johns to Port Edward, no indication can be given at this stage when the location of this section of road will be finalized. The terrain is difficult and will entail extensive investigation to determine the possible route.</block>

<p>Sir, that was in 1965. A private company was employed to survey the road from Baziya to Umtata and Libode. I do not know why not to Port St. Johns. Nobody knows why they were told to stop at Libode. That survey was completed some years ago, but nothing has been done about tarring that road or preparing it. From Libode on to Port St. Johns there has not even been a survey and, as the Minister knows very well, from Port St. Johns to Port Edward there has not been a survey. The road is not even located yet. There are only two ways of getting to Port St. Johns and that is via these roads; you cannot get there by sea and there is no aerodrome. I put a question to the hon. the Minister this year as to the road transport service to Port St. Johns and as to what interruptions there had been. The reply I got was that there was no passenger service from Kokstad to Port St. Johns on the 12th, 14th and 22nd January, and on the 4th, 5th and 21st to 26th February. There was no contact with Port St. Johns at all. They tried to make special efforts to get perishables down to Port St. Johns with a big truck, but the truck could get no further than Flagstaff, so Port St. Johns was completely cut off during that period from Kokstad. From the Umtata side it was cut off on the 11th, 12th and 22nd January and on the 4th, 11th, 21st and 26th February. The goods truck was unable to travel from the 21st February to the 28th February, so Port St. Johns could get no goods at all from the Umtata side during that period. Sir, the people in Port St. Johns are dependent on that road. They are farmers and their farm produce must get to the outside market. I understand that one of the hotels kindly undertook to store the cream for the farmers in its refrigerated room until the road was open again for them to get the cream away. The guests were unable to get down to the hotel, and on certain days there was no way of getting out of Port St. Johns on either road, because the roads on both sides were blocked. The construction and the maintenance of roads, as the hon. the Minister has often pointed out, is not financed out of the ordinary sources out of which national roads are financed. A special grant has to be made by the Treasury. The grant this <span class="col_5437-5438" refersTo="page_1182"/>year is R1 million. Last year it was R990 000, so it has gone up by R10 000 this year. Sir, I ask the Minister: What can be done with R1 million&#x003F; I understand that the average cost of constructing a national road today is in the vicinity of R150 000 per mile. With R1 million you cannot even construct 10 miles of road in a year, quite apart from maintaining the road. Sir, this Government has a duty to the people in Port St. Johns. They were assured by the late Dr. Verwoerd and by this Prime Minister that their interests would be protected. They are in an isolated spot surrounded by what may become foreign territory. At the moment it is controlled by the Transkei Government, and the Transkei Government controls the national roads as well, although they are not responsible for constructing them. They are responsible for the maintenance, as the hon. the Deputy Minister told me the other day. Rut, of course, they only maintain roads out of the money that they get from the Government. This road is unusable at certain times because the rivers overflow the bridges. Port St. Johns is completely cut off when the bridges are under water. Surely something can be done to build new bridges so that Port St. Johns will not be cut off in this manner&#x003F; My information) from the farmers&#x2019; association is that every time they have a rainfall of half an inch or more, the rivers come down and these bridges are unusable. I say that the Government has a duty to the people living down there and that is why I want to appeal to the Minister of Finance to use his influence with the Cabinet. I wish the hon. the Minister of Finance would listen to me for a moment. He appointed a committee once before and he knows what the position is there. I am appealing to him to use his influence in the Cabinet to see that a bigger grant is given. The Minister of Transport always gives me the same answer: &#x201C;I cannot get the money.&#x201D; Sir, are we going to go on like this&#x003F; This has been going on for 10 years now, and I make a final appeal to these two Ministers to use their influence with the Cabinet to see that something is done about that road. The Minister of Tourism met a deputation here, and he was very sympathetic. He agreed that what the touring public wants is a tarred road, not a gravel road, but he could do nothing to help them. He is not in charge of roads, but he is in the Cabinet, and I want him also to join these other two Ministers in using his influence in the Cabinet to get more money set aside for those roads in the Transkei. We are desperate. The roads were taken from the provincial council and it is now the responsibility of this Government to see that they are properly maintained and that proper bridges are built and also that the construction of the tarred roads should commence, because we cannot leave the roads in that state. There is the other national road to Umtata, the stretch from Umtata into East London. It has now become worse than it has ever been. It is a hazard today. It has been patched up but that is not sufficient. There are big potholes in the road. The Minister will know that plans were drawn up to build a new road to bypass Umtata and to meet the national road to Queenstown, but what has happened in that regard&#x003F; No money has been set aside yet for that undertaking.

<speech by="#schlebusch">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. SCHLEBUSCH</person>:</from>

<p>In the course of this debate today we have heard a great deal about road safety, and each of us is indeed concerned about the tremendously high death-toll claimed by our roads. The slaughter on our roads is such that we all feel that any contributory factor which may be the cause of accidents, should be eliminated. That is why I felt that I wanted to mention briefly a few aspects which should be taken into account. One of these aspects are these convoys of new motor vehicles travelling on our roads from the assembling factories to the interior. These convoys, in themselves, present a very great danger to us. We all feel that if they can be avoided, we should do so. The large vehicle-carriers which are on our roads, are another danger. We could eliminate them by having new cars transported to the interior by the Railways. This is high-rated traffic for the Railways, and, in any case, the cost of the railage is already added to the purchase price of the vehicle, and the buyers of vehicles will also be much happier, because the speedometers of these vehicles are disconnected and one is not always sure of the mileage done without the speedometer registering it. For that reason I feel that it is in the interests of all of us, but especially with a view to the accident rate, that these licences be withdrawn. If they could be eliminated, it would add to our convenience on the roads.</p>

<p>A second factor is the question of the speed limit. It has been proved time and again that high speed is responsible for very serious accidents. Since we have such a high accident rate, I think the time has <span class="col_5439-5440" refersTo="page_1183"/>arrived for us to call a halt and take drastic action. To my mind this speed limit of 70 miles per hour should only be allowed on roads built in such a way as to permit of high speeds, i.e. on the dual-carriage roads and the national roads, but on the other roads we should reduce that speed limit. On those roads we should stipulate a maximum speed of 60 miles per hour. It was proved, at the time when the speed limit was introduced on the public roads, that proportionately the number of accidents on the public roads as against the urban roads, to which the speed limit had already been applicable at the time, showed a marked decline and that hundreds of lives had been saved as a result of that speed limit of 70 miles per hour. I feel that we should do something drastic in order to prevent accidents occurring because of this factor.</p>

<p>Then there is another factor, namely recklessness. Here I want to link up with an appeal I made last year. Perhaps I did not phrase it clearly enough. The hon. member for Port Natal also referred to it indirectly. This appeal is that if we introduce a speed limit, we may now allow all vehicles to travel at the same speed. In many parts of the world it is the practice for a heavy vehicle to display next to its number plate an indication as to the maximum speed at which it may travel. I believe that this is essential. I myself have often driven a heavy motor vehicle. It is perilous to drive such heavy vehicles on our roads at high speeds. They are not as easy to handle as are ordinary vehicles, and for that reason they should have a lower maximum speed limit, and that should be displayed on the back of the motor vehicle. I also want to associate myself with what was said by the hon. member for Koedoespoort in regard to drivers&#x2019; licences. That person who has just obtained his driver&#x2019;s licence, should at least serve a probationary period, and an indication to this effect should be displayed on his car so that everybody may see that he is still serving a probationary period, and then it would be the duty of every motorist to watch this person and to report him, because he would still be serving his probation; and if such persons were serving such a probationary period of one year, I am convinced that they could drive much more cautiously, for in the course of that year they would learn to drive more cautiously and slowly. Then there is a certain large enterprise which uses many vehicles. On each of their vehicles they have two drivers who take turns at driving, and in this manner they have reduced their accident rate by two-thirds, just because that driver has the responsibility that if he makes an accident, he is dismissed. This has made them realize that they must drive cautiously.</p>

<p>There is another matter I should like to mention, and that is to urge people to be cautious. There are many motor-drivers who do not care whether they have an accident or not; it does not matter to them, because they are insured, and it is the insurance company that has to bear all the costs. I simply feel that even if his motor car is fully insured, he should personally bear part of the costs if he is involved in an accident for which he is responsible, and that this should not be shifted on to the insurance company. Let us say, for instance, that he has to pay R50 if it is his first offence and R100 if it is his second, and that the fines may increase in this manner; if that were the case, such a person would really feel it if that money were deducted from his salary, if he worked for a salary. Then he would realize that he should drive more cautiously. It would also make our motor insurance much cheaper if they received those contributions from such persons. My motor car insurance is such that I have to bear the first R200, and I get a very big reduction on my premium because they know that I will drive cautiously.</p>

<p>I want to mention one other matter. I want to refer to the consortium&#x2019;s third-party insurance. Contemptuous reference was made to it here, but I really feel that the consortium that was established at the time, has provided us with a constant premium for the years since 1965. In looking at the trend of all other things and the number of accidents occurring, I am convinced that we would have paid double those premiums if the Government had not stepped in and established this consortium and, by doing so, kept premiums on a fixed basis up to now. I just want to express my sincere thanks for the fact that it has been possible for us in recent years to save the motor-car owners these millions of rand in extra premiums. We hope and trust that they will stand firm in future and take every precautionary measure to see that these premiums are not increased.</p>

<p>I shall give that to the hon. member just now. The Kei River-Umtata road which is 60 miles long, will cost us R3 800 000. The Umtata-Port St. John&#x2019;s road, which is 61 miles long, will cost us R7 300 000. Then there is another 70 miles of road between Port St John&#x2019;s and Port Edward. The section of route B which is outside the Transkei and which is 154 miles long, will cost us R11 500 000, and the 66 miles in the Transkei will cost us R6 600 000. That gives us a total amount of R30 587 000 and provision is made therefore in the memorandum which will be laid before the Cabinet. If possible we shall see what the maximum amount is we can get to use in the whole area. However, the whole matter is one of funds. I am glad that the hon. member has made a special plea to the Minister of Finance so that the Minister of Finance, if possible, could also make a plea to the Cabinet in connection with these problems.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I see the hon. member for Green Point is not here at the moment.</p>

<p>Since hon. members have referred once again to the sums of money invested with Monkor Trust, Protocol Constructions and Tuckers Land Development Corporation, I want to refer hon. members to the reply I furnished in the House of Assembly in this regard. As far back as 7th March, 1972, I stated in this House, in reply to a question, that a total amount of R6&#x00BD; million had been invested at between 8 per cent and 9&#x00BD; per cent interest with township developers, i.e. Monkor, Tuckers Land Development Corporation and Protocol Constructions, and that this had merely been done in order to exploit the high rate of interest. I approved these investments <i>ex post facto.</i> I emphasize the fact that these investments were approved by me <i>ex post facto,</i> because I was satisfied that all of them were properly guaranteed. This links up with the statement made here by the hon. the Minister. The rates of interest in this regard, which the hon. member questioned, are as follows: The interest rate on the investment with Federale Finansies is 8,5 per cent; the interest rates on the three investments with Monkor Trust, are 8 per cent, 8,625 per cent and 9 per cent. The interest rates offered by Protocol Constructions are 9,5 per cent and 9,5 per cent, and those offered by Tuckers Land Development Corporation are 9,5 per cent in respect of all three amounts, i.e. R1 million, R500 000 and R500 000.</p>

<p>The congestion of traffic in the urban areas, the urban transport facilities for the entire Republic, in other words, in the metropolitan areas. The terms of reference of the committee are&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) To submit a report and make recommendations on &#x2026;</li>

<p>In other words, this committee will cover the problems posed by the hon. member properly, even the possibility of underground or tube trains, etc. The committee has to review this entire matter. In addition the committee is requested to have submitted at least an interim report by the end of September, 1972, in which general guidelines are indicated for the directions in which it thinks to find the solution to the problems mentioned in its terms of reference. I hope it will be able to do so, for it is really a tremendous task. The committee consists of the following members : the chairman is Mr. Driessen, Secretary for Transport.</p>

<p>No, there is the City Treasurer of Durban, and we also have the City Engineer of Johannesburg. I want to satisfy the hon. member for Yeoville that such a committee, which I think is a very competent one, will be able to represent widespread interested parties properly. I also believe that the committee will be able to examine properly the requirements set by the entire economic infrastructure and South Africa&#x2019;s growth and planning. The hon. the Minister of Finance appointed this committee and instructed it to proceed with its business. I think that we should even at this early stage say to this committee&#x2014;this is something which we must realize&#x2014;that its report will revolve for the most part around the question of finances, for as the hon. member said, a tube train in Johannesburg alone could cost millions. It will have to be ascertained what contributions the local authority bodies, etc., are able to make. I do not want to anticipate the task of the committee, for this is really a tremendous task which has been entrusted to the committee. I want to express the hope that this committee will be able to submit to us a programme and a plan according to which we will be able to proceed.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member also mentioned the question of road safety and asked whether we are planning with the necessary imagination.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I did not say that. I referred to catching the imagination of the public.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member asked whether there would be a campaign to educate the public. First of all, I want to mention that the present board as it is constituted at the moment, consists <i>inter alia</i> of Prof. Riekert, the vice-chairman of the C.S.I.R., a member who has already for a long time been appointed by the C.S.I.R. to undertake research in connection with road safety. I do not think that we could have a more suitable person.</p>

<p>*To indicate how important this post is I must indicate to you that the salaries attached to this part-time chairman&#x2019;s post is R4 800 per annum. The deputy chairman is Mr. Stofberg, one of the senior engineers in our country. He is attached to one of our largest consulting engineering firms dealing with the construction of roads, road safety, and so on. In addition we have the five members of the various executive committees, and the Secretary for Transport, the Secretary for Justice and the Commissioner of Police. Then there is in addition a member representing the municipal associations. We regard the post of director as being so important that we have made the salary attached to the post R10 800 per annum. This post is going to be advertised. <span class="col_5447-5448" refersTo="page_1187"/>I want to express the hope that this director with his staff, and also this council, will not also become a mere documentation centre, as happened with previous councils &#x2014;and I am saying this without making any complaint against the old councils&#x2014;but that their approach to this matter will be a revolutionary one. I agree with the hon. member for Yeoville that education is one of the most important aspects of this matter. He himself asked whether there was no break-down in communication between drivers of motor cars, and asked whether we had the right road consciousness. He said that there were devices which could be installed in a motor car to test the reactions of a driver, his reflexes at the possibility of an accident. This new council has been instructed to investigate all these requirements thoroughly to see what we can do in this connection to ensure road safety. I should like to add to that the ideas expressed by hon. members on the opposite side. In the same way as the hon. member for Durban Point, the hon. member for Yeoville went further from that point and came to the Jan Smuts Airport, and spoke about long-term planning. I want to say at once hat there is thorough long-term planning in regard to airports. In this long-term planning the following is taken into account or considered : The motorized traffic, the air traffic, the passenger traffic and the runway and taxiway capacities, the apron capacity, the capacity of the buildings, the movements on the runway, aircraft accommodation, and roads. Then there are still the additional parallel main runways, the aprons. etc. Long-term planning is properly investigated by the master planning committee. etc. The hon. member said that the problem was that we had waited too long. Firstly. I want to tell him that we think that the Jan Smuts airport will be fully complete by July, except for the tube (<i>duin</i>) which may possibly be constructed later. It is planned to construct in future a tube providing access from the one building to the other. This is the so-called telescopic passageway. The construction thereof has been postponed as a result of financial and other restrictions. It will be possible for the Jan Smuts Airport to be placed in full use in July, and I hope that the opening ceremony will take place in October or November. It is true, however, that during the entire construction and development programme there, there have been a tremendous number of problems, and there had to be adjustments in moving from one building to another. Passengers for the Boeing 747 on the internal services had, for example, to be accommodated in the space provided for the 727s and 737s. As a result of the building operations which are in progress, therefore, there has been congestion. But I think that I can say without fear of contradiction that when this building has been completed, it will be possible to compare it to the best in the world. This building will not only have all the facilities for processing passengers and baggage, but it will also have the space. Architecturally, this building will also be a showpiece for the whole of South Africa. I think we will then be able to be proud of this building.</p>

<p>I come immediately to the problem of the D. F. Malan building.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>What about the parking&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Since the hon. member has asked me now, I can furnish him with the information in regard to the parking. The parking facilities have of course been leased to a company, after tenders were called for. Those parking garages are in fact for the convenience of the passengers. The building was of course erected by the Department of Public Works. The tariffs there are as follows: Up to two hours it is 20 cents. From two to three hours, it is 50 cents; from three to five hours it is 80 cents; from five to eight hours it is R1: from eight to 12 hours it is R1.20: from 12 to 16 hours it is R1,40; from 16 to 20 hours it is R1,60 and from 20 to 24 hours it is R1.80. Now the hon. member has requested that one should receive a discount on the parking tariffs if one has a valid air ticket. If this has to be done, it can only be done in one way, i.e. by adding the amount of that discount to the price of the ticket. If that is not done, the South African Airways will have to suffer that loss, for we are in the position that there is only a certain amount of parking space, which has been allocated under contract to a tenderer who had to incur very considerable capital costs in order to make the necessary provision and who had to furnish the necessary guarantees, as well as assure the Tender Board that he would provide these services. One could not expect him to decide arbitrarily what concessions he was going to make to which people, for he would not know how many short-term travellers, how many long-term <span class="col_5449-5450" refersTo="page_1188"/>travellers, etc., there would be. He has to provide these services in accordance with this scheme. That is the problem I have in this connection.</p>

<p>Now the hon. member, as well as the hon. member for Durban Point referred to the D.F. Malan airport. They raised many objections to the improper functioning and inefficiency of D.F. Malan.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I did not do that. I only complained about the delivery of baggage at Jan Smuts. I said that at D. F. Malan it was much better.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Some people say that it is much worse at D. F. Malan. It depends upon the circumstances on a specific day, and what aircraft are arriving. The fact of the matter is&#x2014;this has to be taken into consideration; I want hon. members to realize this in the first place&#x2014;that neither the D. F. Malan nor the Louis Botha Airports were initially planned to take a 747. The 747s were purchased with the specific idea of using them on overseas flights. After we had already made considerable progress with the planning, the South African Airways, after a very proper and thorough analysis of the circumstances and the growth rate of the passengers, etc.&#x2014;if members would like it I could mention the growth rate to them&#x2014;made a projection and found that from 1973 onwards 19 aircraft would leave D. F. Malan daily, bound for the north, in other words, a 707, a 727 or a 737 would leave every 20 minutes. On the basis of that projection it was then found and decided that there would be an extremely big saving if we also used a few 747s on the flight to convey those passengers, instead of using so many aircraft. This would be a saving in flight staff, fuel and in various other respects. That is why the 747 has been commissioned. I want to admit candidly that at Louis Botha our department is not yet prepared to accommodate 747s. It is a question of finances etc. The growth rate in air traffic in South Africa was three times greater than our ordinary economic growth rate; it was more than 12,7 per cent. The growth rate in our air traffic was also greater than our population growth rate. People have become air travel-conscious, and it is for that reason that we have a backlog. At the same time we must take into account the fact that we experienced many problems as a result of the building alterations at D. F. Malan. I therefore want to ask hon. members to exercise a little patience in this regard. D F. Malan will be in full use by the end of the year, with all the new facilities, and then we will no longer have these problems.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked me what our altitude is in regard to the motor industry and the motor-car owner. He even asked whether we regard motorists as a burden. He mentioned very interesting figures here, which indicated that the increase in the number of motor-cars in South Africa has been 12 per cent per annum over the past four years. The hon. member also said that there is no country in the world, apart from the United States of America, which may be compared to South Africa in this respect. Sir, if that is true, is that not an admission of South Africa&#x2019;s high standard of living&#x003F; We must not claim today that the standard of living in South Africa is low, and then contradict this statement tomorrow with figures such as these. I call the hon. member to witness that with the exception of the United States of America the annual increase in the number of motor-cars in South Africa, as a percentage is greater than in any other country in the world. Here we have proof of the high standard of living of our people in South Africa, and of our economic welfare. In this respect we surpass the rest of the world.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Even if they are included, our standard of living is still high. Sir, I want to tell the hon. member that it is not the policy of this Government to regard the motor industry as a burden. The hon. member said that as a result of the local content of motor-cars, motor-cars in South Africa were more expensive; but we are giving the necessary impetus to the motor-car industry, and giving the necessary infrastructure a shot in the arm wherever we are able to do so, precisely because we regard the motor industry as industrial development not only to provide the Whites with labour, but to provide all sectors in South Africa with labour. The policy of the National Party Government is to encourage industrial development in South Africa, and we are spening millions on constructing as many safe roads as possible, precisely in <span class="col_5451-5452" refersTo="page_1189"/>order to lend further assistance to the motor industry.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member also referred to taxation and costs, the excess profit on the transport of oil and petrol, motor vehicle insurance and the larger local content of motor vehicles. Sir, those items can be discussed when we deal with the Department of Commerce.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>That was just to illustrate my point.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I accept that. But if the hon. member has any problems in regard to these items, he can raise the matter when we deal with the Department of Commerce.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Kimberley North made a very fine plea here in regard to the sea rescue organization. I am pleased that the hon. member raised this matter here. We have a search and rescue organization, in which the following departments are involved: The Department of Transport; the South African Police; the South African Railways, which includes harbour services and lighthouses; the S.A. Airways; the main Post Office; and the Department of Defence, which includes the South African Air Force, and the South African Navy. This organization, which is known as Tekstar, deals with the calls, for assistance etc. of the Sea Rescue Institute, the people who do the searching. At the moment, as the hon. member was quite right in saying, this organization, for which he made a plea here, is being subsidized. In 1970-&#x2019;71 it asked for R48 000 and only received R24 000. In the 1971-&#x2019;72 financial year it asked for R50 000 and again received only R24 000. In 1972-&#x2019;73 it pointed out that it had to acquire new vessels; that its vessels were too small to cope with certain ocean conditions and it asked for R44 500, or approximately R50 000. I just want to tell the hon. member that we are aware of the altered circumstances, and that Tekstar is investigating the matter all over again to determine to what extent the patrol boats of the Department of Industries can be involved in rescue work and what the future responsibility for rescue work of the vessels of its organization, the N.S.R.I., the Department of Industries, the South African Navy and the harbour tug boats should be. After this investigation they will make recommendations in regard to this 1973-&#x2019;74 subsidy. We shall consider the plea made here by the hon. member carefully, and I hope that we may perhaps be able to help. Sir, I am very pleased that we have people who, out of love for their fellow-men, make their own time available free of charge to do this good work.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Point objected very strongly to the fact that the report of the Department was only laid upon the Table today. I think he has reason to object, but let us consider what the position is. The report was completed by my department in October, 1971. My department made the report available to the Government Printer in 1971 already, but the printing was delayed as a result of an accumulation of printing work. My department had to return this report three times to have printing errors in the translation and in the data corrected, so that hon. members may rely upon it that the data as published is the correct data. This report could have been Tabled three days ago, but then we found further errors, in the English version only, which had to be rectified by means of an errata list. This, unfortunately resulted in a further delay of two days, and I am apologizing for that, but my department is not to blame for the delay. We shall in future see to what extent we can expedite the report. It is not a question of contempt for hon. members of this House. If hon. members had wanted any information, on the basis of the previous year&#x2019;s report, they could at any time have received that information by way of questions on the Order Paper, or by contacting the department directly. They could have done so if they had wanted information on which to base a case they may have wanted to make out in this debate.</p>

<p>The hon. member has stated in regard to the Louis Botha Airport that he sees there is only R50 for the building in the Estimates. Firstly, I want to make it very clear that the Department of Transport is not constructing the buildings. That is the task of Public Works. The Department of Transport has already asked for the money and that this should be regarded as a priority service, as priority No. 1, because Louis Botha is also an emergency airport for the 747s. My department is only constructing the runways and the apron. It is merely a question of finances. That is the only problem.</p>

<p>The hon. member also put a question in regard to La Mercy. There is a Cabinet <span class="col_5453-5454" refersTo="page_1190"/>committee of finances which has approved an initial amount of R100 000 appearing in the Estimates. This is in the Loan Estimates, and is in respect of La Mercy airport. But now our department has also instructed the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure to institute an investigation, and to submit a comprehensive memorandum, in conjunction with the Department of Public Works, on what the costs there will be. This Department is proceeding with its planning in regard to the airport. We are not putting a stop to it. The planning is proceeding in conjunction with the Department of Public Works and the South African Airways. It is a question of finances. But hon. members who know Natal know what the topography of Natal is like. We had to investigate the whole of Natal for the best airport which could serve Durban. We cannot build an airport which could serve Durban and Richard&#x2019;s Bay. We cannot build an airport which is further from Jan Smuts than La Mercy, for then one would have administrative costs in regard to management and transport, and these would be so high that it would be uneconomic. I think my department has made a very thorough and comprehensive investigation, and this is the only place. La Mercy has not been shelved. Now there is still the investigation in regard to costs, etc., which has to be done.</p>

<p>A final decision has been taken that the airport which has to be constructed for Durban will be at La Mercy. But the purchase of land has not been finalized because a submission has to be made to the Cabinet as to what the costs of the entire undertaking would be.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parow raised one matter, which I just want to mention briefly. I think we must consider this, for what he said is something revolutionary. He said that for the sake of road safety we should consider whether it is not necessary for us to take over the traffic system. I want to tell you that we should rather think along the lines that we have provincial councils and local authorities in South Africa which are a political forum, but also an administratively essential unit in the control of the whole of South Africa. I am stating this quite candidly. We can utilize this, without taking it over into the Central Government, by simply compiling a co-ordinating and unifying action, and by infusing the correct guidance from our National Road Safety Council so as to provide activation. I believe we should think along those lines. Only if we do not succeed could we possibly consider the other aspect, but the accusation is frequently made that the Government may possibly want to abolish the provincial councils and the local authorities. Personally I see them as being not only an essential political forum, but in our present setup and in the structure of South Africa, as an essential administrative unit as well for every locality, for all circumstances and areas. We must simply see to what extent we can establish cohesion and coordination there, so that the work can be done. In respect of the other matters which he raised, i.e. that the licences should be provisional and that the drivers and the employers should have a sense of responsibility, I must tell him that I think that these are very important matters which we should take into consideration. The hon. member for Salt River also discussed road safety; he also discussed the airports, and I think that I have furnished a thorough reply in this regard.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member asked the question why the Public Works Department should build for the Department of Transport. I shall convey his request to the Cabinet.</p>

<p>*I am very pleased that the hon. member for Bethlehem raised the matter of whether modification or the removal of water from clouds so clearly. I think that in the past we knew very little about this subject. Firstly, I want to make it very clear that the Department of Transport, the only department undertaking weather modification and research in regard to weather modification has, of necessity, always had to deal with this matter, and will have to continue to do so in future. The department regards this entire undertaking as a research project. Personally I am very sorry that that corporation failed to do so because they wanted to commercialize it. They thought that making rain for people was a money-making project. We have already made R200 000 available for research in that sphere and we proceed from the assumption that it is a research project. However, we are still in the very initial stages of this development. <span class="col_5455-5456" refersTo="page_1191"/>I am pleased that the hon. member paid such a fine tribute to Mr. Du Toit, who in my opinion is one of the best officials in our department. Not only is he a very humble and modest person, but also a person who tackles a matter with religious conviction in recognition of the Creation and the natural conditions in the Creation. It was a fine testimonial the hon. member gave him.</p>

<p>In regard to the question of a glider, I shall have the matter investigated, and I shall see what we can do in this regard.</p>

<p>Well, if he was replying to another hon. member, that is all right. Then he asked me why there was a delay in the building of the road from Johannesburg to the south. There was no delay; it was only a question of financing. There was no delay whatsoever in the planning of that road. The planning is up to date.</p>

<p>He also mentioned the question of road safety and he asked whether the Act will be applied in the Bantu territories. I may reply to him that this was taken up by the Department of Bantu Administration and Development, and that the law advisers have also been approached. According to the law advisers and the Department of Bantu Administration and Development, the Bill will apply in the Bantu areas and in the Transkei as well.</p>

<p>*I think that with this I have replied fully to hon. members. I want to thank them all for the way in which they participated in this debate. I want to mention that the Department of Transport is perhaps one of these departments with the most differing functions. It has perhaps more functions than any other department. It is an extremely large department. We in the Department of Transport believe that the entire industrial development is constructed on the correct communication system, whether it is by road, or by air through the establishment of various airports, or by whatever other means. I think that up to now this department has performed a very good task in this respect.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when the hon. the Minister of Finance replied to the Budget debate, he took me to task and suggested that I had insinuated that the bankers of South Africa were operating dishonourably during the month of March. He also accused the hon. member for Constantia of a similar thing. The basis of the accusation was that I had said that I had been told that the lifting of the credit ceiling by some R140 million merely gave effect to an existing situation. The hon. the Minister then went on to say that the Treasury and the Reserve Bank knew nothing about this. They only had figures up to the end of February. He said that these figures showed that the banks were then R7 million to R8 million over their credit celings. I can only repeat today what I said then, namely that I was told that the lifting of the ceiling will in fact merely give effect and legal recognition to an existing situation. Most banks are above prescribed ceilings. The hon. the Minister is well aware of what has been going on. He knows how the banks have been operating. The hon. the Minister knows about repaying loans on the 29th or the 30th of the month and reborrowing on the 1st of the following month. I do not have to tell the hon. the Minister what has been happening. The hon. the Minister will also know that when you discuss this matter with bankers, nearly all of them acknowledge quite freely that they have been overextended, if I can use that phrase to describe the situation. They really are not very excited with supposedly R140 million that has been put into the economy.</p>

<p><span class="col_5457-5458" refersTo="page_1192"/>The hon. the Minister wants to know from me whether the insinuation is that the banks operated dishonestly. I made no such insinuation, but I say that the hon. the Minister made a direct accusation, because he said that the banks had exceeded their credit limits by a R7 million to R8 million as at the end of February. If banks being over-lent is regarded as being dishonest, as it apparently is by the hon. the Minister, then it is the hon. the Minister who has not only insinuated that the banks have been dishonest, but who has also made a direct accusation. He has put on record that they were over-lent. The hon. the Minister must not accuse me of insinuations.</p>

<p>The next matter I want to raise is the question of borrowing abroad by the private sector, again something which has been in fairly common usage, I think, now for some six or seven months. I should like to know from the hon. the Minister whether any guide-lines have been set, so that the private sector will know under what conditions they can approach the Treasury or the Reserve Bank or whoever is concerned, for permission to do deals with overseas countries. I should imagine that the banks may have some knowledge of what the requirements are, but I think it is important in matters of this sort, that the business community either direct or through the financial institutions, should have guidelines as to what the thinking the Government is in the introduction of further overseas capital into the private sector.</p>

<p>The next item is the question of Sidarel. This company is in liquidation and there may be investigations going on. I therefore do not want to discuss this company <i>per se;</i> I am only interested in what evolves around this company. I had a question on the Question Paper, which was very fully answered by the hon. the Minister saying that the Registrar of Financial Institutions did not investigate the position because Sidarel was not a registered financial institution, that there were investigations going on and that there were no obvious steps which could be taken where these companies appeared to be getting into trouble. What is of interest about this situation is that when a collapse of this kind takes place, it is always preceded by rumours for weeks and weeks and sometimes for months and certain indicators become apparent, particularly in the case of these institutions which are borrowing from the public. The two main indicators are, firstly, that you get a company which suddenly appears on the financial scene and within a very short period, perhaps a year or two, it has grown to enormous proportions. The second indicator is that these companies, as the hon. the Minister rightly said, offer excessively high rates of interest. When these two things happen, namely an enormous expansion of a company and high rates of interest being offered, those of us who have had anything to do with the financial market place, immediately see the red light and if people consult us, as they sometimes do, we usually tell them to leave these companies severely alone. We have had such cases in the past and we are going to have them in the future, because you can never stop people being dishonest. It is not possible. However, I wonder whether the hon. the Minister would not, through his committee which deals with this matter particularly, give some consideration to the Registrar of Financial Institutions keeping a watchful eye on these aspects of these companies, so that irrespective of what rights the registrar has in terms of specific Acts, if he feels that a company, and a financial company in particular, is operating in a way where the red light is shining, he shall have the right to take a look at the company. I know that we have to be careful in this regard. I know that we do not want to have continuous interference by the State in the running of private enterprise, but there have been a lot of these cases and I wonder whether the hon. the Minister would give some consideration to this matter.</p>

<p>The next item I want to raise comes under the question of public dept. In reply to a question I put to the hon. the Minister, he furnished figures which show that the bulk of our borrowings from overseas were from Europe; in Deutsche Marks particularly and in Swiss francs, and that these loans, if they run to full maturity, are going to cost us something of the order of R53 million in capital and R22.5 million in interest more than we anticipated, as a result of the realignment of currencies. Last year I asked the hon. the Minister whether he was interested in borrowing in Euro-dollars, and he said yes. One of the reasons he gave for saying yes, was this possibility of the revaluation of currencies. I should like to know from the hon. the Minister why we are so heavily committed in our overseas borrowing in these European currencies which, we knew, were <span class="col_5459-5460" refersTo="page_1193"/>those which were likely to rise most because, they were the most undervalued. Why did we not borrow more in dollars or Euro dollars, when, as the hon. the Minister explained to us, we knew the currency was weak&#x003F; It is going to cost us an awful lot of money. It is true that it is over a fixed period of time and rates of exchange may obviously differ. We may find that these currencies will come down and ours will go up, although I think it is doubtful.</p>

<p>There is one other question here and that is in relation to the loans of Iscor and Escom. It would seem from the figures which the hon. the Minister gave me in reply to a question that practically all, if not all of the Iscor and Escom loans, are guaranteed by the Reserve Bank or the Government against any losses. In other words, they covered forward for them. This means that when Escom or Iscor go to the market they are not really concerned where they are going to borrow from, except that I presume they do it in consultation with the hon. the Minister. It seems that we are subsidising Iscor and Escom against any losses which they may suffer as a result of devaluation and revaluation. This brings me to another question. We have given forward guarantees to financial institutions against currency losses. Is there any way that the Reserve Bank in turn can cover itself&#x003F; In other words, it has bought forward for the private sector, and is there any way it can buy forward to protect its own position in relation to the forward guarantees and the forward underwritings it has given to the financial sector&#x003F;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. S. D. ERASMUS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Parktown put a few technical questions to the Minister, to which, I am certain, he will reply. But he also made a few statements which are not clear to me, and which I find strange. He said here that the R140 million by which the credit ceiling has now been lifted, and which will now come into circulation, was in fact only a rectification of the present position. Then he explained that the banks had been lending money, and that this had been paid back on the 29th or 30th of the month. That is a very serious statement the hon. member made here. I can understand, and I do think that there are certain banks which perhaps lent a little more than they were supposed to, but made certain that that money was returned at that juncture, a day before the end of the month, in order to&#x003F; set the books straight. But I want to dispute very strongly the statement that this could have amounted to the entire total of R140 million. A total of R140 million is a tremendous amount of money. If it is as the hon. member for Parktown stated, this provision which is being made in the Estimates to lift the ceiling and to inject an amount of R140 million into the economy will be of no value whatsoever. According to the hon. member it is already there. I want to inform the hon. member that I was in the company of one of our major bankers the evening after the Budget. I then asked him specifically how much additional money this lifting of the ceiling would now inject into the economy, for I myself am not all that conversant with what the precise position in regard to the banks is. He then tried to calculate it, and said that he estimated that an additional R120 million would now be injected into the economy. I therefore beg to differ with the hon. member, for I think he made a very serious statement. There may perhaps be a very small amount, but I think he was exaggerating it tremendously.</p>

<p>In his next point the hon. member referred to the Sidarel case, and to the liquidation of this company. Immediately after he had started mentioning that, I smiled and thought of what the hon. member for Hillbrow had unburdened himself of here yesterday. He attacked us yesterday for having been taken over by socialism, and how the State was interfering in every sphere. He had berated us for having too much control, and here the hon. member for Parktown was asking the Minister whether there was no method which could make it possible to place ordinary commercial companies, for Sidarel is nothing else, under a measure of control as well. It is virtually out of the question. Only financial companies which accept deposits, and in regard to which the public has to be protected, are properly controlled. I therefore think that it is a little unreasonable to expect at this stage that the Registrar of Financial Institutions should exercise control here as well. After all, these were responsible people. They had built up a major company. But this was one of those mushroom concerns. As the hon. member was quite right in doing, he warned his people against companies which pay these tremendous rates of interest, because it is clear that these people are not <span class="col_5461-5462" refersTo="page_1194"/>taking a properly calculated risk for the future. They are gambling a little with the future. The State can do whatever it wishes, but it cannot protect a person against his own ignorance, just as it was unable to protect the individual some time ago when he lost his head and stampeded to invest on the Stock Exchange, regardless of the dividends being offered. Individuals did not exercise their discretion and ask: &#x201C;I am buying a share; what are the dividends on it : going to be&#x003F;&#x201D; No, Sir, he purchased shares at whatever price was being asked. In this case I think the hon. member was again saying something which was in conflict with the views of one of his own financial stars, who tried to attack us by saying that we wanted to apply socialism.</p>

<p>I now want to return to the statement the hon. member made on Tuesday in the debate on the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote. I must honestly state now that I do not know where I am with the United Party. I really do not know what their financial views and policy are. Listen to what he said. <i>Inter alia</i> he explained that ours is a developed country, and that we have fallen behind the other countries in the world as far as our development is concerned. Then he went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If we had utilised all our resources of men and material, we would have placed ourselves in a position to resist the onslaught from without. Instead of that what happened&#x003F; As soon as things went sour overseas, we were completely pregnable; we could not stand up to the onslaught from without. Before we knew what had happened, we had to devalue. That is what the Government did to this country, and it is no good their going to the public and saying that devaluation is a wonderful thing. Devaluation is a step that you take as a last resort, and every economist knows that.</block>

They will reiterate the old labour story, but let us analyse this matter a little further. He says that when the onslaught from without was made, we were unable to with stand it. But, Sir, ours is a small country. We are developing. Our standard : of living is as good as that of any other country. We have an economic development plan according to which we plan our economic future. We are working on that basis; we are trying to keep the rate of inflation as low as possible. We have full employment in this country; we are one of the countries with the most stable price structure in the world.

<heading>CHAIRMAN&#x2019;S RULING ON ATTRIBUTION TO MEMBER OF WORDS NOT APPEARING IN OFFICIAL REPORT OF DEBATES</heading>

<speech by="#deputy_chairman">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY CHAIRMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Before calling upon an hon. member, I wish to refer to a point of order raised by the hon. member for Zululand on Tuesday, that the hon. member for Middelburg had to accept his word that he had not uttered certain words during a speech made in this House in 1964, as claimed by the hon. member for Middelburg.</p>

<p>On 10th April, 1947, the Chairman of Committees gave a considered ruling during which he stated that it was the rule that a member could make an explanation during debate if a material part of a speech he had made had been misquoted or misunderstood (see S.O. 142 (1)) and that the practice was that whatever a member said in explanation&#x2014;whether relating to the words or the meaning of his speech&#x2014;had to be accepted as true and not afterwards called into question. I feel however that this rule can only be applied to an explanation made at the time the statement to which it was directed was made or at the conclusion of the speech which called for the explanation, which according to May&#x2019;s Parliamentary Practice (18th Edition) at page 409, is the proper time for making such an explanation. The rule regarding the acceptance of a member&#x2019;s explanation can also be extended to a personal explanation made under S.O. 142 (2) with the prior consent of Mr. Speaker at a subsequent sitting during the same session (see also May, page 249).</p>

<p>In my opinion, however, it cannot be applied to explanation in respect of speeches made during previous sessions as this would create the quite untenable position that in a subsequent session a member could disavow statements which the Official Report of the Debates of the House show him as having made, while the member himself had offered no explanation in respect thereto during the session in question.</p>

<p>In this particular case the point at issue is whether the hon. member for Zululand used certain words which do not appear in the Official Report for the 1964 session. Here I consider that, bearing in mind that the accuracy of the report of any speech may be disputed by means of the usual procedure when the weekly edition of the Official Report containing such speech appears or within a reasonable period thereafter, it will create an equally untenable position if words can thereafter be attributed to an hon. member, despite the fact that such words are not reflected in the Official Report of the Debates which are issued under the supervision and control of Mr. Speaker.</p>

<p>I rule therefore that it is not in order for a member to attribute to another member words that do not appear in the Official Report of the Debates.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>I was saying that in the opinion of this side of the House devaluation was resorted to as the result of basic weaknesses in the economy resulting from Government actions and Government policy. These main weaknesses are, first of all, a lack of growth and a lack of productivity, particularly in comparison with the productivity in other countries, both of which have been caused by our failure to use our resources which are available to us to the full. Now, if I can be heard, Sir, I would like to refer to the imposition of control over interest rates on deposits with the banks and building societies which the hon. the Minister announced in his Budget speech, and the control of interest rates on participation mortgage bonds, and other specified types of investments. First of all I would like to say that I regard this control as being bad in principle. In South Africa we have a sophisticated and highly developed money market and banking system which performs the function of bringing into equilibrium the supply of funds from lenders and the demand from borrowers who have a use for these funds. The money market and the banking system establish an interest pattern which is a delicately balanced one and a very complex and intricate one, an interest pattern which in some respects is fairly firm and fast, but in other respects is flexible and can change as conditions require; an interest pattern which ensures that the supply of funds from different types of lenders with different types of requirements is brought into balance with the demand of different types of borrowers with different types of requirements. Essentially this is a free enterprise system which requires freedom of the market and the discipline of the market if it is to function properly. It is the market mechanism which ensures that the available funds are used where they are most wanted, and this broadly means that they are used for the most productive purposes. If you interfere with any part of the system, a system which is working perfectly satisfactorily, then you interfere, as the Minister has decided to interfere, with the whole mechanism. If you interfere you prevent interest rates from fulfilling their function, which is to bring into balance the supply and the demand of funds, and you distort the flow of funds in the money and capital markets, so they tend to flow away from the uses where they are most required and flow to uses where they are uncontrolled, such as on the grey market. What I have just said was also said by the hon. the Minister himself in August, 1970, when in his Budget speech of that year he announced the withdrawal of the requirement from the banks that they give an undertaking to limit their deposit rates. I would suggest that what the Minister said then, is applicable to the circumstances now as well. I would like to give an example of how the flow of funds becomes distorted as the result of import control. The control of the interest rates over participation mortgage bonds, is effectively going to lower the interest rates on those bonds by about 1 per cent, from a gross 10 per cent to a gross something like 9 per cent. That lowering of interest rates must discourage investors to invest their money in that type of investment. There are other types of investment which offer higher interest rates, and it is natural that investors in participation mortgage bonds are likely to switch their investments now to those other types of investments. That is going to mean that there will be a reduction in funds available for flat development. I do not know what the hon. the Minister of Community Development is going to say to that because participation mortgage bonds have been one of the main sources of finance for flat development. Now if the availability of funds is going to be reduced as the result of the lower interest rates, either flat development is going to slow down or flat developers are going to look for other sources of funds. If they look for other sources of funds, such as from direct mortgage bonds, they will create greater competition for those funds and force the interest rates on those funds up. You cannot have it both ways. You <span class="col_5467-5468" refersTo="page_1197"/>cannot force interest rates down on the one hand without them bursting out higher somewhere on the other hand. I think it is virtually impossible to foresee what the effect of the interest rate control is going to be, and I am not even confident that it will have the effect of encouraging deposits in building societies, which the Minister wants it to do. But of one thing I am quite sure, and that is that if funds are not put to their most productive use&#x2014;and they will not be put to their most productive use if you interfere with the interest pattern-then productivity suffers, and if productivity suffers you will get an increase in the rate of inflation. The Minister himself in August, 1970, said more or less what I have said in that respect. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, during the Second Reading debate I said that the hon. the Minister had presented one of the best Budgets of all times. And do hon. members know who also agrees with me&#x003F; 6 666 voters of Oudtshoorn also agree with me. Those who do not agree come to a meagre 1 818, not even 18 per cent. Therefore it is obvious what a good effect this Budget has had.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia said interest control was a very bad instrument. But does that hon. member not know that we are living in a country in which there is a controlled economy&#x003F; Does he want to free everything&#x003F; Does he not want this Government to take action when rates of interest are out of hand&#x003F; Does the hon. member really want to tell us today that the Government should not have taken any steps&#x003F; Should the exploitation of the poor man and the man who has no capital, be allowed then&#x003F; The hon. member cannot come forward with something like that.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>It is a fact that one does not like this control, and that one would have liked to have it determined by supply and demand. However, where there is exploitation, the Government must take action. I may just tell the hon. member that this Government will in fact take action.</p>

<p>I want to refer to what was said yesterday afternoon by the hon. member for Parktown. The hon. member for Parktown again levelled an accusation at the Minister in connection with certain things he had said during the Second Reading. This relates to the amount of R140 million, being the relief granted in respect of the ceiling of the banking sector. That hon. member acts as though the hon. the Minister does not know what is going on in the country. Then he also maintained that the hon. the Minister did not know how to control the financial position of South Africa. The hon. member will concede that a certain restriction was imposed on the credit ceiling as at the end of the month. There is no restriction on the operations in the course of a particular month. If these people over-lend during any month, they may see to it that it is back before the end of the month. But these banks cannot lend an impossible amount. Let me illustrate this by way of an example. Let us suppose the ceiling that is fixed stands at 100 and the banking sector allows it to rise to 120. If these banks are again within the limit of 100 at the end of the following month, they are complying with the legal requirements. This is, after all, a legal requirement which has been laid down. Now the hon. the Minister says that they may go up to 120. In other words, now the banking sector need not reduce to 100 the 100 which went up to 120 in the course of the month. They are now able to go up to 120. In other words, in the course of the month the ceiling may rise to 140. It happens. That is why an extra R140 million has been pumped into the private sector. Surely the hon. member does not want to tell me that he does not know this. So how is it possible for the hon. member to argue that there is not that amount of extra money&#x003F; I really do not want the hon. member for Parktown to be unworthy of his position. As a financial expert he knows the position is not as he gave it out to be.</p>

<p>The hon. member also raised another point by asking why there were no borrowings in the dollar area. Hs wanted to know why everything was borrowed in Europe. It most definitely is a fact, surely, that the Government tries to borrow where it is cheapest. If we were to borrow in the dollar area it would come out much more expensive for us. The dollar position is such that it has been possible for us to have borrowed more cheaply on the German and Swiss markets by as much as from 1 per cent to 1&#x00BD; Per cent. Does the hon. member not know this&#x003F; Now I want to ask the hon. member what the position will be in 15 years&#x2019; time; this is what is important with a view to the repayment <span class="col_5469-5470" refersTo="page_1198"/>of these loans. The hon. member asked me what my opinion was. I told him that we were borrowing in the right place. No one knows what is going to happen in 15 years&#x2019; time. The dollar may revalue tremendously. Anything may happen. We trade mainly with Europe. The hon. member knows what our position is as regards trade with Europe. In 1971 we imported goods to the value of R1 323 000 000 from Europe. Imports from America amounted to only R440 million. Consequently it is logical and understandable for us to negotiate loans from those countries with which we trade most.</p>

<p>What is the position in respect of international investments in South Africa&#x003F; The sterling area has investments to the value of R3 371 million in South Africa. That was the position in 1970. The investments of Western Europe amount to R1 406 million. Over against that, investments by America and its companies amount to only R855 million. Then there is such a thing as interest and dividends paid out to these countries. As against our imports of R440,7 million from America, our exports are R135 million. To some extent the difference is made up by way of interest and dividends we pay over to America in respect of its investments here. But in respect of Europe there is a bigger difference as far as this is concerned. I want to point out to the hon. member that it is the position, after all, that we have to pay in Europe for our large imports from Europe. We cannot pay in dollars, because that would involve extra conversion costs. We use these loans we obtain in Europe to pay for the difference between imports and exports. Our gold is not sufficient to pay for that. Consequently we obtain cheaper loans in Europe.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke about the latest loans entered into in February, 1971. From what I heard the full amount of those loans had not been used up. At the time of our devaluation, we still had some of that money in Switzerland. It cost this Government nothing extra and neither did we lose anything when we used the balance of those loans to pay for imports. There was no loss in dollars, nor any loss in respect of conversion.</p>

<p>The hon. member must take one fact into account, and that is that South Africa and Europe&#x2014;and I include England in this &#x2014;are closely interwoven. We have been trading for centuries and we have our trade relations. This makes a great difference to where one borrows from. Does the hon. member want to give us to understand that henceforth we should borrow all our money from the East, i.e. from Japan, Russia or China&#x003F; I think there are certain economic laws which apply. Apart from these trade connections with Europe, however, there are also some other additional factors which apply.</p>

<p>Hon. members said we were so badly off. In this regard a survey has been conducted by Market Research of Africa. Hon. members have probably seen it in the Press. It shows how well-off South Africa is with this National Party Government and the implementation of its policy. It establishes the fact that South Africa&#x2019;s standard of living is of the very highest in the world. For example, the survey shows very clearly that 68 per cent of the Whites in South Africa have telephones as against 34 per cent in Great Britain. It must be remembered that Great Britain is a developed country, while we are a developing country. Over against that we have Western Germany with 31 per cent, Italy, 27 per cent, France, 19 per cent, the Netherlands, 43 per cent, and Belgium, 33 per cent. There is only one which has a higher percentage and that is Luxembourg with a percentage of 78 per cent. When we look at all these figures and these facts, we see that the Government&#x2019;s policy is the right one and that our approach to the economy is the right one, i.e. that we consider what is in the best interests of our State overseas and in what way we may best serve the poor man in South Africa by controlling rates of interest and at the same time assisting this country to grow economically so as to keep within the 5&#x00BD; per cent objective envisaged by the economic development programme. When I speak of a 5&#x00BD; per cent growth rate, it does not mean that that growth rate should be 5&#x00BD; per cent every year. Surely it cannot be established as specifically as that. One year it may be per cent or 4 per cent or whatever. The next year it may rise to 6 per cent, but the average throughout will have to be approximately 5&#x00BD; per cent. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I find nothing more distressing than listening to the hon. member who has just sat down. Every time he speaks, I fear for the economic future of South Africa, because some of his arguments really are depressing. <span class="col_5471-5472" refersTo="page_1199"/>For example, he is apparently very keen that we should contain our growth rate at 5,5 per cent. Then he goes on to say that this is of course an average. He has, of course, worked out that in 1970 the growth rate was 4,8 per cent. In 1971 it was 3,7 per cent and this year it is expected that we might have a 5 per cent growth rate. Therefore, for the two following years we will have to have a 7 per cent growth rate. We are building up a position on this theory of averages that if we do not have 7 per cent in 1973, we might have to go for 9 per cent or 9&#x00BD; per cent growth in 1974. I am not impressed with averages; I like to see my profits now.</p>

<p>The hon. member makes another fatal error when he talks about interest. It is all very well to stand up and say that the public are being exploited, that the man in the street is being exploited by high interest rates. There are cardinal principles in economics which have taught us that we have to be very careful of controls because of the distortions they create. What the hon. member has not given any consideration to, is what is the likely impact on lending to be of a lowering of the interest rate and not allowing free market mechanisms to operate&#x003F; Are people going to say: I cannot get an interest rate that I really want; therefore I am going to find some entirely different form of investment&#x003F; We may well have it in the Stock Exchange over the next six months, depending on what the attitude of England, particularly, is with buying on the South African market. You may have people who normally would have been prepared to invest in participation bonds getting a shade under 10 per cent, who will say: &#x201C;No, 8&#x00BD; per cent does not interest me, I will rather have a little gamble somewhere else and see if I can make a capital profit.&#x201D;</p>

<p>These are the factors that surround these things that one has to take into account. One always gets the feeling that there is not sufficient examination in depth. One takes an attitude, one takes a stand, and as our lawyers&#x2019; friends say, one does not always become mindful of what the consequential amendments might be.</p>

<p>The third item the hon. member discussed was the question of foreign currencies. I am not having an argument with the hon. the Minister on the issue as to where he should have borrowed and where he should not have borrowed. What I am trying to find out is the reasons for what we have done, because on the face of it it can cost us a considerable amount of money. I repeat to the hon. member that I learnt one very important lesson when I was a young man and went into business. A chap came in to see me one day. We were doing shipping in those days and we had a standard rate which we applied to all our customers. What was a potentially big client came to see me and said that he was considering moving his account and asked whether we would take it. He said that he would not like to pay the normal rate, but that he wanted to pay a little less, any way in the beginning, during the first year of our doing business together. I went to my senior partner, the chairman of the company, who was a canny gentleman. I will never forget what he said to me, namely: &#x201C;My boy, make your money out of every transaction. Do not wait for the next one to make your profit. Make it in each deal.&#x201D; It is the same with these overseas loans. To suggest that they are being entered into on the basis that things might change over the next 15 years, that the Deutsche Mark and the Swiss franc and the French franc may decrease in value and that the rand may increase in value, is not a very sound basis for operating. There may be a modicum of correctness in what the hon. member says when he talks about our dealing commercially very heavily with the Common Market today and that this is one of our natural sources of flow of goods to and fro. On the other hand, there is an awful lot of business being done in the United States and an awful lot of capital coming into this country from the United States. We hope that it will continue. We hope that the Americans will never change their minds about investing in South Africa. All I want to get from the hon. the Minister &#x2014;and I am sure he knows that this is the attitude in which I ask these questions&#x2014; is the basic reason for the way we are doing it.</p>

<p>There is one other matter, namely the question of the Lodder report and the question of interest rates and investments. The hon. the Minister in his Budget speech said that he could not deal with the Post Office side of investments, because they were waiting for computerization. But there is still one aspect of the Post Office which I think should be changed and be changed immediately. I have raised this matter previously. If I deposit money in <span class="col_5473-5474" refersTo="page_1200"/>the Post Office after the 2nd of the month, I do not receive any interest for that month. If I withdraw any money from the Post Office prior to the last two days of the month, I do not receive any interest for that month. I unfortunately had to withdraw a little money out of the Post Office yesterday. So I have lost my interest for this month. I do not like it. I do not think it is sound investment. I think the hon. the Minister, through his colleague, who merely acts as an agent, should pay me my interest from the day I put my money in up to the day I withdraw my money. It should not be incapable of being calculated without a computer. I hope the hon. the Minister will see if something cannot be done here. Further there is another foolish regulation which, as far as I know, is still in existence, namely, that I cannot deposit more than R4 000 into the Post Office in any one year. That is in my savings account. I am not talking about the other investments where they act as an agent. So, if I have deposited R4 000 in the first two or three months of the year and I want to draw it out because I want to use it for some other purpose and if I then receive more money to invest, I have to go somewhere else for a short-term investment. I think this is foolish. Why this embargo&#x003F; The basis of borrowing money is to encourage people, not to discourage people. To say to a person that because he has already deposited R4 000 during one year, he cannot deposit any more although he has already taken it out, seems to me absolutely ludicrous. I can understand if the hon. the Minister wants to control the situation and says that no person shall have more than R4 000 in his Post Office savings account at any one time. I do not know the pros and cons of a figure of R4 000, but this may have some merit. But to say that a person cannot deposit more than this figure, does not seem to make any sense to me. The Post Office used to be and still is to a great extent the place where the small man puts his few rand for short periods of time. He has moved away from the Post Office to a large extent over the years to the building societies because he gets interest on his daily balance. These shortsighted rules cannot be deliberate, because when these rules came into operation, we did not have the problems of the building societies. It may be that it is benefiting the building societies at the moment, but it is on a very short-and today, but there term basis and the building society is a long term lender. I do not think it is very sound policy that we should encourage this type of borrowing by them for long-term lending. It is true that they will always have a sort of reservoir which will turn over. I wish the hon. the Minister would give a little consideration to this issue. I do not think the position has changed since I raised it. Maybe I am wrong. I will be glad to hear that I am wrong. I have not gone into it. I have looked at my old savings bank book which sets out these rules and regulations. If these are still extant, I would like to see them changed as soon as possible.</p>

<speech by="#herman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. HERMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, during his Budget speech the hon. the Minister placed particular emphasis on the fact that the main object of the Government&#x2019;s policy in this Budget was to improve our balance of payments and, more particularly, to reduce the deficit on our current account and increase the level of our foreign reserves. This is, of course, to be welcomed. It is also the main object of any businessman to watch his bank account and always see that everything is right as far as that is concerned, that that balance of payments is correct. There are various ways for one to keep such a balance of payments in order. One of the ways is, for example, to take cognisance of our exports. There are also other ways, which were particularly emphasized last year, i.e. saving, hard work, etc. When we think of the exports, we think at the same time of the statement of the President of the Reserve Bank, i.e. that banks should be allowed to exceed their ceilings applicable to their discounts and surpluses by 5 per cent and their investments by 10 per cent.</p>

<p>I want to come back again to what the hon. member for Parktown said in his Second Reading speech, and again yesterday, in connection with the R140 million. This was also raised here again yesterday and today, but there is one point the hon. member for Parktown loses sight of. The hon. the Minister placed specific emphasis on the fact that this concession was made with a view to, and for the purpose of, making a greater volume of credit available for our production and export purposes. When the hon. member for Parktown says that R140 million has already been loaned by the banks, i.e. that they have already exceeded their powers by R140 million, he loses sight of the object the hon. the Minister of Finance laid down, i.e. that we must take note of our <span class="col_5475-5476" refersTo="page_1201"/>production and our exports. If there were in fact transgressions by the banks, then this was also done in respect of other sectors of society, for example in respect of ordinary businessmen, farmers and perhaps also private persons. The object of this concession is specifically for that one purpose which the hon. the Minister laid down.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the Budget indicated very clearly to us what has again been plainly reflected in Oudtshoorn, i.e. that the Opposition members have absolutely lost contact with the man in the street. They do not know what his needs are. I particularly want to refer to one member on that side, and to the hon. member for Houghton. In his speech the hon. member for Yeoville mentioned that the Government does not listen to the United Party or to businessmen. The hon. member for Houghton again said that &#x201C;economics is stronger than politics&#x201D;. This points out to us that these people think solely of the big captain of finance, the capitalist. In this House they speak only for the big financier, the man who is already well-endowed with capital. They lose sight of the fact that there is also the man in the street, whom they must also look to.</p>

In addition we also showed that we are the very best cricket players in this House&#x2014;we hit four sixes in a row. I think that tonight the hon. Opposition would do well to switch on the radio and listen to the 1818 overture, so that next year they can perhaps make a better job of speaking about finances here.</p>

They also advocated that job reservation be completely done away with, of course so that there could be an uncontrolled influx of non-White labour to the urban complexes and the industries &#x2026;</p>

<p>Oudtshoorn proved to us that it is true. I do not know where the hon. member gets his figures from.</p>

<p>With reference to Oudtshoorn, I should like to ask the hon. the Minister something. When we think of the extent to which our majority in Oudtshoorn increased, we must also think of the future and, in particular, of our young people. In that connection I want to ask the hon. the Minister if he cannot consider making a further concession as far as the young people are concerned, next year or perhaps even in the course of this year.</p>

<p>By that I mean with reference to maternity costs. Maternity costs are a tremendously expensive item these days. Last year a concession of R100 was made.</p>

<p>No, I am not going to do so. We want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he will not consider making more concessions for maternity costs, particularly with respect to special maternity cases. I want to leave it at that. This is perhaps a subject that belongs more to tax proposals.</p>

<p><span class="col_5477-5478" refersTo="page_1202"/>I want to raise another matter, which is also of cardinal importance, with the Minister, i.e. the competition amongst our financial institutions. In that connection I am thinking particularly of the competition to obtain savings from the public. I am told that in Pretoria alone there are 54 registered financial institutions. Each of them has some or other kind of public relations officer sent out into the field to get money from the public. They come along to the public with many good proposals and consequently persuade them to invest the money with their institution. It frequently happens that when the money is invested with one body, the next public relations officer comes along and again persuades that investor to take away the money and invest it with another body. So we eventually find that money becomes tremendously expensive. In every transaction there is commission involved. Every public relations officer gets a commission for the money he obtained for investment in that institution. If we think of the tremendous pumber of oublic relations officers on the move throughout the country, we wonder why this good manpower is being wasted. Can this manpower not be applied elsewhere with greater efficiency&#x003F; Can some or other restriction not be placed on these public relations officers who criss-cross the country to obtain money from the public for the purpose of investment&#x003F; Money is made tremendously expensive by these people, specifically because commission is paid two or three times. We can, as it were, describe these as flight funds. If the hon. the Minister sees his way clear to imposing some or other restriction on this, I think it would serve a very good purpose on behalf of the saving slogan we appended last year and also for the making available of money and the cheaper money we are going to get.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Potgietersrus touched on quite a wide variety of subjects during his ten-minute speech. I cannot deal with anything like all those subjects in the time available to me, but there are two aspects I should like to mention. Firstly, there was his reference to the man in the street. I should like to remind him of certain facts from which he cannot run away. The first is that the cost of living, namely the consumer price index, rose during 1971 by 7 per cent, which is a very high rate of inflation. The second fact I should like to remind him of is that while many consumers may have been able to protect themselves against that rise in the cost of living through bargaining and demanding higher remuneration, there are classes of the population who are defenceless against inflation. Pensioners, in the main, are defenceless against inflation. They do not have any bargaining power with the authorities that give them their income. In the main, the non-Europeans, and particularly the Bantu, are defenceless against the rising cost of living, because they too have no bargaining power.</p>

<p>I should now like to return to the subject I was speaking about when my time expired previously, namely the control of interest rates. The hon. member for Sunnyside felt it was necessary to have this control to prevent the public being exploited. I believe, as I shall indicate in a moment, that control is, in present circumstances, more likely to keep interest rates up than it is to reduce them, but before I develop that theme, I should like to give one further example of where the flow of funds is likely to be distorted as a result of interest control. Up to the time when this control was imposed, financial institutions were offering up to per cent on deposits subject to three months&#x2019; notice. They were also offering up to 6 per cent on call deposits. Now, under the regulations regarding the control of interest rates, three-month deposits are limited to the same rate of interest as call deposits. The result of that is naturally going to be that depositors are not going to keep their money in accounts requiring three months&#x2019; notice; they will either put it on call, where they can get the same rate of interest, or they will look for other investments, and possibly earn higher rates of interest at longer terms of notice. The point is that this control of interest is going to change the pattern of deposits with the financial institutions and because it changes the pattern of deposits, it must also change the pattern of lending; there is a correlation between the length of commitment you can have for lending and the length of commitment you have in respect of borrowing. Interest control is therefore going to have the effect of forcing the financial institutions to lend in different manners and for different purposes. I believe that there is also quite a chance that interest control will change the pattern of deposits, and tend to make them shorter term and call deposits, rather than deposits subject to <span class="col_5479-5480" refersTo="page_1203"/>longer terms of notice. That seems to be the pattern of the regulations. If that happens, the building societies are going to become even more vulnerable than they are at present&#x2014;and they have some difficulty on this score at present as a result of the fact that they are lending &#x201C;long&#x201D;, and will be borrowing &#x201C;short&#x201D; to a greater extent.</p>

<p>Even if there were justification for the imposition of control on interest rates&#x2014;and I do not for one moment agree that there is any justification&#x2014;I find it difficult to agree that there could be any justification at the present time. The hon. the Minister gave as his reason for this control the fact that he feared the competition between the deposit-receiving institutions when the credit ceiling was raised would lead to higher deposit rates. Surely, at this point of time all the indicators are in the opposite direction. The indicators are that the money supplied is going to become freer, not scarcer, as a result of the improvement in the balance of payments, and that competition is therefore going to tend to force interest rates down, rather than up. If that is so, then I think that control can only have one effect, and that is that it will hinder the drop in interest rates. With a market that is artificially distorted by interest control, maximum interest rates, such as we have imposed, tend to become minimum interest rates.</p>

<p>Finally, I should like to ask the hon. the Minister this question : Would it not be appropriate at this point of time to use the normal instrument of the bank rate, the Reserve Bank discount rate, to keep the interest pattern in check, rather than to impose an artificial control over certain types of interest rates&#x003F; To me it seems that an adjustment in the bank rate at the present time would be in harmony with the Minister&#x2019;s decision to raise the credit ceiling, and it would also be in harmony with the general tendency that we foresee, of money becoming easier as a result of an improvement in the balance of payments.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. F. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to venture onto the path of the hon. member who has just resumed his seat. I have a matter I should very much like to bring to the attention of the House. I think we must focus our attention on this very important matter. Quite a lot has been said here about the balance of payments, bank accounts and the revenue and expenditure that must tally. I specifically want to link up with that by saying that we must ensure that certain people&#x2019;s income and expenditure also tally. I should like to take up the cudgels for our physically handicapped people, our paraplegics; we must ensure that the State also thinks of giving them financial assistance.</p>

<p>I have had the privilege of living in Kimberley for the past 20 years, for 18 of which I have represented that area here and in the Provincial Council. During that period I have had the opportunity of visiting those institutions at Alexanderfontein and Diskobolos hundreds of times and seeing what is being done there by the State. We are grateful for what the State is doing there. The first few times I visited those places my heart and soul were filled with revulsion at the sight of how much human suffering there is, particularly in respect of people who are so retarded, but in recent years it has been a pleasure for me to visit there. Pride was kindled in my heart at the sight of what those people are trying to do for themselves. They are self-supporting and they help themselves. I have never seen more courageous people than those one encounters there. I have never seen people displaying greater bravery than those physically handicapped people. I have never seen prouder people, people imbued with one characteristic, i.e. to help themselves and to make themselves self-supporting and self-sufficient. Those people decided not to burden the State and ask for charity. They have tried to hold their own in life, to earn their own money and to perform a service for their fellow men and the State. But they have gone much further, Sir. Those people have placed South Africa on the map. They have shown us that on the sportsfield they can do as much as the ordinary person; they have shown us that they can be better ambassadors than the average sportsman, because the eyes of the world are focused on those people only because there is a measure of sympathy for them, although they do not want that sympathy. Sir, what do we do to help those people along&#x003F; Most of those people, who could sit back if they wanted the State to look after them, decided to help themselves, and today they earn money for their own provisions. Because those people are retarded to a certain extent&#x2014;because they are crippled, if I may use that word&#x2014; they earn much smaller wages than the <span class="col_5481-5482" refersTo="page_1204"/>ordinary man in the street or than they themselves would have earned if they did not have those handicaps. That is the first handicap they have. Apart from that handicap, their expenditure is relatively much greater than that of the average man in the street. Sir, those people cannot simply walk into a shop or a place of business and buy a suit of clothes like most of our men; the clothes must be specially made for them, and that also applies to the women. But, Sir, one of the cruellest aspects of all is that a large portion of those people need special footwear, and this specially manufactured footwear for handicapped people is one of the most expensive items I have yet come across in this country. They have a third handicap. Most of them must be transported in wheelchairs. This is something they must purchase for themselves. At times they obtain help in that connection, but largely those people are self-sufficient in that respect. The fourth aspect that troubles me is that those people must make use of their own transport. They cannot, like the average man in the street, make use of a bus service; they must have their own cars to transport them. And then I come to the matter I should like to put to the hon. the Minister : Those cars must be purchased on the ordinary market and then modified to adapt to those persons&#x2019; handicaps. This costs up to R1 000 and more; and because those people earn less and must pay more for their clothes and other articles, and for their cars, I want to ask the hon. the Minister and the State this morning whether we cannot help those people with a subsidy so that they can purchase a car every third or fourth year. Sir, I know of some of those people driving cars that are 12 years old because they cannot afford to buy a new one. Their expenditure on the maintenance of that car is tremendously high, much higher than in the case of the ordinary man in the street. In that respect they also have a big handicap, and therefore I feel that I must ask the hon. the Minister today whether we cannot help those people by giving them a subsidy, equal perhaps to the value of the modifications to the cars, or perhaps by making the purchase tax a little lighter for them, so that those people can at least buy a car once in four years instead of once in eight or 10 years, so that their maintenance costs will not be so high, so that they can get to their work more easily and so that, to a certain extent, they can enjoy in life what we enjoy; and that they do not have to spend their hard-earned money on the maintenance of cars, etc. I trust that in our State capacity we shall assist and help these people who support themselves; that we shall do something in return for what they do for us, for what they do for themselves and for what they do for their fellow men. I advocate that the hon. the Minister should see whether in the next Budget, or even in this Budget, he can do something for these people in connection with the purchase of motor cars, perhaps by way of a subsidy or perhaps by way of a lower purchase tax.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Kimberley North delivered a plea here for the paraplegics. I have no objection to the plea he made. It was done in an exceptional manner and I trust the hon. the Minister will listen to the plea the hon. member made on behalf of these people, who have already won great fame for South Africa on the international sportsfield.</p>

<p>Sir, I should like to speak to the hon. the Minister about the Land Bank. On behalf of the farming group on this side I want to say that we welcome the fact that the hon. the Minister has thought fit to make R18 million available to this institution this year. This amount is, of course, a little less than in the previous year, and one laments the fact because of the difficult financial circumstances in which so many South African farmers find themselves today. The hon. the Minister is aware of the fact that we on this side of the House have repeatedly in the past advocated that the Land Bank ought to be the financial institution to help the farmer, because of the fact that the ordinary financial institutions today are apparently no longer particularly interested in the financial needs of the farmer for various reasons. In many other investment fields they can obtain a much better return on their investments in our agricultural industry. I am told that in certain districts there are private financial institutions who are calling in farmers&#x2019; mortgages. There are only two other institutions, i.e. the Land Bank and another institution, which I may not discuss here, which can help the farmers. Up to three or four years ago the Land Bank was still in a position to make considerable long-term loans available to individual farmers and private companies for the consolidation of debt, for mortgages, etc., and I lament the fact <span class="col_5483-5484" refersTo="page_1205"/>that now, apparently as a result of a shortage of funds, the Land Bank has been placed in a position where it cannot consider any application for a loan in excess of R50 000. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister realizes what the present-day position of many of our farmers is in this respect. In its latest report the Land Bank mentions the fact that applications have decreased slightly in the past year, in comparison with the previous year, but this does not mean that the demands of the agricultural industry for long-term loans has decreased. I agree with them wholeheartedly; the number of applications has in fact decreased slightly. I should like to know what steps the hon. the Minister can propose to place the Land Bank in such a position that in the course of time it can grant more and more assistance to agriculturists on a broader level; particularly with its linked insurance scheme, the Land Bank is pre-eminently the institution which can enable future farmers, who must take over farms, to do so free of mortgage or free of mortgage to a large extent. The Land Bank is therefore the ideal institution in this respect. In spite of the assistance the hon. the Minister is granting this year, and the help he has given in the past, we are concerned about whether in future the Land Bank will be in a position to have more funds at its disposal to be able to help more farmers. As I see the picture&#x2014; and I am sorry to say this&#x2014;there is no other way out than for more and more farmers to make representations to the Land Bank for financial assistance. It worries us that the Land Bank was compelled &#x2014;it is not the bank&#x2019;s fault; I think it is an excellent institution&#x2014;to restrict applications for long-term loans to a maximum of R50 000 and also to restrict their hypothec loans to a maximum of R5 000 per application. We want to know from the hon. the Minister what he proposes, and whether he and the Government agree with us that in the course of time the Land Bank will spread its wings ever wider to be able to be of assistance to more farmers in this respect. What I find illuminating in the latest report of the Land Bank, is that a large number of farmers must undoubtedly be in a very difficult position because the Land Bank finds that the fact that the farmers do not quickly enough pay back loans, redemption and the repayment of interest in arrears, makes it impossible for the bank to help more farmers. This is proof that the situation of our agriculturists at the present moment is by no means an ideal one; on the contrary, that it is alarming as far as the future is concerned. Therefore we want to know whether the hon. the Minister can hold out any prospects of the Land Bank&#x2019;s being able to help us, and of the chances of obtaining more money on the open market in future being good, so that many more farmers in agriculture can be helped, because we are worried about the situation.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Parktown is feeling a bit guilty about the allegations he made the other day in regard to the bank lending ceilings. He today tried to push the guilt on to me and tried to tell the House that I am really the man who made the insinuations. Sir, I made no insinuations at all; I made a positive statement to the effect that the banks had by the end of February exceeded their lending limits to an amount of R8 million or R9 million. In so far as they have done that they have been in the wrong; it was wrong of them to do so, but I think it is almost impossible for the banks, with their vast organizations and their hundreds and hundreds of branches, completely to be able to control bank lending to a definite limit. Previously the banks always had a cushion between the ceiling and the actual lending. Nowadays they are pushing against the ceiling and sometimes they exceed the ceiling and go higher, but I think it is a very difficult matter for them to administer, to be correctly at or below the ceiling. In any case it is not the case, as the hon. member said, that the banks had exceeded the limit by R120 million to R140 million. If that had been the case, if it had been possible at all, as the hon. member suggested, that through booking and overbooking and all kinds of procedures they could evade this regulation, then naturally this control of credit would have been completely unnecessary. I can assure the hon. member that it is not the case that the banks have exceeded their limit to that extent, but if it had been the case, and the Reserve Bank became aware of the situation, the Reserve Bank would have had to force them back to the actual lending limit. What would the position have been if the hon. member had been right in saying that the banks had exceeded the ceiling by R120 million or R140 million, and the Reserve Bank had become aware of it and had forced the banks back to the ceiling where they should have been&#x003F; That would have <span class="col_5485-5486" refersTo="page_1206"/>meant that they would have had to withdraw R120 million to R140 million, which would have created a very difficult situation. So, even if he had been correct in his statement, I think it still serves the purpose that the Reserve Bank with the consent of the Treasury has increased the ceiling by R120 million to R140 million.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked me about the devaluation and the foreign borrowing by the Government, and referred to a question he put to me last year about borrowing on the dollar market, and said that I had also said that I thought it was good that we should borrow in the dollar market. But now he asks me why we in the last year borrowed mainly in the Deutsche Mark market or the Swiss franc market. Of course it is quite easy to go back and see what was done in the past. We did exactly what the hon. member suggested. In our borrowing we look at the position then obtaining. He took the hon. member for Sunnyside to task because he had been looking to the future and he quite rightly said that we should look at the position as it is at the present moment. We looked at the position when we borrowed the money We looked at the position petaining at that particular moment. The fact is that at that particular moment last year the interest rates of these various currencies varied considerably and we borrowed in the cheapest market. I quote from a schedule I have here which shows that in certain cases the U.S. dollar was 7 6/16 per cent whereas the Swiss franc was 5&#x00BC; per cent; so that was the actual reason why we mostly borrowed Deutsche marks and Swiss francs. Another fact I might mention here is that in many of these cases we had borrowed these Swiss francs and Deutsche marks after revaluation, so that in the case of repayment we do not lose the full amount of the devaluation and the revaluation. Thirdly, I wish to mention to the hon. member that a large percentage of the money we had borrowed from the German and Swiss markets had been retained by the Central Bank; it was not spent, with the result that we had a profit. When there was devaluation we had a book profit on the francs and the marks and the other foreign currencies.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked me about the Sidarel affair. I am sorry too. We are very sorry about these things which often happen in the capital market, but it is quite impossible for the Treasury to control all these new financial companies that are formed. As I said in reply to a question put to me a few weeks ago, we as the Treasury and the Financial Institutions Office have no control over such an institution like Sidarel because it does not fall under the Banking Act. The hon. gentleman was quite right when he said these institutions which arise like mushrooms and offer high interest rates are often very dangerous. For that reason we are now going into the matter to see whether there is any way in which such institutions could be brought under our control. Of course, the hon. member will agree with me when I say that we do not want to spread our control too broadly. We do not want to control everything. It is impossible; it is unwise to control everything, but still we are going into the question to see whether it is at all possible and feasible and correct to exercise some control over the formation of financial institutions of this nature.</p>

<p>About forward covering the hon. member asked me a few questions. I can just say that the Central Bank provides forward covering for the corporations. They are performing a public function and for a percentage, something like &#x00BC; per cent, the Central Bank is providing forward covering &#x2014;not for private institutions but for the State corporations. But it is not possible for the Central Bank itself to procure cover for its own purposes. We do not know of any cases of this nature, and I do not think it is at all possible to do that.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked me about borrowing by the private sector in their overseas market. Well, we shall in the course of time, and from experience, be able better to lay down guide lines. There are no fixed guide lines. As the hon. member knows we have in the past allowed State corporations like Iscor and Escom and the Rand Water Board and the municipality of Johannesburg to borrow abroad. We shall start with the larger corporations. After all, it is impossible for a small business or corporation to go overseas to borrow money. It will mostly be the national organizations which start something in the mining or the industrial field of national importance. The hon. member will realize that we shall have to be very strict in these matters. In the first place it would frustrate and stultify our whole monetary policy if we were to allow too many institutions to borrow too much money in the foreign market. We will therefore have to exercise some control there. In the second place it <span class="col_5487-5488" refersTo="page_1207"/>is not good for South Africa&#x2019;s name when there are too many institutions or companies borrowing on the foreign market. We therefore have to exercise a very strict control. In the beginning it will be mainly the national companies which start projects in the mining and industrial fields of international importance.</p>

<p>Oh yes; these foreign companies will have to apply for the right to borrow overseas. We of course will look into the matter concerning the conditions of the loans. If the interest rates are too high or if there is any other factor that might distort the local market, we shall have to look into that too. In any case, they will have to fall into the whole pattern of foreign lending. We will see to that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia just in passing mentioned that our problem in South Africa was low growth and low productivity. Of course I do not want to enter into the Budget debate again. This is the complaint we get from hon. members on the other side, namely that South Africa&#x2019;s economy is in dire straits as a result of low growth and low productivity.</p>

<p>That is the general statement by hon. members. I again wish to remind the hon. members, although they do not want to accept this reminder, that not only South Africa but the entire world today is in a state of so-called recession. This low rate of growth about which we are complaining is not only to be found in South Africa; it is prevalent all over the world today. I received yesterday the brochure <i>News Week</i> from America. It is dated 24th April and therefore still has to appear. In an article I read the following: &#x201C;Western Europe&#x2019;s over-all production last year rose by only 3 per cent.&#x201D; We are being accused in South Africa for bad economic administration and that type of thing because we have an over-all production rate of just over 3 per cent.

<block name="quote">Some national forecasts suggest a composite growth rate of 3,7 per cent.</block>

<p>That is what they expect for the coming year. May be. It is therefore not so extraordinary that we in South Africa do not have the high rate which we all want to have. We are in a period where there is a low rate all over the world. The hon. member for Parktown, and I think my hon. friend for Pietersburg, mentioned the other day that South Africa was not impregnable. They said we were vulnerable and that if something happened in the outside world we felt it immediately. It is true. South Africa has an open economy. We are not an isolated community which is not affected by happenings in other parts of the world. We have an open economy. America&#x2019;s economy is only affected by its outside trade to the extent of 6 per cent. And America was first last year not only to close the gold window but also to impose the 10 per cent surcharge on imports. We have an open economy to the extent of 25 per cent. So we are very vulnerable. We are affected to a very large extent by happenings in other parts of the world because we import and export a very large percentage of our gross national product.</p>

<p>The hon. gentleman&#x2019;s complaint actually is in regard to interest rate control and participation bond rate control. I think we could have discussions here for hours on this particular point. There are two distinct viewpoints in the world and in South Africa in regard to interest rate control. We had it once in South Africa after which it was abandoned officially. Later on it became a question of moral persuasion. We talked to the banks and the building societies and in this way tried to impose a ceiling in regard to interest rates. We think it is necessary at the present moment again to <span class="col_5489-5490" refersTo="page_1208"/>impose interest rate control, mainly for the reason which the hon. gentleman has mentioned, namely that there is a softening of rates in the world. We want to help that softening in South Africa. We do not want the competition between the banks for liquid funds to prevent that softening and the coming down of interest rates in South Africa. I recognize that this is probably a point on which we could talk for hours without being able to convince each other. After very serious consideration of the matter it was the opinion of the Reserve Bank with the concurrence of the Treasury that the time has come that we should do something in regard to interest rates. But it is not as easy as the hon. gentleman said. He said that we distort things now and that, if we leave matters, money, in accordance with the market economy, will always flow into the best directions. It is not always so. We have seen in the last few years that interest rates had no effect at all on consumer expenditure. Consumption went higher and higher no matter what the interest rate was. We have seen during the last few years how much money went into the building of offices. I believe that in Johannesburg there are hundreds of offices standing vacant at the moment. We had this big building boom in the big cities of South Africa. Particularly participation bond funds went into big building projects. But we did not get money in the actual housing sphere where we wanted the money. It is not so easy to say that these things distort the economy. Interest rates do not play the part they did play in the past. The hon. gentleman asked me whether we could not simply have used the bank rate. The bank rate no longer has the effect it had in the past when we studied economics. It no longer plays the same role as it did in the past.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parktown asked about the Post Office savings bank. As far as I can understand this matter, the payment of interest on your daily balance is not possible before the computerization of the bank. In any case, this is a matter we shall go into. I believe, however, that that is the position and as soon as that is provided they could pay on a daily balance. There are things which worry me too in regard to the whole Post Office savings bank system. We shall go into these matters.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Potgietersrus made representations in regard to more assistance for young couples. We shall look into the matter. In regard to the hon. member&#x2019;s request for maternity benefits, I just want to point out to him that in the year in which a child is born, there is a deduction of R100 from taxable income in respect of medical costs, as well as a child rebate of R100. There is already a reduction of R200 in the taxable income.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kimberley North referred to certain physically handicapped people. This is a matter which also deserves investigation. In certain circumstances the persons concerned already receive a rebate in respect of the customs and excise duties on imported articles. If these persons have an income of R5 000 or less, they are also allowed to subtract R600 from their income in respect of apparatus used by them and in respect of travel expenses. Something is already being done for these persons, but I can give the hon. member the assurance that we shall investigate the matter again in order to see whether something more can be done for them.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when we deal with this Vote I think the adage &#x201C;the proof of the pudding is in the eating&#x201D; is a correct one. The House will remember that last year there was a tremendous fuss, on the part of the Opposition, about the new dispensation which, from that date, we implemented in respect of the provinces in terms of the new Financial Relations Act. Hon. members opposite made a tremendous fuss. The hon. member for Durban Point actually asked what hope there was for the continued existence of the provincial system. The hon. member for Salt River made the classic statement that as a result of that dispensation he would not take part in this debate again this year, that he would say nothing this year. It does not look to me as if he does not want to say anything, because he cannot say anything in that connection. What do we find if we review this Vote&#x003F; May I specifically tell the hon. member for Salt River that as far as the Cape Provincial Administration is concerned, there is an increase of almost R25 million. This applies to each of the other provinces. In Natal there is an increase of almost R10 million. In the Transvaal there is an increase <span class="col_5491-5492" refersTo="page_1209"/>of R23 million and in the Free State an increase of R5 million, a total increase of more than R63 million. We remember that last year the Opposition said that the Provincial Administrations would become secondary advisory councils. I think the hon. member for Salt River was the person who made the absurd comparison with the homelands, the Transkei, etc. What was the guarantee&#x003F; The guarantee of this side of the House was a complete guarantee that consisted of four parts. The first was that the amount voted to the provinces in future would be the subsidy plus their tax potential and that this must be equal to their needs. The second guarantee was that they would obtain this allocation; in other words, that in all respects their needs would be met in the case of a slump or a recession. If we now analyse the Vote, the guarantee specifically applies this year when we have had a difficult time of it, financially speaking. This year the guarantee given by this side of the House is being implemented in all its consequences. This year the position is such that the provinces do not have to come to the Government with their hats in their hands so that it embarrasses them; that their capital needs have been determined by a scientific basis and that now that we have experienced a financial slump, now that there is a slight scarcity of money and a recession, they can specifically come to the Central Government in a steady and independent way and the Central Government is in a position to meet their needs. I say that their capital programme is now being drawn up completely scientifically in all respects. It is being based on our economic conjuncture, the conditions, the gross product, the growth rate, etc. As far as we are concerned, it embodies this immediate benefit, i.e. that as a result of this there is no visible increase in the provincial rates. The provincial rates curve is actually evidencing a downward trend. This speaks volumes. It actually proves the success of the new dispensation granted to the provinces. In this period of capital scarcity, with the Government perhaps having had to curtail the subsidy, the provinces would have been compelled to supplement their revenue by additional taxes if the old dispensation had been adhered to. I am convinced that if given the choice today of going back to the old subsidy system, and the supplementing of subsidies on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, as was the case earlier, the provinces would be the first to say that they accept the new dispensation with great delight and satisfaction. But this also has another advantage, as proved by the fact that the provinces have disciplined themselves&#x2014;because they know that their representations are dealt with sympathetically&#x2014;to this extent that they come to the Government in a disciplined way with a very clear and more scientific stipulation of their needs. Therefore it is particularly gratifying to see this appropriation and to see to what extent it works successfully in the light of the amendment brought about last year by the Financial Relations Act.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, if I am permitted to do so, I want to give a reply in this debate on the provinces to a question put by the hon. member for Newton Park on the previous Vote, a question to which I unfortunately failed to reply. The hon. member for Newton Park pointed out to me the position at the Land Bank. He said that the Land Bank restricted its loans to a maximum of R50 000, and that many farmers could not obtain assistance. He said the funds of the Land Bank were limited, and wanted to know whether there were any prospects of that situation being improved. I want to tell the hon. member that we ourselves feel it is a pity that the Land Bank is obliged to curtail to a large extent its powers to grant loans. This is the case as a result of the scarcity of funds. The scarcity of funds is partially attributable to the things we mentioned here, namely that funds are being channelled in certain directions, where they can earn very high interest rates. The Land Bank cannot offer those high interest rates since it cannot charge the farmers high interest rates. Therefore, interest rate control may eventually benefit the Land Bank as well.</p>

<p>Another matter to which I want to draw the hon. member&#x2019;s attention, is that many of the boards of control of the bodies closely connected with the Land Bank, some of which are supported by the Land Bank, do not invest their funds with the Land Bank. I think that in the future we shall have to make a plan and do something to ensure that such bodies invest their savings with the Land Bank in order that the Land Bank may by those means obtain more funds for loan purposes. As hon. members know, the State has granted the Land Bank an amount of R10 million for its own purposes at an interest rate of 2 per cent. Because the Land Bank gets this amount at an interest rate of 2 per cent, it <span class="col_5493-5494" refersTo="page_1210"/>is possible for that body to borrow approximately R40 million at the current interest rates so as still to be able to fix its own interest rate at the current interest level. Therefore, in this way the State helps the Land Bank, by way of a low interest rate, to be able to borrow a large amount of money at a higher interest rate in order that it may maintain its lending rate at a fixed level. This is one of the methods that are used.</p>

<p>The second important question to which I replied in the Budget debate, was that some financial institutions feared that the bonds of the Land Bank would no longer count as liquid assets. In my reply to the Budget I said that that fear was unfounded and that, until the Government had taken a decision in that regard, all the bonds taken up at the Land Bank would still count as liquid assets. I expect this also to be of assistance in inducing banks and other institutions to invest more money with the Land Bank. The Land Bank is going public shortly, and in view of the increased liquidity which exists and which is going to come about in the finances of the country, we expect the Land Bank, with the money allocated by the State, to be in a position to attract more funds for its purposes, also because the current interest rates are showing a downward trend. I have hopes that in the years or year ahead the Land Bank will find it a little easier to operate. However, it is not my expectation that it will very soon be possible for the Land Bank to be placed in a position where it will be able to meet all the demands of farmers as far as agricultural financing is concerned. That is going to require a great deal of money, and therefore it will still take a very long time.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would like to deal with a subject which I have taken up with the hon. the Minister over the years. When we began with decimalization, naturally a new coinage was introduced into South Africa. With that, we saw the disappearance of the pound note, or afterwards, the R2 note. The hon. the Minister replied to one of my questions I put to him at great length. Today we are in the position that we have a R10 note, a R5 note and a R1 note. I do not know whether the R1 notes are printed on paper of a very low quality, but tellers in banks and other people who handle large sums of money in bazaars, etc. will tell you that, through the absence of an intermediate note, the R1 note is undoubtedly used to excess.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the banks keep on reissuing these old notes and one has to deal with these dilapidated, dirty notes. Those people who handle currency and have to pay out large sums will find it very convenient if there is an intemediate note between the R1 note and the R5 note. If it will make it convenient for decimalization, say, a R2,50 note can be introduced. However, there is no doubt about it that the R1 note today is used to a great extent with the net result that you have this very dilapidated piece of paper to deal with. I know of some people who say that they would like a million of them, never mind if they are dilapidated. But I would like to ask the hon. the Minister to give consideration to the introduction of another note. I know that the Chambers of Commerce have put forward a request to him but that he has turned it down. Maybe he feels that it is not convenient or warranted. I feel that he should give consideration to the introduction of such a note. I think that the hon. the Minister should look to the quality of this R1 note. If he feels that the paper on which it is printed is satisfactory then he should print these notes in greater quantities than they are printed at the moment and withdraw these very dilapidated notes. I have often taken it up with the banks and asked them whether we could not get cleaner notes, but then they tell me that they are only issued with a certain number of notes by the Reserve Bank and accordingly they reissue these dilapidated bank notes. I think it is wrong to ask people to handle these dirty, filthy notes, because one does not know what sort of disease you may pick up. I feel that if there were intermediate notes it would reduce the handling of the R1 notes and would make it easier as far as carrying currency <span class="col_5495-5496" refersTo="page_1211"/>is concerned. The person who is carrying money around today finds difficulty at times to get change. If you have to change a R10 note you have to carry a packet of R1 notes with you. It is not easy to get change for a R5 note either. If one wants to buy a small article you find difficulty in getting change for a R5 note. In regard to the intermediate note, I would like to see the R2 notes reintroduced. If the hon. the Minister feels that that is not convenient as far as decimalization is concerned, let us have a R2,50 note.</p>

<p>I want to leave the question of notes and look at the coinage. Firstly, I refer to the R1 coin. I do not know whether the Minister has the statistics available as to the circulation of this particular coin, but from my experience and the enquiries I have made, it seems that it is not a popular coin. It is a heavy coin which is becoming a collector&#x2019;s piece in some cases. It is not a very popular coin. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister could give consideration to either withdrawing it or making it lighter in weight. I do not know whether that could be done, but I do not think it is a coin that is very popular. Then you come to the 50 cent coin. It is another coin that does not have the circulation you would expect it to have, also on account of its weight. It is a heavy coin and is difficult to carry around. When people are extracting change from the bank you find that comparatively speaking there is very little demand for this particular coin. One only has to go where they handle big amounts of cash to find out what coins are used. You find that you very seldom see a R1 coin. And if you do see one turning up in a cash box, you wonder where it comes from. As I have said, it is becoming a collector&#x2019;s piece. The 50 cents piece is also a heavy coin. Then there is very small coin which has come into existence, the &#x00BD; cent coin. I know it may help the poorer sections of our community, but I have yet to see an article which is marked down to a half cent. You have this little coin which is more of a nuisance than it is worth. One wonders why it was ever reduced to the size it is at the moment. It is not a coin which is very popular. It has a nuisance value, and is apt to get lost.</p>

<p>I want to ask the Minister to give his serious consideration to the question of the note issue. We have now had experience of the note issue, and I think it is time we reconsidered the whole matter, to see whether we cannot reintroduce a note in-between the R5 and the R1 notes. Further, I should like to ask the Minister to consider having these notes printed on better quality paper, because they do not last. I am sure that the number of notes handed in to the Reserve Bank for exchange must be very large indeed&#x2014;much larger than it is necessary. I feel that the use of better quality paper or an intermediate note would improve the position.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to take up with the hon. the Minister the question of the method of tax administration, with particular reference to the assessing and collection of taxes. I think it is common cause that the Department of Inland Revenue, as is the case with most departments and many business organizations in South Africa, is suffering from a continual shortage of staff. I doubt very much whether this situation is going to change. South Africa is, we hope, a country which is going to expand, and our economy is going to expand. We are going to have as a natural process of evolution a shortage which, I think, will remain. I do not think we are going to get over these staff shortages. Our population may grow, but our industries will also grow, and therefore the need for workers and people of management calibre will also increase. We shall therefore always have shortages. At the present moment I doubt very much whether the hon. the Minister or the department will be prepared to say that they are happy about what checking is being <span class="col_5497-5498" refersTo="page_1212"/>done, what inspections are being done, what assessments are being done, and, from the Controller and Auditor-General&#x2019;s point of view, what audit is being done, of income tax returns. I do not say this in any spirit of criticism because it is a factual position and I think one must face it to see if we cannot change the position with the means we have at our disposal. I remember, for example, that in the good old days when I was in practice, if a dividend was paid by X Company to Mr. Y, a notification of the payment of that dividend always arrived in Mr. Y&#x2019;s file, and if that dividend was not returned by him, the Receiver of Revenue was able to say, &#x201C;You have not declared this dividend which we have been advised by X Company has been paid to you.&#x201D; This may be happening today, but I doubt it very much. I do not think that cross-checking is taking place today to the same extent as before. We have gone some way in trying to solve our tax administration problems by the introduction of P.A.Y.E., which at least ensures that there is an automatic deduction of a portion of a man&#x2019;s tax, and by the introduction of provisional payments which force the taxpayer to some extent, and to some extent only, to assess himself twice a year and to make his tax payments in advance. I wonder, Sir, whether the time has not come for us to take another step forward. We know that in the United States and in some European countries&#x2014;my colleague, the hon. member for Pinetown, tells me that it happens in Switzerland&#x2014;there is and has been for many years a system of self-assessment. In other words, when you or your accountant prepares your income tax return, you in effect do the work of the Receiver of Revenue; you prepare your assessment and you assess yourself. The hon. member for Pinetown and I last year had an interesting visitor, who was one of the assessors of the American inland revenue department. He had come to South Africa to help Americans living in South Africa with their assessments, because they are obliged to complete their own assessment and to assess themselves. In Canada, I understand, there have been some great steps forward. There they had the Carter Commission and they changed their whole system of taxation very considerably. They seem to have advanced to a considerable extent in the logistics of tax collection. What seems to be happening is that these countries are moving towards a system whereby you assess yourself. This assessment is then fed into a computer and then the computer would set up a norm for you. Most of the people who pay tax in this country are salary-earners with a reasonably fixed income. A norm is set up for each taxpayer. If the income of Mr. X is R10 000 a year, the computer would record this as his norm. When his next return comes in, the computer looks at his assessment within certain limits, a plus on the one side and a minus on the other side. It may be 5 per cent or 10 per cent either way. If his return for the following year does not differ by more than 10 per cent up or down from that for the previous year, which the computer has already recorded, then this is regarded as an assessment that does not require investigation each year, and a period of time is set, after which everybody&#x2019;s assessment is dealt with regularly. I do not know what the period is; it may be every three or five or seven years; I do not quite know how they operate, but I understand that there is a set period of time. This would therefore mean that assessments that really require looking into, could be handled much more effectively and much more efficiently by the available staff. You would then be able to place the emphasis on the assessment of individuals and companies whose incomes vary considerably. I fear that unless we move from the individual assessment of every taxpayer to a mechanized system through the computer, we are going to find that the efficiency of our tax system may well break down. Just as it has become necessary today in every aspect of business life to computerize, so has it also become necessary to computerize in the sphere of taxation, and I hope that some consideration will be given to this suggestion.</p>

<p>There is one other small matter that I want to raise, and I want to raise it in the hope that the hon. the Minister will be able to allay some fears. I have had representations from certain accountants who are very concerned with the fact that whenever they object to an assessment they find that their client&#x2019;s tax position is investigated over a period of three to five years. We know that a lot of assessments are not examined very carefully today. This is the point where I came in. But what they say is that if you object to any assessment from the Receiver, then you will find that there will be an investigation into your affairs. I doubt whether this is the case but I think it is important that the hon. the <span class="col_5499-5500" refersTo="page_1213"/>Minister should be able to tell us what the position is. One cannot have any objection to this. The Receiver is obviously entitled to examine anybody&#x2019;s income tax returns on any occasion if he cares to do it. That is his function and his job, but it would be a sad thing if a special situation existed today where, if you object to your assessment, all your asessments for the last two or three years come up for re-examination. I hope the hon. the Minister will be able to give us some assurance that this in fact is not taking place.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>I want to raise with the hon. the Minister what appears to be an anomaly or an irregularity in the collection of income tax from children. I refer to this as an apparent anomaly, because it may well be that there is machinery to put right what seems to be wrong. If so, I am not aware of it and I believe most taxpayers are not aware of it, and it is because of that that I raise this matter.</p>

<p>It is a fact that many children, particularly older children, do in fact try to make some contribution to the family income, or on their own merits earn a small income from their own activities. It is provided in the Income Tax Act that amounts so earned by children up to the amount of R600 per annum, shall not be taxable. These earnings are not taken into account in the assessment of their father, the taxpayer, and only if the amount so earned by these children exceeds R600 per annum do they themselves become independent taxpayers. This, in effect is the instruction given in this very excellent brochure issued with the income tax forms.</p>

<p>Let us take first of all the case of a university student. It may be that during his university holidays he goes out to try to earn some money in order to make a contribution to his own education and thereby to assist his family with their budget. If he is employed by a firm such as a department store, or he works for a newspaper, his pay cheque for the few months in which he works will be subject to an automatic PAYE deduction of 10 per cent. If he earns R300 during his school holidays he does not become a taxpayer and he does not render a tax return, but R30 has been taken off his remuneration at source by way of PAYE. This tax credit to the family, the R30 which he has paid, cannot appear in his father&#x2019;s income tax return, because the amount could not be shown, being under R600; nor does it appear in his own income tax return, because he has none, having earned under R600. Therefore, this R30 accrues to the State to whom it is in fact not due. It comes from a person who is not liable for tax, nor does it accrue to his family as a credit against his family&#x2019;s tax. This is the case where one member of the family is in fact a taxpayer.</p>

<p>I think perhaps a more serious anomaly arises in the case of the poor families, the low-income families, of whom there are many in this country, particularly in the non-White group. There, for example, you might have the father, the wage earner, earning some R2 000 per annum. You have the children making some contribution, possibly, to the income of the family. If the family is large enough, if there are sufficient minor children in the family, the abatements will in fact make the father a non-taxpayer. If he makes no income tax return, he is not liable for tax and he does not come within the purview of the Receiver of Revenue. His children who are each making their contribution of possibly a few hundred rands to the family budget, are themselves not taxpayers, but nevertheless each one of them is being taxed at source. In spite of its poor circumstances, the family is in fact paying tax where none is due. I do not know how many such cases there are, but there may well be very many in this country, particularly when one has regard to the Coloured community, the Indian community and a large part of the urban Bantu community. In the urban areas, such as Soweto, you have instances where the entire family goes out to try to make some contribution to the family budget. In total they might well fall into a tax class, but because the children are excluded, the total income of the family does not fall within the taxable bracket. These children&#x2019;s contributions are nevertheless taxed at source as if they were liable, by means of deductions by way of PAYE.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Minister, if he agrees that this anomaly does arise, whether there is any machinery by which the anomaly can be rectified. It must be remembered that these families make no return of tax, or if they do, then these earnings are not shown as part of the income of the family. How can the matter be remedied&#x003F; How can these people be assisted not to pay taxes which are not due, or how can they recover taxes which have <span class="col_5501-5502" refersTo="page_1214"/>been paid while they were not due&#x003F; It seems to me that this is an anomaly, an injustice if you like, which was not intended by the fiscus, but which should be put right because it bears most hardly on those children who, where it is needed, are making a contribution to the family income. It bears even more hardly on those families which are in dire need of contributions by their children, or on those families where every member has to earn as much as he can in order to survive. These hardships are aggravated in cases where the family is not liable to tax, but pays the tax through the PAYE system without an obvious remedy for the recovery of tax incorrectly paid.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I shall not reply to that question which was put directly to the hon. the Minister by the hon. member for Von Brandis, because I should like to return to something said by the hon. member for Parktown. I give him my full support if anything can be done to promote the collection of our funds and the control which is exercised over it. We are all of one mind about that and we are glad that the hon. member raised something like this. Attention will most certainly be given to something of this nature.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said, however, that accountants had drawn his attention to the fact that when a person objects to his assessment, his affairs are investigated. I must say that I have received no such objection in Pretoria. The hon. member also said he did not believe that this assertion was worth much. I want to put it pertinently that when a person objects to his assessment, he should not, after all, be afraid of having his assessments for the previous years gone into as well, for if his assessments were correct and he did not meddle with the information, he need not be afraid. So I should not feel concerned about such an investigation at all. If it is true that it has become customary for the department to act in this way&#x2014;I do not believe that it is the case&#x2014;the department will stop doing so very quickly, because if it finds that all the assessments were correct, it cannot afford to waste manpower on examining such assessments. I also want to say that my experience in the past was that the department does not have the necessary manpower to conduct inspections on a large enough scale. As far as I know such inspections, where they</p>

<p>were in fact conducted, have always proved successful and have always been to the advantage of the State.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Parktown has raised some interesting points in connection with our system of tax assessment and collection. The amount spent on the collection of taxes is an important consideration. According to a statement which I have in my possession, the cost which we incur to collect taxes runs into a fairly large amount. In 1969-&#x2019;70 the cost to collect taxes amounted to R7,99 million, and in 1970-&#x2019;71 to R8,4 million. I also have here a comparison with the cost of collection in the United States. In the case of South Africa, it is 0,4 cents. It was 0,4 cents in 1969-&#x2019;70. In 1970-&#x2019;71, when a larger amount was involved, it was 0,39 cents. In the United States, to which the hon. member has referred, it appears to be 0,5 cents per dollar, which means that the cost of collections in the United States was roughly about 40 per cent to 50 per cent more than in our instance. But, Mr. Chairman, that does not convey necessarily that we can sit back and be satisfied with our position. In any administration, I will admit, one will always find that there is room for improvement. That will be the position in our administration as well. That will always be the case where one has to deal with human beings. In view of this, <i>inter alia,</i> I may mention to the hon. member that in October and November, 1971, two members of the Department of Inland Revenue, the Secretary of the department, Mr. Schickerling, and Mr. Schweppenhausen, spent two months in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom in order to make a study of their systems of taxation, collections, and what is involved.</p>

<p>*In a memorandum Mr. Schickerling described the purpose of the visit as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die doel van die besoek was om deur middel van persoonlike samesprekings kennis van ander lande se belanstingstelsels en hulle invorderingsprosedure op te doen, om met hulle oor gemeenskaplike probleme gedagtes te wissel, en om in die algemeen toekomstige verwikkelings op fiskale gebied met hulle te bespreek.</block>

<p><span class="col_5503-5504" refersTo="page_1215"/>&#x2020; As a result of this visit, a rather comprehensive memorandum was compiled by Mr. Schweppenhausen. I have it here and makes for very interesting reading. The matter was not left at that, but Mr. Schickerling states here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sedert ons terugkoms het ek onderhandelings met die Staatsdienskommissie gevoer, en op 4 April 1972 is &#x2019;n departementele beampte wat die afgelope paar jaar as Staatsdiensinspekteur diens gedoen het, aan die departement gesekondeer. Hy word belas met die taak om ondersoek in te stel na waiter van bogenoemde stelsels met vrug hier ingevoer kan word. Die departementele werkstudiebeamptes en rekenaarprogrammeerdes sal onder sy vleuels geplaas word. Ek is seker dat beter benutting van die departementele personeel, uitrusting en akkommodasid bewerkstellig sal kan word, wat op die beurt besparings en doeltreffendheid sal meebring. Op hierdie tydstip word &#x2019;n volle selfaanslagstelsel nog nie beoog nie &#x2026;</block>

<p>That was the other point raised by the hon. member.</p>

<p>&#x2026; maar die basiese voordele wat dit inhou, kan nou reeds met aanpassings van prosedures deur ons benut word.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member also raised the question of objections and special investigations in the case of objections. The explanation seems to be very simple. The reason is that an objection is dealt with by a more experienced officer, who may see more errors in a return than a junior who dealt with the return originally. I think that is probably a reasonable explanation.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Von Brandis raised the question of children&#x2019;s income, where some of them may work during school holidays, university holidays and so forth. The explanation I have here is that PAYE is not necessarily deducted from a student&#x2019;s wages. Instructions appear in the PAYE deduction tables that if employers are satisfied that the employee is a fulltime student, they need not deduct. When deductions do take place, the student himself is given a refund and a shortened procedure for such a refund is in fact in use. I understand that it is only a small form that has to be completed and sent in to the collector for refunds.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I thank the hon. the Deputy Minister for his explanation. I think it is perhaps not widely enough known that there is a method for the recovery of such money improperly collected by means of PAYE from students. However, this was not the whole of my question nor the whole clarification which I sought. I did, in fact, refer also to families where the children, being minors, make a contribution to the family income. These children are not necessarily full-time students. They may be part-time students. They may not be students at all. There is, surely, an anomaly in a situation where minors, who are not themselves liable for tax as individuals, and whose fathers are not liable either for tax despite the contribution which these children make to the family&#x2019;s income, if only in the degree of self-support which they offer as their contribution, may nevertheless be taxed at source. It is a fact that they are taxed at source. I have personally seen, in the case of my own family, where my children have earned some small income by means of writing a magazine article, that the tax is in fact deducted by way of PAYE. This is universal practice. It happens everywhere in this country, and it happens most particularly, I would say, in the case of those families who are hard-up and whose children have to go out to make some contribution to the family income. The question whether they are students, full-time students or part-time students, is irrelevant. They do, in fact, make a contribution to the family income. That family, as a whole, is not taxable because of their low level of income, but these children are in fact being taxed. They are not aware of their remedy, the means by which they may recover this tax, a tax which is not in fact due to the State.</p>

I want to avail myself of this opportunity to convey the thanks of the Government and of the House to Mr. Groenewald for the valuable services he has rendered, and in particular for the serious and objective way in which he performed his duties at all times, as well as for the loyalty which the State and I have always received from him. I should like to wish him a very pleasant period of retirement.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we now come to the last of the Votes of the hon. the Minister of Finance and possibly the most important one of the whole lot. We are dealing here with the voting of money to the department under the control of the Controller and Auditor-General. The Controller and Auditor-General is the person who is the watchdog of this House, in the same way as we are the watchdogs of the public of South Africa, to see that moneys voted by this House are properly expended and that proper control is exercised over moneys that are voted for use in this country. I want to start by expressing the appreciation of this side of the House to the Controller and Auditor-General, Mr. Kotzenberg, and to his staff for the job that they have done. They have done a good job under extremely difficult circumstances. One only has to go through the reports of the Controller and Auditor-General to see the difficulties under which they have worked and to see the magnitude of the task that they are being asked to carry out under these difficult circumstances. We can sense a frustration in the report of the Controller and Auditor-General in that he is not being allowed to do the job that he should be doing.</p>

<p>No, I am not fighting. There is nothing to fight about. He is not being allowed, through circumstances beyond his control, to do the job that he would like to do. We find that he is required to audit the accounts of 261 Government departments, Government agencies, statutory bodies and boards, Bantu authorities and so forth. This is a tremendous task which he has been asked to do. But in addition to this he is expected to carry out <i>in loco</i> inspections of cash, revenue, stores, in offices and institutions spread throughout the whole of the Republic. If we put this in another way, what it amounts to is that he should every year, inspect 2 556 different offices, institutions and depots. We find that in the last financial year he was able only to inspect 1 090. In other words, something under 43 per cent. This means that in effect what we could imagine from this is a 43 per cent effective audit. But we find that this is not so, because even in the 43 per cent of the offices that he has visited, he has not been able to conduct a 100 per cent audit of each of those offices. What he has had to do was to do spot checks in different places. What do we find is the situation&#x003F; I quote from his report for 1970-&#x2019;71 on page 16, paragraph 15 (3).</p>

<p>Revenue Vote No. 12.&#x2014;&#x201C;Audit&#x201D;, R2 259 000 (contd.) :</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am sorry but there is so much noise that I cannot hear what you are saying. I assume that you have put the vote &#x201C;Audit&#x201D;, which we were debating before the House adjourned for lunch, because it was impossible to hear what you said. I want to say that it is nice for the Government to be able to rejoice. Let them enjoy it now, because it will be shortlived. Brakpan is coming again. We will talk to them then.</p>

<p>Let us now get down to the Vote which is before the House, the Vote Audit, of the Minister of Finance. Before we adjourned for lunch I was saying that the report of the Controller and Auditor-General showed a degree of frustration on the part of the Controller himself and his department in his failure to carry out his duties as we would expect him to carry them out and as he himself would like to carry them out. He failed to do so because of circumstances beyond his control. I have quoted where he said that it was impossible to carry out a more thorough investigation as a result of the difficult staff position in his department. He goes on page 51 of his report&#x2014;I hope you can hear me, Mr. Chairman&#x2014;and he says:</p>

<block name="quote">Out of a total of 541 audit posts on the fixed establishment, 355 were filled by permanent &#x2026; units.</block>

<p>He goes further and says that he has lost certain officers, but that he has been able to recruit others. A most revealing statement he makes is where he records that of the officers who were concerned directly with audit work, 51 per cent consisted of officers who had less than four years&#x2019; service or who were there in a temporary or part-time capacity. How can the Controller and Auditor-General be expected to carry out the duties, which he himself would like to do and which this House expects him to do, under these circumstances&#x003F; I want to ask the hon. the Minister and his Deputy what they are doing to assist the Controller to do the job he is supposed to do. Are they satisfied with the circumstances as we find them here today&#x003F; I must say that we on this side of the House are not satisfied.</p>

<p>I want to draw pertinently to the attention of the hon. the Minister the concluding paragraph on page 51 of the Controller and Auditor-General&#x2019;s report. He says:</p>

<block name="quote">I therefore feel that it is encumbent upon me once again to issue a serious warning that the present staff position in my department poses a real threat to the effective performance of the duties entrusted to me.</block>

<p>I had a look at past reports and I find this cropping up over and over again. In fact, this is the third year that an almost identical paragraph has been printed and what has the hon. the Minister done&#x003F; Has he done anything to assist the Controller and Auditor-General, to improve the situation so that he can do the job of work as he would like it done&#x003F; I am aware that a certain amount of local auditing is done within departments by the departments themselves. I am also aware that a certain amount of control is exercised within those <span class="col_5509-5510" refersTo="page_1218"/>departments by the departments themselves. However, I am afraid that that is also unsatisfactory, especially if we look again at page 16 of the report, paragraph 15 (1) where the Controller and Auditor-General reports:</p>

<block name="quote">The undercollections and unsatisfactory stores features which were brought to light can in the majority of cases be attributed to non-compliance with instructions with regard to internal checking and control.</block>

<p>Because of the instance which we have discussed in this House in the last 18 months or more, instances of complete lack of control on the part of departments

&#x2014;I refer to the Agliotti scandal and others which we have had here; I refer to the case which was revealed yesterday of a certain Mr. Gouws who had sole control of a tremendous fund of money while there was no supervision over him&#x2014;I raise this matter today. We are perturbed. How many other instances are there which are not being found through lack of audit control, where the Controller and Auditor-General wants to do the job of work, but this hon. Minister and his Deputy are not giving him the tools wherewith to do it&#x003F; When I started, I likened the Controller and Auditor-General to the watchdog of Parliament. It is no good having a watchdog who is old and mangey and whose teeth have been ground down. We need to give our watchdog teeth and it is only this hon. Minister and his Deputy who can give that watchdog the teeth he needs to do this job of work. It is three years now that the Controller and Auditor-General has been asking for this, but the hon. the Minister has still not given it to him.</p>

<p>Let us go further with the question of local control. If we look at the Controller and Auditor-General&#x2019;s report for 1969-&#x2019;70, we find on page 16 that it is not only the Controller and Auditor-General himself who is worried about this lack of control, but also the Treasury. On page 16 it is recorded that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Treasury has also, on several occasions, expressed its concern over the unsatisfactory state of affairs as regards control over stores as reflected in departmental inspection reports.</block>

<p>I want to say that, unless the Cabinet tightens up at that level and assists the people who should be exercising the control to carry out the control measures required of them, we are never going to have proper control of this matter. In the report for the year 1970-&#x2019;71, mention is also made of the Department of Defence, the department which falls under the Minister of Defence, the leader of the Nationalist Party in the Cape, who has been so jubilant about the success that he attained on Wednesday. What do we find there&#x003F; We find that there is internal audit provided for in his department, but that this appears to be unsatisfactory. We have had a similar statement in last year&#x2019;s report. The one that appears in this year&#x2019;s report reads that eight of these reports of which three were brought to the attention of the Commandant-General were noted as unfavourable and that even internal audit within the department is not satisfactory. We have had our scandals, and we have had losses of public money due to insufficient control and supervision. Here is a department which should exercise the control. In my days in the Service if there was one thing we dreaded it was the visit of the auditor, because he went through everything with a fine toothcomb. Nothing was left out, but today, I believe, it is not happening because he is unable to do the job which he has been given because he does not have the tools to do it. I want to ask the hon. Minister pertinently : If he was a director of a private concern would he be satisfied and does he think that his shareholders would be satisfied with the type of audit the Government is getting today&#x003F; I want to say categorically that I do not believe any shareholders of any concern with which I have anything to do with would be satisfied with this amount of auditing. In fact, in the private sector the hon. Minister knows no firm is satisfied with anything short of a complete and total audit. I accept that in an enterprise as vast as this Government administration it is impossible to do a total audit: I accent that. However, I believe that we should do more than we are doing now. I want to appeal to the hon. Minister to give to our watchdog, the Controller and Auditor-General, the teeth which are necessary for him to carry out the job of work he would like to.</p>

I want to tell the hon. member tha the said a few things he should preferably give second thoughts to. He says there is no control over, and management of, certain bodies, or that there is a great lack of it. I think that the lack of control is from those hon. members&#x2019; side in respect of their voters in Oudtshoorn.</p>

<speech by="#van_zyl">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to point out to the hon. member that the inspectorate of the department and its control and management begins within the department itself. If one&#x2019;s management and control in one&#x2019;s department is good enough and adequate, there is virtually no work for the Controller and Auditor-General and his staff. This hon. member ought to know that two years ago this matter was before the Select Committee on Public Accounts. We examined the question of staff thoroughly and adequately, and at a very high level the Cabinet increased the salaries of the public servants at the time. This was done specifically to retain the staff. What happened in the past&#x003F; As a result of this National Party&#x2019;s good economic policy and its good Government, the country was so prosperous that the Public Service staff was completely drawn off. This hon. member now says, and this is correct, that people who are in the Service have very little experience. The reason is that the staff of the State is drawn off to the private sector. I think it is a compliment to the Controller and Auditor-General and all the departments that as far as their inspectorate is concerned they can exercise as much control as they do. Of course, one can never be completely satisfied, and I want to concede to the hon. member that one must do everything to obtain adequate control. However, one must not try to achieve this with insinuations, as he tried to do. I want to say, in addition, that when the Controller and Auditor-General carries out an audit he does a 10 per cent inspection. If from that sample it appears necessary to carry out a more extensive inspection he would do so. Then a larger audit is carried out. This could perhaps cover 50 per cent or more, depending upon circumstances, if the Controller and Auditor-General&#x2019;s staff enters a department, carries out a 10 per cent sample check and finds nothing wrong, must a complete audit then be done&#x003F; The hon. member said :</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;A total audit must be done&#x201D; and I say why&#x003F;</block>

<p>That is not necessary, and it is not done, The hon. member says that if the Minister has a private business, he would never be satisfied if a complete audit is not carried out. It is not done, because a total audit is not always done. It depends on circumstances. If a total audit had to be done it would be an impossible task and the Controller and Auditor-General would never finish his work. I just want to state something very clearly. I think that the Controller and Auditor-General is giving us an impartial report. He reports clearly and unequivocally; he is not hiding anything and not patching anything up. That is his task. The hon. member said he is Parliament&#x2019;s watchdog. That is so, and I agree. For that reason all those matters are dealt with by the Select Committee. It is the Select Committee which is again Parliament&#x2019;s watchdog and which has all those departments before it and listens to witnesses. Decisions are taken accordingly. The hon. member himself is on the Select Committee with me.</p>

<p>Well, that is true, but at least he did have a seat on that Committee. Let it be as it may, he knows that the matters are thoroughly investigated. We ferret out whatever we can and the Select Committee&#x2019;s report is presented in this House annually. We therefore also have that report before us. Since we do believe that the Controller and Auditor-General must have adequate Staff, and I want to state this clearly, it is ensured at Cabinet level and by the Public Service Commission that this section of the Public Service is properly looked after. As I have already said, the salaries were increased for that reason, and for that reason there are so many other additional facilities given to the officials. In that way we try to retain the people and prevent their being drawn away by the private sector.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, of course, I should very much like to agree with what the hon. <span class="col_5513-5514" refersTo="page_1220"/> member for Pietermaritzburg District said at the beginning of his speech. It is quite appropriate that this came from a member of this House itself, since it concerns, as was pointed out, the Controller and Auditor-General and! since he is one of the most responsible officials of this House who is accountable to this House. Then, to my mind, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District went further than was necessary. In the first place, he tried to imply that things in connection with Government expenditure were in the process of collapsing. I must deny this absolutely. We know that there are problems as a result of staff shortages, but where would one not find such problems&#x003F; This is the case everywhere and in all Government departments. In the private sector, too, they have the problem of staff shortages, and adjustments have to be made. However, to try to create the impression that chaos is developing, and that is the impression one gains from the hon. member&#x2019;s speech, is to my mind totally unfounded. Nor do I think that that conclusion could rightly be drawn from the observations which were made by the Controller and Auditor-General in his report and to which the hon. member referred. For instance, the hon. member dragged in here incidents such as the Agliotti affair and the Gouws affair, which was raised in this House yesterday. After all the hon. member may not argue that these things would not have happened if the Controller and Auditor-General&#x2019;s staff, for instance, had been in full strength; besides, he may not even argue that if there had been an irregularity in regard to the Agliotti affair or the Gouws affair, that would have been something which the Controller and Auditor-General would have discovered. Here it was not a case of Government moneys being embezzled or removed, where it would have been the normal function of the Controller and Auditor-General to point this out. I would readily grant that the tendency for people to lay their hands on Government moneys, might be strengthened if it were to appear that the Controller and Auditor-General was no longer able to exercise his functions properly.</p>

<p>Yes, but the hon. member raised instances such as the Agliotti and Gouws affairs, which are not relevant here at all, and which actually, do not concern the functions of the Controller and Auditor-General at all. These were simply dragged in here by the hair. I do not think that the hon. member may rightly argue that in our administration, in our spending, in the keeping of accounts and in the examples of internal audit mentioned by him, a state of affairs has at all developed which may give rise to a tendency towards the conditions to which I referred here. It is not being denied that problems do exist. There are staff problems, and the Controller and Auditor-General has rightly pointed them out, but when he does so, I do not think that we should try to create the impression that we are heading for chaos. I think the hon. member has gone too far in that respect.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark may go ahead and be proud of the result in Oudtshoorn, but let me tell him that with every Nationalist member of the House of Assembly <span class="col_5515-5516" refersTo="page_1221"/>who comes to this House from the rural areas, the responsibility resting on this side of the House to put the case of the farmer in South Africa, only becomes greater. In spite of the Oudtshoorn result and in spite of the fact that the Nationalist Party candidate was elected, I want to say to the hon. member that we on this side of the House will not neglect our duty in respect of the farmer and in respect of the people living in the rural areas. Sir, I have already said that we come here year after year to bring certain problems of the farmer to the attention of the Minister. Today we on this side once again want to isolate some of these cardinal problems very clearly, so that the hon. the Minister may give us an idea of how he sees the future of the farmer. In the first place, I believe that there is a general lack of confidence among most agriculturists today. My proofs are, in the first place, the fact that the average age of the South African farmer is increasing all the time. The place of those older farmers is not taken by younger people. In addition I can prove this statement by referring to the number of students enrolling at the agricultural faculties of our universities every year, and I believe I can also prove it by referring the hon. the Minister to the number of students at our agricultural colleges. Sir, this situation should definitely be a tragic one to anyone interested in agriculture, in the sense that, while most young people are qualifying themselves for a particular direction today, fewer and fewer young people are qualifying themselves for the agricultural industry. To me this is an alarming position, and I believe that in the course of time this country will lament the fact that for so many years we have neglected to do something in regard to this matter. I believe that this lack of interest in agriculture is due to the lack of confidence in the future of agriculture; that is why the father is no longer prepared to influence his son to have himself trained as an agriculturist; that is why fathers are no longer prepared to see to it that their sons attend agricultural colleges. The young people, who are all striving for a high standard of living and who want to earn the highest possible wage or salary, are influenced by the fact that the general and economic situation in agriculture is not attractive enough for them. I want to refer the hon. the Minister to page 2 of the report of his Secretary for Agricultural Economics and Marketing, where the debts of the farmer are compared with his assets and the following is stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On an over-all basis, this is an indication of a favourable state of affairs. Nevertheless, the increasing total debt and high interest rates are placing a heavy burden on the agricultural industry. Moreover, it is a known fact, and one that was again confirmed by applications in terms of the interest subsidy scheme that came into operation during the year under review, that the burden of debt in the industry is rather unevenly spread and that financial obligations are crippling some farmers. Similarly, the financial position of farmers in certain branches of the industry is generally less favourable.</block>

<p>This is what the Minister&#x2019;s Secretary says in his report.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I can read out the entire report to the hon. member if he wants that, but I do not think it is necessary. I want to make this point specifically : The financial position of the agriculturists is such that it must necessarily exert an influence on the young people. But one need not look at this report only; let us also look at page 184, paragraph 10.2.1.6 of the most recent report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Agricultural Industry, where we read the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">However, there are indications that the course of events in the economic sphere during the late 1950s was much less favourable to the South African farmer. However, it is suspected that the harmful consequences of these serious difficulties have not yet been eradicated completely.</block>

<p>They went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Various experts have pointed out, however, that in spite of this comparatively favourable impression in respect of the share of the agricultural industry in general and the prosperity of the country, the instability and particularly the disproportion of the distribution of income in the agricultural industry, points at serious income problems for certain farmers, problems which are suspected to <span class="col_5517-5518" refersTo="page_1222"/>be closely connected in several respects with the incidence of agricultural poverty in South Africa.</block>

<p>I do not think one can obtain more convincing evidence for the statement I made when I said that the financial and economic position of many farmers helped to bring about a general lack of confidence. Consequently these people are not prepared to influence the next buyer, even a son, to take up this profession. In other words, one finds now that nobody is exceptionally optimistic about the future of the agricultural industry. There are also people in very important positions who continually say that we have too many farmers in this country, and when one gets bodies which should be taking the lead&#x2014;I am very sorry to say this, but there is one person in particular who, in my opinion, is making a tremendous mistake by persisting with his stories that there are too many farmers in South Africa, and this is a certain Prof. Kassier of the University of Stellenbosch, one of those people who should be training our young people and giving them confidence in the future. But he is one of the people who has repeatedly pointed out that we have too many farmers and who has even gone so far as to say that the figure of 30 000, representing the number of people who will possibly have to leave the agricultural industry, has been conservatively calculated and that this figure should be much higher. Furthermore, I am sorry to have to say that even a person such as Mr. Chris Cilliers, who is the Director of the S.A. Agricultural Union, and also a person such as Dr. M. B. Marais. who was chairman of the Commission of Inquiry into the Agricultural Industry at one time, continually say that there are too many farmers in South Africa and that we should have fewer. I have already raised this point with the hon. the Minister previously, and unfortunately his name is also linked with it in a report which appeared in <i>Rapport,</i> a report to the effect that the hon. the Minister allegedly agrees with these statements.</p>

<p>If the hon. the Minister does not agree with that, I would be very glad to hear it, and I want to say to the Minister today that I believe this debate could do much to inspire confidence among the agriculturalists if the hon. the Minister would tell us very clearly that he disassociates himself from the statements made about the number of farmers who have to leave the land, so that we may know exactly where we stand with the Minister.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Of course I am aware that it is a world phenomenon, but I am also aware that although it is a world phenomenon, people in those countries where this is also found are prepared to pay attention to this point and to think in terms of reversing the process instead of having fewer and fewer farmers on the land. I think that unless we state very clearly what we mean by the number of farmers or the so-called uneconomic farmers who are to disappear, unless we say very clearly how many we have in mind, unless we state by what scientific method the decrease of 30 000, or whatever the number may be, should be brought about, and unless we can put forward a very clear scientific basis for it, I believe that that sort of statement, which is often unfounded, serves to reduce the confidence in our agricultural industry. Sir, you need simply read the agricultural publications and magazines. Responsible farmers and authorities on the industry have repeatedly asked what this means, these 30 000 farmers who are to disappear; in the first place, where are they to find a livelihood, and, in the second place, if their land is to be bought out, by whom is it to be bought and where are the finances for it going to come from; and, once they have been sold out and one has, say, 60 000 farmers left in South Africa, would the process not repeat itself within one or two generations&#x003F; I think the hon. the Minister should take this House into his confidence in regard to this matter so that we may inspire greater confidence in the industry. The hon. the Minister has a responsibility towards the farmers of this country.</p>

<p>Another very alarming fact which I believe gave rise to this lack of confidence in agriculture, is that the fight we have had against inflation in recent years, has hit the South African farmer hardest. Once again, I do not want to furnish my own figures or facts. I think the person who may quote <i>par excellence,</i> is Mr. De la Harpe de Villiers, who said the following at the congress of the S.A. Agricultural Union in Windhoek in October of last year (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_5519-5520" refersTo="page_1223"/>The net income of many South African farmers is too low for a decent existence and does not keep pace with those of enterprises outside the agricultural industry.</block>

<p>Mr. Frans van Wyk, also a member of the Du Plessis Commission, said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The South African farmers&#x2019; financial position is so serious that he was forced to pay out in interest almost his total income.</block>

<p>Surely it was not supporters of the United Party who levelled this criticism. After all, this is criticism which the hon. the Minister and members on that side of this House should consider seriously in examining the problems of our farmers.</p>

<p>I shall not apologize for repeating many of the points I made on previous occasions, but every year I have to listen here to the same excuses being made by the hon. the Minister, which is no solution to South Africa&#x2019;s problem. That is why it is our duty to bring these problems to his attention time and again and I believe that at some or other stage we shall achieve something and the hon. the Minister will come forward with a plan and not merely search for excuses for his lack of action. It is very clear to us that the lack of confidence is caused by the fact that there is a shortage of working capital for the farmer, and when there is a shortage of working capital, capital is tremendously expensive as well. In a previous debate this morning I pointed out the situation in the Land Bank to the Minister of Finance. I pointed out that the situation was by no means adequate, and that today increasingly fewer farmers could be helped by those institutions when they were in financial difficulties in respect of bonds held by them. I believe this is the heel of Achilles of our agricultural industry today. And this is causing a lack of confidence. If one&#x2019;s other financial institutions are no longer interested in agriculture, who is to take care of the function of financing agriculture&#x003F; Nobody else can do it except a State institution, institutions such as the Land Bank and the Agricultural Credit Board. If the farmer is able to absorb production costs, or if a situation may be created in terms of which prices may be adjusted regularly as the production costs rise, the farmer may most certainly just like any other person, appeal to the private financial institutions. Then he may be helped there and pay the normal interest rate. However, because he is not in the position of being able to do so, there is no other alternative but to expand the scope of the Land Bank so that it may play that role. It is the attitude of this side of the House that we should have a division or a department of agricultural finance which will have to play this role and which will be a master body in relation to the Department of Agricultural Credit and the Land Bank as the two most important institutions in this respect.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>I have always thought that the hon. the Minister does at least recognize the problem, but merely does not have a solution to it. However, it seems to me now that he does not even recognize the problem. I have already mentioned the problem as far as the farmer is concerned. The private financial institutions are no longer interested in the farmer today, because of the fact that they can invest their money much better in so many spheres other than in the agricultural industry. If this is the situation, surely something else should be substituted. This is all this side of the House is pleading for. If a problem develops in a particular direction, make sure that an answer can be given and that a body can be established or that the scope of certain institutions can be extended in order to fill that vacuum which has been caused. This is all we are asking of the hon. the Minister in this regard.</p>

<p>In the second place, we believe that confidence in our agricultural industry may be considerably restored if we got away from an <i>ad hoc</i> assistance mentality. We must get away from the idea that the farmer can be helped by the department every year, and that there is financial assistance for him whenever he has to contend with economic or climatic problems. If we could get away from that <i>ad hoc</i> assistance mentality, and could think instead along the lines of long-term planning for our industry, we would inspire confidence in it.</p>

<p>The hon. member asks me: Such as&#x003F; I want to say to him at once that we on this side fully agree with the findings of the Commission of Inquiry into the Agricultural Industry, namely that advisory agricultural planning councils should be established. The only point on which we differ with them, is that we do not want the body to be merely an advisory one. There has already been an agricultural advisory council, but this did not meet the need at all, because those persons had no power. They could merely advise. They did not even have the right to talk about the price policy or to make recommendations. We would rather see an agricultural planning council being established so that it may place the general planning of our agricultural industry on a sound footing.</p>

<p>Is that your solution&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member has asked me whether this is a solution. I believe it would be the first step. One must have experts who are able to do these things for one. One must be able to have the experts of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, of Agricultural Economics and Marketing and of Agricultural Credit. They may consolidate all those functions so that we may know exactly, and be able to determine, what the future holds for agriculture in South Africa. One can do nothing without proper planning. Only an agricultural planning council could meet this need. When the farmers see something of this nature being established for them, I believe there will immediately be increased confidence in our industry. I am not advocating an Industrial Development Corporation, or a similar body, for agriculture. However, I want to take it as a precedent. The Industrial Development Corporation has helped us to place the industrial life of this country on a sound basis. I see something similar in the establishment of an agricultural planning council. Even when surpluses and shortages arise, one may have such a planning council which may channel one&#x2019;s production in a particular direction. It would consist of people who could predict the future accurately. It is not impossible to make such predictions if they have the correct information and data and the right technical people. The United Party sees the basis of our agricultural future in the establishment of such a body. If not, we shall just have to accept that it is not only the so-called uneconomic farmer who will have to leave the land. It will even include the young productive farmer who, as a result of circumstances beyond his control, finds that his profit margin is becoming increasingly smaller and consequently has less and less confidence in the industry.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p><span class="col_5523-5524" refersTo="page_1225"/>We have had discussions here before about the definition of an economic and an uneconomic farmer. However, I want to point out to the hon. member what happened in recent times. I want to quote from the

<i>Landbouweekblad,</i> in which a farmer indicated how his production costs have increased in recent years. He said, for example

(translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Fertilizer prices were in some cases increased for the umpteenth time last year. Now again by 50 cents.</block>

<p>He also mentions the case of tractors and says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Price Controller has granted a price increase of almost 9 per cent to one company, while another company&#x2019;s tractors have already increased by R400 each. Soon there is going to be a further increase of R400-R800 in one year on one tractor!</block>

<p>He points out, for example, that the price of bags has increased tremendously. A combine, for which he paid R11 200 last year, costs more than R14 000 this year. A 10-ton lorry, for which he paid R9 500 last year, costs more than R12 000 now. When this situation develops, it is not only the position of the so-called

&#x201C;uneconomic&#x201D; farmer which becomes increasingly difficult&#x2014; it also applies to the bigger farmer, the so-called

&#x201C;prosperous&#x201D; farmer, and the economic farmer, as we are supposed to know him. The position of those people is also becoming progressively worse. I believe an agricultural planning council could pay attention to matters such as these and make good recommendations to the hon. the Minister. In this way we would find that the profit motive would return to the agricultural industry. In this way we would see greater confidence in the industry. I believe this is the first step which should be taken.</p>

<p>I want to look at a few other steps as well. If we want confidence in our agricultural industry, we should eliminate the additional bottle-necks in the industry. Where bottle-necks arise in the marketing, whether it be of meat or whatever, those bottlenecks should be eliminated immediately. If they are not eliminated, it only causes a lack of confidence on the part of the agriculturist. The result of that is that he becomes less and less interested in his industry and in making a success of it. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am rising to furnish an immediate reply to the speech made by the hon. member for Newton Park, and I am doing so for a number of reasons. In the first place I find it interesting that the hon. member has asked me questions today about what my standpoint is on certain matters. The questions he has asked here now he has himself furnished replies to in the past in political speeches made outside Parliament. These were accusations which he made without checking up, and now he wants to come and check up afterwards. He and his leader on the opposite side went about in the country and made statements to newspapers to the effect that I had said on one occasion that 30 000 farmers should disappear off the land. He did not try to check up on his facts then. He did not then take the trouble to ask whether the report, as he read it in the newspaper, was correct. He simply went and used it as an item of gossip, saying that that was what the Minister wanted to do. He did this himself a few days ago. It was not very long ago, it was when he and his henchmen were addressing a meeting in Oudtshoorn. He then did the same thing and told the farmers of Oudtshoorn stories. There are many small farmers, smaller farmers and big farmers in Oudtshoorn. There is probably no other constituency in which farmers of different categories are better represented than they are in Oudtshoorn. There he tried to tell the farmers, in all manner of ways, that the Government, with its Minister of Agriculture, wanted them out of the rural areas. Nor did he hesitate to mention the figure which the Minister had allegedly mentioned. He mentioned the figure of 30 000, and Oudtshoorn gave him his reply. Just as the other farmers in the country do not believe him when he claims that I had said that, so the farmers in Oudtshoorn did not believe him, and proved it. I now want to tell the hon. member this: If he wants to discuss agricultural policy I am quite prepared to accommodate him. If the hon. member is prepared to convey and interpret correctly the standpoints which I state. I am also prepared to discuss them with him. But if the hon. member does what he has always done in the past and interprets statements made by people or standpoints adopted by them in such a way as to derive benefit for the United Party from them in a dubious way, then the farmers of South Africa will never <span class="col_5525-5526" refersTo="page_1226"/>accept him. Then he will remain a shadow Minister all his life. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I maintain, Mr. Chairman, that I need not furnish him with a reply this afternoon as to who censures him. I think Oudtshoorn has replied to him very strongly and without any doubt, for he also happens to be the Cape leader of his party, and not only the shadow Minister of Agriculture. But after he had listened to this and made such statements, I want to say to the Leader of the Opposition that I have held this position for approximately 14 years now, and during that time he has had four shadow Ministers of Agriculture. Some of them are still in the House;

some of them have already left. I now want to say to him that if his shadow Minister cannot do any better than this, he should really see whether he cannot find anyone else to take over as shadow Minister. [Interjections.] The hon. member made a few statements, statements which I want to analyse immediately. One of the first statements he made was that people do not have confidence in agriculture and are not going into agriculture. But is that statement correct&#x003F; He tried to prove here that the people in agriculture are becoming older and that not so many young people are going into agriculture any more. Is the statement the hon. member made, i.e. that there is no confidence in agriculture, correct&#x003F; We can, in the first place, consider the production industries in the country, we can consider the prices which are being paid for agricultural land and, if a person pays that price for agricultural land without having any confidence in the industry, then he must either be a United Party supporter, or stupid. In the second place, if there is no confidence in &#x2026;</p>

<p>Do not become nervous.</p>

<p>In the second place, Mr. Chairman, if a piece of land is made available by the State, land owned by the State which is made available for agricultural purposes, then there are hundreds of applications for one farm. The Minister, with the department and its board, then has to decide to which of those hundreds of applicants the land should be sold. In the third place, Mr. Chairman, hundreds of applications to the Land Bank and to the Department of Agricultural Credit are being made by people who want to purchase land in order to go farming. The hon. member has in fact just levelled the accusation that there is insufficient credit available from the Land Bank with which to undertake this financing, the financing of the purchase of the land for the young farmers. It seems there is not enough money available. But if there are no applications, if there are no people who are interested, why should that money then be made available&#x003F; No, Sir, let us not merely stand here flailing the wind and do so just to try to prove a few political points. Surely this hon. member knows as well as I do that when agricultural land comes onto the market the demand for that land is usually far greater&#x2014;there are far more people who make application for it&#x2014; than the amount of land which is available. He mentions that the commission points out that there is an uneven financial distribution of income in agriculture. Of course there is an unequal distribution of income in agriculture. This is present everywhere, Sir. Then the hon. member states that there is a tremendous burden of debt in agriculture. He quoted last year&#x2019;s figure of R113 million&#x2014;the total fixed debt in agriculture. But what was the farm income from agricultural produce&#x003F; The farm income from agricultural produce in this country is more than R1 700 million per annum&#x2014;in other words, one year&#x2019;s income from farm produce is more than the total debt in agriculture&#x2014;only one year&#x2019;s income. Mention to me another industry which has a better ratio. The hon. member must not shake his head now. After all, we are arguing this matter out now. I am replying to the statements made by the hon. member. Of course there is an unequal distribution. The hon. member now says that the Minister must state his policy in respect of the measures which are being adopted to rectify this situation in agricultural industry. The hon. member then stated his solution. The solution which he presents for this situation is a council which will plan agriculture as a whole, which will plan its production patterns, its sales patterns, its marketing patterns, and so on. I do not want to say that such a co-ordinating council will not be able to achieve a little co-ordination. However, I cannot see how such a board would be able to accomplish more than the advisory council we have at present. But what is the present situation in South Africa&#x003F; The present situation is that agriculture is being planned in absolute terms on the various levels. It is being planned on the <span class="col_5527-5528" refersTo="page_1227"/>

research level according to the need for research in respect of every product which is being produced. In the sphere of marketing it is being planned by different control boards which are co-ordinated by means of a marketing council composed in terms of a Marketing Act passed by this Parliament. The hon. member is now proposing an overall council which will undertake the planning. He says that the problem is that the advisory council does not have powers and that it can only act in an advisory capacity. When the hon. member has established the council which he has in mind and has conferred upon that council the powers which he wants to confer upon it, and when this wonderful planning has now been accomplished&#x2014;that planning which was also proposed by the commission of inquiry, to which the hon. member referred&#x2014;what will happen then&#x003F;

But the hon. member reads only those portions of the recommendations in the report of the commission of inquiry which suits his purpose. He does not read further. He does not read what action the commission proposes. That side of the House now wants to establish a council, but as I see the matter, this is only likely to happen by about the year 2040. However, that is not relevant now. Is this council which that hon. member is now proposing going to have the power to prescribe to farmers what they may produce, and what not&#x003F;</p>

<p>The right guidance is being given to the farmers every day.

The farmers are told that certain areas, for example, are more suited to maize. This is analysed by means of research, and indicated to the farmer. They are being given all the information they need. Once the hon. member has established this council, upon which he wants to confer powers, is he also going to give that council the power to determine for the farmer what he should produce in certain regions, and what not&#x003F; What powers does the hon. member then want to confer upon the council if he does not want to confer that power upon them&#x003F; If all the planning has been done, if all the recommendations have been made, and if the guidance, as the hon. member is now proposing, has been given to them, and the farmer does not act upon that guidance, what is the hon. member, with his council, going to do then&#x003F; These replies the hon. member must give us this afternoon.</p>

<p>But it is easy to level criticism here, and to say that this, that or the other is not being done. I now want to say to the hon. member that if the State is held responsible for planning and the implementation of planning in agriculture, it will have to take powers to restrict farmers to what they may produce and to how much the expenditure has to be which may be incurred in that connection. That will have to be done. If that is done, the matter will have to be carried through to its logical conclusion and the prices will also have to be determined.

<p>But you are now proposing that you want to tell the farmers at this early juncture what you are going to do. After all, you are interested in what is happening at present in agriculture. I know of course that the hon. member will never have an opportunity of implementing his policy. That is just by the way. The hon. member made certain allegations and statements here, and said that one of the causes of the unequal distribution and the fact that the farmers are not interested in agriculture is because credit facilities for the farmers are inadequate.</p>

<p>Yes, under the planning council, but which will provide the financing and credit on an overall basis. At the moment this is being done by the Land Bank and the Department of Agricultural Credit. Apparently the hon. member is not satisfied with the fact that there are two bodies which are doing this, but I must point out that these are two different kinds of financing. However, the hon. member says that he will have a council which will be consolidated, and which is going to undertake the provisions of credit. I want to ask the hon. member one question: Will the council which the hon. member is going to appoint for that purpose provide credit without taking into consideration the financial position of the person who is making application for credit&#x003F;</p>

<p>That may seem strange.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am merely asking the question. Is the hon. member going to have a norm according to which farmers are going to be provided with credit, or is he not going to have any norm&#x003F; If he has a norm, the hon. member probably has the sound common sense to acknowledge that there will be people in agriculture who do not comply with that norm, or is it so that under the policy of that member everyone will comply with the norm&#x003F; If there are people who do not comply with that norm, the hon. member has still not solved the problem to which he referred. That same commission of inquiry referred to the fact that in some cases there is too much credit available in agriculture. Even if the hon. the Minister of Finance were to remove the credit ceiling over the banks completely and the Land Bank had an additional amount of R100 million at its disposal for providing credit, but an Act still existed in terms of which credit has to be supplied&#x2014;in other words, if the norm is not eliminated&#x2014;there would still be a large number of people who would not qualify for that credit. Surely that goes without saying.</p>

<p>However, the hon. member wants to create the impression that under his scheme every farmer in South Africa will qualify for credit; only he has to be on the farm. That is the impression the hon. member is trying to create, for his argument proceeds from that point. He says the farmers are leaving the farms and he wants to know what my policy is and what I am going to do about it. I maintain that the farmer who does not comply with the norm imposed by this Government or any other Government in regard to the provision of credit to farmers, will disappear from agriculture. Is the hon. member satisfied with that&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>What is the norm&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is the question. The norm which the Government accepts is that cognizance should be taken of the total situation of the farmer. Consideration has to be given to the total investment made in the land which he purchased. Consideration has to be given to his total investment in agriculture. These facts have to be taken into consideration so that it may be determined whether the credit which he has available for that purpose will enable him to move from that situation to a better one. That is the norm. I am asking the hon. member what other norm he is going to accept, for there is another norm which goes further than that. The Government goes further and we adopt the standpoint that we in the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure are prepared to run an even greater risk with such a farmer than that specific norm, and to finance him over and above that norm. I want to ask the hon. member what his norm is going to be if he has to undertake agricultural financing by means of the council which he is proposing. Let him tell us what his norm will be. Is he going to finance any farmer, regardless of the size of his property, regardless of the extent of his farming operation&#x003F; As soon as that farmer needs financing, is the State going to supply it to that farmer by means of its institution, regardless of whether that farmer owns 100 morgen or 20 000 morgen, or whether he produces 1 000 or 1 million bags of maize&#x003F; Is the hon. member also going to have a norm in that case in that he will say that he <span class="col_5531-5532" refersTo="page_1229"/>will only finance farmers who do not own more than a specific quantity of land&#x003F;

Is he going to undertake unrestricted financing&#x003F; I want to ask the hon. member this question : If he undertakes unrestricted financing, regardless of the size of and the investment in that farming enterprise, how is he going to keep those small farmers on the land, which he implies he is going to do&#x003F; How is he going to keep them there&#x003F; I say that it is very easy to make statements here. But I want to point out that the norm of the Government is as follows : When the State intervenes financially, when it is expected of the State to undertake financing, it does so within the norm of the economic farming unit. I must agree with the hon. member that that farming unit can vary. It can err slightly to the wrong side&#x2014;although it cannot go as easily to the left-hand side as it can to the right-hand side&#x2014;but the fact remains that it can err. The opinion can be that that land is a little larger than the established norm. It goes without saying that one cannot cut off a piece of that man&#x2019;s land if he is above that norm. However, one does have a norm. The hon. member has asked what an economic unit for the farmer is. I want to say this to the hon. member. An economic unit for a farmer is a unit which, in the opinion a body established by the State, can allow a farmer to make a reasonable subsistence on that property according to the capital investment which is being utilized on that property. This is stated very simply. Within that norm the opinion of the board may vary. The board may sometimes arrive at one conclusion and sometimes at another, but that is the basic norm. Now I want to ask the hon. member, if he comes into power one day and he appoints this council of his and establishes a norm for it, what is its norm going to be&#x003F; I am asking this question because he is criticizing me, and he is criticizing the Government&#x2019;s standpoint. What is his norm going to be according to which he is going to do this, or is he going to have no norm whatsoever&#x003F; Is he going to allow any farmer unlimited credit, regardless of the size of his enterprise&#x003F; Is the hon. member going to do that&#x003F; If the hon. member is not going to do that, he must not say that this Government is doing nothing, and then he must not say that he put certain questions to the Minister and that the Minister had not replied to those questions. I have stated my reply repeatedly, and I am furnishing it again this afternoon. It is that when the State is expected, in any industry, whether it is in agriculture or in any other industry, to undertake financing, it undertakes that financing within the economic limits of the person whom it has to finance. The State is not there to finance big farmers. The State is not there to encourage capitalistic farming, and that is why it has to have that norm. On the other hand, the State is not there to finance people whose financial burdens are such that they will still be unable, despite all the auxiliary measures the State is able to put at their disposal, to remain on the land. After all, one cannot spend the taxpayer&#x2019;s money in such a manner. The hon. member is creating the impression, and I may be wrong &#x2026;</p>

<p>Very well then, but that is not what is at issue here; that is not what we are discussing now. We are discussing the accusation the hon. member made, i.e. that the Government is doing nothing to keep farmers on the land by means of State financing. That is what is at issue here. If a farmer is able to obtain financing elsewhere, the State is, after all, not responsible for him. I am not talking about the &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The policy of the National Party is that the State helps the farmers as much as possible, but it has to be done within a norm according to which one is able to keep a farmer on the land. I want to repeat that it is not the duty of the State to finance people in agriculture who want to expend their enterprise to an exceptional extent. Nor is it the duty of the State to finance people in agriculture who have no hope of being <span class="col_5533-5534" refersTo="page_1230"/>rehabilitated. Nor is it the duty of the State to provide financing to every person who wants to farm and who wants to purchase land, regardless whether he will be able to make a decent subsistence on that land. If that is the policy, and if there are such norms, it unfortunately has to be the case in agriculture. The total income from agriculture is not equally distributed among all farmers, just as the income in other sectors is not equally distributed among the different companies. In the business world the income of the different companies and the people who participate in those industries, is not evenly distributed among them, and there are people who are leaving those industries as well because what they are able to derive from them is insufficient. The position is the same in agriculture. For that reason the commission found that one of the major problems is in fact what the hon. member referred to and which he accused the Government of. He said namely, that there is an unequal distribution of income. I now want to ask the hon. member whether he maintains that the Government should ensure a more even distribution of income in agriculture. Is it the task of the Government to ensure a more even distribution of income in agriculture&#x003F; Is that the hon. member&#x2019;s standpoint. Sir, there will always be an uneven distribution, even if the United Party were to be in power; or is there not going to be an unequal distribution of income under a United Party government&#x003F; There will always be people in agriculture who derive too little from agriculture to make a decent living, and there will always be people who will disappear from agriculture, now and in the future, and if that is not a logical argument, then the hon. member must tell me what is. The Government appointed a commission of enquiry, and that commission of enquiry found that this will be the position in agriculture in spite of all the auxiliary measures introduced by the State. People will, from time to time, disappear from agriculture. Whether it is 30 000 or 10 000 or 2 000, has nothing to do with it. What is relevant to this matter is the following: If they were to disappear from agriculture as a result of Government action, if the Government were to make it its policy to oust them, then it would be different, but if they are disappearing from agriculture as a result of economic circumstances, then I ask to what extent is it the responsibility of the Government to keep those people on the land&#x003F; Must the Government finance them in full in order to keep them there&#x003F; The Government cannot do this, and therefore a certain number of them will always disappear. Sir, because this is the situation and people will disappear from agriculture, which creates a problem for the rural areas, the commission of enquiry recommended that a committee be appointed to go into the whole question of rural reform, a committee on which different departments would be represented, which would have to investigate how people who leave agriculture may be absorbed elsewhere and what policy should be followed in order to retard rural deterioration. Sir, what did the hon. member do when this committee was announced&#x003F; He went to Oudtshoorn and told the voters there: &#x201C;This committee which the Minister has appointed to investigate rural reform is part of the Government&#x2019;s policy to get rid of 30 000 farmers.&#x201D; The hon. member is shaking his head now, but surely that is what he said.</p>

<p>Now the hon. member says that the Minister does not have long-term planning for aid. Every time a problem arises the Government provides <i>ad hoc</i>

aid; we (the United Party) are now going to plan on a long-term basis. But is that true&#x003F; The Government&#x2019;s entire marketing policy is based on long-term planning. Our entire research policy is geared to long-term planning, to determine what commodities might become scarce, and the production of which products could be encouraged. Our entire research, our spraying and our control of fungus diseases is geared to the long term. Our financing for interest rates on Land Bank loans is planned on a long-term basis. All this is planned on a long-term basis. Does the hon. member now want to tell me that they will never give <i>ad hoc</i> aid&#x003F;

Take something like the wool industry, of which the hon. member has a little knowledge, for he shears sheep himself and sells the wool. Otherwise he would not have had much knowledge about this either. Suppose he had a wool enterprise which had obtained good prices over the years, and suddenly there was a collapse of the overseas market. Now the hon. member states that one should have had long-term planning in order to deal with this position, one should not merely make <i>ad hoc</i> aid available. What long-term planning could the hon. member have had in that case&#x003F; Would he have begun to plan ten years ago, so that if the wool prices dropped in ten years&#x2019; time, he would have been able to do this, that or the other&#x003F; I now want to ask the hon. member a second question.

<p>Yes, in a moment. After I had been there, the hon. member went and told the farmers that this was typical of the Government; the Minister did not have a long-term policy.</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Will the hon. the Minister deny that I said that the hon. gentleman came there without a plan in order to tell the farmers immediately what kind of assistance they could expect under those circumstances&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member will recall that the floods were still in full spate when I was there. The trains were still stranded along the lines, and these were still under water. I arrived there and I told the farmers&#x2014;and the hon. member knows this&#x2014;that the normal, easily payable damage which they had suffered, they should begin to restore immediately and the Government would subsidize them by 50 per cent. As to more extensive damage, however, we would let them know what we would do. Then the hon. member went and told them that the Minister had only provided <i>ad hoc</i> aid.</p>

<p><span class="col_5537-5538" refersTo="page_1232"/> They say they will have a long-term policy; they will have a blueprint in the case of every possible earthquake or flood which may occur, regardless of the circumstances and the extent. That is the kind of nonsensical statements the hon. members make. The hon. member criticized <i>ad hoc</i> measures; he said the hon. the Minister must not come along with <i>ad hoc</i> measures; he must come along with a long-term policy. That is what he has said now. Now I am asking the hon. member this question. Suppose one experiences a sudden collapse of the market, such as the wool market, or a gradual collapse, suppose one suddenly has a situation which may have been caused overseas by a strike, or by something else. Possibly the hon. member will not even understand this fully. Then there are, for example, circumstances caused by floods, such as we experienced here. I can enumerate hundreds of cases of this kind. What type of assistance other than

<i>ad hoc</i> are the hon. members going to offer the farmer&#x003F;

I am talking about the impression the hon. member created. I know he knows better. The impression he wants to create is that when a situation arises this Government, the Department of Agriculture, and the Minister of Agriculture, are totally unprepared to try to do something about the situation.</p>

<p>I said &#x201C;ineffective&#x201D;.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member&#x2019;s argument is that it is ineffective. In every case where circumstances of this kind arose the machinery of the Department of Agriculture was put into operation immediately. Are they going to offer assistance to the farmers without any investigation, or without any determination of the extent of the damages, and without any control&#x003F; Or are they also going to control it, and offer assistance under certain conditions&#x003F; If the hon. member then states that there has to be control, how is he going to do this without spending time on it&#x003F; In that hon. member&#x2019;s impetuous haste to try to be disparaging and to start gossiping he asked the farmers in the Gamtoos area, two or three days after the flood : &#x201C;What is the Government doing for you&#x003F;&#x201D; Should we then have remedied that whole situation in a day or two&#x003F;</p>

<p>The policy of the Government is very clear, and the policy of the Government in agriculture is very clear. The government has its Departments of Agriculture which undertake production planning in all the attendant facets. The Government has its financing institutions, within certain limits, and in accordance with certain norms. The Government has its institutions which assist and advise it in regard to the marketing of products which are co-ordinated by means of the Marketing Council. The Government has its schemes for coming to the aid of the farmer financially when he finds himself experiencing problems of a particular kind. In this way there is in many cases subsidization of interest rates, contributions by the State and the Land Bank, and agricultural credit loans at 5 per cent interest. In the same way there is also provision by the Land Bank for the harvesting of crops. The hon. member asked what the Government and the Land Bank are doing. The Land Bank will within the next two months make financing available to an amount of almost R400 million for harvesting the maize crop. But the hon. member says there is no credit for agriculture. The Land Bank has just had to make financing to the value of R100 million available for harvesting the wheat crop. But the hon. member stated that nowhere were there facilities available for the financing of credit for agriculture. The hon. member should not make such wild statements. He should qualify his statements.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But the Land Bank at the present stage is surely not geared to taking over every single mortgage. After all, the Land Bank did not say to those farmers that they should take mortgages on their land through private institutions. Now that they find themselves in difficulties, he wants the Land Bank to take over. I want to concede one thing to the hon. member. The Land Bank and other semi-State institutions will in future have to play a far greater role in the financing of agriculture, particularly the financing of mortgages, than in the past for the simple reason that the original financers of agricultural mortgages are no longer willing to do this to the same extent today. They have far more attractive investments outside agriculture. That I want to concede to the hon. member. But I cannot expect the Land Bank to ignore at this stage a liberty the investor had of obtaining mortgages from a lot of financial institutions, and be prepared to take all those mortgages upon itself all at once. But when a farmer comes to the Land Bank for a loan for the purchase of land, etc., it is available. If the Land Bank should now say that it is going to take over all the mortgages in South Africa, regardless of whether those farmers are in difficulty or whether their mortgage has been called in, surely the hon. member will understand that the Land Bank will immediately be burdened with mortgages to the amount of R300 or R400 million and more The Land Bank has to get its money from investments from elsewhere, or by means of contributions by the Government. Now I want to ask the hon. member this: Does he expect the Government to have to make an additional R300 or R400 million available to the Land Bank, so that the Land Bank can give the other financial institutions the money to invest in other directions&#x003F;</p>

<p>But as long as his loan has not been called in, surely no pressure is being exerted on him.

He is not under financial pressure so that he is unable to obtain credit. Surely he has the credit. As long as he has the credit, and it <span class="col_5541-5542" refersTo="page_1234"/>is not called in, then surely he still has credit. Now I want to ask the hon. members the following question : Should the Land Rank now undertake to take over the mortgage of every person who wants to transfer it from a private organization to the Land Bank&#x003F; Must the Government provide the funds for that purpose&#x003F; Surely it is absurd to argue thus.</p>

<p>There the hon. member is making the same generalization again. It should spread its wings wider. How wide should it spread its wings&#x003F; I have certain funds at my disposal. Now I say that I am prepared, with these available funds, to spread my wings to include the calling in of mortgages, to help people who have found themselves in difficulties, but not wider than that. Now I want to ask the hon. member: How does he want to spread his wines wider now&#x003F; Does he want to spread them so wide that any person who comes to the Land Bank for a mortgage, has to receive financial assistance&#x003F; That is the question.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, but that is not the question. That is not the issue. If a person wants a mortgage of R100 000 from a private institution, and he is refused, and he does not want to divide it up, should the Land Bank, under these circumstances, give him that loan, and then perhaps not have money available for another farmer whose mortgage is being called in&#x003F; That is the question I am asking. The hon. member states every year that he does not receive replies. I need not furnish him with replies to all these questions. He knows the answers just as well as I do. He knows what different auxiliary measures this Government has introduced. He knows the problems which arose as a result of droughts. He knows about the livestock withdrawal scheme, and the financing schemes. He knows about all these things. But the hon. member states that this Government is not interested in keeping alive an interest in agriculture and in trying to keep people who are engaged in agricultural activities on the land. The Government is interested in only one thing, he says, and that is to see whether it can get them off the land. That is what the hon. member says, and he knows it is not true. I shall give him another opportunity later. I want to discuss this with him again. He must give me further information about this council of his, for example what its powers and its norms are going to be, so that I can hear what his standpoint is in regard to this matter.</p>

Another thing it would do, it would obviate the fact that lots of people are growing wheat where wheat should never been grown, if you had proper planning and proper co-ordination of the agricultural industry in South Africa.

Can the hon. the Minister explain to us what norm his department adopts&#x003F; The only norm I know about at the present time is that the loan must not be more than R50 000 and that a farmer must have been summonsed before he can get a loan. I think that is the norm. [Interjections.] The Land Bank is the biggest grantor of agricultural credit in the country at the present time and that is the norm of that hon. member&#x2019;s party. It would not be our norm. We would grant a loan from the Land Bank to any farmer whose farm is potentially viable and whom we believe to be an asset on the land or a credit to the country.</p>

<speech by="#kingwill">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>We would see that he would be helped. That is what our attitude is, Mr. Chairman, The hon. the Minister raised this question in the Gamtoos River Valley. I was there. We went there, and we had every right to go there to see what was going on, to see that this hon. Government, this hon. Minister, was doing their job. I visited the home of the M.P. for Humansdorp to tell him I was there, to discuss the whole problem. I presume that is 100 per cent in order&#x003F;

And I believe that in future there should be a long-term plan in respect of disaster assistance. It should not be on an <i>ad hoc</i>

basis. These floods will recur, Mr. Chairman; they will occur again and again. It is high time the Government had a blueprint of the way in which it will assist disaster-stricken areas. And I made a speech on this subject to indicate how it should be done.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister is talking about long-term planning for the sheep industry. The best really long-term planning that has been done by this Government in respect of the small stock industry was the &#x201C;veeverminderingskema&#x201D;, the stock reduction scheme. Now, what has happened&#x003F; The hon. the Minister knows that this scheme had a great potential to save the small stock industry in the Karoo and the Free State and the other small stock grazing areas. What happened the moment the scheme got under way&#x003F; This was a long-term scheme&#x2014;and I wish the hon. the Minister would listen, because he has accused us of many things and I am trying to give an answer. The stock reduction scheme was a good long-term plan to rehabilitate the sheep industry, the pastoral industry. Tremendous propaganda was made to get it under way and just at the moment when it was going full steam ahead, the farmers had got interested and the propaganda had been successful, the Minister makes a decision without discussing it with organized agriculture and says the scheme is now off and that there could be no new members.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>I did not say for ever, but it is good long-term planning. And this is my answer to the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>We would certainly introduce long-term planning into our agricultural policy. And now I want to say that we are fortunate to be able to conduct this debate this year at a time when, generally speaking, the whole of the country has had good rains. Production is on a high level. I think we are all very grateful that this is so and that we can conduct this debate not under the pressure of the extremely difficult circumstances we have had in the past. And another factor which makes it easier to conduct this debate, is that we had the Report of the Commission of Inquiry into Agriculture&#x2014;we have now had the Third Report&#x2014;and in passing I want to convey my congratulations to the chairman and the committee who wrote that report. I think it is an outstanding job of work. I think it can be used as a guide for many years to come to try to get our agriculture on a sound footing. I hope the hon. the Minister will follow much of the advice that is contained in these various reports.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, so far the Government has done only one thing, and this is the passing of a Bill for the control of subdivision of agricultural land. That was easy enough. That cost nothing. What has the hon. the Minister done to try and consolidate agricultural land, and make farming units more viable&#x003F; We have heard nothing about that. That would be a more positive contribution than the negative <span class="col_5547-5548" refersTo="page_1237"/>act of passing an Act to stop the subdivision of agricultural land.</p>

<p>And, Mr. Chairman, we are grateful, too, that during recent months there has been a revival on the wool market. I want to say with gratitude that the wool farmers of South Africa go forward with far more optimism than they could do in the years gone by. [Time expired.]</p>

I want to state very clearly to hon. members that I am standing up here specifically because you speak about Oudtshoorn the way you do. I stood up to test the agricultural policy. I want to discuss one of the most important branches of the agricultural industry in South Africa, and that is the ostrich farming in Oudtshoorn.</p>

I refused that young member a turn to speak and told him that I know he made many promises to his voters, that I know he will carry them out and be an industrious member. He then asked me to say at least something about Oudtshoorn and the ostrich industry, since I am one of the boys from that district. I now want to say at once that if there is anyone who knows Oudtshoorn, it is I.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I shall come to that hon. member and the Land Bank in a moment. He must just give me a brief chance. Oudtshoorn is a district I know better than many hon. members do. For example, I know Oudtshoorn, Calitzdorp, the portion at Ladismith and Vanwyksdorp. Do hon. members know where I was born&#x003F; There on the other side at a small place called Langverwag, where 99 per cent of the ostrich farmers voted. I was the only absentee! Do you know how many ostrich farmers there are in Oudtshoorn&#x003F; I think that 85,9 per cent of the ostrich farmers in South Africa live in that district. It is a wonderful industry. Hon. members must not pretend it is not an agricultural district. On the contrary. A very important branch of the agricultural industry is encountered there. This ostrich feather industry &#x2026;</p>

<p>They should have had you as M.P.</p>

<speech by="#potgieter">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>If you would now keep quiet you would perhaps find out that you know nothing. I want to state very clearly here that I know that district very well. But do you know what&#x003F; I know its people just as well. I know the English-speaking people there. They are ostrich farmers. There are the Edmeades and the Barrons. But I also know the Afrikaars-speaking farmers there: The Le Roux&#x2019;s, the Myburgh&#x2019;s, Grundlineh&#x2019;s, the Fourie&#x2019;s, the Ferreira&#x2019;s, the Streichers and the Potgieters. Let me say that we have economic units there. The hon. member spoke of economic units, but I know three important farmers to whom we gave equal chances in Oudtshoorn to farm with ostriches. They all began with economic units exactly equal in size. The one farmer now has 6 666 beautiful ostriches. The other farmer farmed badly; he went downhill; he did not farm scientifically and he only has 1 818 birds left. The good farmer now has 4 848 more ostriches than the bad farmer. Then there is still the third farmer. I want to tell the hon. member for Walmer that he was <span class="col_5549-5550" refersTo="page_1238"/>a sheep farmer. The hon. member for Walmer is also a sheep farmer, but he is a good sheep farmer for whom I have a high regard. The other person who went farming there with ostriches was a real sheep, and his name is van der Merwe; he now owns only 259 ostriches. What is going to happen to that ostrich farm I do not know, because he farms only with male ostriches. Of course the logical consequence is that he will disappear altogether from the scene.</p>

<p>I say it is a lovely district; it is a district where there is fine co-operation between the farmers. I went to school there. We played football with our Jewish friends, English-speaking people and Afrikaans-speaking people pushing in the same scrum. You speak of a national unity, but you must see how we scrummed there politically. That is an example of national unity in South Africa. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Kensington, who has just interrupted me, who is such an advocate of national unity and then says that we are racialists, must tell me why they did not nominate Mr. Barron, who is a Jewish friend of the farmers, as the candidate at Oudtshoorn. He was, after all, good enough for the provincial council and there he obtained many more votes. Then the United Party would have had a candidate. Then they would at least have had a candidate that could have meant something to the ostrich feather industry in South Africa, not so&#x003F; Our Jewish friends, the English-speaking people and the farmers, formed a close unit. You know that the farmer is the co-operative society and the co-operative society is the farmer. You speak of the co-operative, binding together, grab-each-other principle, but yesterday we saw the results of that. Pardon me, Mr. Chairman, if I am now a little out of order, but I am now coming back to the point.</p>

<p>If it is a United Party female ostrich she lays a wind-egg.</p>

<p>When I got to my friends there in Oudtshoorn, where I was born and grew up, I discovered that the ostrich farmers were in heavy rebellion against the United Party. English-speaking people, Afrikaans-speaking people and our Jewish friends were all in revolt. Do you know why&#x003F; I remember that with the First War, when there was a collapse after the ostrich feather industry had made a great contribution to the State&#x2019;s economy and filled the State coffers, an economic depression occurred. Our Karoo farmers are independent people, but they subsequently had to go to the Land Bank. When I got there I saw that they were feeling despondent, that they were angrily heart-sore. They said that the fine Land Bank, with its fine prestige, had been slandered out of existence by the biggest political gossip-monger in South Africa. That Bank, from which they should have obtained assistance, had been slandered out of existence. They told me that the farmer who had done that gossipmongering, was called Myburgh or Streicher. That is what happened. By the conduct of the hon. member, who makes use of the half-hour in this debate, through his speeches and his outside campaigns, the prestige of the Land Bank in South Africa was undermined. Nothing is private any longer. Certain peoples&#x2019; records must be examined at the Land Bank. He pokes his nose into the internal affairs of the Land Bank.</p>

As the son of an ostrich farmer I want to say today that I am exceptionally grateful for the development of the ostrich feather industry in Oudtshoorn. Fantastic development has taken place. They need it.</p>

<p>The same applies to the tobacco farming there. We also have it there in Brits. <i>Die Burger</i> did some fine advertising for the ostrich industry in South Africa recently. I have never seen such advertising ability before. Politically speaking those ostrich heads had familiar faces. They were seen throughout the country. This had such a captivating effect that there is now an &#x201C;upsurge&#x201D; in South Africa as far as the ostrich industry is concerned.</p>

<p>I want to say that I saw that the ostrich farming was developing. I want to thank the Department of Agriculture from my heart of hearts for the research which this Minister and others had done as far as the ostrich industry there is concerned. It is the department, in particular, which is engaged in research there. I see that the officials who concentrate on research are also looking at me. I never thought that the research into ostriches would allow such a large ostrich egg to be laid as the one I saw in <i>Die Burger.</i>

That link is the White farmer and his family, the individual farmer, the holder of ground, the person who rears his family among the people of the countryside, the person whose roots go down deep and not the person who can be transferred about, who can be shot from one place to another, a person who is merely a paid servant of a company, a company which in many cases is interested in agriculture for what it can save itself on taxation, a company which in many cases is prepared either just to break even or even in some cases to lose money on an agricultural operation in order to save on taxation.</p>

<p>No, you cannot ask a question. You can just sit down. You have a long time to talk and I have very few minutes left.

My constituency is one of the best and economically strongest farming constituencies in South Africa, and in this constituency we have always regarded the Land Bank as one of the last resorts to which a person can go. I want to say that I have been absolutely shaken rigid in the past couple of years by the farmers in my constituency who have had to have recourse and who have sought to have recourse to the Land Bank for financial assistance. Some of them were members of old families who have inherited farms. This does not account for any of the people who had to buy farms at today&#x2019;s prices and who had to pay the sort of interest they have to pay today.</p>

<p>We have mentioned the question of wool. In England for over eight centuries if you study the wool trade, wool has been a cyclical operation. I am sure that anybody knows that there is going to be a time when wool is going to plummet. It has happened before in our own experience. It will happen again. Surely it is time that we had the sort of mechanism which is going to be able to read the economic indicators that are manifesting themselves overseas. It is also time that we had the permanent sort of operation which will be able to support the price of wool. I make absolutely no bones about saying that to support the price of wool to keep the farmer on the land and to keep the farming community prosperous is very important. This is important because the whole of the primary business throughout the whole of South Africa, throughout the platteland, depends upon the farming community. The hon. member knows as well as I do the privations and the hardships and the difficulties which have come not merely to farmers, but also to every small business throughout the length and the breadth of the Karroo during the time of the drought we have just experienced.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wentzel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. G. WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, now that we have heard these three speakers from the Opposition side, it is very clear that these gentlemen are trying to transmit to the world outside as poor an image of the agricultural industry as possible. I want to refer briefly to certain matters mentioned here by the hon. member for Mooi River. He said, amongst other things, that the fact that companies could now participate in the agricultural industry, constituted a dangerous trend. I want to tell him that if it is to the advantage of the agricultural industry and the farmers in South Africa, I think it is a good thing if they can mobilize their capital and administrative talents, etc. One of the problems we have in the agricultural industry, according to the commission of inquiry, is that certain uneconomic units have continued to exist. Therefore I do not see anything wrong with our wanting capital mobilization to take place in the sphere of agriculture. But, Sir, the following is an interesting fact which I should like to bring to the attention of the hon. member. When we in this House discussed certain legislation aimed at combating certain monopolistic trends which had begun to crop up in the company world in the agricultural industry, legislation such as the Egg Production Control Act, it was that side of the House which took this amiss of us. I fail to see what the hon. member&#x2019;s argument is in this regard. He now wants to pretend to be the patron of the agriculturalist over against the large companies.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to come back to the hon. member for Newton Park. The hon. the Minister has almost completely ploughed him under here, but I can still see something protruding and I want to deal with him further. In his customary manner he went on to present a poor picture of the agricultural industry. He quoted, amongst other things, from the report of the commission of inquiry into the agricultural industry. I want to say at once that the report that was tabled here, reveals a very profound study of our agricultural industry. I am sure that the study of this report ought to contribute to an enhancement of the standard of debating in this House, especially as far as the United Party is concerned. Sir, as was to be expected from the hon. member, he did of course stress the most negative aspects in this report. Now I want to quote to him from the same report, from Chapter 3 : &#x201C;The financial position of the South African farmer and circumstances influencing it&#x201D;. On page 35 the commission said the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Economic agricultural policy: The progress made by the South African agricultural industry during the post-war years in the production of food and other commodities, also in respect of productivity and net farming income, is striking even on a basis of averages. In the light of this there ought to be no doubt as to the value of its contribution to the economic progress of the country and as to the fact that this sector has qualified in full as a worthy pillar of support of our national economy.</block>

<p>Then the commission went on to say that notwithstanding certain problems experienced in the agricultural industry, the latter had made a tremendous progress, and then it mentioned the problems, <i>inter alia,</i> the instability of the agricultural industry, the problems of climatic conditions, the disproportionate distribution of personal income, which the hon. member also mentioned, <span class="col_5559-5560" refersTo="page_1243"/>and the high incidence of uneconomic farming units. The commission went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If these conditions are carefully taken into account, one is compelled to conclude that the progress made by the more successful farmers of South Africa on economic farming units during the postwar years, was phenomenal.</block>

<p>Sir, this is the problem of hon. members of the Opposition; they always see only one part of the farming picture, and then they want to present a picture of total weakness in the agricultural industry. The commission had something to say about this as well; it said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">However, in recent years the impression was gained that the problems experienced in that part of the South African agricultural industry in which the most serious structural defects occur, are being pushed to the fore to such an extent and presented as being so representative of the broad agricultural sector that the true nature and significance of the problems with which what is actually the most valuable part of the agricultural sector has to contend, seldom receives sufficient attention.</block>

<p>Sir, hon. members of the Opposition referred to the slender confidence people have in the agricultural industry, and then the hon. member said, because there were not enough people who enrolled as students at the agricultural faculties of our universities and at the agricultural colleges, that there was no confidence in the agricultural industry, but I want to level the accusation that this is so because of the poor picture of the agricultural industry presented by the United Party.</p>

<speech by="#wentzel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. G. WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>The commission of inquiry said that one of the basic reasons for the problems of a certain percentage of the farmers, was uneconomic farming units. Another reason mentioned by the commission, was maladjusted farming enterprises. I want to tell the hon. member that this year we once again discussed in Parliament, in the course of the debate on the Subdivision of Agricultural Land Amendment Bill, these problems which give rise to uneconomic farming units, and what was the standpoint taken by hon. members opposite&#x003F; They were opposed to it. When the hon. the Minister asked for certain powers in order that he might cope further with these problems, it was that side which fought the Bill tooth and nail in all its stages; they were opposed to it in principle as well.</p>

<p>Furnish the reasons as well.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wentzel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. G. WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, we know what the reasons are. The reason is quite likely that there were a lot of land speculators behind those arguments. But, Sir, I am going further. The poor image of the agricultural industry created by hon. members of the Opposition, gives rise to a general feeling outside, even with the consumers of agricultural goods, that too much is being done for the farmer. I want to make the statement here that the agricultural industry should not be seen as a social institution for keeping certain people on the land. It is true that when disaster conditions develop, one has to grant individual assistance to certain farmers hit by such a disaster, but basically the object of the large amounts of money which are also made available under this Vote, is, in the first instance, to place the agricultural industry on a sound production footing and, in the second instance, to spend these amounts of money for the sake of soil protection and soil conservation. One of these schemes, a scheme which is being discussed widely and will probably be discussed in this debate as well, is the stock withdrawal scheme, which is not only aimed at helping the farmers specifically, but also at conserving and protecting the soil so that it may recover from the catastrophic droughts we have had in recent years. Sir, the moment an election is fought, one finds that it is the standpoint of the United Party&#x2019;s candidate, <i>inter alia</i> in Brakpan, to talk about the &#x201C;mutton scandal&#x201D;, and when that hon. member pays a visit to the Karoo districts, he complains about this scheme and says that enough is not being done in this respect.</p>

<p>Sir, these points will still be argued further. Nowadays, if one is a member of the United <span class="col_5561-5562" refersTo="page_1244"/>Party, one can say anything; it merely depends on where one is; one is free to say contradictory things.</p>

<p>Sir, another aspect I want to mention in regard to funds made available by the Government to this industry, is that of food subsidies. In this respect, too, it is being said that too much is being done for the farmer. But, once again, this is not a subsidy made directly to the farmer; it is a subsidy made to the agricultural industry as such, which implies benefits to the country&#x2019;s economy as a whole, not only to the farmer, but also to the consumer as well as the secondary industries. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#van_eck">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. VAN ECK</person>:</from>

<p>These difficult times which the agricultural industry is experiencing at the moment in view of the depopulation of the rural areas as a result of the increasing production costs as well as the cost of living, and consequently the reduced profits of the farmer as well, are also in particular the very times when the farmer badly needs the Department of Agriculture to help him and to support him. But unfortunately there are several matters prejudicing mutual confidence, incidents prejudicing in particular the image of the Department of Agriculture as a result of the poor control and weak discipline found in those departments at the present stage. We had the case, known to numerous farmers, at the agricultural college of Glen, where vegetables are produced and sold by the store to various employees of the department at a nominal price. Nobody can object to that; in fact, if the department looks after its workers, we welcome it. But I wonder whether the hon. the Minister is aware of the fact that bunches and bunches of carrots and bags of potatoes are loaded onto vehicles to be sold outside to the public at a profit. And this is not the only case of this nature. There is also the case at the Koopmansfontein experimental farm, where milk was made available to the officials at a very reasonable price. One of the officials recognized the business possibilities this presented, and he bought a cream-separator, sold separated milk to the non-Whites and sent away the cream, and so he received a substantial cheque every month, supplementing his normal salary. As a result of this weak discipline other officials were in due course encouraged to go even further. One of them borrowed some of the Dorper rams there and kept them on his farm nearby in his own flock. However, then he made the mistake of removing some of the ear-tags and also of chasing three head of cattle belonging to the Koopmansfontein experimental farm into his own pen. I think the Police caught him when he wanted to sell the third head of cattle. That is the type of thing that is going on as a result of the weak discipline in his department.</p>

<p>This matter concerns the purchase of two Siementhaler bulls by the Glen experimental farm from <span class="col_5563-5564" refersTo="page_1245"/>a certain farmer, Mr. Ben Scholtz, of the farm Vlakpan near Douglas. Two officials of the department were sent out to select bulls, and eventually one bull was bought for R700 and was immediately sent to Glen by rail. Six months later this breeder was informed by the Department of Agriculture that the bull was sterile and that they would like him to replace this bull by another. The breeder was quite willing to replace this bull by a bull of similar quality, and asked them to return the first bull at once in order that he might subject the bull to fertility tests to see what had really happened. Seven months went by, after he had originally supplied the bull to Glen, before he got that bull back, and when the bull was unloaded he immediately noticed that this bull had undergone a change, that there was a tremendous thickening of his breeding organs and that this bull had very obviously caught a venereal disease while it was at Glen. Then Mr. Scholtz immediately sent a letter to the head of the O.F.S. region and asked them to send back immediately his second bull, the substitute bull, or else they had to be willing to pay for the second bull as well, for he did not consider himself to be responsible for the condition of the first bull. It took six months before the substitute bull eventually reached the breeder again, after the Glen experimental farm had used the bull and bred several calves from him. Any honourable farmer who buys a bull or gets one from a breeder, sends it back again and gets calves from such a bull, would be willing to pay for such a bull, but in this case the State refused to pay any compensation for that second substitute bull. I just wonder what the policy of the department is. I should like to know from the hon. the Minister whether it is not his policy to have bulls and rams purchased by the department tested the moment they arrive at these experimental stations. Why was the test not conducted in this case&#x003F; We should like to know whether this was attributable to the negligence of officials. The farmers in the vicinity of the Northern Cape region believe that all the departmental herds are infected with venereal diseases, and consequently they are not willing to buy departmental bulls and rams, something which has an adverse effect on the reputation of the department.</p>

<p>He immediately took the original bull to the veterinary surgeon in Kimberley. There it was slaughtered and its breeding organs were sent to Onderstepoort for examination and to get a report on them. Once again he had to wait for eight and a half months before he eventually received a reply from Onderstepoort, and when he received the report, the reply was that as a result of exposure the specimen had become unsuitable for bacterial examination. It had stood there on a shelf for such a long time that it went bad. That was the situation, and we should like to know from the Minister what happened in this case. The unreasonable lawsuit which the department subsequently brought against this particular breeder in order to get back the original R700, cost this breeder quite a few thousands of rands to defend. The case became prescribed, and in order to fight the prescription they eventually went as far as the Supreme Court in Bloemfontein, and this cost the taxpayers of South Africa thousands upon thousands of rands. I should like to hear from the Minister what the taxpayers had to pay up in order to prosecute this lawsuit.</p>

<p>In the meantime this particular breeder, who is not a member of this party but a member of that party, once again tried to settle this matter with the Minister. He tried to see the Minister during a co-operative society conference. Once again he received the message from the member for De Aar that the Minister would not be there. When he arrived at the co-operative society congress in Pretoria, he found that the Minister of Agriculture was in fact there, but was simply not willing to see him so that this matter <span class="col_5565-5566" refersTo="page_1246"/>might be settled out of court.

<p>The hon. member will forgive me if I do not follow him in his bull story.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Newton Park set out to us the planning council which is the pivot on which the policy of the United Party hinges. He mentioned several pertinent facets. First of all, I should like to know from the hon. member for Newton Park, since he wants to bring non-Whites into this Parliament, how many non-White representatives he is going to appoint to this planning council so as to implement his party&#x2019;s policy. Surely, if he does not do this, his policy is quite wrong from the beginning. The hon. member for Newton Park is very concerned about cost increases, but, as is the case with a great many of his arguments, this does not go beyond generalizations; he never arrives at a specific point. The hon. member for Mooi River referred a moment ago to &#x201C;company movement into the platteland&#x201D;. Have these two hon. members ever given any thought to where cost increases and &#x201C;company moving into the platteland&#x201D; hook up with each other&#x003F; I have here the annual report of the largest fertilizer manufacturing company in the country. I notice that the annual report was signed by a Mr. Oppenheimer, who is also a member of the managing board of

&#x201C;Soetvelde van Suid-Afrika Beperk&#x201D;. This is one of the

&#x201C;companies&#x201D; which are &#x201C;moving into the platteland&#x201D;. I notice that this company&#x2019;s profit before taxes amounted to more than R21 million over the past year. Profit after taxes amounted to R13 million. We examined this matter somewhat more closely and looked at the approximate profits yielded by this company&#x2019;s fertilizer products. The percentage of profit-worthiness of the fertilizers was estimated as follows: powdered supers, 54,20; granulated supers, 55,07; and ammoniated supers, 55,39. It is known that urea costs R25 per short ton to manufacture. It is also known that the selling price per metric ton is just over R86 per ton. Even if my figures are 100 per cent too low, it means that it costs R50 per ton. Then the profit is still approximately 36 per cent per metric ton. Why does that hon. member not complain about the cost increases of this product, which is to a very large extent essential for the agricultural areas&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>1 mentioned that the price of fertilizer had been increased.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#reinecke">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. REINECKE</person>:</from>

<p>Why does the hon. member not penetrate to the crux of the matter&#x003F; Why does the hon. member stop at generalizations&#x003F;</p>

<p>The same story remains valid in respect of fuel prices in the country. The hon. member does not furnish specific data. Whereas I am pleading here for a thorough cost investigation to be instituted by the hon. the Minister into fertilizer and fuel, I am furnishing specific particulars. That hon. member, on the other hand, does not go beyond generalizations and blames the Government for the cost increases. The agricultural sector takes approximately 26 per cent of all the diesel and oil products brought into the country every year. Ever since January and February we have been reading in the newspapers that these fuel companies want to increase the fuel price by between 13 per cent and 15 per cent. That would provide them with an extra profit and cost the consumer an extra R20 million on the country&#x2019;s estimated order of R160 million. Fuel is one of the means which the agricultural industry cannot do without. Price increases may simply not take place. Outside the area of control a case is being built up with a view to an increase in prices. It is my view that fuel profits are being concealed under a very large number of disguises. Therefore I ask that, for the sake of the agricultural industry and for the sake of the profit margin of the farmer, very profond thought be given to the matter before the Government grants any increases in the price of fuel. According to the <i>Petroleum Press Service</i> of July, 1971, which reflects the price increases and the prices per barrel of the various Persian Gulf sources, the actual increase in the price of crude oil, after the local 1971 increase, was already 0,23 cents per litre. The increase in the price of crude oil in April as against the increase in the price of petrol of 0,53 cents per litre at the bowser, at landed cost, was already 30 cents per litre. This could not possibly represent the technological loss through waste products. I am making out a specific case here today for the South African farmer and the consumer, and I trust that the hon. the Minister of Agriculture will take cognizance of the fact that we in this sector <span class="col_5567-5568" refersTo="page_1247"/>cannot bear an increase in this cost item. I should also like to ask the hon. the Minister of Agriculture to lend his support to an inquiry into the whole fuel distribution industry in our country. Tankers of different firms drive past the same farms to different tanks erected on those farms. One finds that every now and then marketing people from different companies pay visits to the same farmer on the farm. We believe that this practice necessarily forces up the cost of fuel. We therefore ask the Government to look into this matter.</p>

<p>let us come back now to the inconsistency of the hon. member and his party. On 16th February the hon. member for Von Brandis complained in col. 1214 of Hansard that the price of fish had risen by 12,8 per cent and those of milk products and eggs by 11,4 per cent. Then the hon. member for Von Brandis went on to make a big fuss about the voters of Brakpan having to vote against the Government because of these high agricultural prices. In the course of the same debate, on 17th February, the hon. member for Newton Park attacked the Government because agricultural prices were too low. I should very much like to know how that party reconciles the two. The one member complains that the prices are too high, while the other member complains that the prices are too low. What else did the hon. member for Newton Park say&#x003F; A moment ago he made a big fuss about surpluses. What did he go on to say&#x003F; He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In other words, when the general economic climate is depressing, we do not encourage productivity and production in South Africa. Surpluses in the economy and in industry are a sign of economic prosperity.</block>

<p>Because there are surpluses in the agricultural industry today, he levels accusations at the Minister and wants to undo the work of a number of boards of control, the Marketing Council and several Government departments, and replace them by a planning council which he vaguely identified Mr. Chairman, I see my time has expired, and I thank you for this opportunity.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, attacked the hon. member for Newton Park because he had told us about the high prices the housewives have to pay for certain products. The hon. member for Newton Park was complaining about the consumer prices and not the prices received by the farmer. That hon. member will admit that, in respect of many products, there is an enormous gap today between the price the farmer receives and the price the housewife has to pay.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. D. DEACON</person>:</from>

<p>Then I shall defend the hon. member for Von Brandis. I agree with the hon. member in regard to the rising costs we have in agriculture today. I should very much like to discuss this aspect at a later stage. At present, however, I should like to say something more about a matter which was raised in this House this morning by means of questions. We are confronted with an enormous problem in regard to the home industry association. This is quite a sound principle the hon. the Minister of Agriculture initiated. It gives the farmers&#x2019; wives as well an opportunity to make some contribution towards agriculture and the progress of the farmer on the farm. Furthermore, it provides them with an additional income and, as I see it, this movement he initiated is quite a sound one. However, we have this difficulty that, in terms of the Health Act of 1919, the powers of the Minister of Health are delegated by the Administration to the local authority. We are experiencing difficulties with the agricultural industry in this respect. I am very grateful that the Minister of Health is here today to give us some clarity on this score. The specific case I am discussing now is that of Grahamstown. But this is not the only local authority in regard to which we are experiencing difficulties.</p>

<p>In his reply the hon. the Minister of Agriculture said today that the hon. the Deputy Minister discussed this matter with the town clerk there. The Registrar of Cooperative Societies discussed this matter with them. The Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing also discussed the matter with the provincial administration. As far as I know, the Wheat Board was in favour of these ladies doing the <span class="col_5569-5570" refersTo="page_1248"/>baking in their own kitchens and selling their produce on a commission basis for their co-operative societies. In view of the fact that this local authority now says that these ladies may not do any baking unless they run a bakery according to bakery standards&#x2014;this was also said in other towns&#x2014;it would cost these housewives at least R15 000 to build a new bakery. Their kitchens are spotlessly clean. Every farmer&#x2019;s wife in South Africa is proud of her kitchen, but these ladies are not allowed to do their baking there when they want to sell their produce on a commission basis. But what upsets the Whole argument is the fact that if these ladies want to bake for charity, they are allowed to sell their wares anywhere, even on a street market.</p>

<p>When the local authority says that it is a health regulation which prevents those housewives from baking in order to sell their produce in a clean little shop or in their co-operative society, it is quite absurd when compared with the unlimited selling which is allowed for charitable purposes. I should like to ask the Minister of Agriculture to discuss this matter further with his colleague, the hon. the Minister of Health, so that we will not experience any further snags. Is it not possible for a definite guideline to be laid down by law for this kind of baking in order to give the town councils some guide to determine, under the law, that this can, in fact, be allowed in these towns in question&#x003F; I feel very sorry for these ladies, particularly those in my constituency. They embarked on this venture with the idea as described here in the report of the Secretary for Agricultural Economics and Marketing. Unfortunately I only have the English version of the report here. Under the heading

&#x201C;Home-industries Co-operatives&#x201D; I read the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">During the year under review there was a great deal of interest in the founding of home-industries co-operatives. At 30th June, 1970, there were seven of these co-operatives and another 11 were registered during the year under review. The purpose of these co-operatives was to sell home-baking and handwork and home-grown products &#x2026;</block>

<p>The purpose is to sell home-baked produce and here we have struck a snag with the local authorities. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister could do something in this connection for the sake of the housewives and in the interests of agriculture.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with other matters. In this connection I should like to refer to the rising agricultural costs. In the same report I quoted a moment ago, we find at the bottom of Table 5 certain figures in regard to farming requirements. The basis of 100 applies to the years 1958-&#x2019;59 and 1960-&#x2019;61. The figures have been furnished up to this year. We now find that there were increases; for example, there were increases in respect of fuel, which was mentioned by the hon. member for Pretoria District. According to this table fuel was placed at a base of 100 at that time and today, or rather in 1970-&#x2019;71, it was 102. This is probably a mistake, because the hon. the Deputy Minister, according to <i>Agricultural News</i> of 27th August, 1971, furnished different figures when opening the silos at Kaalfontein, near Kempton Park. The figures he furnished, there were much higher. He complained about the high production costs of the farmers, and said that during the last quarter of 1970-&#x2019;71 this increased by 5,4 per cent compared with the corresponding period of the previous year. He then went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The highest price increase was in respect of fuel, which showed an increase of 11,9 per cent.</block>

<p>How could it be correct when it is stated in this table that, as against a base of 100 in respect of the years 1958-&#x2019;59&#x2014;1960-&#x2019;61, the figure in respect of fuel is now 102&#x003F;</p>

<p>It is most probably a printing error. I should like to know from the Minister whether it is in fact a printing error. But the hon. the Deputy Minister went even further. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Repair service tariffs increased by 11,7 per cent during that quarter &#x2026;</block>

<p>We now see in the table that spare parts through all those years increased from 100<span class="col_5571-5572" refersTo="page_1249"/> to 122 from 1959-&#x2019;60 up to the present. Probably this is also a printing error, because it cannot be correct when there is an increase of 11,7 per cent in costs in one quarter. I do not know whether the figures of the Deputy Minister were perhaps incorrect, or whether the figures in the table are incorrect, but I should like to know from the hon. the Minister what the position is. I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; while the price of fencing material also increased by 9,8 per cent during that quarter. The prices of machinery and equipment showed an increase of 6,1 per cent, mainly as a result of an average increase of 8,4 per cent in tractor prices.</block>

<p>This speech was made before devaluation and our tractors are imported. A large percentage of the spare parts also have to be imported. On top of that we have to pay excise duty on them. I think the hon. the Minister should go into the import of equipment, particularly tractors, thoroughly. He should discuss this with his colleague, the Minister of Finance, to see whether we could not have an excise duty rebate in respect of these goods. The production costs of the farmer are constantly rising, they are rising by the day and every quarter. If we do not succeed in containing these production costs how then will the farmer be able to market his produce at a lower price&#x003F; This is what is being expected of him. We heard over the news that the mealie prices were now lower. The farmers have to pay more for everything, and yet they receive a lower price for their produce. [Time expired.]</p>

I want to say today, on the occasion of this Agricultural debate, that for the first time in many years we are in a position to participate in this debate in a spirit of gratitude. A spirit of gratitude in the sense that where we still had barren plains last year we now have plains of waving grass. Where we had poor stock last year our stock, almost throughout South Africa, are in a good condition this year. That is why we are grateful for being able to participate in this debate in this spirit.</p>

<p>No, it is not a question of rectifying mistakes. I have the highest regard and respect for our farmers in agriculture. The hon. member for Mooi River mentioned his district, the district of Mooi River. It is a district I know fairly well. But why is that district experiencing a shortage of funds today&#x003F; Why are the people having a hard time of it there&#x003F; The same applies to the district of Mount Curry. To my mind quite a good comparison can be drawn between these two districts. It is as a result of the fantastic drought the people have had there. Our wool industry lost more than R40 million. The rains brought grass but no money.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>And the high costs.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, there are also costs attached to it, but the prices have also increased to a certain extent. As a result of the drought our agricultural economy is experiencing difficulties today; our people are struggling, because it will take them quite a number of years to pay for the effects of the fantastic drought we have had there. We will have to adapt ourselves to it; the people will have to adapt themselves to it. But in due course, just as has happened in the past, the people will adapt themselves to circumstances economically, and they will find their feet again.</p>

<p><span class="col_5573-5574" refersTo="page_1250"/> What is the function of agriculture at present&#x003F; Its function is threefold. The first function of agriculture is to provide food and raw materials. The second function is to ensure a livelihood for the farming section of the community. The third function is the utilization of the natural resources in such manner that they are preserved for future needs as well. This function is naturally a very important one. A healthy agricultural system is economically essential for the development of South Africa. Agriculture can with justification be called one of the key industries of the Republic.</p>

<p>To come back to the function of agriculture, I just want to say that as a result of the evolutionary process which is taking place in agriculture today, there exist certain problems which have been identified and recognized. In the short time at my disposal I should like to deal with one of these problems. This is a very important aspect in agriculture. In order to allow the threefold function of agriculture to succeed, mortgage capital is absolutely essential to a very large portion of our agricultural population, particularly in view of future consolidation which has only begun to be applied in earnest. The more this is applied the more mortgage capital will be required. Surely, this is understandable. Now, it is a fact that much of our mortgage capital in agriculture goes back a long way. We know that many mortgage bonds as they exist in agriculture today, are even transferred from one generation to the next in the private sector. I am not talking of mortgage loans from the Land Bank or the Agricultural Credit Board. The result is that, under these circumstances, the working capital available to our younger farmers is always inadequate, particularly when the young man inherits the farm which carries a large or medium mortgage bond. In that case there is very little or virtually no security available on which to obtain capital to continue his agricultural activities on a healthy economic basis. I want to make the humble suggestion today that particularly in view of future, large-scale consolidation&#x2014;a start has already been made&#x2014;a scheme should be worked out comprising compulsory insurance cover for all mortgage bonds on fixed property in agriculture. This should not only be obtained in respect of existing mortgage bonds, but also in respect of any bonds which are registered in future. I shall tell hon. members why I say this. The Land Bank initiated a scheme such as this about 11 years ago. This is a scheme of compulsory insurance applied by the Land Bank, and this is being applied quite successfully. On 30th December, 1971, there were 25530 farmers who were covered by insurance for an amount, in round figures, of R3 004 million. According to surveys there are approximately 90 000 farmers in the country. When the figure of 25 530 farmers who are already covered in terms of the Land Bank scheme is subtracted from the total number of farmers, approximately 64 470 farmers remain. Between 1955, when the mortgage insurance scheme of the Land Bank came into operation and 1971, 4706 farmers have died. The amount of debt redeemed in this manner exceeded R30 million. This is a very large amount of money. When it is taken into consideration that the total burden of mortgage bonds in agriculture last year was estimated to be R941 million, the debts amounting to R3 million written off over the last 11 years, represents 3,3 per cent of the total burden of mortgage bonds in agriculture. When we take the 25 000 farmers whose land was covered by the Land Bank by means of insurance, we find that 28 per cent of our farmers are already being covered by means of mortgage insurance. In other words, 72 per cent is still not covered.</p>

<p>No, I said 72 per cent were not covered yet. Not all of them have mortgage bonds. A large proportion of those farmers do not have bonds. What I am pleading for is that the farmers who do have mortgage bonds, whether in the private sector or wherever it may be, should be covered by insurance in order to place agriculture on quite a different economic basis within a few decades.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Aliwal has just delivered a plea here for an improved financial scheme for the farmers as he is concerned about the financial position of the farmer in South Africa. He has fully agreed with us, because we, too, are concerned. We appreciate the fact that he is so concerned and that he has at least made or <span class="col_5575-5576" refersTo="page_1251"/>submitted plans for effecting an improvement to the situation.</p>

<p>In this regard I want to come back to the Minister. The hon. member for Newton Park asked the hon. the Minister here for his view regarding the future of the agricultural industry. The hon. member tried to point out the bottle-necks and to show the Minister that we had to put our heads together in order to eliminate those bottle-necks. What did we have from the hon. the Minister&#x003F; The first matter on which the hon. member for Newton Park touched, was the financial position of the farmers and the lack of confidence in the agricultural industry. He proved his statements. To give you an example, I want to mention that only 16 students are taking the course in sheep and wool farming at Grootfontein. And yet the Minister comes forward and says, &#x201C;But there is confidence. In the first instance, see how many applications there are for more land&#x201D;. Mr. Chairman one also has something called love of the land. It is true that there are rich people and that 16 per cent of the farmers of South Africa are not in debt.

If we are to continue in this vein of the hon. the Minister being unable to see the bottle-necks, we shall get nowhere. Every farmer in South Africa is concerned about the financial position of the agricultural industry. The hon. member for Newton Park indicated here what Mr. De la Harpe de Villiers and Mr. Frans van Wyk had said. But what did the Minister say&#x003F; The Minister was satisfied with the position.

<p>The net revenue is only R601 million. What is strange, is that the volume of production of the farmers of South Africa increased by 7 per cent last year and by 7.8 per cent this year. This only goes to show how hard-working the farmers are. Now, what is the position as regards the net revenue&#x003F; Last year it decreased by R73 million and this year it increased by only R10 million. Debt, however, increased from R1 340 million last year to R1 380 million. In the past four years debt increased by approximately R400 million, but the hon. the Minister is not concerned.</p>

<p>The debts of the farmers grow each year. The hon. member for Newton Park indicated what the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own report says, i.e. &#x201C;It has a crippling effect on the farmer&#x201D;. Last year the report said, &#x201C;It is alarming&#x201D;. What does the hon. the Minister say and what is he going to do about it&#x003F; It does not help us to say that things are going well with the agricultural industry. The desk of each member in this House who is doing his job, is piled high with applications for financial assistance. I shall tell the hon. the Minister what is happening now. The rates of interest are increasing all the time.</p>

<p>The other day I had a case which I referred to the hon. the Minister, and I hope he is going to help me with that. This case relates to a farmer whose rate of interest was increased to 10,5 per cent by Sanlam. He has to be covered by insurance and he will therefore have to pay 13 per cent. What man can make an existence if he has to pay 13 per cent, with the prices of agricultural produce being what they are&#x003F; Surely, he just cannot make an existence! But if the hon. member for Newton Park advocates a financial institution for the farmers of South Africa here, the hon. the Minister has nothing but criticism. The hon. member said the financial schemes had to be under one umbrella so that we might investigate a farmer&#x2019;s case who had been shown away by the Land Bank and assist him at a lower rate of interest. Otherwise the farmer must be subsidized. This side of the House has advocated that since 1966 when the hon. the Minister of Finance came forward with anti-inflationary measures, which included higher rates of interest. Remember, that was one of his fundamental points. This side of the House said they had to be subsidized.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, by 2 per cent, but at that time interest was lower. Then the hon. the Minister came forward with a half-baked scheme and increased interest by 1,5 per cent. As rapidly as the hon. the Minister increases it, the financial institutions increase it too. So it goes on. As a result of this some of the best farmers in South Africa are being ruined. There is no point in telling us that it does not matter. A plan will have to be made if we are in earnest with the agricultural industry in South Africa and this side of the House is. When we look at the figure, we see that the number of farmers decreased by 24 000 in recent years. Now it is being said that the number has to be decreased by a further 30 000. The hon. the Minister said today that he did not agree with that, and I am extremely pleased that he does not agree.</p>

<p>I know that he is not going to take them by the scruff of the neck and push them off the land. I want to tell hon. members that if the Minister is not going to do something about interest, these people are slowly going to be strangled to death. They will gradually be drawn from the agricultural industry as a result of these rates of interest. That is why we are making this plea and that is why we shall continue doing so. Surely it is not an unheard of thing to speak here of a subsidy. Surely the agricultural industry is the most important sector, a sector which has to provide food to the people of South Africa cheaply. It is the sector which produces the character building section of the population of South Africa. That is why I am in earnest about it, and if it is worthwhile, surely this must be done. Surely these subsidies are nothing strange. This hon. Minister voted R14 million for the transport of the urban Bantu in order to assist the industrialist. Does he agree&#x003F;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we have listened today once more to the lamentations of the hon. member for Newton Park and the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town. I want to tell hon. members in all honesty that when listening to the members of the Opposition, one gets the impression that they want to talk the farmer in South Africa out of agriculture. They try to talk him out of it. I just want to tell the hon. member for Newton Park that he is doing agriculture a disservice, and that he is telling an untruth when he says that the hon. the Minister of Agriculture said that the number of farmers in South Africa have to be reduced by 30 000. This is not true. The hon. member read that report in a certain newspaper, but the hon. member only read the headline of the report. He only read the caption; the hon. member can go and check up on his facts. I now want to give the hon. member for Newton Park some good advice. Surely, he has a friend who can read well. This friend can decipher this report for him and we shall then see that the hon. the Minister did not say that the number of farmers in South Africa have to be reduced by 30 000. The hon. member also said that we should make correct predictions as far as the future of agriculture is concerned. I really do not know why the hon. member wants the Government to make predictions on that score, because the hon. member has an hon. member on that side with a crystal ball, the hon. member for Hillbrow. Surely, that hon. member is able to make all the predictions for the hon. member for Newton Park.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. T. C. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>This is quite a misrepresentation of the facts. I want to be a little more positive about agriculture. There are certain economic pointers one can look at when one wants to see whether or not the industry is doing well. As a farmer one cannot but feel proud of the fact that agriculture today is one of the major earners of foreign exchange for South Africa. It is interesting to note that, during the year 1970, we imported agricultural produce to the value of R60,5 million while we exported agricultural produce to the value of R431,9 million. In other words, agriculture was responsible for a surplus of R371 million in foreign exchange for South Africa. When we compare this figure with the total imports of South Africa for 1970, we shall see that the total imports of goods amounted to R2 540 million while exports amounted to R1 421 million. We then see that agriculture is one of the major earners of foreign exchange in South Africa. When one considers an industry and when one wants to see whether an industry is healthy, one surely has to look at the gross production value. All hon. members on that side of the House will agree with me if I point out that, since 1950 to 1970, the gross value of agricultural production increased from R618 million to R1 510 million. In other words, the gross value of our agricultural production has increased by 144 per cent during the past 20 years. We may also consider another aspect of agriculture in order to determine whether it is doing well or whether it is on the downgrade, as was suggested by hon. members opposite. For that purpose we can take the physical volume of agricultural production. Contrary to the psychosis the hon. member for Newton Park and other hon. members opposite want to create, i.e. that all is not well in agriculture and that there are people who are leaving agriculture, we find that the physical volume of agricultural production increased by 112 per cent over the last 20 years. I think one of the best pointers to see whether an industry is sick or healthy, is to consider the value of the capital assets in that industry. In that respect we see that agriculture presents an equally glowing picture. We see that the capital assets increased from R2 900 million to R6 690 million between 1950 and 1970. In other words, the capital assets in agriculture increased by 126 per cent. I think there is a good reason for this. I think the major reason for this is the fact that the National Party is governing the country, because the National Party has confidence in the country and in South Africa. It constantly expresses its confidence in agriculture and does not try to kill it with words. The following aspect we look at, is the value of land. Hon. members know that it is quite interesting and significant to consider the tendency we have in land prices. During the past 20 years, from 1950 to 1970, we see that the price of land has doubled every ten years. In other words, this is further proof of the confidence the people have in agriculture in South Africa. When we look at the index of the value of land, we see that, between 1950 and 1960, the index increased by 122 per cent and by 74 per cent between 1960 and 1970. The overall increase in the value of land in South Africa during the past 20 years is 287 per cent, and this represents an annual rate of 14,3 per cent. Sir, when one looks at these aspects, it proves only one thing, and this is that there exists great confidence in agriculture; that agriculture is not on its way out, but that it is on its way in. Sir, hon. members on the Opposition side made a great fuss here about the question of production costs in agriculture and about the increase in producers&#x2019; prices. Sir, when one listens to the complaints and the lamentations on that side of the House, one gets the impression that production <span class="col_5583-5584" refersTo="page_1255"/>costs in agriculture are increasing out of all proportion to the increase in the price the farmer gets for his produce; but when one looks at the real figures, the hard facts, one sees quite a different picture than the one the hon. member for Newton Park would like to hold up to us here. We see that the producers&#x2019; prices of agricultural produce increased by 26,4 per cent between 1960-&#x2019;61 and 1970-&#x2019;71. If over against this we consider the increase in the prices of requisites such as material and implements, we see that the price increases in production means amounted to only 16,9 per cent. As against this we had an increase of 26,4 per cent in the producers&#x2019; prices of agricultural produce. One can go further and say that we in South Africa are quite fortunate when we consider the tendencies in the prices of agricultural produce. We are in a quite fortunate position in having a Government who looks after the interests of the farmer and agriculture.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Lydenburg paints a rosy picture here; he tells us that everything in the agricultural industry is fine. Sir, have we ever had a Minister of Agriculture who was booed at an agricultural union meeting before&#x003F; Have you ever had as many reports in the Press as you have today about farmers who are unhappy with prices, about farmers who cannot get loans, about farmers who are getting loans but paying 10&#x00BD; per cent interest and, Sir,&#x2014;do not forget the other side of the picture&#x2014;about the housewife who is paying too much for her products. The hon. member for Newton Park spoke about this price gap earlier here this afternoon. But the hon. member for Lydenburg says that everything in the garden is rosy. He talks about exports and about the wonderful contribution that agriculture has made to exports in the country. But, Sir, why did he not do his homework properly&#x003F; If he had, he would have seen by how much the value of agricultural exports has gone down, expressed as the percentage on the total exports of this country&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#du_plessis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. T. C. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>Why&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>It has gone down because of the policy of this Minister and because of his Government; that is why it has gone down. This is the country which could produce far more than we need; which could be exporting almost every product, but because of the policy of this Government we find ourselves with shortages in this country. As I say, Sir, the hon. member spoke about exports, but why does he not tell us that in 1968 exports of agricultural products made up 36,8 per cent of the total exports of this country, but that in 1970 it dropped to 30,4 per cent&#x003F; I believe it has dropped even lower since then. But he does not tell us that; he simply tells us what agricultural exports were worth, and then he speaks about the appreciated value of land. If he had known anything about economics, he would have known that the value of land has only gone up because the value of money has gone down. That is the only reason why you are paying more for land today; it is because the value of money has been depreciated under this Nationalist Government.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to come back to something more positive and deal with the control boards that we have in this country. Unfortunately, the hon. member for Pretoria, who is not here, spoke a little earlier and took my colleague, the hon. member for Von Brandis, to task because, as he put it, he had complained that prices of agricultural goods to the consumer were too high. He tried to equate this with the statement of my hon. friend, the hon. member for Newton Park, who had complained that the prices received by the farmers were too low. Sir, that is precisely the message that we are trying to get through. The message seems to have got halfway to the Government, but only halfway because they still do not seem to understand what we are trying to say, and that is that the function of the control board has broken down. Sir, for how long has the United Party been asking that the Government should reform the entire system of the control boards to ensure that more attention is paid to the primary object of the control boards, and that is price <span class="col_5585-5586" refersTo="page_1256"/>stabilization and orderly marketing&#x003F; Let us get away from this policy that we have had and that has resulted in gluts followed by shortages. This country has either got too much or too little of everything; never does it balance out. Sir, I see the hon. the Minister of Finance laughing. I know why he is laughing. How often has he had this story thrown at him&#x003F; We are now throwing it at his colleague, the Minister of Agriculture, because he is just as guilty of this stop-start policy. When there is an overproduction of butter and dairy products, he brings prices down, and what happens&#x003F; We have to import from New Zealand. And, of course, the reverse is also the position. Mr. Chairman, if these poor boards were performing their functions, we would have happy farmers getting a fair price; we would have happy housewives who are satisfied with the quality of the goods they are getting and the price that they are paying, and we would not have gluts and shortages, but I am afraid that not one of those conditions is satisfied by these boards.</p>

<p>I want to deal for a moment with the potato Board. The Minister knows that he has had a series of questions to answer, and that he answered the last one here this afternoon. What did he tell us in this House on Tuesday when I asked him whether any offers to purchase potatoes had been received from South American countries&#x003F; He said that offers had been received by the Potato Board and considered by the Potato Board. When I asked whether any potatoes had been exported as the result of such enquiries, the answer was, &#x201C;No.&#x201D; But, Sir, I asked further: &#x201C;If not, why not&#x003F;&#x201D;, and do you know what answer he gave&#x003F; The answer was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No exports were effected. The board&#x2019;s prices are not competitive and packaging requirements could not be met.</block>

<p>Sir, what is the position in the country today&#x003F; We have a tremendous glut of potatoes and the hon. the Minister knows it; it is no good running away from it. Our information on this side is that a very lucrative offer was made to the board &#x2026;</p>

<p>I know that the board does not buy in potatoes; we all know that the board does not buy in potatoes. But if the question was incorrectly phrased, the Minister knows what the intention was behind the question, and he ran away from it. It is no good running away from it. Sir, what is happening with these potatoes&#x003F; While we have this glut, he fails to export because he is still negotiating with regard to the price and because packaging requirements could not be met. What does he mean by that&#x003F; Are we so inflexible in this country that for ideological reasons we will not even re-pack for other countries&#x003F; Because that is exactly what happened and the Minister knows it. In the meantime, while we are sitting and not exporting for various reasons, the housewife is still paying too much for potatoes. She is still paying between 11 cents and 15 cents a kg in Cape Town where small ones are being sold on the market for 20 cents per 15 kg and larger ones at between 50 and 60 cents and a top price is 70 cents per 15 kg. This is how the Control Board is operating. Is this Control Board operating efficiently&#x003F; Is the Minister satisfied that it is operating efficiently&#x003F; And it is not the only one. What about the Milk Board&#x003F; We have a report here of 12th April that it is apparent that the Witwatersrand Milk Distributors Association will try to increase the price of milk to shops to counteract the trend as the profit margin on delivered milk is higher than that on milk sold to shops. You have two systems for the supply of milk today; the one where the dairy suppliers deliver direct to the housewives at a high price, and where they deliver to retail outlets at a lower price. Those retail outlets are using milk and are selling it to the housewives at a lower price. Is he going to allow the Dairy Board, the Milk Board, to do this and to increase the price to the retail outlet so that they will compel the housewife to buy under the other system where it is going to be delivered at the higher price&#x003F; I ask this because he knows that the Milk Board allowed that very thing to happen here in Cape Town two years ago where we had the situation that the consumption of fresh milk in two months rose by nearly 6 000 gallons a day and when this new system was introduced and the Milk Board allowed the distributors to jump on this one, to restrict the supermarkets and the retail outlets in their distribution of milk, with the result that the farmer got less for his milk and the consumer had to pay more.</p>

<p>The Wool Commission has retained 260 000 bales of wool which were not sold and which remained in the country because of the slump in the price, but the hon. member will not know that because he is interested only in the scandals of agriculture. He will not trouble himself any further by investigating matters.</p>

<p><span class="col_5589-5590" refersTo="page_1258"/> I should like to deal with the stock reduction scheme and I am pleased that the hon. member for Wahner recommended it so highly. I know that he has the scheme at heart, because he is a farmer in my constituency, and one of the fairly good ones, and I am glad he has it at heart. The hon. member said the department made a sudden end to the scheme. But the scheme was introduced and came into operation as long ago as September, 1969. It was suspended in February, 1972. Now I want to tell the hon. member that any farmer who has soil conservation at heart and who, as a result of this drought, has seen his land deteriorate to such an extent that he will have to employ any means to bring about its recovery, should surely have decided in this time what he wanted to do. The people who have soil conservation at heart and the future farmers of this country have all, without exception, joined in the scheme. The man who wants to leave land to his descendants, participates in this scheme. The man who has been forced to his knees by drought, as, for example, in the Steytlerville district&#x2014;where 72 per cent of the farmers participate in the scheme&#x2014;has joined the scheme because he has soil conservation at heart. If a person cannot make up his mind in three years&#x2019; time to go in for a scheme, I really do not think this should be laid at the door of the department.</p>

<p>But I want to proceed. I am pleased hon. members spoke about this scheme in this House as they did. In this regard I want to read to you what was said about this scheme by a United Party candidate in the Brakpan election, and today I want to challenge the hon. member for Newton Park, who is the leader of the agricultural group of the United Party, to repudiate what this person said in Brakpan&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Civin uncovers meat scandal: A mutton scandal in which the Government is allegedly paying farmers to decrease their flocks of sheep and thereby forcing up the price of mutton, has been uncovered by the United Party candidate for the Brakpan Parliamentary by-election, Mr. Julius Civin. Mr. Civin was alerted to the scandal when he was told by housewives in the town that mutton prices had increased astronomically this year, and he said this week &#x201C;I understand that mutton has been priced at 58 cents a pound on occasions&#x201D;. During his investigations he found that farmers who had previously marketed 2 000 sheep a year, were now on the quota system and were only marketing 500 sheep a year.</block>

<p>He now relates the quota system to the stock reduction scheme&#x2014;what utter nonsense !</p>

<block name="quote">This means that under normal circumstances farmers should be hopelessly out of pocket, but the Government is subsidizing them to the tune of R7 000 each per year and some farmers are even getting R8 500 per year for not farming.</block>

<p>Then he went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The end result of all this is that whereas previously the market was glutted as farmers reduced their stocks, now there is only a 50 per cent mutton availability with the result that the price of mutton has gone up by 22 cents a pound.</block>

<p>I want to read another few extracts from this article before dealing with them&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Civin, who has made exhaustive inquiries into the situation, because of the seriousness of the complaints from housewives, also found that the cost to the country of the subsidy scheme would be about R150 million. The result is that the taxpayer will have to pay this money and at the same time pay double for his meat. Nationalists have told Mr. Civin that they cannot vote for the candidate of a Government which indulges in such a scandal.</block>

<p>I say I challenge the hon. member for Newton Park to repudiate this article. Here we have the two heads of the United Party. In the city it speaks one language, but in the rural areas and here, from where it <span class="col_5591-5592" refersTo="page_1259"/>will be relayed to the farmers, they speak another language. The hon. member for Walmer commends the scheme as one of the best ever in agriculture, and I am in complete agreement with him, but here we have a United Party candidate who slandered this scheme.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Pay higher compensation&#x201D;! In Brakpan Mr. Civin said that we were draining the taxpayers&#x2019; money for a scheme which allowed the farmers not to farm but at Graaff-Reinet the hon. member for Newton Park told the Government: &#x201C;Pay higher compensation&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Today I want to squash once and for all the notion which exists in the country that the stock reduction scheme is responsible for the increase in meat prices, because that is not so. The stock reduction scheme has nothing whatsoever to do with the increase in meat prices. The fact of the matter is that the <i>per capita</i> consumption of mutton increased from 8,7 kg in 1960-&#x2019;61 to 10,4 kg in 1970-&#x2019;71. This is an enormous increase in the <i>per capita</i> consumption of meat. Over, the same period there was an increase from 141 metric tons to 225 metric tons per year. Over the same period the total number of slaughterings increased from 4 900 000 to 9 300 000. This illustrates the tremendous increase in the consumption of mutton as a result of the higher standard of living. I say we should stop blaming the stock reduction scheme as being responsible for the increase in meat prices, because that is not so. I do not begrudge the farmers the meat prices they are obtaining at present, because I think it is necessary for the stock farmers of South Africa to get an injection.</p>
