<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I please ask for the privilege of the half-hour.</p>

<p>The first point to which I should like to draw attention this afternoon, is the position which the Prime Minister occupies in the Government of South Africa. He is undoubtedly the person who has the most power; he appoints the Ministers and he can dismiss Ministers. He is the final arbiter of national policy. It is in that capacity of his that I want to take up a matter with him this afternoon, one which I regard as one of the most important and pressing problems facing South Africa at the moment, and that is the economic policy being followed by this Government at the present time.</p>

<p>We are used to the Government&#x2019;s tactics of trying to run away from any discussion of the country&#x2019;s economic situation and to their attempts at distracting attention from it by setting up false beacons. In Brakpan, as we still remember, the false beacon was that the United Party did not want to put its heart and soul into fighting communism and terrorism, and now, with a view to Oudtshoorn, the false beacon is an attempt at reviving racial hatred and racialism&#x2014;an outrage towards South Africa, which makes every responsible South African shudder. In view of what happened here last week, the Prime Minister is called upon to clear up this matter, but we cannot allow him to run away, too, from a discussion of the bad economic situation of South Africa. He is the final authority in the Government and he has to account for the things which are so manifestly wrong in the economy of South Africa, under which so many people suffer, especially the ordinary citizen, the person with a fixed income, the aged, and the newlyweds. Before we deal with anything else, he must first discuss this matter with us. His responsibility is even greater because of the failure of his party&#x2019;s financial group and his Minister of Finance to reply to the criticism which had come from this side. [Laughter.] Sir, hon. members on that side laugh. Yesterday when the hon. the Minister delivered his reply, they sat here fast asleep. He battled for an hour, but achieved nothing. In places he revealed complete confusion.</p>

<p>For example, he tried ridiculing us because our speakers had pointed out that the economy was advancing ever more slowly, while prices were rising ever more rapidly. To him this seemed to be a contradiction, but it was not, Mr. Chairman. The biggest problem of South Africa is the very fact that economic growth is being retarded in the midst of inflation, an unfortunate phenomenon which economists strikingly describe as &#x201C;stagflation&#x201D;. If the Minister of Finance is unable to see this dangerous phenomenon, then one must wonder how competent this Government is to govern South Africa in these difficult days. Sir, I have already warned before that this Government is completely incompetent to handle our economy. On various occasions I have sounded the particular warning that unless it handled our economic affairs correctly, we would lose control of the relations question in South Africa, and this applies not only to relations between Whites and non-Whites, but also to relations between Whites and Whites, for there is one thing about which the hon. the Prime Minister and I may have no argument, whether we apply his solution or my solution to South Africa &#x2026;</p>

<p><span class="col_5131-5132" refersTo="page_1029"/>Sonny, did you write that speech&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I warned, as I have just said, and what happened&#x003F; The cost of living has increased enormously, and it is still increasing. Our standards of living have not kept pace with the rise in the standards of living of countries in Europe from which we expect immigrants, and it is falling more and more behind. Do we have the necessary money, Sir, to safeguard ourselves in a dangerous world&#x003F; Is our economy strong enough to deter our enemies in a dangerous world&#x003F; What happened this Session&#x003F; These Budgets were presented, all with the same feature, i.e. a large unexpected deficit.</p>

<p>I say &#x201C;large&#x201D; because it is clear that the Minister of Finance tried to conceal his deficit by juggling the figures. The second feature was that reserves were either depleted or were being depleted, and all three gambled on the revival of the economy, although the Minister of Railways did not seem to be too happy about it. But what is even worse, is the fact that the main Budget left us with a series of unsolved problems. Businessmen and industrialists must plan in advance. What particulars did they obtain from the Minister&#x003F; Last year they were up against an increase of approximately 7 per cent in the cost of living which, of course, diminished the buying power of their customers, and a growth rate, not of 5&#x00BD; per cent as envisaged by the E.D.P.&#x2014;not even of 4 per cent which others anticipated&#x2014;but of approximately 3,7 per cent. Now, what is the forecast for this year&#x003F; On what basis must the businessmen and the industrialists plan&#x003F; What is John Citizen to expect&#x003F; What did we get from the hon. the Minister&#x003F; We did not get any forecast of the growth rate for this year, or of the growth rate he is striving to achieve. Neither did we get any forecast of the rate of inflation, or to what extent he believes he will be able to curb it. We did not get any dynamic plan for the future. What we got, was some relaxing here and some tightening there; there was some nibbling at the whole problem, but no vigorous action.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Now, what are the results going to be, and how do they affect the responsibility of the hon. the Prime Minister&#x003F; First of all, the growth in our living standards is not going to keep pace with the growth in living standards <i>per capita</i> in Europe, As I have warned before, it is going to become increasingly difficult for us to attract immigrants to South Africa. We may even once again lose some of our valuable people who will be drawn to higher standards overseas. Secondly, the growth rate of last year, and the sort of growth rate which seems to be envisaged at the moment for this year, are not going to be able to create work opportunities, not only for the Bantu coming on to the labour market, but also for the Coloureds coming on to the labour market.</p>

<p>Let me warn the hon. the Prime Minister. There are those who are forecasting already that unless we have a growth rate of at least 6 per cent there is going to be growing unemployment among both the Bantu and the Coloureds by next year, 1973. Thirdly, while this Budget may promote some growth I do not believe it is going to cope with the inflationary pressures adequately to prevent the country being faced with a spate of claims for wage and salary increases before the end of the year, with ever-growing burdens on the ordinary man in the street. Fourthly, the concessions made in respect of our labour pattern, and the additional use of our labour, may help us to take up some surplus capacity in industry, but it certainly will not provide a long-term answer to the problems with which the South African economy is faced at present. Fifthly, the decline in the tempo of industrial development in our existing industrial complexes is going to leave the Government with a shortage of funds, a shortage of funds for the development of the Bantu homelands, a shortage of funds for the decentralization of industry and, in fact, for the whole fabric on which this Government&#x2019;s non-White policy is based. Sixthly, the revised taxation schedules, giving with the one hand and taking with the other hand, giving a minimal relief, are going to be totally inadequate to get the best out of our entrepreneurial and executive classes in South Africa.</p>

<p>All this means only one thing to me, and that is that there is serious trouble for South Africa and all its people ahead unless proper steps are taken and taken quickly. I believe that the position is so serious that I am going to put five questions to the hon. the Prime Minister this <span class="col_5133-5134" refersTo="page_1030"/>afternoon, questions which I believe need urgent and clear replies. I believe that he, as head of the Government, cannot shirk his responsibility in respect of these questions.</p>

<p>The first thing I want to know from him is whether it is still the policy of his Government to reduce the number of Bantu in the White areas regardless of the consequences. I have already indicated that the generation of funds for the decentralization of industry, the development of the homelands and the infra-structure in the border areas depend on the prosperity and growth in the existing industrial areas. I must describe them as economic power stations of South Africa. They provide the power for development not only in the White areas, but also in the Bantu areas of South Africa. If their sources of labour are limited and their development is frozen, they are not going to develop sufficient power for development elsewhere for the carrying out of the policies to which the hon. the Prime Minister is committed.</p>

<p>The second question concerns the plans, if any, which this Government has for the rapid training of our labour forces, Whites and non-Whites, to produce an adequately trained and productive labour force to compete with sophisticated labour forces elsewhere in the world. I want to say at once that the steps so far announced are totally and utterly inadequate to achieve that objective; nor have they any chance whatever of succeeding in so far as the Bantu are concerned as long as we are trying to train craftsmen who are chained to the migratory labour system, a system which means that they are available for a maximum of 12 months at a time and then must return to the homelands before they can resume their work in the White areas. This applies to all the Bantu other than those who are protected under section 10 and those in the border industries.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. the Prime Minister now that I do not want to be put off with fatuous talk about this being the responsibility of the employers of labour in South Africa. This is a national problem which must be tackled on a national basis; it must be tackled by the Government of the day in the full knowledge that employers can only move within the ambit of Government policy.</p>

<p>There is a third question I want to put to the hon. the Prime Minister. It concerns the use of non-White labour in jobs previously done by Whites. We know that the Government claims that its policy is the controlled use of non-White labour in jobs previously done by Whites, in consultation with the trade unions. I suspect sometimes that they have tried to borrow that from the United Party. What is the control that is going to be exercised&#x003F; Is the Government going to control this problem in a weak, half-hearted manner, or is it going to go ahead in a determined effort to improve the productivity of the whole labour force, as the ultimate answer to the problems of inflation or a bigger internal market and a bigger export market&#x003F; There have been some answers from the hon. the Minister of Labour in the Other Place. We want the hon. the Prime Minister to give us an answer. There are enormous benefits awaiting this country if only it would employ all its labour resources to the best advantage. We know, of course, that for various reasons there are problems associated with the increased use and higher training of non-Whites, problems which can only be sorted out if there is proper consultation and all parties put their cards openly on the table and discussion is frank and open. I believe the success of such negotiation depends 100 per cent on a clearly defined programme of Government objectives and, in the first place, on maximum development of the economy and the increasing use of non-Whites on an orderly basis and with the approval of the trade unions in the second place. I know that Tucsa has already called for the establishment of bodies throughout South Africa, on a nation-wide basis, to gather the facts and to be in the position to help and advise with labour negotiations on these issues. Without accepting the responsibility for the guidance of these bodies under a clearly defined policy, the Government can be the instrument of chaos, chaos in the ranks of labour and chaos in the ranks of the employers as well, where similar difficulties can arise. This, I believe, is going to be the final consequence of the position as it exists now. The hon. the Minister of Finance seems to have vaguely indicated that businessmen have the responsibility of employing additional non-White labour in jobs previously done by Whites.</p>

<p>I come to the fourth question. I want to know from the hon. the Prime Minister whether at a time like this, at a time when we are faced with a slowing up in our growth rate and a time when we are falling <span class="col_5135-5136" refersTo="page_1031"/>behind in the <i>per capita</i> increase in the living standards of the countries of the Western world, the Government is going to continue to spend precious money and use even more precious labour&#x2014;particularly trained labour&#x2014;for the creation of infrastructures for the decentralization of industry exclusively for ideological purposes.</p>

<p>Fifthly, we want to know&#x2014;and I believe industrialists throughout South Africa want to know&#x2014;whether the relaxations forecast in the provisions of the Physical Resources and Planning Act, as announced by the Minister of Finance, are final, or whether further relaxations will be granted. Will those relaxations granted be temporary, or will they be final&#x003F; What is the position&#x003F; Are those industrialists who expand and who allow the greater use of Bantu labour in those areas to which the Act applies, going to be able to rely on additional use of Bantu labour in the future, or will the Act always be hanging over their heads as a source of uncertainty and as a source of frustration in the future&#x003F; I put these questions to the hon. the Prime Minister, because he will appreciate that the answers not only involve the Minister of Finance, but also the Minister of Labour, the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, the Minister of Planning, and the three or four Ministers responsible for the education of the various groups of our population. That means that lack of cooperation on the part of anyone, a lack of co-operation in a coherent and clearly defined policy, can create bottlenecks which could cause chaos, uncertainty and insecurity. This could be fatal to peaceful economic progress and the future of our country. It is no good planning for relaxations under the Planning Act if you find that the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development does not want to make the labour available. It is no good the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development making labour available where it cannot be absorbed because of the activities of other Ministers elsewhere, while there is again a shortage in the labour force needed for the development of South Africa in other regions.</p>

<p>I believe that my analysis of our problems and the questions which I have put to the hon. the Prime Minister, indicate how heavy his responsibility is to the overall co-ordinated planning and for the policies which are necessary to solve our human problems in South Africa today. His Cabinet should be a delicately attuned symphony orchestra acting in harmony under his baton. I want to tell him that at the moment they seem to me more like a rag-time band notable for their disharmony. I hope the hon. gentleman will show the nation that he is capable of accepting this responsibility by dealing with this part of our debate very explicitly and very clearly so that every entrepreneur and every trade union leader, indeed every businessman in South Africa, will know exactly what his position is and can have clear guide lines for his plans for the growth and prosperity of South Africa.</p>

<p>In putting these plans to the hon. gentleman, I want to remind him once again of three things. The first is that the success of any non-White policy in South Africa will depend on economic prosperity and increased living standards, increased living standards not in a vacuum but increased living standards in comparison with the countries of the rest of the world. The second thing of which I want to remind the hon. the Prime Minister, is that our security in a dangerous world depends upon our economic strength and the defensive instruments which that economic strength can command for South Africa. Thirdly, the greatest bulwark against Communism in the world of today is a prosperous and a satisfied community. I want to warn the hon. the Prime Minister that the widening gap between the incomes of the different races in South Africa may be the gap through which Communism will breach the defenses of South Africa.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is very clear to me that if there is one disappointed man in this House, it is my hon. friend the Leader of the Opposition. The way in which he started this debate showed me only too clearly exactly how disappointed he is. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition made the statement&#x2014;we all know it is correct&#x2014;that in the final instance I am responsible for all my colleagues. I want to tell him that I gladly accept that responsibility. He said I was responsible for the actions of my hon. friend the Minister of Finance. I want to say to him that it is a proud responsibility I take upon myself. In passing I want to say that in the years in which this Minister has been sitting in this House of Assembly and in the years in which he has handled important portfolios, he has rendered invaluable services <span class="col_5137-5138" refersTo="page_1032"/>to South Africa. I want to say to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that the Budget which the hon. the Minister of Finance has introduced once again, bears the stamp of a Budget handled by a man who not only knows what he is doing, but I am expressing it as my conviction that there are very few people, if any, who would have been able to emulate him in this. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>It is of no avail if we laugh about it contemptuously; let us reason out the matter with each other across the floor of this House like fair-minded, reasonable people. Let us see whether there is any substance in the charge made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. Was the hon. the Leader of the Opposition not in the House yesterday&#x003F;</p>

<p>&#x2026; but I only wish you could have been sitting here in my bench to see how you looked. This is my opinion; but let us leave it at that now. I have a very high regard for the Minister, while the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has a low opinion of him. But surely we need not judge only on my opinion and on his. Surely it has been our experience in the past year in particular that the various economic interest groups in this country, whether their orientation be Afrikaans speaking or English speaking, have not on one single occasion hesitated to say candidly what they thought of Government action and what their standpoint was in respect of economic affairs in South Africa. We had a Budget which was introduced against the background of not only very difficult circumstances in South Africa, but also extremely difficult international economic conditions, circumstances which have affected all countries of the world intimately, which are continuing to do so and, as the hon. the Minister indicated, will continue to do so in the future. The hon. the Minister introduced his Budget and neither the hon. the Leader of the Opposition nor hon. members opposite, who in the past have let no opportunity pass of quoting some or other person or of citing some or other businessman against us, have been able to cite any business interests, business groups, business organizations or economists of repute against us in respect of this Budget. Surely it is my duty to take note of what the Chamber of Industries says. Only this afternoon, between one o&#x2019;clock and two o&#x2019;clock, I was listening to what the economist of the Chamber of Industries said here in Cape Town this morning, namely that as a result of this Budget there was every reason to be optimistic about the economic future of South Africa.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>In addition, I listened to what the Chamber of Commerce and the Sakekamers had to say. I have listened to the standpoints of all possible interest groups, and what was the keynote of these&#x003F; As my friend the hon. the Minister of Finance said, some of them said that they would have liked to have seen the Budget take this or that form, but this is natural and goes without saying. However, what was the keynote of this criticism, which did not emanate from politicians who wanted to make political capital out of the matter, but emanated from economists and business institutions&#x003F; The keynote was that the Minister had not only introduced a good Budget, but had once again laid the foundation for growth in South Africa, and that South Africa had reason to be optimistic. It is probably a long time since there has been such appreciation for a Budget among businessmen as that which appears from the comments which have been made on this year&#x2019;s Budget. Who am I and the <span class="col_5139-5140" refersTo="page_1033"/>Leader of the Opposition to have a great deal to say about this Budget if these are the comments of the people intimately affected by this Budget&#x003F; It is clear to me that the Leader of the Opposition is very disappointed. After all, the Opposition prematurely took delight in saying how badly South Africa was faring. They prematurely took delight in saying in what a predicament this Government had landed the economy of South Africa. What are they doing now&#x003F; It is true that in recent years there has been a deceleration in growth. We all know this. But surely it is not the first time this has happened. It happened in 1968 as well. The figure for 1968 is approximately the same as for the year which has just passed. This has happened before too. And yet, in spite of the fact that it happened in one single year, 1968, we maintained a growth rate of 6 per cent for the 1960s, as compared with the 5 per cent for the decade from 1950 to 1960 and 4 per cent for the decade from 1940 to 1950. Surely these are the economic facts with which we are faced. On what grounds can the hon. the Leader of the Opposition presume to reproach us in this regard&#x003F; To me it is an indication of disappointment on the part of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition.</p>

<p>Since he has levelled the charge at me, let us look at South Africa for one moment now. We took over the government in 1948. Many hon. members sitting in this House know little about 1948, because they were still young then. But fortunately we still have the figures, although our memories have become vague. Relatively speaking, South Africa was an undeveloped country in the economic sphere in 1948. Not only was South Africa poorly developed in 1948, but my hon. friends sitting on the opposite side had no confidence in its industrial and economic future.</p>

<p>And unfair.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; and unfair, but I shall prove the truth of it to him. The GATT agreement was negotiated by the United Party in the 1940s. Even today we are still paying as a result of the terms they negotiated in that GATT agreement. We are paying for that because the United Party adopted the attitude that South Africa did not have an industrial future, but only an agricultural future. They adopted the attitude that in that GATT agreement the emphasis should at all times be placed on South Africa being an industrial country, and no terms were negotiated with a view to the establishment of industries here in South Africa. They regarded South Africa as an agricultural country, but they saw no chance for the industrial development on the economic front. Surely this is an obvious fact, and nobody can deny it at all.</p>

<p>I am saying that South Africa was comparatively undeveloped in those years, and in that regard we need not rely on guesswork again. We need merely look at the figures again today. I, as the responsible person in this regard, must satisfy myself whether the National Party has acted in the interests of South Africa and whether the Ministers for whom I am responsible have guided that development into the right channels. And, Sir, I have satisfied myself of that. What do the figures tell me&#x003F; The figures tell me that in 1947-&#x2019;46 we had a Budget of R349 million. That was the Budget strength of South Africa in 1947-&#x2019;48. I must point out to hon. members opposite that we were handicapped by the GATT agreement, that they rallied the world against us when we took over and that they held out no idealism and no hope for the future. Their propaganda was : Because this Government has taken over, the banks will close and the feet of the unemployed will resound in the streets. This, Sir, was the message they conveyed to the outside world about South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it is old stuff, but it is true. Bad medicine remains good for hon. members opposite. In spite of those facts which we opposed&#x2014;in fact, one can see it for oneself in the figures&#x2014; we have developed South Africa. Naturally, things developed slower initially, because there was a very great deal we had to rectify. Thus one finds that 10 years later that R349 million had become R698 million. The figure had almost been doubled, but things nevertheless proceeded at a slow pace initially. Ten years later, in 1967-&#x2019;68, a figure of R1 956 million was reached; and four years later, the figure of R3 648 million was reached. In other words, in slightly more than two decades, it has increased to that extent, but in spite of this, that side is accusing the Government of being incompetent; it is accusing the Ministers of the Government, especially the Minister of Finance, of being incompetent, and what do we find&#x003F; We find that thanks to my predecessors, and thanks to this Minister and his predecessors, we were able to increase a Budget of R349 million in 1947-&#x2019;48 to R3 648 million slightly more than two decades later.</p>

<p>Let us go further. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition levelled a further accusation at me. He accused me and my hon. friend, as well as the National Party and my predecessors, of not having ensured proper standards of living for our people. If this were true, it would be a very serious matter. But let us see how true this economic argument of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is. We have not merely remained even, if one takes 1948 as a basis; we have not merely added the cost of living to salaries. We have raised the standard of living of the people in South Africa, Whites and non-Whites, in an unparallelled way. Again it is not necessary that my word or someone else&#x2019;s has to be accepted for that. We can merely look at the figures. As a basis, we may take the figure so often used by hon. members opposite, namely that the rand of today is worth only 40 cents as compared with that of 1948. I am prepared to accept that figure of 40 cents for the purposes of my argument. In the first place I want to say this, then: It is obvious that the cost of living has risen, not only in South Africa, but throughout the world. It is obvious that the value of money has decreased; the penny is no longer the penny it was in 1900. This applies throughout the world. The point is not whether the standard of living has risen. The point &#x2014;and I must satisfy myself on this&#x2014;is not that the cost of living has increased; the point is whether salaries and wages have kept pace with the increase in the cost of living. The point is not merely whether the cost of living has increased; the question is whether the standards of living of the people have risen in spite of that increase and whether they have been able to pay it. What do the figures tell me, Sir, because I have to satisfy myself on this score&#x003F; In order to satisfy myself on this score, I examined the position in respect of different categories of people in order to see what they received from the United Party in 1948 and what they receive from this Government. We can look at any aspect whatsoever; let us look at the position of a bricklayer. The hon. member levelled the reproach at me that we are prejudicing the standard of living of our people and that, economically, we are not looking after our people. We have heard several times from hon. members opposite that we should go back to the economy of 1948.</p>

<p>Sir, I called for the various figures in order to see what the answer is. The answer is that under the United Party the average wage of a bricklayer was R21-67 per week in September, 1946. The average wage for a bricklayer in 1972 was given to me as R82-33 per week. It has increased from R21 to R82; that is the average. Accepting that the rand of 1948 is worth 40 cents now, hon. members may work out for themselves what the position is. Let us take the case of a motor mechanic. I shall leave out the cents for the moment; his weekly wage was R17 per week; now his average wage is R64 per week. I take the case of a police constable; a police constable younger than 18 years received R30 per month under those hon. members, and if he was 18 years or older, he received R33 per month. That same police constable is not receiving R30 per month and R33 per month now; he receives R110 per month and R130 per month now.</p>

In their time a teacher in the lowest category received only R45 per month; under us, a teacher in the lowest category receives R190 per month; in their time the salary of the teacher in the highest category&#x2014;this was the maximum on which one could start&#x2014;was R70 per month, and now it is R325 per month. Sir, let us see how they treated the female teachers. In their time the starting salary of a female teacher was only R36 per month; now she receives R145 per month. In the highest category they received R56 per month; now they receive R1 560 per year, i.e. R295 per month.</p>

Sir, let us forget about all these other people for a moment. Let us take the matriculant, who is the basic unit in the Public Service, in the banks and in all undertakings. Let us see what prospects they offered a matriculant in the Public Service, and what the position is today. In their time a matriculated male clerk received R36 per month in the Public Service. Under us he starts on R130 per month in this year of 1972. Lastly, let us look at nurses, and then we will have dealt with the entire spectrum. In their time a White student nurse received the princely salary of R27 per month.</p>

<p>I maintain that there is no unemployment in the homelands, and I maintain that there is no unemployment outside the homelands. To tell the truth, there are many people who think that we are building up a tremendous shortage as far as Black labour is concerned; there are many people who are concerned about that. I want to say to South Africa and, for that matter, to hon. members opposite that they need not be concerned about unemployment. Even they will have enough to do as long as this Government rules South Africa. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition is merely making a statement. He adduces no proof for it. He merely makes the statement that &#x201C;our living standards are falling behind&#x201D;. On what grounds he says this I do not know. He adduced no proof for it at all, and he cannot do so either. But what is the &#x201C;serious trouble&#x201D;&#x003F; Why does the hon. member use these words, i.e. &#x201C;serious trouble&#x201D; that is in store for us&#x003F; These are difficult days, most certainly, but surely the hon. the Leader knows as well as I do that, as far as these problems are concerned, the necessary measures are being taken by this side of the House.

<p>One can never do enough, but when the United Party was in power, there was nothing. [Interjections.] Let me give hon. members an example, since they are annoyed about my statement. I used to live in Brakpan. At that time it was a town with 25 000 White inhabitants. Until the National Party took over in the Transvaal in 1949, there was not a single high school for Afrikaansor English-speaking children in that town. Do hon. members know this&#x003F; Twenty-five thousand White inhabitants and there was not a high school for Afrikaans and English children in the whole of that town! Today there are no fewer than five for Afrikaans and English children in that town. These, then, are the hon. members who want to come and talk here! We are training not only the Whites, but also the non-Whites. To tell the truth, the accusation is levelled at us by the allies of the United Party that we are doing too much for the non-Whites in that regard. What is more&#x2014;and I still want to say something to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition about this&#x2014;not only do the Hertzogites, their allies, level that accusation at us, but the United Party itself does so too. Do we then not have it on record&#x2014;the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has still not replied to it, and in this Budget debate I shall insist than he give me a reply&#x2014;that the Leader of the United Party in South-West Africa, the Hon. Senator Niehaus, reproached us with spending too much on the education of the Black people in Owambo&#x003F;</p>

But he has received the reply to that innumerable times. He received it from my hon. friend on my left, the Minister of Transport, as well as from the hon. the Minister of Labour.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<p>The reply was that we believe in controlled employment, that we believe the White worker should be protected and that we believe the White worker should not work under the non-White. Surely we have told him that innumerable times&#x2014;what nonsense is this that he comes along and asks the question again&#x003F;</p>

<p>Fourthly, he asked me whether we would continue spending valuable money on the establishment of infrastructures for the border areas and the Bantu areas &#x201C;exclusively for ideological purposes&#x201D;. What nonsense is that&#x003F; In the first place, that infrastructure must be established, whether it be next to the Bantu areas, within the Bantu areas or in the White areas. Our policy is very clear, because we are serious about it and because we want to retain the non-White in his homeland. It is very clear because we have viewed the matter from all angles&#x2014;from the economic angle, the sociological angle and ethnological angle. We saw that, viewed from those angles, it is better for the Bantu to remain in his homeland and work there if this can be done. I am not apologizing to hon. members opposite or to anyone for the fact that I am spending money in order to develop the infrastructure near the homelands or within the homelands. The hon. members opposite then make great play of saying that they also want to develop the homelands &#x2026;</p>

<p>They make a great show of that, but how can you develop the homelands if you do not create the infrastructure for it&#x003F; If they are not prepared to do so, surely it is only mere talk&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader asked me whether the relaxations were temporary or permanent. The White Paper sets it out very clearly. After all, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition can read and he heard what the Minister said in his Budget speech. The position is that it depends on the type of industry, and we have said explicitly that future industries which have a certain <span class="col_5149-5150" refersTo="page_1038"/>labour ratio and which want to supply certain demands cannot be established in certain White areas. They must be established in the border areas or in the Bantu areas.</p>

<p>With that I have replied to the five questions put by the hon. the Leader. After putting these questions the hon. the Leader said that my Cabinet looked like a &#x201C;ragtime band&#x201D;.

<p>Mr. Chairman, we have had an interesting few minutes from the hon. the Prime Minister but it seems to me to have proved very little indeed. The hon. gentleman has come out with the fact that in his opinion the United Party entered into the GATT agreement upon the inner belief that South Africa&#x2019;s future was a future as an agricultural country and not an industrial country. Fortuitously the hon. member for Pinetown is sitting behind me. Between 1945 and 1948 he, on behalf of the Board or Trade, was engaged in investigations into the following industries with a view to their extension and their development in South Africa : The shoe industry, the clothing industry, the footwear industry, the furniture industry, the timber industry, the leather industry, the chemical industry, the canned fruit industry and the biscuit industry. Yet the hon. the Prime Minister says that we were expecting that South Africa would only develop as an agricultural country.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. gentleman says, &#x201C;Why did we then enter into the agreement&#x003F;&#x201D; The hon. the Prime Minister knows there have been opportunities for revision of that agreement over the years. Why have there not been revisions&#x003F; The hon. the Prime Minister knows that. It was taken up the other day with the hon. the Minister of Finance. The hon. gentleman knows that very well.</p>

<p>He has set out to show that when one looks at wages, people are being paid more today than they were in those days when one has regard to the value of money. The value of money is not everything. The question is: What share have those people had in the prosperity of South Africa&#x003F; Here you have a national income multiplied ten or eleven times, but where is there an increase here of ten or eleven times of what it was 25 or 26 years ago&#x003F; So, I do not think these increases reflect all that credit on the hon. gentleman and those who are working with him.</p>

<p>Then the hon. gentleman asks: Who has developed South Africa&#x003F; Mr. Chairman, who laid the foundation for the development of South Africa&#x003F; It is the United Party with the plans it made during the wax years with its economic advisory council and the wonderful reports that were put in on which this Government build.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister has challenged me to show that living standards have not risen faster in the Republic than elsewhere. I am speaking from memory, but I have the figures with me in one of these files. But as I remember the situation according to the Reserve Bank figures, in the ten-year period, 1958-&#x2019;68, the standard of living <i>per capita</i> rose in South Africa approximately 2,5 per cent per annum.</p>

<p>2,4 per annum. In Great Britain it rose approximately 2,5 per cent per annum. In the countries of the European Economic Community they rose approximately 5 per cent per annum and in Japan they rose approximately 10 per cent per annum.

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>It seems to me that with the present situation, we are falling further behind the increase in living standards of Europe at the present time. We have no figures from the hon. the Minister of Finance of his expectations for the coming year. We have no idea what he is envisaging by way of a growth rate. It seems to me that my case is made and the case of the hon. the Prime Minister lacks any proof whatever.</p>

<p>We have had our differences about unemployment. We are always in an unhappy situation when unemployment is discussed in this House. We are in an unhappy <span class="col_5151-5152" refersTo="page_1039"/>situation because we have no figures in respect of the Bantu homelands. Time and again we have asked the hon. the Minister for figures concerning Bantu unemployment in South Africa, but all we get are the figures of registered Bantu unemployed, which are the figures of those who take the trouble to register in the urban areas. On the figures given to us by one of these hon. Ministers only the other day, he believes that the population of the Bantu townships is far greater than what the official figures are. I believe he is correct; I believe that there are vast numbers of Bantu in those townships, fair above the figure which is authorized. I believe that the hon. the Prime Minister will find that he will be very surprised to see what the extent of unemployment is in some of those townships. I have visited some; I visited one outside East London which I believe is carrying 50 per cent more people in it than what the population was intended to be. I believe that a very high percentage of that extra 50 per cent are unemployed. But he will not find them in the figures of the registered unemployed Bantu in South Africa. It gives me no pleasure to take this up with the hon. the Prime Minister; it is a source of great regret to me, but I feel the time has come to say quite straightly and honestly across the floor of this House that it is no use coming to us with figures of registered unemployed Bantu, while no attempt is made to give us the unemployment figures in the Bantu homelands and of those in the townships who are avoiding registration or are in excess of the population at the present time.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister replied to my five questions. The first question had to do with the reduction in the number of Bantu in the White urban areas. He said, of course, that he was making no projections and forecasts in respect of 1978, but that there will be no removal of Bantu if it led to a disruption of industry. I understand that, but what we are worried about is not the disruption of existing industries, but about the growth of the existing industrial areas to give sufficient power and strength to the development of the future of South Africa. The second matter I took up with the hon. gentleman was the training of employees, White and non-White, in order to enable us to compete with sophisticated labour forces in other parts of the world. The hon. gentleman said that the United Party had done nothing. Has he never heard of the COTT scheme&#x003F; Has he never heard of what was done in the war years&#x003F; Did he never hear of those things&#x003F; He talks today about the tremendous amount that is being done. The last figure I have shows that there are only 3 676 Bantu in the whole of the Republic getting technical and vocational training. This figure is in respect of March, 1971. The Prime Minister then dealt with the question of non-Whites doing the work of Whites and he said that we had received a reply already. That is one of our troubles. We have had conflicting replies. I leave this matter to members of the labour group to deal with. He went on to say that no matter how difficult the situation may be at the present time, he was going to continue with the decentralization programme, because he believed in it and asked whether we also believed in the development of the Bantu homelands. Of course, we believe in the development of the Bantu homelands, but just because of this very difficulty we suggested that it should be done with private White capital. The hon. the Prime Minister and his Government would not face up to that and have now reached the stage where they talk about development on an agency basis.</p>

<p>I agree that in the life of the Government the change has been marked. It is now development on an agency basis, whatever it was before. But until the Government gets around to align development on the basis of private White capital and initiative going into those homelands, we are going to remain as we are today with minimal development and with the suspicion that there is a vast amount of unemployment in those areas. The hon. gentleman also replied to my last question and indicated that the dispensation depended upon the type of industry. I think we are at cross purposes here. The hon. the Minister of Finance talked about dispensation for industries very largely engaged in exporting &#x2026; [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, if a Leader of an Opposition ever talked himself out of a position, then the hon. the Leader of the Opposition talked himself out of one this afternoon; for what a plaintive display did <span class="col_5153-5154" refersTo="page_1040"/>we not have from the hon. Leader this afternoon! While I concede that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is a gentleman, and a good man. I sat here this afternoon wondering whether one would not feel slightly ashamed if he had to be one&#x2019;s Prime Minister. I know that is a harsh word, but it is true. What have we had here this afternoon&#x003F;</p>

<p>Last week we discussed finances in this House in the Budget debate. Yesterday afternoon those hon. members sat there as if mummified while the Minister of Finance discussed finances here. After the Budget debate and the reply yesterday&#x2014;I wonder whether this is not the first time in history this has happened&#x2014;the hon. the Leader of the Opposition stood up and tried to turn this debate into a financial debate. Why did he do that&#x003F; For one reason; he must steer clear of certain matters. He grabbed at this subject this afternoon as a fig-leaf. Therefore what you saw here this afternoon was the hon. the Leader of the Opposition running awry. While my people are asking for bread, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition offered them a stone this afternoon. His conduct here this afternoon reminded me of what Dr. Malan once said. Listen now to how applicable this is to that hon. Leader, with his feet of clay. I quote (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You have allowed yourself to be led to believe, Dr. Malan said, that to allow a people to live, it is enough to ensure them their bread and butter. You have buried your idealism. You have looked askance at what you have loved, to call it sentiment, and in doing so you have encouraged the alien who detests your own nationhood to his own advantage. It did not occur to you that a people cannot, just as an individual cannot, live by bread alone. You have forgotten that it is ideals, and ideals alone, which can inspire deeds of self-sacrifice. You have forgotten that sentiment is like cement, and that its dying out is the most certain way to national disintegration and death, for only a nation with a soul is immortal. A nation without a soul is no nation at all, and has therefore no future either.</block>

<p>Sir, if we want to discuss economic matters, I can discuss them with you. Here you have <i>Tegniek.</i> I quote (translation): &#x201C;New upsurge expected&#x2014;Budget arouses optimism.&#x201D; They say that we may expect a growth rate of 5 per cent to 6 per cent this year. But what do we have from the Opposition&#x003F; While we are asking for life for our people, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition makes this pitiful performance.</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa will never be the same after Brakpan. February, 23rd, will go down in history.</block>

<p>Now, you must hear what this person wrote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A change of Government would, of course, change every aspect of South African life. The United Party estimated it would take it at least three sessions of Parliament to repeal all the restrictive laws passed by the Nationalist Government since 1948.</block>

<p>They must still tell us which &#x201C;restrictive laws&#x201D; they are going to repeal. But that is not what I want to spend time on. Listen to this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There will be an upheaval in the Civil Service. The United Party is on record as saying that it would rid the Government of all Broederbonders; about 4 000 of them are firmly entrenched in virtually all the top jobs in the Civil Service.</block>

<p>Now, you must hear what they have to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One of the first problems we will have to deal with will be pollution, a United <span class="col_5155-5156" refersTo="page_1041"/>Party M.P. said this week. Can you imagine all the secret documents burnt in Pretoria and Cape Town that night when the Nationalist Government falls out&#x003F;</block>

<p>Sir, what does that mean&#x003F; There are people who, according to those hon. members, will be kicked out of the &#x201C;top jobs&#x201D; in the Civil Service, when they come into power. These are Afrikaners. (Interjections.] These are decent ordinary Afrikaner people for whom they have no time at all, and whom they do not care about in the least. They do not mind saying that when they come into power, they are going to put those people out in the street. They talk about the Bantu and the Indians who have to be given work, but in respect of my people, my Afrikaner people, they say that they will put 4 000 of them out of their jobs; it makes no difference what becomes of their wives and children. Sir, I think it is a disgrace to adopt that kind of attitude. [Interjections.] Sir, I shall continue to quote from this passage&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The future of Afrikaans concerns doing extensive business with the Government will be bleak indeed when the Nats are toppled. <i>Die Transvaler,</i> the party&#x2019;s official mouthpiece in the Transvaal, makes only a small profit as a newspaper; its backbone is the school books and Government printing contracts, and when the Nationalist Government is toppled, they will have a bleak future indeed &#x2026; <i>Afrikaanse Pers</i> has a R2 million printing contract for telephone directories, and <i>Nasionale Pers</i> and its subsidiaries have also made hundreds of thousands of rands from prescribed books since the Nationalists came into power.</block>

<p>Then they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa will never be the same after February 23rd.</block>

<p>In other words they say openly in this Sunday newspaper that those Afrikaans business concerns will be dealt with in this way by the United Party when it comes into power.</p>

<p>&#x2026; it is quite clear that hon. members on the other side of the House are back to the tactics which they employed in the Budget debate. The hon. <span class="col_5157-5158" refersTo="page_1042"/>member who has just sat down started by saying, &#x201C;We have had a whole week,&#x201D; and then he stopped; he was going to say, &#x201C;&#x2026; a whole week to discuss financial matters&#x201D;, and then suddenly the realization percolated into his brain that we had had only one day to discuss financial matters before the hon. the Minister of Labour turned the debate into a real &#x201C;skiet en donder&#x201D; one. Sir, as far as I am concerned, we will stick to the matter that really concerns the people of South Africa, economics, and not Oudtshoorn, which will be dead duck by Thursday evening.</p>

<p>Sir, I have listened here now to two speeches, one by the hon. the Prime Minister and one by the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education, and I ask myself what either of these speeches has contributed to the well-being of South Africa, and regretfully I have to say that they have contributed nothing whatsoever. The hon. the Prime Minister indulged in long historical surveys, going back to 1948 and going back to what Brakpan used to be, but he showed no concern for the present in South Africa and, what is worse, not only did he show no concern for the present, but he gave no thought whatsoever to the future. He praised the hon. the Minister of Finance, but as the Minister of Finance is not in the House I will leave this and deal with it under the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Vote. He then went on to say that conditions in the world were bad generally and that the hon. the Minister had produced this wonderful Budget in conditions which were bad here, as in the rest of the world. It is true that conditions throughout the world are not good, but we have told hon. members on that side of the House time and again that we are a young, developing country and that the conditions which apply to the older and well-established countries in the world do not apply in South Africa, and that if we had utilized all our resources of men and materials, we would have placed ourselves in a position to resist the onslaught from without. Instead of that, what happened&#x003F; As soon as things went sour overseas, we were completely pregnable; we could not stand up to the onslaught from without and before we knew what had happened we had to devalue. That is what the Government did to this country, and it is no good their going to the public and saying that devaluation is a wonderful thing. Devaluation is a step that you take as a last resort, and every economist knows it. The hon. the Prime Minister said that everybody had accepted this Budget of the hon. the Minister of Finance as something quite remarkable and quite outstanding and quite wonderful. Sir, what did the public really say&#x003F; They said that the hon. the Minister of Finance&#x2014;and I am giving the best construction that was placed on the Budget&#x2014; had acted as best he could within the scope of what he was able to do within the context of Nationalist Party politics. That is all he did. He did not come with a Budget that meant something to the country. He tried to flex his muscles as much as he could within the chains to which he has been bound during the past 11 years that I have been in this House. Sir, what is the question that everybody asks after they have given this faint praise&#x003F; They ask: Is it enough; will it do the trick; are things going to be better&#x003F;</p>

<p>Sir, my hon. leader dealt with certain vital economic issues and asked for certain answers. Our complaint against the Budget and the hon. the Minister of Finance is that he said much but told us little. Regretfully I have to say the same of the hon. the Prime Minister this afternoon. On the 29th of last month, until the 1st March, there was a meeting in Cape Town of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Economic Advisory Council. Following this meeting the Prime Minister issued his usual statement. This statement summed up the economic position of the country and assessed the immediate future in the following words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To sum up, it may be said that the Council is of the opinion that there are factors in the economy which are favourable to a renewed upsurge, although the problem areas indicated will continue to demand the attention of all parties. The situation undoubtedly calls for circumspection in the formulation of economic policy, but there is no reason why the South African economy should not soon show a satisfactory rate of growth again.</block>

<p>Sir, what does all this mean&#x003F; Is this a clear-cut, positive, dynamic statement of policy by the hon. the Prime Minister&#x003F; It is the same kind of verbiage that we had from the hon. the Minister of Finance &#x2014;words, words, words which are completely meaningless, which are absolute mumbo-jumbo. But there is one thing in this statement which is correct, Sir, and that is where it says on page 5&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_5159-5160" refersTo="page_1043"/>The Council noted with concern that industrial production did not perform satisfactorily during 1971.</block>

<p>This must have come as a great shock to the hon. the Prime Minister, because it was his hon. Minister of Finance who, looking at South Africa and its economy through his rose-coloured glasses, had been making optimistic statement after optimistic statement throughout 1971, until the truth became apparent to him when he had to prepare his own Budget and found that he had a deficit, which I still say amounted to R131.4 million. It is no good the hon. the Minister telling us that he had a balance of R72 million odd to begin with. Any industrial or financial company that goes to its shareholders and says, &#x201C;We have had an enormous loss this year, but don&#x2019;t worry, we have some reserves and everything is fine&#x201D;, would soon hear from its shareholder. Sir, 1971 has come and 1971 has gone, but what about 1972&#x003F; What did the hon. the Prime Minister say about 1972&#x003F; He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Council is agreed that South Africa could, with the necessary judicious economic policy, experience a moderate acceleration of growth rate during 1972, which could be the beginning of a new phase of a higher long-term rate of economic growth for the country.</block>

<p>Sir, what does this mean&#x003F;</p>

<p>We have asked the hon. the Minister of Finance, and now the hon. the Prime Minister, time and time again: &#x201C;What is your projected growth rate for 1972; what does a moderate acceleration mean&#x003F;&#x201D;. The growth rate in 1971 was 3,7 per cent; in 1970 it was 4,8 per cent. The projected growth rate for 1970 to 1975 of the Economic Development Programme is 5,5 per cent. In both 1970 and 1971 we have fallen behind the requirements of the Economic Development Programme. What we want to know from the hon. the Prime Minister, because the hon. the Minister of Finance will not tell us, is what his growth rate projection is for 1972. What is his projection in monetary terms, and what is his projection in real terms&#x003F; Perhaps we can get an answer from the hon. the Prime Minister to a question which I have asked the hon. the Minister of Finance five times and to which we cannot get an answer from him, and that is what he estimates the rate of inflation is going to be. By what percentage is the cost of living going to rise this year&#x003F; Sir, the public is entitled to know. We cannot work in the dark. The object of the hon. the Prime Minister is growth coupled with an acceptable rate of inflation. Sir, that is an object with which we agree but, for the benefit of the hon. the Minister of Finance, we do not want stagflation with a high rate of inflation and a low rate of growth. We want heating up of the economy to ensure a growth, with a cooling down of inflation by removing the factors that make for inflation; and that is what the hon. the Minister did not understand when he asked us about our hot policy and our cold policy&#x2014;hot for development and cold for inflation. Sir, what are the limits within which the private sector has to work&#x003F; Nobody tells us. There is no indication whatsoever from any source whatsoever as to what the projections are for 1972. What are we to aim at&#x003F; What are the objectives; what is the programme to attain these objectives&#x003F; Are we to wander around in a vacuum of ignorance&#x003F; The businessman, the entrepreneur, the financier, is supposed to sit behind his desk and plan to help the hon. the Prime Minister to increase the growth rate in this country and he wants to know what the limits are, what the guidelines are, what the boundaries are and where we are going. Not in one single word uttered by the hon. the Prime Minister or by the Minister of Finance can we find the answers. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>The hon. member, who has just resumed his seat, is resolved to continue the debate in connection with financial matters, but undoubtedly to his disadvantage. Notwithstanding all the optimism prevailing outside, the Opposition is now adopting a pessimistic tone, and I want to accuse them of doing this in a cool and calculating manner. If we look at the sad tidings we have heard from that side of the House since 1968, we find the following pattern: In February, 1968, the United Party issued notes for its speakers. I have a copy here in my hand, and they advised their speakers to concentrate on the &#x201C;White labour shortage, <span class="col_5161-5162" refersTo="page_1044"/>housing, pensions and grievances&#x201D;. That was in February, 1968, and after 1968 we had that tremendous upsurge in our economy, which they now want to use to their advantage. Again we find ourselves on the threshold of such an upsurge, and again we have these calculated sad tidings, which I say are intended to create a spirit of pessimism outside, and probably it is also being done with a view to canvassing a few votes at Oudtshoorn. I can say more about these notes that were compiled by a very intelligent and cunning person. Initially I thought it was the hon. member for Hillbrow, but to our amazement we later discovered it was the hon. member for Yeoville who compiled them. But I want to come to a much more serious matter than this one. I say that here there is calculated and cold-blooded action being taken to create a general spirit that can adversely affect the country&#x2019;s economy. I say that this borders on economic sabotage. Let us now look at the speech of the hon. the Deputy Minister, who has just resumed his seat. They asked for proof that the United Party are Afrikaner-haters. In my hand I have the minutes, the Hansard, of the debates and the Natal Provincial Council proceedings of November, 1971.</p>

<p>The hon. member, whose provincial councillor this is, may put up his hand meanwhile and say whether he agrees with him or not The provincial councillor, Mr. Waterson, was then speaking in support of a motion in connection with National Party policy, and after he had discussed the entire spectrum of National Party policy, he came to the following statement, and this deals with nothing but the various policies of the National Party. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But because of the actions of this Government the Afrikaans-speaking people are getting a bad name internationally.</block>

<p>We know which Press is causing that. But now he continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Now if their statements are justified &#x2026;</block>

<p>He is referring to Ministers who made responsible statements in connection with the danger on our borders, and he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Now if their statements are justified, and not just trying to rally the people to the cause, or whatever it may be, but if their feelings are justified then I say Mr. Chairman, unequivocally that these people are acting utterly irresponsibly. They know that their policies are driving us to a situation which we may not be able to contain, and if these changes are not made quickly and this blood is shed that the Ministers keep on telling us is going to be shed&#x2014;and remember that in the last month or so at least three Ministers have come out with this sort of blood-and-thunder stuff&#x2014;then I would say, Mr. Chairman, that certain of these Cabinet Ministers, knowing that they have created this situation &#x2026;</block>

<p>Remember, they caused the situation on the borders&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; knowing that they have driven this country into a situation of bloodshed, they may have to answer as criminals against the State of South Africa. After this last war, Mr. Chairman, there were courts to deal with criminals against humanity. And the time may come when certain of these Ministers who are driving this country into the bloodshed they keep talking about, may have to answer.</block>

<p>Now I want to engage in a discussion with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, even though I am a backbencher, I believe in democracy. If the hon. the Leader of the Opposition believes that in this country we fight matters out at the polling-booth, and if the hon. Opposition believes that in this country we rule by way of majority decisions of this Parliament, they must not only put this provincial councillor in his place, but they must get up and apologize to us for having had something like this in mind. Anxiety and suspicion crept into my mind about this matter being discussed in Natal. Mr. Waterson is a member of the Executive Committee. In all probability he would be taken up in the Cabinet if the Opposition came into power. It may safely be said that they would not have enough talent in the House and that they would consequently have to bring in people from outside. Our question to them now is whether this will <span class="col_5163-5164" refersTo="page_1045"/>take place within a month or two of the election. I want to ask this of the hon. member for Turffontein, who is sitting there with his head bowed and who speaks on behalf of the youth of South Africa. He must tell us whether this is what he is going to do with his fellow-Afrikaners. Does he endorse this&#x003F;</p>

We would very much like to be pleasantly surprised as far as this matter is concerned.</p>

<p>How is this matter presented abroad&#x003F; The debate that took place in the Natal Provincial Council enjoyed very wide publicity. For example, <i>The Friend</i> of 19th November of last year reported this debate. <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 21st November of last year also reported it. They reported what Mr. Trevor Walmer said in connection with the Broederbond. I think it is definitely the hon. member for Orange Grove&#x2019;s Broederbond, because he speaks so much about it. I shall quote from the report in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i>: &#x201C;Mr. Trevor Walmer warned that the country was heading for a dictatorship. Describing the Broederbond as &#x2018;an evil pressure group&#x2019; &#x2026;&#x201D;. So he continues. Immediately afterwards Mr. Derek Waterson&#x2019;s threat&#x2014;this N�remburg idea&#x2014;was reported. They hereby create the impression that that specific segment of Afrikaans cultural life will be eradicated and destroyed. That is the implication it embodies. If that is the case, the question immediately arises: What about all the dedicated public servants who have helped to implement this policy&#x003F; Is the Opposition also going to do a &#x2018;N�remburg&#x2019; on them&#x003F; What about all our academics and students who are dedicated people&#x003F; I want to ask the hon. member for Durban North whether he agrees with this. He must tell us what they plan to do about this. Do they agree with the statements of the provincial councillor or not&#x003F; The hon. member for Durban North is also a legal man. He knows that one does not abuse the courts in a country that is ruled democratically. What is the hon. member&#x2019;s answer&#x003F; Now he sits there!

<p>The Prime Minister replied, and I shall say something about that in a moment. Immediately after the hon. the Prime Minister had replied, it was, as far as the hon. members on the opposite side were concerned, the end of the debate on the most important problem which South Africa faces at the moment, i.e. the vicissitudes of our people under a Government which is unfit to manage South Africa&#x2019;s economic affairs. They are running away from it because they simply dare not enter into a point-blank confrontation with the United Party in a debate on the economic conditions in South Africa and on the economic misdeeds of the Government. They dare not give us a hearing on what is happening to the income of the man in the street, to the rising cost of living, to inflation, on how the savings of <span class="col_5165-5166" refersTo="page_1046"/>our people are being eroded by inflation and how the rand is being ruined by inflation. They do not want to touch upon those matters. He has my sympathy, because I do not think he can do better. The hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education and the hon. member for Primrose, are pushed forward to revert immediately to stories about racial hatred, language injustices and I do not know what else&#x2014;everything with the object of inciting the feelings of the people and of playing with the emotions of people in the hope that they will forget what is really being inflicted upon them by an incompetent Government. I do not want to speak about these matters, because at the moment we are engaged in more important matters. However, to the face of the hon. the Prime Minister, whom I know to be a fair man&#x2014; I know he is a strong man and a hard debater, but fundamentally he is a fair man &#x2014;about the extreme lengths to which the propaganda of the Nationalist Party is going in order to stir up these stories about racial hatred. The hon. the Minister of Defence started it and then all the small fry followed suit. Here I have this morning&#x2019;s <i>Transvaler,</i> which carries one of the most flagrant and most untruthful reports I have ever read about the Parliament of South Africa and its members.</p>

<p>Dr. Fisher, the hon. member for Rosettenville. Such is the ignorance. Here the Chief Whip on the United Party side is mentioned, a person who was given a testimonial the other day by the Chief Whip on that side of the House, a testimonial to the effect that they speak Afrikaans to each other. But <i>Die Transvaler</i> does not take any notice of that. I do not have the time to mention all of them, but my friend sitting next to me here, the hon. member for Transkei, is also mentioned in <i>Die Transvaler.</i> At every session so far the hon. member has made speeches in good Afrikaans in this House. He has already done so this session. He is held up <span class="col_5167-5168" refersTo="page_1047"/>as a unilingual English-speaking member in this Parliament. The hon. member for Durban North is also mentioned here. He is a person who has often spoken Afrikaans in this House. Mr. J. J. J. Scholtz of <i>Die Burger</i> paid tribute in one of his articles to Mr. Mitchell&#x2019;s use of Afrikaans in this House. An ex-Senator. Mr. Paul Sauer, got up and congratulated him on the Afrikaans he used in the Senate. But <i>Die Transvaler</i> sends out into our country the report that he is a unilingual person, that he is a Afrikaner-hater, that he does not want to speak Afrikaans. Then there is the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District. He is an ex-public servant who, under Nationalist Party Government, received promotion time and again after having passed the language tests. He is probably the only member of this House who has a certificate of bilingualism signed by the late Dr. Verwoerd. But <i>Die Transvaler</i> says he is not bilingual, he is an Afrikaner-hater and he cannot speak Afrikaans. And so I could go on. Let me mention another one. They mention my friend the hon. member for Walmer. He comes from Graaff-Reinet. They say he is not bilingual. In my view the most beautiful and the purest Afrikaans is spoken in the Karoo. And here we have a person who speaks Karoo Afrikaans like a Karoo farmer. He is one of the most bilingual men in this House. But <i>Die Transvaler</i> does not hesitate to send out the report that he cannot speak Afrikaans and is therefore an Afrikaner-hater. What are politics in South Africa coming to if the propaganda of the Nationalist Party descends to as low a level as this, if such downright lies, such unverified, uncontrolled lies are sent out into the world purely with the object of gaining a few votes at Oudtshoorn by exploiting racial hatred&#x003F; This is disgraceful.</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>No, not in Committee.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the hon. the Prime Minister just for a moment. His speech was an important one, because he obviously sat down thinking what matters the hon. the Leader of the Opposition might raise. Then he prepared a speech in reply to that. But he could not anticipate everything which my hon. Leader would raise. That is why he made certain statements which are irrelevant and which, with all due respect, are not true. For example, he said that the Budget met with general approval on the part of the businessmen or South Africa, and that we had not quoted any criticism of the Budget. But that was not necessary. The criticism of the Budget was expressed 10 days before the debate started. We came forward with our own criticism, which was well-founded and substantial. [Interjections.] Hon. members on the opposite side may as well laugh. I happen to have here one or two articles written on the Budget. Why did the Prime Minister not refer to them&#x003F; Why did he not refer to the fact that the people in the motor industry had complained strongly that this Budget was going to do the motor industry no end of harm&#x003F; Why did he not quote the letters and statements in the newspapers to the effect that the man in the street was getting nothing out of this Budget&#x003F; I have several of them. Why did he not quote the criticism of the labour policy of the Government, criticism which came from various interested parties&#x003F; There is, for example the following one:</p>

<block name="quote">A warning that South Africa may have been pushed into an almost irreversible inflationary spiral by the Budget unless the Minister of Finance, Dr. Diederichs, puts am end to ideological restrictions on the use of African labour, is given by the Chairman of Union Acceptances.</block>

<p>It goes on in this vein. This is well-founded criticism, the same criticism as that of the United Party, but the hon. the Prime Minister wants to pretend that there has been no criticism of the Budget and that it has been generally accepted. Then, to the astonishment of every person who knows the history of South Africa, the hon. the Prime Minister came forward with a wild assertion which is entirely unfounded.</p>

<p>I can speak English and I shall speak English when it is convenient. Everyone knows that I am bilingual and that I can speak English. The hon. member for Yeoville stood up here with a very finely demure face and said he wanted to protest against the blatant racialism that allegedly came from hon. members on this side of the House last week. On the eve of the Oudtshoorn election, and before 1975, I want to protest about the false idea the United Party and the English Press gave the country about the debate that took place in this House last week. It was not a debate about racism. National Party members only brought to the fore the Opposition&#x2019;s attitude to the Afrikaner and to the heritage of the Afrikaner in South Africa. They cannot mention one instance where the National Party has deviated one iota from the course it has designated from its earliest days in respect of unity in South Africa, the heritage of the English-speaking community or anything else. The National Party has revealed the United Party as being Boer haters, people who have not made a single contribution to national unity and the development of national unity and White unity over the past ten years. I am also disappointed about another aspect.</p>

<p>I want to record my disappointment at the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, not only on behalf of the people in the public gallery today, but also on behalf of the South African people generally, about the pace he tried to set in this debate today. It is unheard of that economic affairs be discussed under the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote. Why is the United Party today harping on economic affairs&#x003F; Last week they could have spoken about economic affairs the whole week. Today we are interested in matters such as relations politics, a burning question in South Africa today. We want to speak about that. About policy matters and the weighing up of one policy against another&#x2014;that is why the public gallery here was full at quarter-past-two this afternoon. At the moment, however, it is half full again.</p>

<p>Before my time is up, I want to dwell on the hon. member for Yeoville again for a moment. The United Party men do three things in politics. They either run away from a debating point, as they are doing today, they accuse the National Party of racism or they lay claim to the National Party&#x2019;s implementing United Party policy. Last week the hon. member for Yeoville again appropriated the outgoing policy of the National Party for the United Party men. He said that as far back as 17th January, 1929, in the Phoenix Hotel, Gen. Smuts explained the outgoing policy the National Party is now appropriating for itself. Let us just look at what Gen. Smuts said.</p>

<p>&#x2014;</p>

<p>&#x2026; so that one day we may have a British Confederation of Africa states, a great African Dominion stretching unbroken throughout Africa. That is the cardinal point in my policy. We shall not work for South Africa alone &#x2026;</p>

<p><span class="col_5171-5172" refersTo="page_1049"/>Do you still say &#x201C;hear, hear&#x201D;!</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; but we shall be a friend of our fellow African states and shall work for a united British Africa. When the South African Party comes into power again, it will do its best to foster that spirit of co-operation and brotherliness which will in the end lead to this great African Federation of States. The term &#x201C;South Africa&#x201D; will surely one day be dropped from our national vocabulary and there will be a united British Africa.</block>

<p>Now I just want to tell the Opposition, they call themselves &#x201C;South Africans&#x201D;. I call myself an Afrikaner. If this holistic Smuts idea were perhaps realized in future, what would they be then&#x003F; Would they then still be &#x201C;South Africans&#x201D;, in the big &#x201C;United British Africa&#x201D; where the term &#x201C;South Africa&#x201D; would have been &#x201C;dropped&#x201D; from the vocabulary of South Africa&#x003F; I see the hon. member for Yeoville is giving instructions for silence. They must probably not reply to me in the debate. They must probably continue with economic arguments. That is what they must speak about. In contrast the National Party has never, in its relations politics, ever thought of a &#x201C;British Africa&#x201D;: it has not thought of a &#x201C;British South Africa&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The National Party recognizes the autonomy and the right to self-determination, even of the smallest people, not only in Africa, but in South Africa, where everyone can have an identity of his own. Is that what comes to the fore in the United Party&#x2019;s idea for South Africa and Africa&#x003F; No, because they are still thinking in terms of the Smuts idiom, of a &#x201C;United British Africa&#x201D;, in which there would have been no room for any &#x201C;South African&#x201D;. There would not have been any room for the hon. member for Yeoville if he were still to call himself a &#x201C;South African&#x201D;. In contrast there is room in the National Party&#x2019;s politics, in our idea of multi-nationality, for a Xhosa with his own identity, an Afrikaner with his own identity, and in Africa for a Ghanaian and a Malawian with their own identities. But that party opposite thinks in terms of a conglomerate without identity, national heritage or anything that can inspire and summon up action and pride for a fatherland.</p>

<p>No, one does not necessarily agree in 1972 that the circumstances of 1929 should still prevail today. It does not make sense. But what I do want to say to that hon. member is that if Gen. Smuts&#x2019; vision were a success and such a federation of states had existed, we in South Africa would, in view of what has happened since then, have had circumstances today in which the outward policy which the Prime Minister is trying to pursue now, would have been an accomplished, successful policy. There would have been a federation of states in Southern Africa, in which South Africa would have been the leading state. The point I made at the time, and which I want to repeat here, is that it took my friends opposite 40 years to find out that Gen. Smuts&#x2019; view was the right one and then to try to echo him and imitate him.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, reproach, that he could have made such a statement, as a statement of fact, that at the time of the change of government in South Africa after the war, the United Party allegedly did not have any confidence in South Africa as an industrial country. He based this on one isolated little incident, namely the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Why did the Prime Minister not give some thought to the matter before saying that&#x003F; Why did he not remember that it was that Government which established the Industrial Development Corporation for South Africa in order to make capital available, not for State enterprises, as is the case today with many of the projects of that corporation, but in order to enable the citizens of South Africa financially to establish industries in South Africa; a policy which was carried out with great success&#x003F; Why did he not mention that it was the United Party of Gen. Smuts which established the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research for South Africa, a <span class="col_5173-5174" refersTo="page_1050"/>council which did a vast amount of good work at the time and still is doing so as regards research for the purpose of developing our industries on a sound and scientific basis&#x003F; Why did he not mention that it was that Government of Smuts which established the Bureau of Standards for South Africa, that he had so much confidence in our industries, that he wanted to ensure that the standard of our products could compete with that of the world&#x003F;</p>

<p>I could mention other examples. Why did the Prime Minister not first think that it was that Government which introduced the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act for our industries, which placed the Unemployment Insurance Act in the Statute Book and which modernized the Shops and Offices Act with a view to the development of the manufacturing industry in South Africa&#x003F; Why did the hon. the Prime Minister not think of the fact that in the almost 25 years during which the Nationalist Party has been in power, it has not placed on the Statute Book one new idea for our industrial development which can compare with one of these Acts&#x003F; Because the hon. the Prime Minister made such a wild statement, I now challenge him in all courtesy to rise and mention to us one new Act of similar significance to the industrial development of South Africa which has been placed on the Statute Book during the past 25 years. And I am not referring to a bit of patchwork here and there and the changing of titles of United Party Acts&#x2014;I am referring to a new idea, a new concept, a new imaginative Act, such as the establishment of the Industrial Development Corporation, to show that they have confidence in the industrial future of South Africa.</p>

<p>All that has happened, is that because of the tremendous encouragement which was given to industrial development as a result of our war effort and the effect of Acts and measures such as those I mentioned, the Nationalists were able to build on the philosophy, the endeavour and insight of the United Party, with a limited degree of success. If one pauses to think for one moment what South Africa&#x2019;s position could have been today in the industrial sphere, were it not for the restrictive shortsighted, ideological restrictions which this Government imposed on our industrial development, it takes one&#x2019;s breath away. In the Johannesburg-Pretoria-Vereeniging triangle, on the Witwatersrand, there are people today who are very keen to expand industries, but they are being restricted by the shortsighted labour policy of this Government, a policy which is so wrong that with every Budget we get very feeble steps on the part of the Minister of Finance to get away from his own policy.</p>

<p>Once again he has come forward with a statement of policy to the effect that where industries wanted to establish branches in the border areas or where they work in shifts, he would allow them to use more Bantu labour in the cities. But why has he said that&#x003F; Because my Leader is correct in saying that the power and the means for implementing any policy in South Africa, including the policy of the Nationalist Party, for the solution of our race problems, are created in the White industrial areas of South Africa. Their restriction of industries in the White areas of South Africa contradicts and impedes the implementation of their own policy. Just as correct and sound as the United Party&#x2019;s insight was, so wrong, shortsighted and un-South African are the actions of the Nationalist Party. Mr. Speaker, my hon. Leader put questions to the Prime Minister in regard to labour.</p>

Here we have the contradictions : On 15th February this year the Minister of Labour made a statement in the Senate on the training of labour, and this is the crux of his speech.

Does this mean the Western Cape&#x003F; Will the Coloureds now be given special opportunities in the Western Cape, similar to those the Bantu are going to get in the reserves in terms of the new Bantu Education Act&#x003F; It would be a good thing, but is it his policy&#x003F; What about the Coloureds of the Transvaal; what about the 40 000 or 50 000 Coloureds of Johannesburg&#x003F; Where is their area&#x003F; Where are the Indians going to be trained&#x003F; In Natal&#x003F; In Johannesburg&#x003F; Why is there an area for the Coloureds and an area for the Indians when it suits the Government to evade their responsibility and a clear statement of policy, while there is no area for the Coloureds or the Indians when we come to the crux of the problem of race relations in South Africa&#x003F; We hear such a great deal about relations politics. If the Government believes, as it said here, that these people should be trained in their own areas, why do the Prime Minister, his newspapers and everybody deny that areas of their own can exist in South Africa for these people&#x003F; Is that not a contradiction&#x003F; Will the Minister clarify it for us&#x003F; Sir, we must realize one thing. It does not matter what policy South Africa is going to accept eventually for the solution of its race problems. Whether it is the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy, the United Party&#x2019;s policy or the Progressive Party&#x2019;s policy, its success will depend on how rapidly we can raise the standards of living of all our people in South Africa.

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just sat down really vented his spleen about <i>Die Transvaler,</i> a short time ago. Now I should like to ask him also to look, for a change, at the newspapers which are their mouthpieces. The United Party mouthpiece with the largest circulation, the <i>Sunday Times,</i> reeks in its very being of hate and venom directed against the Afrikaner and Afrikaner institutions. That is why it uses Afrikaner institutions to stir up suspicion and doubt among the Afrikaner people, mainly for the purpose of presenting the hon. the Prime Minister in an unfavourable light. The propaganda must be prepared in a subtle way, in order to cause questions of suspicion and doubt to arise concerning, amongst other things, the competence of the Prime Minister, his position as leader within the National Party, his authority within his own Cabinet, and the efficiency of his administration, to mention just a few examples.</p>

<p>One of the most unpleasant and objectionable attacks on the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s leadership within the National Party and his indisputable authority within the Government came from the <i>Sunday Times</i> last Sunday. The purpose is clear, Sir. Suspicion and doubt must be created in the minds of the Nationalists concerning the hon. the Prime Minister as a figure of power, which is What he really is in these times of crisis &#x2026;</p>

<p>Sir, the <i>Sunday Times</i> does not tell its readers that as a result of the threats of terrorism on its borders, the U.N. pressure about South-West Africa, the world pressure about a variety of aspects, the onslaughts of sabotage in our midst and threats of communism, South Africa finds itself in the most difficult circumstances in which it has ever been. Sir, neither a Jan Smuts nor a Dr. Malan nor a Dr. Verwoerd had to face these confrontations and their intensity in the way in which the present Prime Minister has to do from day to day. The <i>Sunday Times</i> does not tell its readers that the successful handling by the hon. the Prime Minister of these problems, these confrontations and onslaughts, has shown him to be one of the most competent Prime Ministers South Africa has ever produced &#x2026; [Interjections.] &#x2026; which also benefits and protects the poison pens of the <i>Sunday Times,</i> who would long since have lost the shelter of their offices from where they can continue their work of destruction among the Afrikaner people, had it not been for the safety, the peace and order guaranteed them by these strong and calculated actions of our present Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Instead of drawing the attention of their readers to these facts, the <i>Sunday Times</i> came along last Sunday and pictured the hon. the Prime Minister as a powerless and flustered pawn in the hands of a good colleague who shares the back benches with me, merely on the grounds of a so-called position within an Afrikaner cultural organization awarded him by the <i>Sunday Times,</i> for which I would in any case have respected him if it had been true.</p>

<p>The <i>Sunday Times</i> now places this good colleague of mine in a position of authority over the hon. the Prime Minister, who submits to it weakly and helplessly, according to what the <i>Sunday Times</i> wishes to imply to its readers. This is how it is put&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Although a mere backbencher of only three months standing in Parliament, he will now from his seat be watching the Prime Minister, Mr. Vorster, to see how he implements the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s new strategy of &#x201C;back to Afrikaner identity and exclusiveness&#x201D;. It should be interesting to see how Mr. Vorster will perform under the watchful eye of Dr. Treurnicht.</block>

<p>Sir, I have never seen as humiliating a position as that in which the <i>Sunday Times</i> wants to place the Prime Minister in the eyes of his people, but the people of South Africa know, the Opposition knows, and even the enemies of South Africa know, and that is why I find it surprising that the <i>Sunday Times</i> does not know that when it comes to matters and actions and decisions dealing with the safety and the welfare of this country and its people, to whom he is an inspired leader, the hon. the Prime Minister does not allow himself to be pushed around by anybody within or outside this House, no matter what his position within or outside the party and no matter how much esteem and regard he deserves as a result of that position.</p>

<p>I do not want to devote much attention to the hon. member, as he has apparently declared war on the <i>Sunday Times</i> and it is not my duty to defend the <i>Sunday Times.</i> He seemed to be very concerned about the position of the hon. the Prime Minister and he is now acting in his defence. But I think the Prime Minister can get someone better to do that. At the same time he is dragging in this &#x201C;cultural organization&#x201D; again, but I want to ask him just one question about this &#x201C;cultural organization&#x201D; If they devote themselves to culture, why is it necessary for them to have secret telephones&#x003F; Actually I want to return to several points made by the hon. the Prime Minister. In his response to my hon. Leader&#x2019;s introductory speech on this Vote he was very indignant about the assertion by my hon. leader that the development of our standard of living was lagging behind in comparison with certain countries of the world, and he asked, &#x201C;Where is your proof&#x003F;&#x201D; But to my knowledge the specific statistics now repeated by my hon leader have been quoted by us five times during this session. The Reserve Bank recently indicated that during the decade of the sixties, which is held up to us as one of the most prosperous periods in our economic history, our <i>per capita</i> growth was 2,4 per cent a year, which was lower than that of Britain; it was half of that of the common market countries of Europe and a quarter of that of Japan. What more does the hon. the Prime Minister require by way of proof&#x003F;</p>

<p>Then he went further and read out to us how our Budgets had increased since 1948. What did the hon. the Prime Minister hope to prove by that&#x003F; It may mean, after all, that more and more money had been wasted. But any economic student in his first year knows, after all, that in the growth process of a country there is an S-type curve and that after you have passed the initial stage, a country grows more quickly. This is inherent in the economic process. So what does the hon. the Prime Minister expect&#x003F; He also reads out to us long lists of wage increases, of what the wages were in 1948 and what they are now. This indicates, after all, that the hon. the Prime Minister really does not know what is involved. You cannot take a wage of 1948 and adjust it to the buying power of the rand and then compare it with wages today. If you want to make that sort of comparison, you must compare it with your national revenue and with your gross domestic product. But in any case, inherent in what the hon. the Prime Minister says is the idea that people will just have to be content to remain where they were a quarter of a century ago. It is universally accepted by trade unions all over the world that people may expect their standard of living to rise by at least 2,5 per cent a year. Now I ask the hon. the Prime Minister to take those figures of 1948 again and to make the necessary adjustments to the buying power of the rand; he must add 2,5 per cent a year on a compound basis and then he will see that the position of these people has not improved; it has deteriorated since 1948. His whole argument was that wages had increased. But, Sir, this is the case all over the world. He is trying to indicate that it is thanks to our good Government that wages have increased, but I can assure the hon. the Prime Minister that wages have increased in all the communist countries as well. Am I to conclude from that that they also have such good governments&#x003F; No, that sort of argument does not get us anywhere.</p>

<p>My hon. Leader indicated that there is this income gap, the wage gap, and he tried to indicate that this is a gap through which the communists may get in. I should like to return to that, because the hon. the Prime Minister also expressed himself on this matter earlier on in this session and the Minister of the Interior used very strong language in regard to this matter. In the No-Confidence debate earlier this year the hon. the Prime Minister expressed himself as follows. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As far as the gap is concerned, it is the declared policy of the Government to narrow that gap, which is an historical <span class="col_5181-5182" refersTo="page_1054"/>one. We have stated this on various occasions.</block>

<p>Then he went on and said that his Government was committed in regard to the matter. But what we find so surprising is that within his own speech, after having stated his standpoint so strongly and saying that his Government was committed in regard to this matter, he announced that the average wages of White workers had increased fourfold and those of non-Whites had increased threefold since 1948. If arithmetic means anything, if figures indicate anything, then the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s own figures indicate that the gap has not narrowed but widened. Here, then, we have another typical example of the Government which always has a policy; it has a fixed policy on every matter you can think of, but in practice and in reality it works in precisely the opposite direction. What is the use of having such a policy if it cannot be implemented&#x003F; The indications are there that this gap is steadily widening. One can quote many statistics to prove this. I may just mention that in 1948 the average wages for Bantu in the production and construction section was 25 per cent of the average wages of the Whites. At the present moment the wages of the Bantu are down to 17 per cent of those of the Whites. In other words, where the ratio used to be one as against four, it is now one as against six. So the position is deteriorating. The Government is moving further and further away from its policy, and why do we have this position&#x003F; It is because of the policy of the Government itself, because if you introduce job reservation and implement the Physical Planning Act, what are you doing&#x003F; You are placing an artificial ceiling on the economic development of the non-Whites and keeping down their wages, but at the same time you are creating an artificial shortage of White workers. This means that their wages are artificially increased&#x2014; not that they benefit by it, because as a result of inflation their own standard of living shows only a minimal improvement, and in that way the gap keeps widening. Now we ask the hon. the Prime Minister what he is going to do about this. He has now indicated his policy to us, but he is making no provision for the training of these people. When we talk about training the hon. the Prime Minister speaks of the shortage of high schools which existed in Brakpan 25 years ago. Every indication and every projection suggests that by 1980 we will need one million additional non-White workers for skilled labour of a more specialized nature. Where are they going to come from&#x003F; What steps is the Government taking in order to train them&#x003F;</p>

<p>As regards school education, it is true that three million Bantu are attending school at the moment. But as the hon. member for Johannesburg North indicated the other day, 70 per cent of them do not go beyond Std. 2. Only 4 per cent of them receive secondary or more advanced training and only a third of 1 per cent receive vocational training or attend technical high schools. How is the Government ever going to eliminate this gap if they set about it in the way referred to by the hon. the Prime Minister&#x003F; We have grown tired of all these promises and statements of policy by the Government. This House and South Africa now want to know what positive steps the hon. the Prime Minister is going to take to eliminate this gap.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Chairman, there is another important issue. Recently, in addressing the Sakekamer in Cape Town, the hon. the Prime Minister told them that some of them were trying to develop a psychosis of discontent. He referred particularly to what he called &#x201C;fair-weather Afrikaners&#x201D; and &#x201C;other South Africans&#x201D;. I find the distinction he draws most interesting in view of the kind of discussion we have had recently. Apparently Afrikaners, and certainly &#x201C;fair weather&#x201D; Afrikaners, are not South Africans. Be that as it may, he then indicated that these people were asking for more labour and concessions. These are his words as reported in the local Press:</p>

<block name="quote">They are propagating something which will lead to the creation of a social welfare State in South Africa.</block>

<p>This is a very important pronouncement by the hon. the Prime Minister. He is now trying to indicate that South Africans want a social welfare State, while at the same time suggesting that his Government is implacably opposed to it. These, again, are not the facts of the situation. They work in directly the opposite direction. We have today a state of socialism in South Africa &#x2026; [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just spoken of socialism should listen to the Deputy Leader of his side of the House, the hon. member for <span class="col_5183-5184" refersTo="page_1055"/>Yeoville. Because the hon. member for Yeoville has told the voters in Oudtshoorn that it is the United Party&#x2019;s policy to give every man in South Africa a pension under a national participation pension scheme. He said that even Mr. Harry Oppenheimer would draw a pension under their Government, but he would have to pay in more than he would get out of it. This is the sort of absurdity which hon. members on that side of the House spread in the country in order to draw votes. When the hon. member who has just spoken comes along with these stories of his we are not impressed. The election in Oudtshoorn takes place tomorrow; what is said here today will no longer have any effect on it. The moment of truth for all time has come for that side of the House. For too long they and certain newspapers which support them have conducted a campaign of mud-slinging directed against leading Afrikaners, trying to humiliate them and stirring up suspicions about them in the minds of the general public. They are doing this on advice received from experts from America. [Interjections.] Yes, we know what we are talking about. I want to tell the hon. members that where the moment of truth has now come and they have been challenged by members on this side of the House, such as the hon. the Minister of Labour and the hon. the Minister of Defence, they should not complain.

<p>The hon. member must not ask me who wrote it. If they take exception to the fact that we say that there are elements&#x2014;and I am not saying that it is always the case in the outside world, but I am referring to this House&#x2014; in the United Party side who have no respect for the Afrikaner and his institutions, they must bear in mind that we are only saying what has already been said by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. He is the man who first said that there is no place for an Afrikaner in the United Party. Our memory is not so short, after all. On 2nd June, 1960, Mr. Christopher Kavannagh wrote an article about the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. It appeared in the <i>Cape Argus.</i> He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_5185-5186" refersTo="page_1056"/>I asked him : &#x201C;Why did you leave the United Party&#x003F;&#x201D;</block>

<p>That was way back in 1949.</p>

<block name="quote">He replied: &#x201C;I believe in the national unity of English and Afrikaans-speaking people. I still do. That is what National Union is working for, but you would not believe me what the attitude towards Afrikaans and Afrikaans institutions was in the United Party in those days.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Then the hon. member went on and told how he had walked into one of his own party&#x2019;s offices&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I greeted the man in Afrikaans. He said : &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t talk that language here in this office&#x201D;.</block>

<p>But that is not all. I want to read out to hon. members what was written by a person who is not an Afrikaner, but an editor of one of the newspapers which support hon. members opposite, Mr. Gerald Shaw, who wrote in the <i>Cape Times</i> on 21st June, 1969&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Historically the United Party was a party of the British and Commonwealth connection. This provided the underlying ethos; so the advent of the Republic left the party in something of a psychological vacuum. Perhaps this is because so many United Party speeches on the theme of national unity still seem to suggest that the real South African nationhood must necessarily mean the disappearance of a distinct Afrikaans identity.</block>

<p>That is also the theme of the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town, who said that he would give up his Afrikanerhood. The writer went on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Perhaps this is what the United Party requires more than anything else, just at present; a truly compelling vision of a South African nationhood. Could the United Party then not try to restore to non-Nationalist South Africans some sense of belonging in their own country&#x003F;</block>

<p>I want to issue a challenge today to hon. members on that side of the House. Every hon. member in the House must be able to speak both official languages. When I say that, I do not expect every South African to be able to speak both official languages.</p>

<p>because circumstances may be difficult. But the moment a man becomes active in public life it is as important for him to be able to speak both official languages as it is for a diplomat to learn the language of the country in which he is going to live.</p>

Now I want to say at once that we in South Africa can afford many things, but there are several things which we cannot afford. One of them is that we cannot afford hatred to prevail between English- and Afrikaans-speaking people in South Africa. Secondly, we cannot afford hatred to prevail between Whites and non-Whites. Thirdly, we cannot afford feeling to be aroused between town-dwellers and country-dwellers. In other words, I want to make the statement that no matter how important other things may be&#x2014;at a later stage I shall come back to the economic aspects mentioned here&#x2014;it is and remains a fact that in a country such as South Africa the question of relations is of cardinal importance. If there are political parties and if there are individuals that are stirring up feeling between the two language groups, they must be pointed out.</p>

<p>If the blame lies with my side of the House, with my party, those members must be pointed out. If the blame lies with members opposite, they must be pointed out. If it lies with the Afrikaans-language newspapers, we must say so, and if it lies with the English-language newspapers, we must say so too. As far as I am concerned, I have been pointing this out ever since the first day I took over this office, in the very first speech I made. I am in earnest, and I challenge any member on that side of the House to point out any act committed by me over the past years since 1966 and before that as a Minister, which was calculated to stir up feeling between Afrikaans and English-speaking people. If the hon. member for Yeoville or any other person wants to point a finger at me in that regard, I challenge him to do so. With me it was not merely a question of words. I have shown by way of actions, and so has my party, what our attitude is in this regard. I did not hesitate to use strong language in public, as I did in Heilbron because there were people who wanted to take away English language rights. I did not hesitate to join my colleagues in taking a strong stand against Dr. Hertzog and his people who wanted to violate the English language rights in South Africa. I stated my point of view in respect of English-speaking South Africa in the presence of several members on the other side of this House on the occasion of the laying of the foundation-stone of the monument to the 1820 Settlers. In that regard we have taken an unshakeable stand. During the course of the last elections I said, and I want to repeat it in this House today&#x2014;and this is also my reply to the accusation made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition&#x2014;that even if I had known that no single English-speaking person voted for the National Party, I would still take the stand as I had stated it in this House. My concern is not with whether or not people vote for one; my concern is with the principle which one has to accept in that regard. This is what I said and this is what I did. I want to tell the Leader of the Opposition that what we want from him is not words. I have stated my point of view on co-operation, and he has stated his. However, in this regard we do not want words only. We want actions. We want respect for each other&#x2019;s language.</p>

<p>I shall come to the report in <i>Die Transvaler</i> in a moment. In fact, I am still coming to many things which will embarrass the hon. member. I made an appeal to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, but he did not even condescend to reply. I made an appeal to the hon. member for South Coast, courteously across the floor of this House, but he did not even condescend to give me a reply to it. How often have I not asked the Leader of the Opposition to join me in making an appeal to our people to respect each other&#x2019;s language in practice, in making an appeal to people to the effect that language incidents of this kind, where a person refuses to serve another person or speak to him in his language, should not take place&#x003F; And yet the Leader of the Opposition had the audacity to level the reproach across the floor of this House, and the hon. member for Yeoville indirectly associated himself with it, that we were stirring up racial hatred. I think we may now, because I said that we could not afford hatred being nourished between White and White and between White and non-White, very profitably give our attention to this matter. The actions of the leadership of the United Party create that position between White and White. The newspapers which support it, are helping with a lavish hand in that regard. The hon. member for Yeoville and other hon. members may tell me now, &#x201C;Yes, these are merely the accusations you are levelling against us, but we are levelling the same accusations against you.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has just done so. Now. I do not want us to debate this matter on the basis of the attitude I adopt or the word I give, because I see the hon. Opposition before me from the outside and they see my party from the outside. If we want to have a fruitful discussion on this matter now, I think it is fair, and that the hon. member for Yeoville will grant me this, that we hear the evidence in this regard as to who is guilty of this matter, and call in a person who knows both parties well, who knows the inner workings of both parties. He is a person who is fond of putting himself on the pedestal of an &#x201C;elderly statesman&#x201D;, a person who is fond of lecturing to us on how we should speak the truth, on how we should not make exaggerated statements, and a person who is regarded by the English Press as a crown prince on that side. I am referring here to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. Now let me say at once that in respect of this question, namely who is responsible for arousing racial hatred in South Africa between White and non-White&#x2014; which I want to condemn with all the power at my command&#x2014;I am prepared to acquiesce in the judgment not of my side of the House, but to stand and to fall by the judgment of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout.

<block name="quote">Before concluding &#x2026;</block>

<p>So said the hon. member for Bezuidenhout&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; I just want to say this: I regret that in the short debate we have just had, we again had the same type of language used by the Opposition as we had since last year and right through all the recent debates. The hon. the Minister of Finance quite correctly said that we are now accustomed to it. It is a striking feature that right through the history of South Africa one finds that same hate, the same expressions of horror and suspicion against the Afrikaner. Since his earliest existence the Afrikaner has been stigmatized as a breaker of the law, a dictator and an immoral person.</block>

<p>Then he went on to quote what Gen. Smuts had said in this regard. Continuing, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That is nothing new to this side of the House. Even today, if one watches the Press of the United Party, the English Press, what language does one find being used there&#x003F; It is the sort of language one finds in <i>White Man Boss,</i> and the language one finds in <i>After Smuts&#x2014;what then&#x003F;</i> and the sort of language one finds in <i>In Face of Fear, Twilight in South Africa,</i> and the type of language one finds in books of the calibre of <i>Mistaken Land.</i> The fact is &#x2026;</block>

<p>I want hon. members to note that, and particularly the hon. member for Yeoville&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The fact is that the United Party today makes itself guilty of those extravagances, not only as regards the Nationalist Party but in regard to Afrikanerdom (because in effect the Nationalist Party is not only a party; it is a national movement embracing 80 per cent of the Afrikaans-speaking people in the country).</block>

<p>&#x2020;This is what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said. Then he went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I say that the fact that the United Party makes itself guilty to such a degree of that sort of thing is the best proof to me that the United Party has become the successor to that imperialism which through all the years was responsible for the feeling of hostility against the Afrikaners in South Africa. I want to state that the Opposition in adopting this course, is taking a tremendous responsibility upon itself. They are today engendering racial hatred in the country and inciting the English-speaking people against the Afrikaans-speaking people.</block>

<block name="quote">They are today engendering racial hatred in the country and inciting English-speaking people against the Afrikaans-speaking people, which will delay good relations between the races for 20 or 30 years in this country. But it is fortunate that the Government, the Nationalist Party, is not doing the same from its side. They know the Nationalist Party and ought to know that if this side of the House wants to start inciting&#x2014;and it has an enormous quantity of ammunition with which to do it&#x2014;the Afrikaners against the English-speaking people, the attempts of that side of the House will look like playing with dolls and like the work of amateurs in comparison. It is fortunate that this side of the House withholds itself from that course of causing a cleavage almost forever between the language groups in the country.</block>

<p>And then my hon. friend the hon. member for Yeoville, Mr. Marais Steyn, made an interjection; he said, &#x201C;oh;&#x201D;. After he had made that interjection, according to Hansard, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout went on to say&#x2014;</p>

But this party continually finds, in everything it does, that English-speaking people are being roused against it. I could confirm this to you in so many ways. We may just as well take this example, and I simply picked it at random while going through my files in this regard.

But while we are on that point, I want to state it very clearly here that on numerous occasions the accusation was levelled against us, and the hon. member for Yeoville was one of those who did so, especially at the time of the referendum, that we did not want to establish a Republic for the reasons for which we said we wanted it. No, allegedly we only wanted a Republic here in order that we might interfere with the rights of the English-speaking people. That accusation was levelled against us, and now I state here categorically that this Government has now been in power for 24 years and that in those 24 years there has been no interference with the rights of English-speaking people, and I stand here fully realizing my responsibility as the leader of this party, and I am telling the hon. member for South Coast that I shall not allow anybody to interfere with the rights of English-speaking people as long as I am in charge of this Government.</p>

I have no reason to feel confident that if the United Party came into power, the rights of Afrikaners would be safe in South Africa.

There are two official languages and each man is entitled <span class="col_5205-5206" refersTo="page_1066"/>to use whichever language he chooses. Therefore any member in this House is entitled to use whatever language he likes, whenever he likes. The fact that he uses that language is no insult to the other language group.

He was disqualified because he did not have the necessary qualifications. Was he bilingual&#x003F; Did the Prime Minister veto him is a candidate&#x003F; What about Senator Peterson, who was elected as a Senator in Natal&#x003F; Was he bilingual&#x003F; Let us draw a veil over that sort of thing. We want to build South Africa together. I believe that when a man comes up for Cabinet rank he should be bilingual. I believe he should be able to serve the people of both races in their own language. I agree with the Prime Minister. What else does he want&#x003F; How else must a man be a good South African other than vote for the Nationalist Party&#x003F; That is what we want to know. The tragedy is that as a result of the activities of this hon. Minister of Defence, he has caused a bitterness in South Africa which is going to take years for the Nationalist Party to live down, despite what I accept as the genuine attempts by the hon. the Prime Minister. The hon. gentleman said that the time has come for us to put an end to incidents of this kind. I accept that. Let us put an end to incidents of that kind. Will he talk to the Minister of Defence; will he talk to the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions and will he talk to the Minister of Mines&#x003F; I will assure him that people on my side of the House will show respect for both languages and both language groups as we do at every single one of our congresses where there is infinitely more Afrikaans and English spoken on the basis of nearly 50/50, than ever happens in their congresses. This happens time and time again. One must look to the body of the party. Take the percentage of English speaking in their party and the percentage of Afrikaans speaking in our party. You will then find that Afrikaans- and English-speaking persons in this Party are very nearly fifty-fifty. I give the assurance that since I have been leader of this party there has never been one incident between English speaking and Afrikaans speaking in the ranks of the United Party.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, how did this debate originate; what gave rise to this afternoon&#x2019;s debate&#x003F; Nothing more than the demanding of their primary rights, within and outside this House, by Afrikaners. Nothing more, and nothing less, than the fact that the Afrikaner asks that he be respected and that his rights be respected. The hon. member of the Opposition wants to dismiss the matter with the words &#x201C;stupid propaganda-making&#x201D;. He says that it is &#x201C;stupid propaganda-making&#x201D; if this side of the House asks that the Afrikaner be respected. I want to associate myself with what the hon. the Prime Minister stated so very effectively here. Sir, every previous leader of the National Party may be quoted on his standpoint in respect of this matter. Every single leader of the National Party has on some occasion or other expressed an opinion on this particular matter. <span class="col_5207-5208" refersTo="page_1067"/>Gen. Hertzog began by doing so when he was still speaking Dutch, in the old days. At the first opportunity he had expressed an opinion on this matter as long ago as 1912, but I am not going to quote his words now. I was present on one occasion in the City Hall of Durban, when Dr. Malan was speaking there. He said on that occasion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To the question regarding the direction in which South Africa&#x2019;s safety and happiness lie, there can be but one single and simple answer, which can thus be summarized : First of all there must be a serious and determined effort to consolidate the two White races into a national] unity, not by artificial means, but by the creation of ever more common ground between them. This is only possible on the basis of equal rights ungrudgingly conceded and faithfully applied, as well as full and common participation in our South African nationhood.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to come to what the present Prime Minister said when he was speaking at the Settler Monument. I should like to quote for the record what he said on that occasion. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And today the descendants of the Voortrekkers and the Settlers again, I believe, have come to an understanding, an understanding which flows from the fact that they both accept, not only that the Republic of South Africa is their only home and fatherland, which claims their undivided loyalty and love, but also that there is room for both to work and to live for the fatherland.</block>

<p>Over the years we had the express desire from leaders of that side. What do we find on this side of the House&#x003F; The hon. the Prime Minister said this and it deserves to be emphasized. Because the Afrikaner is insisting on his rights, he is denounced as an inciter of racial hatred by that side of the House. I want to quote from the same source, and the same authority which the hon. the Prime Minister quoted from. I am quoting from Hansard of 5th February, 1953, col. 706. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I do not want to state that every man on that side is un-South African but we have noticed that the ruling spirit on that side is anti-South Africa.</block>

<p>In col. 707 he goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The truth of the matter is that these attacks stem from a dislike of him because he is the man who introduced bilingualism where there was unilingualism in the Defence Force &#x2026;</block>

<p>He was referring to the then Minister of Defence. He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; what was foreign he changed to something South African, and what was red he changed to orange. He gave to the South African Defence Force the uniform, the language and the colour of South Africa. That is why the other side of the House is so hostile towards him.</block>

<p>If you insist on what is your own then you are not accepted by that side of the House; then you are regarded as being a race hater. What did the hon. the Minister of Defence say&#x003F; He replied in this debate to a point of dispute raised by the hon. member for Durban Point. The hon. the Minister said he wanted to know why these hon. members could not also go and address meetings at Oudtshoorn during the by-election there. Then the hon. member for Durban Point attacked him. What did the hon. the Minister of Defence say&#x003F; I challenge any hon. member to tell me where he made an attack on English-speaking persons in South Africa and where he insulted them. Where was he inciting racial hatred in what he said here&#x003F; Sir, we had the problem that we have certain members in this House, such as the member for Zululand&#x2014;whom I cannot call the &#x201C;hon. member for Zululand&#x201D;, but the member for Zululand&#x2014;who rose in this House in the process of this hatred-inciting campaign, and said, &#x201C;Mr. Chairman, death by torture is becoming commonplace in South Africa.&#x201D; That is what the member for Zululand said in this House. On that occasion he implicated South Africa.</p>

If there is anything which stirs up hatred, then it is that attitude. He said this with reference to the Bultfontein case in which the police were involved. If there was ever a hate-fomenting process, then he is the greatest instigator thereof. Sir, have you ever heard more offensive words in this House than those which the hon. member used on that occasion&#x003F; But if we on this side react to that and insist on our rights, then we are told that we are stirring up and instigating hatred. [Interjection.] I shall repeat it for the hon. member if he did not hear what I said. I quoted what he had said from Hansard. I stated that he had said : &#x201C;Death by torture is becoming commonplace in South Africa&#x201D;. I hope it has penetrated to him now. It seems to me as if he has problems, and cannot hear what I am saying to him.

<p>Let me tell the hon. the Prime Minister immediately that my attitude in this Parliament has always been that what has been said has been said. I do not think that he or any <span class="col_5211-5212" refersTo="page_1069"/>other member will find me running away from anything I have said at any time. What is more, it does not worry me either that quotations are made from speeches that are on record and which reflect one&#x2019;s considered and honest opinion of the situation at that time. If the hon. the Prime Minister thinks that he is embarrassing me with that, he must simply keep on thinking so. I can assure him that that is not the case. Sir, I was a member of the United Party in the days when fusion took place under Gen. Hertzog, and let me say&#x2014;I have said it in this House before&#x2014;that it was the best party which South Africa has ever had; that was probably the happiest time in the political history of South Africa. I am very glad that I already had the opportunity to be interested in politics in those days. We all know that when the war broke out, a very sharp and bitter division occurred. My own feelings were on the side of Gen. Hertzog as a leader and a person; but I was strongly anti-imperialist, and on the grounds of my opposition to Nazi imperialism I supported Gen. Smuts. I was against all forms of imperialism&#x2014;communist imperialism, British imperialism, Nazi imperialism. I was against all forms of imperialism and I still am today, and if my country is threatened by a form of imperialism, I will fight it.</p>

I asked then whether we should now read out here everything that was said against the Jews. I could read it out; it is the easiest thing in the world; we can implicate the Prime Minister in it and we can go <span class="col_5213-5214" refersTo="page_1070"/>into all those things that also caused bitterness amongst the English-speaking people. But, Sir, I would be dishonest if I should get up here today and say that the Nationalist Party still thinks so. That would be quite dishonest, and I think it is totally unfair of the Prime Minister to accept that what a man said 20 years ago about a situation in a party, automatically still applies.

Is there one man on that side who would tell me that the Nationalist Party has not drastically changed its views on national unity, on the language question and on the Jews&#x003F; They have changed, and the United Party has also undergone changes under different leaders. Sir, I have been sitting as an M.P. on this side under the present leadership for the past ten years. I would definitely not have been sitting here if the situation which applied during the war years still applied in this party today. I would not have been sitting here, and if my word is not taken for it, I could quote anything which any of those members, from the Prime Minister to the Minister of Community Development, in the National Party said 20 or 30 years ago, and then I am entitled to say it still applies to that party. No, I may say that in the years I have been sitting in Parliament on this side of the House, in each case where the interests of the Afrikaans-speaking people were concerned, whether it concerned universities that were to be established or any other matter&#x2014;there was the fullest co-operation from the English-speaking people in this party; and in many cases, let me say, where, for example, the establishment of an Afrikaans university or the real cultural interests of the Afrikaner were concerned, it was men such as those sitting immediately behind me, men such as the hon. member for Durban North and the hon. member for Musgrave, who often came forward most strongly and joined me in supporting the promotion of these matters.

<p>I want to add this, that I do not know of anybody who is in his right mind and who objects to the principle of bilingualism. There is certainly no such person on this side of the House. As regards the principle of equal treatment of the two languages in the public sector, I may say that it is firmly established in South Africa and I do not know of anybody who is threatening it, except the section that broke away from that party and pretend to be the real Nationalists today. But now a campaign is suddenly started which really has nothing to do with the interests of the two language groups, but which has everything to do with the interests of the party opposite. And now a terrible injustice is suddenly being done to the Afrikaans language. Sir, my point of view has always been that a person who goes into public life must either be bilingual or make himself bilingual and from that point of view I will not diverge &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hartzenberg">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. HARTZENBERG</person>:</from>

<p>I am very pleased that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout admitted, after he had been challenged by the hon. the Prime Minister, that he had, in fact, spoken the truth in 1952 when he said that the United Party discriminates against Afrikaners, and I say that the hon. member, in saying that, implied that the hon. member for Durban Point did not speak the truth today when he said that this was not the case in 1952. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout today gave the hon. member for Durban Point the lie in this House. The second point I want to mention is the following. When the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said in 1952 that this was the case in the United Party, it was denied just as vehemently by those hon. members as they are doing today and as it was denied by the hon. member for Durban Point today. I am asking you now, Sir, if they denied it in 1952 and if they are still denying it today, what guarantee do we have for believing that their denial means anything today&#x003F; I want to quote somebody else who has belonged to several parties in South Africa. Since the Prime Minister said that that member was in the National Party initially and saw the United Party from the outside and that he was subsequently in the United Party and therefore saw both parties from the outside, I just want to say that this member now belongs to the United Party once more, and I wonder whether he <span class="col_5215-5216" refersTo="page_1071"/>is able to see them objectively now. I want to quote Mr. Serfontein&#x2019;s article which appeared in the <i>Sunday Times</i> on Sunday. He made precisely the same statement the hon. member for Bezuidenhout had made in 1952. He said that this was still the case in South Africa and that it is surprising that there are not 1 000 language incidents in South Africa every day on account of discrimination against the Afrikaner. The hon. member said that he had spoken 20 years ago, but he did not speak 20 years ago and then stopped speaking. In the <i>Cape Argus</i> of 2nd June, 1960, he adopted the same standpoint, and that was eight years later. This question is one of the most important questions in the history of South Africa, and I now want to tell hon. members that the hon. member proved today that the attitude of the United Party is to discriminate against the Afrikaner. Since he adopted that standpoint in 1960 we have had no evidence from the United Party to prove that they have changed their attitude; on the contrary, we have had evidence that this is still their attitude. In order to put this matter in its true perspective I should like to quote briefly to hon. members from two speeches made by two South Africans. The first quotation comes from a speech made by President Steyn at the National Convention. In that speech he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<p>No, wait a minute, you are afraid of those things. I want to quote to hon. members the standpoint President Steyn adopted in 1908 and 1909. He said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But, gentlemen, we may just as well leave the work undone, leave as it is, unless we try at the same time to unite or re-unite the two White races of South Africa. If we do not do that we shall not achieve unification in the true sense of the word. This is not an impossible task. Look at the two races. They lived together for a whole century and yet remained divided. Something must have been wrong. We must resolve to place the two races on an absolutely equal footing in the Constitution. If we are not going to do that, we may just as well not tackle the rest of the work. There can be no unity without equality. As long as one race feels that it has to occupy a position subservient to that of the other the feeling of being treated unjustly will remain, and this feeling will form a barrier between these two races. I have said that the two races agree on most issues. Language constitutes the major exception. In this respect there has to be absolute equality in Parliament, in the law courts, schools, public service, everywhere&#x2014;in other words, Dutch must be the official language of South Africa together with English. Gentlemen, we ask this not as a favour, but as our right. Our language has lost its official character solely as a result of force. We had to yield to force. The Constitution we are in the proses of drafting now will be our own doing and nobody can expect us to place our language and our nation in a subservient position. If we were to do that, our people would never approve of it and instead of unifying South Africa, we would be dividing her even further.</block>

<p>I now want to make the point that the difference between the Afrikaners in that party and Afrikaners such as President Steyn is the following : President Steyn delivered a passionate plea for unity to the National Convention but he insisted on his rights as an Afrikaner, and those Afrikaners of that party say that they are relinquishing their Afrikanership. They do not insist on their rights in that respect. [Interjections.] I now want to go further and say that the difference between the English-speaking hon. members on that side and Dr. Jameson is the following: When the Afrikaner in the person of President Steyn rose to plead for his rights, he was magnanimous enough to admit that he did not comprehend the situation and therefore conceded that President Steyn was right. The only policy we have from members of that party and from the leader of that party, is the policy of those Afrikaans-speaking people who say that they have to relinquish their Afrikanership. Not one of them rose to say that that was not the policy of the United Party. I suggest that the United Party are using those Afrikaners. Jameson happened to be a Sir and once again there is a Sir in that party. I want to say that he is using those Afrikaners in his party to do things he is not prepared to do himself. The Afrikaner rose in the person of President Steyn and demanded his rights, and those rights were granted. I will accept that the United Party is honest when it says that its policy is what it is when the leader of that party rises and says that those members who, on behalf of the United Party, say that they have to relinquish their Afrikanership, are wrong and that it is his policy that the Afrikaner has the right to fight for his rights. He must call those people to order when they continue vehemently to attack, smear and insult Afrikaner organizations as much as they can.</p>

In view of what that hon. member said the other day, one has to accept that he is also ashamed of President Steyn and what he did at he National Convention. When one considers the past of this English-speaking person, Sir Jameson, he cannot be regarded as a South African who was inspired by a mighty spirit of South Africa first.

<p>Mr. Chairman, it was quite interesting to hear what the hon. member read to us. It seems to me that it has slipped his mind that the late President Steyn was the first chairman of the old South African Party. [Interjections.] He has also forgotten that President Steyn&#x2019;s son was a Cabinet Minister under Gen. Smuts and that he remained in that party until his death, and that his grandson is one of the regional chairmen of the United Party. And yet the allegation has been made that the Afrikaner in the United Party is asked to give up something. I want to put it quite clearly that we are asking no one to give up any part of his Afrikanerhood or of his rights as an English-speaking person. The only thing he has to realize is that he gains something additional, and that is to become a real South African under the United Party. [Interjections.] The hon. the Prime Minister was still saying that he wanted to test the United Party against its actions. He referred to the Executive Committee in Natal.</p>

<p>It is interesting to hear this from the ex-Administrator now. After all, he was the one who got up in that provincial council and said of the Executive Committee, consisting of three English-speaking people and one Afrikaans-speaking person, that it was the best Executive Committee in South Africa.</p>

<p>Yes, that is accepted. He regularly makes speeches in Afrikaans. Last week he delivered a speech in Afrikaans to the Tugela River Development Association. But what is more, he obtained a certificate as a result of a course he had again followed recently, and he was congratulated on the degree of bilingualism he had achieved. Then there is the fourth member of the Executive Committee, Mr. Watterson, who is an immigrant. He was urged to see to it that he becomes bilingual as soon as possible. I am able to tell hon. members that he attends an Afrikaans language laboratory and that the progress he has made in such a short time is quite amazing. I do not have the slightest doubt &#x2026;</p>

<p>I do not have the slightest doubt that within a very short space of time he will be able to address Afrikaans-speaking people in their own language.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister requests further proof. The majority of the United Party supporters in Natal are English-speaking. Does the hon. gentleman know who, <i>inter alia,</i> were elected by them as senators&#x003F; They elected senators from the Free State such as Wolfie Swart and Herman Oelrich.</p>

<p>They did not elect a United Party man from their own province; they elected these senators from outside their province in order to give representation to the Afrikaans-speaking United Party supporters in the Free State.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister alleges that he has appealed to me to join him in appealing to the people to respect each other&#x2019;s language. I know of only one time when the hon. gentleman did this, and I agreed with him. I gladly address such an appeal to both sections to respect each other&#x2019;s language rights.</p>

<p>It seems to me I am making progress; now the Prime Minister agrees. I do not hang my head in shame to any man for my conduct towards the two language groups in South Africa. The hon. the Prime Minister quoted here what was said by this man or by that man. Must I quote to him what was said by Mr. Stirton, who joined the Nationalist Party in Natal and was a member of its executive&#x003F; Must I quote what was said by Mr. Jones, who was a member of the Nationalist Party in Natal&#x003F; Must I quote what was said by Mr. Ivor Benson, i.e. that there was no warm spot in the ranks of the Nationalist Party for an English-speaking person&#x003F; We can continue in that vein, but what purpose does it serve to come along with stories of that kind&#x003F; Does the hon. the Prime Minister want national unity in South Africa, or does he not&#x003F; Since South Africa is being threatened from outside, has the time arrived when he ought to put national unity above almost all else in South Africa, or has it not&#x003F; I am asking the hon. the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>What has been this party&#x2019;s whole policy right from the start&#x003F; It is a party that has stood for national unity and equal treatment for the languages of both groups.</p>

<p>I wish it were true that I did control the English-language Press. The hon. the Minister of Transport is chairman of a large Press group and some other members of the Cabinet are members of the boards of directors of certain Afrikaans-language newspapers in South Africa. It would have been a wonderful thing to me to control the English-language Press in South Africa. I would teach them how to fight the Nationalist Party and how to protect and respect, the rights of both groups in South Africa in the proper way.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think I must put the record straight immediately. I never for one moment said that the hon. gentleman controlled the English Press. That is what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said.</p>

<p>Yes, of course I am right. The hon. gentlemen does not control the English Press; the English Press controls him. Seeing that the hon. member has made that admission, I will not say anything further about this matter but will give him a chance to finish his speech.</p>

<p>Dr. G. F. JACOBS; Mr. Chairman, before I proceed I just want to say something on this issue. The hon. the Prime Minister says that he wants deeds and not words, but I want to ask him just one question. If national unity is so meaningful to him, and I accept his good faith in this regard, why does he not permit us to have bilingual schools&#x003F; Why has that party artificially separated all our children at school&#x003F; How can we ever acquire the measure of bilingualism we are seeking to get if our children are artificially separated at school&#x003F;</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. member a question&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>No, you can reply later. Earlier in the day I raised the question of the wage gap with the hon. the Prime Minister. I pointed out to him that the policy of his party as stated by him specifically was that the wage gap must be closed. I gave him facts and figures; in fact, I quoted his own words to show that that gap is in fact widening. The hon. the Prime Minister today spoke for an hour and a half, but he has not yet given us an answer to that particular issue. We would like to think that he will do so tomorrow.</p>

<p>The second issue I tried to raise is that the hon. the Prime Minister, in addressing the Sakekamer earlier this year, indicated that fair-weather Afrikaners and other South Africans were propagating something that would lead to the creation of a social welfare state in South Africa. What I am trying to suggest is that it is not these gentlemen who want Socialism in South Africa, but that it is established fact. We have galloping socialism; all the insidious aspects of Socialism are there. The trouble is we have not got the welfare side of it. This has a long history. In 1942 certain gentlemen drew up a so-called draft Republican Constitution, and in that particular document, and I gather that certain hon. gentlemen who sit here played a leading role in its drafting, it was said that ultimately the State would have all economic power in its hands. That is precisely our charge; the Government is usurping more and more economic power, and this manifests itself in 101 different ways. There are the giant State enterprises, which operate virtually outside the parameters of jurisdiction of this House, which are not answerable to shareholders and which are getting a bigger and bigger slice of the national economic cake. We have more and more controls. The availability of labour is controlled; the use you can make of labour is controlled; credit is controlled, interest rates are controlled; also where you site your industry. That kind of control to anybody else in the world would suggest Socialism. That is why some of our industrialists and top businessmen are throwing up their arms in despair and are saying, &#x201C;Let us return to the free market mechanism in South Africa&#x201D;. Dr. Hupkes is on record, and I can quote dozens of others who have taken exactly the same line. So we have Socialism in this country; it is an established fact.</p>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p><span class="col_5223-5224" refersTo="page_1075"/>No, I am not interested in questions asked by that hon. member.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I mention only that in 1970 the public sector&#x2019;s share of total investments in South Africa came to 46 per cent. Now, if nearly half the national investment in a country is controlled by the Government, then you have Socialism. From 1960 to 1970 expenditure in the public sector on both capital and loan account grew at the annual rate of 12 per cent. This is three times more than the growth of our GDP. Right at the moment, a quarter of our GDP. is taken up by public spending. If ever you want an example of Socialism, there you have it. As I have indicated we have all the elements of Socialism. There is bureaucratic control. We have more control boards per head of population in South Africa than in any free enterprise system anywhere in the world. We have excessively high taxes. All these factors are indicative of a very considerable degree of Socialism in South Africa. But as I indicated earlier on, the unfortunate part is that in South Africa we do not have the welfare side. We talk about Britain very often as a social welfare state. There a pensioner, irrespective of the colour of his skin and irrespective of a means test, receives R60 per month, which is appreciably more than a pensioner receives in this country. When we talk about White pensioners, that is one thing; but the Black pensioner in this country gets one-seventh of that amount. I think in a country which claims that it is one of the most affluent societies in the world, that is a national disgrace. My charge is that the Prime Minister is wrong. It is not the people who are seeking the establishment of a social welfare state here. We have Socialism, foisted upon us by the Government; but we do not have the compensatory welfare services to go with it.</p>

<p>I want to return to one other issue.</p>

<p>*This concerns the independent Bantu homelands which are now going to come into being; but this is no longer an academic question; this has now become actual. The Government has made promises that they are going to become independent, and now we see Chief Kaizer Matanzima taking up all these promises. Recently, when the hon. Prime Minister had an interview with the periodical <i>To the Point,</i> he indicated very clearly that, as far as he was concerned, &#x201C;if they want to go the way of Moscow or Peking&#x201D;, they could do so.</p>

<p>&#x2020; He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have said it more than once: I should not find it attractive nor wise, but if they want to become left-orientated &#x2026;</block>

<p>We all know what that means to the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; then it is their concern. I should regret it. I should warn them against it but for the rest it is their concern.</block>

<p>This is very explicit what the hon. the Prime Minister had in mind. Obviously they could find there are no limitations. They could establish treaties with communist states. I want to know whether this is Cabinet policy. I wonder whether that has been condoned and approved by the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s caucus. The hon. the Minister of Defence who is, after all, responsible for the defence of South Africa, when talking at Newcastle, as was reported in the <i>Cape Times</i> of the 14th March, 1970, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United Party candidate was telling voters that the independent Bantustans would negotiate with communist countries and form alliances with them. This would never be allowed to happen.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, who is right&#x003F; The hon. the Prime Minister has now repudiated his Minister of Defence on a most serious issue. How could he conceivably keep him in his Cabinet if there is this clash of views on a fundamental question of this kind&#x003F; The hon. the Prime Minister said they could form alliances with communist states; he would virtually wash his hands; he would be unhappy about it, but there was nothing he could do about it. Yet, his Minister of Defence takes a diametrically opposite line. I think the country wants an explanation on this issue too.</p>
