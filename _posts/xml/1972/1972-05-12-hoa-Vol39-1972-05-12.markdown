<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when the debate on this Vote commenced on Wednesday, the hon. member for Durban North discussed the Legodi case. He intimated that not one of us on this side of the House, not one of the legal men here, would be prepared to hold a different view in respect of this matter to the one he himself held. I want to tell him that I differ completely with him and with the hon. member for Houghton. I differ with them because I took the trouble&#x2014;and it was very easy to do so&#x2014;to ascertain the true facts in regard to this matter. I want to tell you immediately, Sir, that the hon. member for Houghton put certain questions in regard to the Legodi case here in this House. If one considers her questions, one sees that those questions were not put with a view to ascertaining facts. Her questions were put with a view to making propaganda against the State of South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton sprang astride the Legodi horse like a Don Quixote, and the hon. member for Durban North, like the faithful old retainer, Sancho Panza, sprang astride the donkey behind, for he was afraid that she would perhaps make a little disclosure which he would not be able to make. He also forgot to do his homework, for if he had done it, he would never&#x2014;I say never&#x2014;have made those statements about the hon. the Minister of Justice in this House which he did in fact make on Wednesday evening. Those two hon. members both made Press statements, on various occasions, in which they furnished distorted facts. But, Sir, their distortions met with a response in the halls of the <i>Sunday Times.</i> I think that one finds the best reflection of the<span class="col_7019-7020" refersTo="page_0464"/> line of thought of hon. members on the opposite side in an article, a disgraceful article, which was written about Ephraim Legodi in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 23rd April.</p>

<p>This article was a leading article, and one consequently assumes that it was written by the editor who is supposed to be a responsible person. His story, in brief, is as follows; and this is the U.P. line of thought; this is the story the U.P. tell in this House, and this was the basis of the attacks the U.P. launched on us in this House on Wednesday evening.The story goes as follows: In November of last year, Mr. Legodi went for a quiet innocent stroll in Johannesburg; a murder was committed before his eyes. Mr. Legodi, this newspaper says, was so public-spirited that he remained standing on that spot and waited for the Police to turn up. The Police then turned up, and took a statement from him. Suddenly, this newspaper claims, Mr. Legodi was a very important witness, and out of gratitude for his behaviour as a loyal citizen of our country, the Police suddenly picked him up and put him in gaol for 129 days, in solitary confinement. The newspaper went on to say that this is a disgrace to the State. Referring to Legodi, this newspaper states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If in his solitude he fell to thinking that he was the victim of a cruel, soulless system that had gone stark, raving mad, who can blame him? Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely.</block>

<p>Sir, I want to tell you that according to the facts of this matter, a person could say: &#x201C;This article corrupts, and this paper corrupts absolutely.&#x201D; Let us consider the facts. I want to furnish as few as possible of the facts. I checked the facts, and this was easily done. But the hon. the Minister will at a later stage furnish the House with the full facts. I just want to point out to you that there are five misrepresentations, five distortions of the truth and incorrect assumptions here, and an absolutely unjustified conclusion.</p>

<p>Sir, the <i>Sunday Times</i> said that in November of last year Mr. Legodi was an eye-witness to a murder. If my hon. friends on the opposite side and the editor of the <i>Sunday Times</i> had taken a little more trouble, they would have found that last year. If he had made further inquiries, he would have discovered that the person concerned had been a man by the name of Mr. John Howell who was strolling innocently along the street, who had then been surrounded by a gang of tsotsis. He was robbed and stabbed to death with a knife, and left there. There was no-one at the scene of the crime subsequently&#x2014; not Legodi, nor anyone else for that matter. Sir, this is supposedly the man who was taking such a leisurely stroll in Johannesburg. He was there; that is correct: but what did he say at the provisional hearing? The record of the provisional hearing is a public document. He said that he was not a member of the gang, although he knew all the people who were there by sight. But they implicated him. They said that not only was he a member of the gang, but that he participated in the murder, and that is why the Police arrested him. Where did the Police arrest him? He did not stand waiting at the scene of the crime, as the <i>Sunday Times</i> states. The Police arrested him in Hammanskraal, three months later, on 17th August; it was then that he was arrested for the first time. But listen to what the <i>Sunday Times</i> has to say about him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He could, of course, have ignored the incident and continued his stroll, and no-one would have been any the wiser.</block>

<p>Do you know what happened, according to Legodi himself? He said that he cleared off after the murder; he went into a darkened cinema. Sir, if a man flees after a murder and runs into a cinema, then he does so with only one object, and that is to mingle as quickly as possibly in the dark with a group of people so that he cannot be identified. This classic article, however, states further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But Mr. Legodi, one must suppose, is a public-spirited citizen. He decided he owed a duty to the State to give evidence, and so he presumably waited at the scene for the Police to arrive and told them his story.</block>

<p>Sir, the story of Legodi was told by other Bantu who were arrested. The other gang members were arrested, and they told the Police that Legodi was one of them, and the Police then arrested Legodi. But, Sir, listen to what this newspaper says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In short, Mr. Ephraim Legodi spent 129 days in solitary confinement, all because he was in a position to give evidence in a criminal case.</block>

<p><span class="col_7021-7022" refersTo="page_0465"/>Do you know what really happened, Sir? At the provisional hearing the public prosecutor realized that he had to get one of these people to testify against his companions so that justice could be done in a case where a White person had been murdered in the streets of Johannesburg. He then asked Legodi whether he would testify for the State against his companions. Legodi agreed, and the Police granted him indemnity. After the indemnity had been granted, Legodi disappeared. He supplied the Police with a false address. He disappeared from the scene completely. They only caught up with him on 17th November in a different place altogether, in Diepkloof. But this article states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; he was kept in solitary confinement, all because he was in a position to give evidence in a criminal case.</block>

<p>No, Sir, he could give evidence in a criminal case; he was an accessory in this case. He gave the Police the false address, and then disappeared completely. When the Police got hold of him and questioned him again, it was quite clear that the other gang members had been working on him, and therefore the Police exercised their rights in terms of section 215, and what did they do? They went to the Attorney-General and requested Legodi&#x2019;s detention in terms of section 215. But hear what this newspaper has to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The record is silent on whether the State made any effort to get in touch with anyone who might be interested, even mildly, in knowing why Mr. Legodi had suddenly, as far as was known, vanished from the face of the earth.</block>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Houghton put a question to the hon. the Minister. She asked whether anyone had been notified in regard to Legodi&#x2019;s detention. This question is on record. A woman, by whom he had had two illegitimate children, was notified. The second part of the reply was that a cousin of his was notified. In fact, that cousin of his brought clothes to him in prison. But hear what this article goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">So this is the kind of place South Africa has become. Solitary confinement without trial is so commonplace that one does not even have to be suspected of committing a crime to qualify for 129 days in solitary confinement.</block>

<p>Sir, this is a misrepresentation of the Act. It is not a case of &#x201C;suspected&#x201D;; the Act provides that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whenever in the opinion of the Attorney-General there is any danger of tampering with &#x2026; any person &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is more than &#x201C;suspect&#x201D;. There must be a danger that such a person will be tampered with. The Attorney-General exercised his discretion in the implementation of his duty, and then this newspaper insinuates that this man had been thrown into gaol for no reason at all. The editor of this newspaper says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If in his solitude he fell to thinking that he was the victim of a cruel and soulless system that had gone stark, raving mad, who can blame him?</block>

<p>Sir, I say that this editor acted in an absolutely irresponsible way. He owes an apology to the thousands of people who read this newspaper and who accepted these stories as facts. I tell you, Sir, I was shocked at this article. If these allegations had been true, it would have been a shocking state of affairs. I say that it is the hon. members on that side who did not do their homework and who echoed here in this House what the <i>Sunday Times</i> had said, who ought to resign, and not the hon. the Minister of Justice.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I was very interested to hear the hon. member for Prinshof in his defence of the State&#x2019;s action in the Legodi case. I am not interested in what the <i>Sunday Times</i> wrote; I have no responsibility for the article in the <i>Sunday Times.</i> What I want to know is why it was that the hon. the Minister, when he was asked questions in this House about Legodi, did not give the correct impression. Why did he not make a statement to the effect that Legodi was not just an innocent witness who happened to pass the scene of the crime? Sir, he made no effort whatsoever to correct the impression which had originally been created, and if conclusions were drawn from the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply in this House, it was his own fault. He had every opportunity to put the matter right; why did he not do so? It is not the asking of questions about the State&#x2019;s actions that gets this country into trouble; it is the answers that hon. Ministers give if they are not accurate. Sir, let me come back to the<span class="col_7023-7024" refersTo="page_0466"/> Legodi case. I did take the trouble, whenI knew that this matter was coming up in the House, to get extracts from the court record. I got the relevant extracts. It is absolutely true to say that the man was not the innocent witness as originally appeared. [Interjections.] Wait a minute!When he originally appeared before the court he was reported as being an innocent witness. Following on that I put questions to the hon. the Minister and he did nothing whatever to dispel the impression that had been created by the original report. But let me now tell this House that although Legodi was originally considered an accomplice, at the preparatory examination the public prosecutor decided that he was not an accomplice and the man made a statement to the Police and he was subsequently called as a witness. I have the judge&#x2019;s statement in the case and I will read it verbatim&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Another witness called for the State was Ephraim Legodi.</block>

<p>I am quoting Mr. Justice Margo&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He was originally regarded as an accomplice when he testified at the preparatory examination, but Mr. McNally(the public prosecutor) in this court, rightly in my view, took the view that he was not an accomplice. According to his evidence he had been arrested origin-ally and charged as a party to the murder and robbery. He had then made a statement to the Police and the charge against him was not pursued, and he was called as a witness in the preparatory examination and in this court to depose for the State.</block>

<p>Now, let us continue and see what use it was to keep this man in solitary confinement for 129 days. I now continue reading what Judge Margo said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">However, he was kept in protective custody under section 215bis of theCode and we were not told why he was so kept in custody.</block>

<p>Not even the judge, Sir, was apparently told. Then he goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">From the outset we have approached his evidence with great caution. It seems obvious that a person who is kept in protective custody in order to testify in due course as a witness, may be vulnerable to the pressure imposed on him by being in custody and may therefore be induced to testify in a manner which he thinks would please his captors.</block>

<p>Now, Sir, what have you got to say about that? I place the onus on the hon. the Minister fairly and squarely for not disclosing the true facts in this case when he answered questions, and I further say that even so, even though he was originally arrested as a suspected accomplice, he later was not an accomplice, and the court decided that they could not accept his evidence for the simple reason that his evidence was suspect because of the circumstances in which this man had been held and he was sent from the court forthwith.</p>

<p>Now I want to say something about the system of keeping people in protective custody in this way. It would have been better for Legodi, in fact, if he had been treated as an accused. It would perhaps even have been better in the long run if he had been sentenced to a short term of imprisonment, because at least as an awaiting trial prisoner, and even as a convicted criminal, he would not have been kept in solitary confinement, and I want to know why all these people are as a matter of course, although the hon. the Minister can make regulations under section 215<i>bis</i> as to the manner in which such people are detained&#x2014;why they are always, it appears, as a matter of practice, kept in solitary confinement. Will the hon. the Minister kindly answer that. As an awaiting trial prisoner, he would have had access to legal advice. He would have been allowed visitors. He would not have been in solitary confinement. He would have had all the privileges of an awaiting trial person, and indeed even as a convicted person. I think this system of keeping these witnesses in solitary confinement is an appalling system and it completely conflicts with the words of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor, the present Prime Minister, who stated, when that particular section was being discussed in the House&#x2014; I have his words here&#x2014;&#x201C;that we will treat these people well and make things easy for them and we will make them as happy as possible&#x201D;. Well, I want to know, if the hon. the Minister and the hon. member for Prinshof and the hon. the Minister of Police, who are all implicated in this, think that they make people as happy as possible by keeping them in solitary confinement until they are finally needed as witnesses?<span class="col_7025-7026" refersTo="page_0467"/> It is not only Legodi who was in this unfortunate circumstance. I got a very frank reply from the hon. the Minister, for the first time, I might say, in all the years that I have been putting questions on this. I heard this year that 25 warrants were issued under section 215<i>bis</i> last year by the Attorney-General, and 12 were issued in the first three months of this year, and a lot of the e witnesses were held because they feared for their safety and it was necessary to protect them. To me it is utterly cynical that they get protected before they give evidence, but who protects them after they have given evidence, when they are surely much more liable to be the victims of vengeance than they are before they have given their evidence Others were taken into protective custody because it was feared that they might abscond, and Legodi was one of those who was taken into protective custody because of the fear that he might abscond. I do not think the hon. member for Prinshof&#x2019;s statement in this House makes the slightest difference to the case. The fact remains that it is true, as I say, that he was not just an innocent witness. All the same, this man who was going to give evidence for the State, was kept in solitary confinement for 129 days, and I want to know where the happy situation comes in which was promised to us by the hon. the Prime Minister when he introduced this clause. I have no apologies to make for originally asking the question, and I believe that the hon. the Minister owes this House an apology for misleading the House in the answers that he gave.</p>

<p>Now I want to ask the hon. the Minister about another matter. At the moment there are 274 banned people in South Africa, or rather that was the position as at 30th June last year, a number of whom are under house arrest, in one form or another. Three new house arrestees had their names tabled this year. I want to know how long ago it was since the hon. the Minister reviewed any of the long-standing cases of banning. There are people who have had five-year bans re-imposed for the second time. I want to know whether the Minister just leaves all these in the hands of the Special Branch, because I want to tell him that I think he ought to take note of the comments of the Appeal Court made in the Dean&#x2019;s case, that none of the persons called as agents of the Special Branch, had been found to be reliable witnesses in regard to any matter which was in dispute. If that is the case as far as the Dean was concerned, how does the Minister know that the Special Branch and the evidence they give should not in fact be in dispute as far as all the people who are banned are concerned. These people are never given an opportunity to defend the charges that have been laid against them. They never even know what the charges are. Does the Minister not think the time has now come for a thorough independent review to be made by a three-man judicial commission or any other form of independent inquiry, despite the fact that the law itself does not lay this down, in order to make sure that there are not among the 274 people at present under restrictions in South Africa, any who are not there by virtue of frivolous or inaccurate or unreliable evidence given to the Minister by the Special Branch. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice_and_of_prisons">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE AND OF PRISONS</person>:</from>

<p>I am really sorry the hon. member for Houghton did not have an opportunity of speaking before the hon. member for Prinshof. I think she would have made a complete fool of herself. But I shall leave it at that for the time being. I am actually rising to reply to the speakers so far, but I think it is desirable that I should, before doing so, say a few things. I should like to say that this debate, under the Vote of the Minister of Justice and of Prisons, ought to take place in a calm atmosphere. I think that this should be the case because whatever one says, one is saying things which affect people who find themselves in some or other unfortunate position. Either they have clashed with the law and have just appeared in court, or they are in prison. I said that I honestly think that that ought to be the correct tone to adopt. I have been here for almost 22 years now, and as far as I can remember, this has always been the case. I am talking about debates under the Votes. This was not the case with debates on the Bills. My predecessor, the present Prime Minister, introduced very drastic legislation, and harsh words were used across this floor. In my time as well drastic measures were piloted through and harsh words uttered. But I say that when we come to the discussion of the Vote, one should be a little careful how one does so and how one puts things. I want to say that during the almost six years I have been here it has been my experience that this was in fact what was done from the opposite side, in the days when the hon. member for the Transkei was the<span class="col_7027-7028" refersTo="page_0468"/> main speaker on the Vote. I cannot imagine, or recall, his ever going out of his way to say things which hurt or caused feelings to run high. I want to say this of the present main speaker: When he originally came here he made quite a favourable impression on me. [Interjections.] I may as well be quite honest now and say that many of my colleagues differed with me, but that was my own impression, and I think I was entitled to it. Subsequently I had the privilege of meeting his wife, and she made an equally favourable impression. She is a friendly and handsome woman. In the beginning things went well, but during the past two years there has been a change of spirit here in this House on the part of the Opposition main speaker on Justice matters. I remember very well what happened last year. At that stage already it had begun to assume a different complexion. Then, on Wednesday evening I experienced what could really happen, and discerned where this whole business is heading. I must say that I can draw no other conclusion but that the speaker behaved himself like a fishwife.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to mention a few terms which were used here to describe the conduct of the Minister to whom this task has been entrusted&#x2014;a very difficult and responsible task. I want to say that the Department of Justice is a difficult department, and the Department of Prisons is not any the less difficult. These are two very, very difficult departments. I think that any person who aspires to occupying this position one day should be careful. I think that apart from the fact that he must to a certain extent have a knowledge of the law he should also have a measure of good manners. I have taken a few extracts from his speech and the words he used were, <i>inter alia,</i> as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is a scandal that he could allow a civil servant to make a statement &#x2026; He has evaded his responsibility as Minister of Justice &#x2026; I think it is absolutely disgraceful.</block>

<p>I am saying this to his hon. Chief Whip who I know feels ashamed, and I know there are other hon. members as well who feel ashamed of this. I need not say who they are. I say that they may as well convey to his hon. Leader that if the hon. member continues to adopt this tone, it is all over between him and me as far as I am concerned.</p>

<p>I shall now reply to the first question put by the hon. member for Durban Point. I am using the word &#x201C;honourable&#x201D; for two reasons only. I am using it, in the first place, because the rules of the House expect it of me, and, in the second place, I am using it out of an ordinary feeling of decency. Those are the only reasons why I am using it. If it were not for this, I would not use it.</p>

<p>I now want to refer to the appointment of magistrates as judges. This is one of the first matters which the hon. member mentioned and in regard to which he used these vehement terms. I want to state how this matter originated, and I also want to sketch the history and background, for the hon. member took it sorely amiss of me for not having reacted.</p>

<p>The whole thing began at Tsumeb. I was privileged to have been called upon, on invitation, to open the magistrates&#x2019; offices at Tsumeb which had been rebuilt, modernized, enlarged and made far more comfortable. I was received in very friendly fashion, but that is by the way, I can mention that there was a very large audience. I was surprised at that. There were Whites and non-Whites, well-dressed. Among other things there was a group of non-White children who sang to us. I found it very interesting, and I appreciated it. I also want to say that I appreciated the arrangements and the conduct of the magistrate there. On that occasion, as one usually does, I made an ordinary speech which was entirely innocent. I said something about the town, and so on, and also something about the magistrate. When I had finished, a gift was handed over to me. The judge president of South-West Africa, Judge President Frans Badenhorst, was the speaker who preceded me. He made a very interesting and long speech. In this speech he pleaded amongst other things that the interests of magistrates should be well looked after. He referred to regional magistrates with the necessary qualifications. That I want to emphasize. He asked that the interests of these people should not be neglected. He said that it had already happened in the past, by way of exception, that officials had in fact been appointed. He then mentioned quite a number of examples. I shall refer to this again in a moment. He went further and said that he felt himself at liberty to raise the matter there for the simple reason that he was not the first person to talk about this matter. He referred to Judge President Beyers and said that he had, on the occasion of a congress of the Law Society of the Cape, at Beaufort West, expressed the idea that attorneys should be taken into consideration. He said, <i>inter alia,</i> that he knew of attorneys who were far better than some of the judges sitting on the Bench. You know, Sir, he states a matter in rather strong terms. Judge President Badenhorst made the speech preceding mine, and when he had finished speaking, I felt that I could not refrain from making any reference to the matter he had broached and that I should really say something in reply to his speech. I shall now tell the House what I said. I think I have a copy of that speech here. With reference to what the judge president said, I commented quite innocently that I noted with appreciation the high regard he had for our regional magistrates. I said that I had personal knowledge of the good work they were doing and of<span class="col_7031-7032" refersTo="page_0470"/> the good qualities they possessed. I also said that I was aware of the legal qualifications which they had. As hon. members may possibly know, they are required to have at least a B.A. LL.B. degree, in exactly the same way as practising advocates, or the Senior Public Service Examination law. I added that it was a matter which ought to receive serious consideration. I said that I hoped it would receive wider publicity, so that the matter could be discussed. I should like to repeat here in this House the precise words I used in concluding, for I think they are rather important. At a subsequent stage I had, upon request, to make what I had said available to the Bar Council. Let me do this all over again. My precise words were as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Judge President touched upon a very interesting subject. I am aware of the good work being done by regional magistrates. I am also aware of the legal qualifications which they possess. I do not want to commit myself in public with reference to the Judge President&#x2019;s plea, but feel that it is an idea which is worth investigating and considering.</block>

<p>I went further and expressed the hope that it would receive wide publicity. Then I said by way of conclusion and, I can almost say, in a humorous vein&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And who knows, since I was the Minister who appointed the first woman to the Bench, it may perhaps still happen that I will also be the first Minister to appoint a magistrate to the Bench as a judge.</block>

<p>Those were my precise words. Let me just tell this story. After this function we were entertained to a mayoral luncheon. From thence I left on a few days holiday. I went to the game reserve and I also went to Oshikati and on to Ruacana. This function took place on a Tuesday, and the following Saturday I was back in Pretoria. Upon my return the week&#x2019;s newspapers were lying there. I was curious to see the newspapers, for I had not heard any news for a week. I was on holiday in the wilderness. It is no use turning on the radio because of the poor reception. Upon my return I found a thick pile of newspapers lying there. I began to page through them. The first newspaper I picked up was the <i>Star</i> of the 21st. Now, all this had happened on the 20th. Let us see what the <i>Star</i> had to say. The headlines in the <i>Star</i> were &#x201C;Legal honours&#x201D;, and it was stated there that the writer conceded that there were certainly magistrates who were better than certain judges. The report went on to read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is no reason why any magistrate should be disqualified from elevation to the judiciary simply because he is a magistrate.</block>

<p>The writer concluded the article by saying that this had not been the practice in the past. He also said that the appointment of advocates &#x201C;was a practice based on principles and it should not be lightly discarded&#x201D;. I have no fault to find with this. So far, so good. But strangely enough, the next newspaper I picked up was the <i>Mercury</i> of the 21st. As I expected, there was Mike Mitchell. But not only was he there, when I looked at the <i>Daily News</i> of the 21st, I saw, yes, there he was again, as large as life. I could see by the very headlines that this was fighting talk. I could see at once where it was leading. I then thought I had better read that report. I then read the following, which was attributed to Mr. Mitchell as being his own words. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This is a frightening thought.</block>

<p>I have already told the House that he always speaks in superlatives. He then said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is a clear indication of the length to which the National Party is prepared to go to manipulate our judges.</block>

<p>In addition, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the Government was allowed to elevate magistrates to the Bench, they would directly or indirectly be able to manipulate judges so that they could carry out the will of the Nationalist Government.</block>

<p>He went further and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government has a very ugly history of meddling with the Constitution &#x2026;</block>

<p>He said further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; that it disliked the independence of the South African judges and would like nothing better than to be able to manipulate the judiciary.</block>

<p><span class="col_7033-7034" refersTo="page_0471"/>That is what the hon. member had said. When I saw it, I thought that what was happening here was really an ugly business. The accusation had been levelled at me that I was going to appoint magistrates and that I was then going to manipulate them. The various Ministers and the Prime Minister could then just tell me in what way I had to manipulate them, and I would then do it. In other words, I had been accused by that hon. member. He said that I was obliged to furnish a reply, and that this House was the place where I should furnish that reply. As an accused I had to furnish the replies. Consequently I told him that I would do so. Because I had thought &#x201C;No, I cannot speak for myself&#x201D;, I waited a while, and then the hon. Justice Eksteen made a speech, I think in East London or Port Elizabeth, before the Law Society there. On that occasion he said various things. Now I want to say that after Mr. Justice Eksteen had delivered his speech before the attorneys in East London recently, I saw that indirectly or directly he was condemning the magistrates as such. Amongst other things he said, and the essence of his argument was. that officials were not independent and that, if the Government should appoint them, they would do what the German judges in Nazi Germany had done. In addition, he also said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They will succumb to pressure to pervert law and justice.</block>

<p>I then thought it is not only Mitchell who is accusing me, but the hon. Justice Eksteen as well; I am in an ugly position here. I thought I had better say nothing, for I could not speak for myself here. And so I said nothing.</p>

<p>The next thing that happened was that the Secretary of my Department, the head of my Department, who is in fact directly responsible, furnished a reply to this, and I shall refer to his statement in a moment. He made it clear that his reply was not concerned with the merits of the appointment of officials as judges, but with the insubs and derogatory remarks the judge had levelled at magistrates and officials of the Department. This was his intention. This is &#x201C;the scandalous thing&#x201D; he did, and which I had supposedly allowed. That is why &#x201C;I should resign as Minister; I am not competent to hold office&#x201D;, and I can quote a whole series of other similar statements.</p>

<p>You will have to reply by apologizing first. If you do not apologize first, I shall not listen to you. I then waited for the secretary to bring me the statement of the judge in question, and I studied it. I also studied the wording of the Press statement made by the Secretary for Justice. I must say that his statement was very controlled and civilized&#x2014;as I have come to know him; the gentleman which he is&#x2014;and I could find no fault with it. But I shall return to that in a moment.</p>

<p>I regarded the unfortunate incident as having been disposed of; I was quite prepared to do that. I thought, let me leave it at that. Now, however, the matter has taken another turn. The hon. member&#x2014; oh I am again saying &#x201C;hon. member&#x201D;&#x2014; the speaker on the other side broached this matter here. He demanded that I give him a reply. I could no longer keep quiet. I told him that I would furnish him with a reply. He compels me to state what my attitude and what my policy here is. I want to be very responsible, and I do not want to make any mistakes. My policy is that I. as responsible Minister, refuse to enter into a controversy in the Press with the Bench or its office holders at any level whatsoever. It is so vitally important that our administration of justice should remain elevated above the squabbles of everyday life that I prefer to endure accusations rather than to say anything or do anything which could tarnish the image of the judiciary or its office-bearers. That is why I said that I would in the interests of our courts have preferred to have forgotten about this unfortunate incident as well, but since I am now being compelled to adopt a standpoint, I shall do so. I must not be blamed for this. If any person is to be blamed, it is the main speaker of the Opposition on Justice matters. My policy further is that it is the task of the judge to administer justice and to officiate. When the judge presides in court and pronounces judgment, the Government and everyone concerned, including myself, accepts that judgment. For some the judgment is sometimes a source of great rejoicing, as happened again recently, and for others the same thing is less pleasant, but this is our<span class="col_7035-7036" refersTo="page_0472"/> system, and that is how I accept it. But judges do not only administer justice; they sometimes make speeches and express opinions on matters which are not their exclusive province. I have no fault to find with that. They probably have every right to air their opinions from public platforms if they so desire. I doubt whether it is always wise for a judge to do so. But in any case, it is their business. I leave it to them to make their choice. One thing I do want to say, however, and I should like the Committee to know this: If they express opinions in regard to matters in public they must sometimes expect to be contradicted. In court it is one thing, there they alone have the say, but outside, all power to speak, so that others are excluded, is not their right. That is my view. So let us understand one another well. If they prefer to make use of public platforms then they do it in the same way as any other person, with the risk of being criticized and contradicted. If they choose to become involved, then they must endure the blows meted out to them.</p>

<p>I studied the hon. Mr. Justice Eksteen&#x2019;s speech, as I said, and as I also said, I would have preferred to have said nothing about it, but I am now being compelled to discuss it. It is my humble opinion that this was a most unfortunate reflection on the independence of our inferior courts, and a reprehensible reflection not only on our practising magistrates but also on a judge who is at present still serving, and on numerous retired judges who were appointed as judges from the Public Service. I say that this is a reflection on them. I am not simply making statements; I saw an advocate&#x2019;s opinion, which was submitted to me, and I may add that this is an advocate outside the Public Service. He is a senior advocate, and I think he can speak with greater authority than the main speaker on Justice on the opposite side. It is very clear from this advocate&#x2019;s opinion that the judge made certain slanderous allegations. Then I want to add: It is also clear to me that his facts are not always correct. What was the essence of his argument? The essence of his argument was that officials do not have a background of fearless independence; that they simply do not have. As he put it, the danger is that if they are appointed as judges, they will succumb to pressure and pervert law and justice. That is the implication. Now, our magistrates are officials. If they, when they are freed of the Public Service yoke, and when they are elevated to the office of judges, cannot then be fearlessly independent and will then continue to succumb to what the Government wants, and apparently to what the Minister of Justice and perhaps the head of the department wants, then surely it is an elementary deduction to say that the whole lot of them, all the practicing magistrates, are succumbing at the moment and that, instead of administering justice, they will first want to ascertain what the Government has to say about it. That is the conclusion one must draw. Who can have any confidence in our Government if the judge&#x2019;s statements are correct? Sir, if any person&#x2014;I do not care whether it is a judge or a Minister or who it is&#x2014;does our administration of justice such a disservice, then I really find it extremely disappointing.</p>

<p>Now I want to ask: What is the further implication? If it is true that they as officials are not free when they administer justice, will they behave any differently when they are members of the judiciary one day? After all, it can only be the judiciary which will force them; that is the conclusion one has to draw. If one reads this hon. judge&#x2019;s speech, and combines it with that of the main speaker on Justice on the opposite side, then I immediately become principal accused in this case. That is what it amounts to. Now you can understand why I kept quiet. Today the main speaker on the opposition side says that I should&#x2014;or that I should have done this a long time ago&#x2014;say whether or not I influence them. That is what he is actually saying, and he takes it amiss of me for not speaking, or rather for not having spoken out before. You see, Sir, he does not know what it is all about. That is the whole problem. Mr. Justice Eksteen implied that the Government influences or prescribes to&#x2014;call it what you will; the result is the same&#x2014;magistrates; magistrates are subject to some or other kind of coercion obstruction in their administration of justice; they are not &#x201C;fearlessly and independent&#x201D;. Whether the Government frightens them or what is supposed to happen here, I really cannot say. I can only say that in my time this has not happened. I also know that it did not happen in my predecessor&#x2019;s time. I assume that it did not happen previously under the National Party Government either. But I should like to see the day when the United Party comes into power and the main speaker on<span class="col_7037-7038" refersTo="page_0473"/> the opposite side becomes Minister of Justice. He will take over the court himself! Sir, I have more respect for our law than to be a judge in my own case. I cannot here, where I am the principal accused, also be the judge and pronounce judgment on what is correct and what not. Judging from the expression on the hon. member&#x2019;s face, this is still not getting through to him. He said that I would manipulate them; the judge said they were not fearlessly independent, and that if they were elevated, they would possibly succumb to pressure. From those two facts it has to be deduced that I am an accused, for I am after all the responsible Minister. My attitude is that I do not want to pronounce judgment where I am the accused; other people must pronounce judgment.</p>

<p>Now I should like to quote a statement. You must please excuse me, Sir&#x2014;I had it with me here, but I cannot seem to lay my hands on it right away. I should like to have this statement on record, and that is why I am going to read it in its entirety. It was released at midnight on the 25th August, 1971, and it read as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Recently there has been a good deal of discussion of the question of whether magistrates should be taken into consideration for appointment as judges of our Supreme Court. This followed on a plea made in this connection by Judge President F. H. Badenhorst, that senior regional magistrates who are competent and who comply with the necessary requirements, ought to be considered for appointment. I do not want to comment on the merits of the case. The hon. the Minister did not commit the Government in any respect either. Others are free to air their opinions. In fact, it is only in this way that the public opinion may be tested. A judge of the Eastern Cape Division of the Supreme Court, Mr. Justice Eksteen, recently adopted a standpoint in this regard when he addressed a Law Society in East London. Mr. Justice Eksteen is also entitled to air his opinion. In his motivation, however, he found it necessary to draw certain comparisons which prejudiced the honour and prestige of our magistrates. For this reason, and because I as head of the department cannot allow such derogatory allegations to be made about them, I am now reacting, after I have had an opportunity of studying a copy of his written speech. The essence of the judge&#x2019;s argument was that a public servant would never make a good judge, because, owing to his background and training as official, he would not be able to display fearless independence. A person&#x2019;s courage is supposedly impaired to such an extent in the Public Service that he will never again be able to act fearlessly, even after he has been freed of the State yoke. This approach, respectfully said, is not correct. Quite a number of former officials have in the past been appointed as judges, and I challenge Mr. Justice Eksteen to produce any manifestation of constraint or bias on their part. In fact, I am of the opinion that most jurists would agree with me that some of the greatest giants on our Supreme Court bench did in fact come from the Public Service, or at least received their basic training in the Public Service.</block>

<p>The judge said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If, however, the Government were to appoint civil servants to the Supreme Court Bench, they must realize that their action can only serve to tarnish and diminish this brightest gem in the crown of our judicial system.</block>

<p>I just want to say in passing that the main speaker on the Opposition side adopted the same tone. He said that I wanted to tarnish and destroy this wonderful jewel which still remained in our system. He said: &#x201C;He wants to break it down; he wants to destroy it.&#x201D; The statement reads further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is clear that in his allegation he completely overlooked the brightest gems, men like the late Toon van den Heever and ex-Chief Justice L. C. Steyn &#x2026;</block>

<p>To mention only two; I shall in a moment add the names of quite a few more&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; if Mr. Justice Eksteen thinks that former public servants will not be able to act fearlessly as judges, it follows that a person like a magistrate who is still in the Public Service will be able to act even less fearlessly on the Bench. The conclusion must therefore be drawn that our magistrates&#x2019; courts are manned by persons who, as a result of their fear of their employer, the State, are unable to form an objective opinion.</block>

<p><span class="col_7039-7040" refersTo="page_0474"/>The following is a very fair conclusion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This is indeed a disturbing insinuation, the more so if it is borne in mind that most criminal as well as civil cases are in fact tried in the magistrates&#x2019; courts.</block>

<p>I want hon. members on the opposite side who are interested in figures, to consider the latest report of the Department of Justice. A limited number&#x2014;I think 33 000, both criminal and civil&#x2014;were heard in the Supreme Court, and if I am not mistaken, almost 1 400 000 were heard in our magistrates&#x2019; courts. Must we now conclude things went satisfactorily only in those 33 000 cases, and that in all these other cases magistrates are subject to pressure in their work and that they receive instructions through me, as channel, from the Government? I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<p>This is indeed a disturbing insinuation, the more so if it is borne in mind that most criminal as well as civil cases are in fact tried in the magistrates&#x2019; courts. Mr. Justice Eksteen is the first judge, to my knowledge, who has delivered himself of such derogatory comment on the judicial work of our magistrates. On the contrary, I have at my disposal growing numbers of testimonials concerning magistrates furnished by judges and other jurists, who enjoy very high esteem in legal circles. I have been authorized by the central committee of the Magistrates&#x2019; Association to deny on their behalf that there is intervention at any time with the judicial discretion of magistrates by the Minister or the head of the department, and to say that they are as free as any judge to pronounce their judgement on the evidence led and under the laws of the country and in accordance with their oath of office.</p>

<p>Then he went on to say-&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But the actual source of indignation among the magistrates is Mr. Justice Eksteen&#x2019;s reference to the conduct of German judges under the Nazi regime. Those judges were supposedly indoctrinated by the Nazi Party, influenced to pronnounce judgments which were not in accordance with law or justice. They succumbed to pressure and perverted law and justice. The judges had supposedly succumbed because they had had no tradition of independence. The German judges were appointed from the Civil Service, and had no tradition of fearless independence to control their instincts. The message is clear. If our Supreme Court were to be manned by magistrates and other public servants, they could, as a result of their background, not display fearless independence, and would allow themselves, as a result of being prescribed to by the Government, to act not according to the law, but to do what the Government wants them to do.</block>

<p>It is clear that others did in fact draw this conclusion. They did draw this conclusion. On 11th August, after the speech had been made, <i>Die Burger</i> said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Magistrate a danger on the Bench.</block>

<p>On the same day the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> stated</p>

<block name="quote">judge warns of Nazi danger.</block>

<p>The <i>Eastern Province Herald</i> said&#x2014;<i></i></p>

<block name="quote">The judiciary must be independent, not obedient &#x2026;</block>

<p>The Secretary for Justice went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whether his statement in regard to the German judges under the Nazi regime is correct, I would not know. To my knowledge all judges in Germany today are still public servants. The comparison with what had allegedly happened in Nazi Germany, is an ugly reflection, not only on our magistrates, but on our judiciary as a whole.</block>

<p>It is a reflection on our administration of justice as a whole. After all, our magistrates are also proud of a tradition of independence and impartiality extending over a period of many years. The Secretary for Justice went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Justice Eksteen also referred to the fact that Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice of England &#x2026;</block>

<p>Incidentally, Sir, he quoted the name incorrectly; it is not &#x201C;Maurice Fitzgerald&#x201D; as he called him; it is &#x201C;Gerald Fitzmaurice&#x201D;.</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and Mr. Justice Gross of France recently decided in our favour the judgment of the International Court of Justice on South-West Africa. According to Mr. Justice<span class="col_7041-7042" refersTo="page_0475"/> Eksteen they had the courage to pronounce judgment contrary to the General Assembly of the United Nations because they were trained in the tradition of fearless independence. I agree that these gentlemen acted fearlessly. They were both public servants before they were appointed to the International Court of Justice.</block>

<p>I want the main speaker on that side on Justice matters to know this. Those two judges were both public servants. They were in the departments of foreign affairs of their respective countries. They were not judges on the Bench. They were not practising advocates. The statement goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Just as the rest of our population do, all the officials of my department, including the magistrates, have the greatest respect for our judges. We are proud of their achievement, and in so far as it lies in our power we deliberately avoid anything which would impair its prestige. We also have a great respect for our Bar, and we are proud of the tradition which has been built up there. Neither I nor the magistrate requested the Government that we be appointed as judges. We are satisfied to leave a matter such as this in the hands of the Government of the day. However, we are not prepared to allow ourselves to be humiliated. Without adopting a standpoint in regard to a matter which was raised, not by the hon. the Minister, or the department, or a magistrate, but by a Judge President, a question may be put as to whether Mr. Justice Eksteen in any way furthered his own case or enhanced the prestige of our inferior and superior courts.</block>

<p>Sir, I can find no fault with that. I agree 100 per cent with this. Now I just want to say this. I think that the right man to have made the statement was the Secretary for Justice. I could not do so, and then I was accused by the hon. member for Durban North and Mr. Justice Eksteen. I just want to say, in all fairness, that I stated at the outset that a metamorphosis is to be observed in the main speaker of the Opposition. I am looking for something now, and. I want to see if I can find it because it is important. The year before last we dealt with the matter of protest control in this House. That was still before this new metamorphosis began to take place. Now I just wanted to show you what the main speaker on the Opposition side had to say at the time. I must find it, for it is priceless. No, I cannot find it now, but I just want to say in passing that when I proposed that magistrates as well as the municipalities should grant consent for processions through their streets, that speaker expressed an opinion on that matter as well. I cannot give you his precise words, because I cannot find them, but what they amounted to was that he said that officials, such as magistrates and in particular chief magistrates, were the only officials who were absolutely independent. He said they could not be influenced; he said they would not listen to a Minister, and he said that the Minister of Justice&#x2014;apparently as he knew me to be at the time&#x2014;was the last person who would try to influence them, and he said they supported it wholeheartedly, for if those people were there they would hear evidence from both sides and would then pronounce judgment on the basis of their own opinion. But now he states in the <i>Daily News</i> that we will manipulate things. But in fairness to him I want to say that when I returned and saw what a row was being kicked up about this matter, I wondered why this should be the case, for I had said nothing unusual, and I telephoned the broadcasting service on Monday and asked for the precise words which they had broadcast. They then gave me what they had said about Mr. Justice Badenhorst, and they added that as far as I am concerned there had been only a brief report. They referred first to Judge President Badenhorst, and then said the following about me [translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Pelser said in answer to a plea that the matter would definitely receive consideration. He said that since he had been the first Minister of Justice to appoint a woman to the Bench, he also hoped that he would be the first to appoint a magistrate.</block>

<p>Sir, let me say this&#x2014;and you must accept my word for it, for it is correct&#x2014;that these are not the precise words which I originally used. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>What kind of impression would it have made if I had, a week after he had kicked up such a fuss, informed the broadcasting service that they should broadcast a statement to the effect that that was not precisely what I had said. I did not express that hope. He would immediately have said that I had changed my mind, and therefore I did not do it. It was too late, and I had already been placed in the dock by the hon. member. But now I want to say something else. I must mention that a considerable number of people have been elevated to the Bench who never practised as advocates. I want to present a list of them. The most well known one, and the youngest in our history, is the man to whom reference was made earlier in the debate on Wednesday evening, Appeal Judge Botha. I want to say of Appeal Judge Botha that I think he is rendering excellent service. There is no doubt about that. It makes no difference whether he finds for or against us&#x2014;he is rendering excellent service, and I am proud of him. I must say I was equally proud of a man such as Dr. L. C. Steyn, the former Chief Justice. I think that he is one of the most brilliant jurists and judges we have ever had on the Bench. The Secretary for Justice has already referred to the late judge of appeal, Mr. Justice Toon van den Heever. That man had a wonderful brain. In addition there was Mr. Justice Brebner, there was Mr. Justice Bok and Mr. Justice Rosenow. But to come closer to home as far as he is concerned, I want to say that this is not an unusual occurrence in Natal either. There it has also been done already. It is Ellison Kahn who says this. He wrote quite a decent article and he also adopted the standpoint that the mere fact that a man is an official ought not to count against him. But what happened in Natal? Mr. Justice William Broome was a public servant for years.</p>

<p>He says it was in 1902. But he mentioned other people, such as Gardiner and Mr. Justice Matthews. But take another case. Do you remember the famous jurist, the outstanding man we had in this country, the man who shaped our law? Do you remember Lord De Villiers? Do you know that Lord De Villiers was a public servant? He was an Attorney-General of the Cape, and his appointment was so unpopular that he could not find another judge before whom he could affirm his oath. Do you know that he was obliged, so I am told, to stand before the Bench, then ascend to the Bench, administer the oath and then come down and affirm the oath himself? He subsequently became Chief Justice of the Cape Province, and after that of South Africa as well, and was probably one of the brightest stars we ever had.</p>

<p>And in London he was, to crown it all, made a member of the Peerage.</p>

<p>I am merely mentioning this to point out that this idea is not all that absurd. I want to quote something else. I hope I can in my haste lay my hand on it quickly. I want to recount what happened in Rhodesia, and now hon. members must not laugh at Rhodesia. In Rhodesia they appointed, as they call it, a judge&#x2019;s commission to investigate the entire matter of the appointment of judges. I should like to inform you of what that commission&#x2019;s findings were, and what report they subsequently submitted. Unfortunately I cannot lay my hands quickly enough on the document in question, and I apologise for taking up so much time with this matter, but it is important; it affects us and it embarrasses all our magistrates. Not only does it embarrass the magistrates, but it harms our administration of justice. I must therefore take up the time of the Committee in this connection. Nevertheless I am sorry about this, and I apologise for doing so. The commission consisted of Sir Hugh Beadle<span class="col_7045-7046" refersTo="page_0477"/> and, I think, Mr. Justice Broome, as well as two practising advocates, both of them Q.C.s, and one official who acted as secretary. The commission reported that when it came to the appointment of judges, regional magistrate with the necessary experience and qualifications should be taken into consideration. This is what happened in Rhodesia. I do not want to express an opinion on it as to whether it is right or wrong, but I do want to say that Rhodesia is in this fortunate position that they can make this kind of appointment for the simple reason that they do not have a Mike Mitchell there as we do here.

<p>Now I come to the Legodi case, about which the hon. the main speaker on that side had a great deal to say. The hon. member for Musgrave also referred to it and said &#x201C;he talked facts&#x201D;. I think that is what he said.

<p>No, the hon. member should not start chattering now. She should sit quite still. I really felt unhappy when the hon. the main speaker on the Opposition side brought up the Legodi case here. I thought this really was not the right thing to do, as this was, after all, Helen&#x2019;s province, the hon. member for Houghton&#x2019;s province. The hon. member for Prinshof furnished the facts to a large extent. This question of this person having been an &#x201C;innocent witness&#x201D;, as the hon. member for Houghton and the main speaker on the Opposition side suggested&#x2014;this is what I should like to take further. The two hon. members who asked questions in that regard and have now referred to it again, are apparently slightly confused. Through their irresponsible action, as was pointed out by an hon. member on this side, they did us tremendous harm. It will not be possible to wipe out the headlines she made, and which he too made in <i>The Cape Times</i> yesterday and, I think, in other newspapers abroad as well. I could submit the true facts to the Committee, but she has achieved her object.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, let me now present the picture to those people who are interested in the truth about the Legodi case. I should like to do so without being interrupted by the hon. member for Houghton. On 21st May, 1971 &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Oh, please, you are deaf. Mr. Chairman, let me now furnish hon. members with the facts. I can see now what is going on. They are ashamed of what has happened up to now. I think the hon. member for Pinelands, in particular, is ashamed. [Interjections.] I do not know, but my suspicions are that the hon. member ought to be ashamed. I think he has the decency to be ashamed. The facts of the Legodi case are as follows: On 21st May, 1970, the corpse of a certain John Cowell was found with stab wounds in his chest and his neck. Robbery was obviously the motive. The hon. member for Prinshof said that nobody had been there, and it would also appear from this that nobody had been there. During August, 1971, a certain Solomon Kumalo and Zachariah Makihita and Legodi were arrested. Some time later, on 21st October, another person, namely Kenneth Wilson, was arrested. On 30th March, 1972 Kumalo was convicted of murder and robbery and sentenced to 12 years&#x2019; imprisonment. Makihita was convicted of robbery and sentenced to eight years&#x2019; imprisonment. Wilson was acquitted and discharged. On 17th August, 1971, Legodi was arrested at Hammanskraal on a charge of murder. His mother was present and she was informed as to where he would be detained. On the same day an<span class="col_7049-7050" refersTo="page_0479"/> uncle of his was informed of the events in Johannesburg by the Police. Legodi was subsequently charged with murder along with the other accused. On 4th November, 1971, during the preliminary enquiry, it was decided to call Legodi as a State witness. In his evidence he claimed that another Bantu man had had a hand in the murder. He undertook to point out that person. This was subsequently arranged with the Police, and he was released. They were to meet one another at a certain place. Legodi had no fixed address. Furthermore, he was unemployed, and it was clear to the Police that he had been influenced to deny his evidence, i.e. after he had been arrested again. On 8th November an application was made to the Attorney-General for his detention in terms of section 215. The Attorney-General notified me immediately. On 9th November, 1971, a Bantu woman, by whom he had two children, was informed of his. detention. On the same day a cousin of his was also informed and requested to take clean clothes to Legodi. Legodi was visited by a magistrate on 18 occasions and the latter had interviews with him. On three additional occasions he had gone out with the Police and the magistrates could not have interviews with him. Not on one of these 18 occasions on which he was spoken to, did Legodi request that persons should visit him, although he had sent messages to this effect to people. It is correct that the magistrates are not required to make a report to the Attorney-General after visits paid to a detainee. However, there is an existing departmental rule&#x2014;I assume this was introduced by my predecessor&#x2014;that if, in the course of such a visit, the slightest irregularity is noticed, this is to be reported to the departmental chief, for the information of the Minister. This was not done. They never found anything wrong. I was asked what amount of money had been paid to him; I replied that R140 had been paid to him. A subsequent question was whether he had been remunerated for work. I replied in the negative. The fact of the matter is that this person was unemployed. It is also a fact that if he could produce today a certificate from an employer stating that he was in regular employment there and what his regular wages were, he could still apply today and then his wages would be paid out to him. But this will, of course, have to be proved. It cannot simply be accepted just like that. There was, therefore, no injustice in this regard.</p>

<p>As I have said, this thing has done us a great deal of harm. This is the case as a result of the fact that the hon. member for Houghton has been asking a question of this nature every now and then, and when she rises the next day, she simply goes on talking about Legodi. This is more or less the theme of what has happened. Then it is published in leading articles in the newspapers. To suggest now that Legodi was simply thrown into a cell and locked up there, is the biggest nonsense in the world. With people of this kind &#x2026;</p>

<p>I do not want any more chattering now. People of this kind are usually detained at the police stations. Tobacco and various other things were given to him. What he wanted, was given to him. Reading matter was given to him. This is the solitary confinement this poor man had to endure. This is their wont. After all, he had proved to the police on a previous occasion that they were tampering with him. When he was released the first time in order to point out the other person, he denied it again after his recapture. At that stage it was clear to the police that this person was allowing himself to be influenced and that they had to keep him in solitary confinement. They kept him in solitary confinement under the best circumtances possible. I say that he was kept in solitary confinement under good circumstances. If the hon. member for Wynberg does not want to accept it this way, it is her business. I am charged with matters of this nature, and I think I know more about them than that hon. member does. She can take part in the debate later on; she is free to do so.</p>

<p>Now let us come to the questions put by the hon. member for Houghton. What did she ask me the first day? In the first place, she asked me the following on 18th April&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whether a warrant for the arrest and detention of Mr. Ephraim Legodi has been issued in terms of section 215<i>bis</i> of the Criminal Procedure Act; if so, for what reason was the warrant issued?</block>

<p>You see, Sir, how limited the question is. My reply was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Yes. The Attorney-General was of the opinion that the witness would abscond and that he might not be traced thereafter.</block>

<p><span class="col_7051-7052" refersTo="page_0480"/>The next day there was a report which made the headlines&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An angry Mrs. Suzman commented today: &#x201C;What sort of a law is this which allows a man who is an innocent bystander, who is no more than a witness to a street crime, to be held for 129 days in solitary confinement?&#x201D;</block>

<p>This is a sordid article which has already been dealt with by the hon. member for Prinshof, and I am not going to make any further references to it. A full week later the hon. member asked me&#x2014;and hon. members should listen attentively now&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whether magistrates who visit persons detained in terms of section 215 of the Criminal Procedure Act are required to report on such visits to the AttorneyGeneral; if so, (a) on how many occasions were reports made in regard to Mr. Ephraim Legodi and (b) what was the substance of the reports; if not, to what officer in the service of the State are such reports made?</block>

<p>This was followed once again by a number of extracts from newspapers and statements by them. At a later stage she put a further question&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(a) What was paid to Ephraim Legodi in terms of subsection (6) of section 215<i>bis</i> of the Criminal Procedure Act and (b) on what date was the amount paid?</block>

<p>My reply read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(a) R140 and (b) on 17th April, 1972.</block>

<p>If the hon. member thinks that I am going to make a &#x201C;statement&#x201D;, as she has asked me to do, then she is quite mistaken. The <i>Eastern Province Herald</i> published one of the most reasonable articles of them all. The <i>Cape Times</i> also had a leading article on this matter. I had thought that it would not refrain from commenting on it. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The case of Mr. Ephraim Legodi is an example of what can happen to an innocent individual in a society which has grown accustomed to the institution of detention without trial &#x2026;</block>

<p>It carried on in that vein, and then it said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mrs. Helen Suzman has rightly described this as an &#x201C;incredible situation&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Durban North used the same words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; that a man who accidentally &#x2026;</block>

<p>After all, these are the same words which were used by the main speaker on that side&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; accidentally witnessed a crime in the street can simply be taken and held in solitary confinement for 129 days until the actual case comes up for trial where he is required as a witness.</block>

<p>Then there was another question, namely&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mrs. Suzman asked the Minister of Justice whether the amount paid to Ephraim Legodi in terms of subsection (6) of section 215<i>bis</i> of the Criminal Procedure Act included an allowance in respect of wages forfeited by him; if so, what was the amount of (a) this allowance and (b) the wages forfeited?</block>

<p>My reply was, with reference to the compensation for wages: &#x201C;No, this was not paid.&#x201D; He had not yet applied, and had not yet produced the necessary evidence. There were no further questions. Now the hon. member for Houghton, who asked this lot of questions, should tell me at what stage I was supposed to make a statement.</p>

<p>Sir, it is, of course, not necessary for any Minister to wait. With the consent of Mr. Speaker a Minister may simply make a statement out of the blue, and he may also do so in reply to a question. But there must at least be some kind of reason for doing so. Something must be indicated; for instance, one may be told: &#x201C;This is a strange case.&#x201D; But she never indicated that it was a strange case. [Interjections.] She and the leader of those members opposite did not make one inquiry; they were only too pleased<span class="col_7055-7056" refersTo="page_0482"/> that she had asked such an innocent question, and then went straight to the Press. Then we had headlines here and overseas, and the world was told: &#x201C;South Africa is bad.&#x201D; That was the second major attack made by that side, and that was done in regard to a sordid matter like this one. That, then, disposes of the Legodi case; what more is there for me to say?</p>

He thinks this is the way a Government acts. But I do not take it amiss of him, for just think how stupid are they? When last did they hold a Cabinet meeting? Let us be realistic now. As a result of this, I must make certain concessions. We have now been governing for 24 years.</p>

If they should possibly experience the misfortune of having to form the Government&#x2014;be it with the Black people or without them&#x2014;then I shall tell you, Sir, what would happen. Incredible as it may seem, they would have to go and ask Mr. Waters on how to hold a Cabinet meeting.</p>

<p>Or Harry Lawrence.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, they could ask him too. I fully believe that Mr. Harry Lawrence, or Mr. Waterson, would have to be present at their first Cabinet meeting, because they do not know how a Cabinet meeting is held; they do not know how Government decisions are taken. That is the trouble with them, and one must therefore make certain concessions. It has just occurred to me that they would possibly be able to ask Major Piet van der Bijl as well. [Interjections.] That is why I say, therefore, that in part I cannot blame the hon. member, but he may not speak to me like that and say: &#x201C;Look here, you must do this or that now.&#x201D; That is something he should stop doing. Now I want to tell him what the answer is. The Botha Commission was appointed by me; I appointed him on my own initiative. He was given special facilities in order that his work might be expedited. He is a person who works at a tremendous pace. The work was completed in almost record time. I have admiration for the way in which this person did his work. His report was subsequently sent out in order to obtain the comments of the public, of the legal profession, of members of the judiciary, of the Law Society and of all interested parties. We wanted to give the people enough time for this purpose, especially since we were in the fortunate position that the commission had completed its work so soon. We gave them time until 31st March, and right up to the end we were still receiving representations from various quarters. Sir, When one receives representations, one may not simply leave them in one&#x2019;s desk or throw them into the wastepaper basket; one has to study them. I have really not had the time to glance through all those things. Why should I do it? I have a competent department for giving consideration to things of this nature, and that is why these matters are left to them. The practice is for them to come to me with a submission after they have considered the representations. Whenever they receive representations in which certain valid points are made, or which have to be investigated further, this is brought to my notice in their submission. In cases where the representations are of no significance or where certain points are raised which have already been covered, those representations are put aside. Of course, when I receive the submission, I have to submit it to the Cabinet, and then we see whether we should accept the report. At the moment the department<span class="col_7057-7058" refersTo="page_0483"/> is engaged in examining these representations. They will submit a report to me in due course. I do not know when that is going to be. I hope that it will be soon, for I should like to introduce the measure next year, if the Cabinet approves the report of the commission. What has to happen first, is that the report of the commission has to be approved by the Cabinet. I have not received the submission as yet, and consequently I cannot say at this stage which recommendations will be approved and which will not be adopted. It is therefore impossible to furnish the main speaker on the other side with a decisive reply at this stage. This is the reply as far as that matter is concerned. I cannot say &#x201C;yes&#x201D;, nor can I say &#x201C;no&#x201D;. The Cabinet has to consider the matter first, and I hope that we shall be able to introduce the Bill next year.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall deal with that in a moment. I have decided, after the performance we had here the other evening, that I shall take enough time to reply. Sir, I think that in saying this, I have at the same time replied also to the question of the hon. member for Musgrave, who told me that I had to reply to his question. He lost his temper to a certain extent. The hon. member looks funny when he loses his temper. Sir, I shall reply straight away to the hon. member for Houghton&#x2019;s question concerning restricted people. The hon. member referred to &#x201C;banned people&#x201D;. The correct word is &#x201C;restricted&#x201D;. The hon. member wants to know whether the question of restricted people was being reviewed from time to time. The answer is &#x201C;yes&#x201D;, it is reviewed from time to time. I have just received a note from the department this moment; I may perhaps furnish the Committee with the figures; I shall see in a moment. Last year, especially, we released a large number of people. I do not know whether this appears in the <i>Gazette.</i> This is in fact possible; I would not be able to say. This question is reviewed from time to time. As regards the request that it should be done by an independent commission, my reply is that this is nonsense. Why should an independent commission pry into our security documents? I am not going to do this. I want to tell the hon. member that the communists have wormed their way into places which would surprise most people. For all I know, a communist may have access to those documents.</p>

<p>What about a judicial commission?</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The answer is that on 30th April, 1972, there were 237 restricted persons, and of these 237 persons 18 were abroad; in other words, this gives one a total figure of 219 in the Republic of South Africa. And then it is stated here that 34 were withdrawn during the past 12 months. [Interjections.] Then there are 83 that were not renewed upon expiry. [Interjections.] Twenty-one were relaxed during the past year. Sometimes they make representations to me, and then I consider all the circumstances. I hope the hon. member for Houghton is grateful. These are the particulars in regard to this matter.</p>

<p>I think there was still one other question on Mr. Justice Steyn. The hon. member for Musgrave said I had to reply on Mr. Justice Steyn. He was angry. He thought I would say nothing. He wanted to make it clear to me that I was up against the wrong person. I shall see whether I can find something in that regard. I have read the newspaper report on Mr. Justice Steyn. I want to say, first of all, that what I said about Mr. Justice Eksteen, also holds good for Mr. Justice Steyn. When this gentleman passes judgment on the Bench, we accept it without saying a word, but when this gentleman speaks outside and clashes with people or bodies, he should not take it amiss if the matter were taken up with him. I have read it. The hon. Mr. Justice Steyn makes many speeches, and these are mainly concerned with&#x2014;and in this respect he is his mother&#x2019;s child, who was a person who took a great interest in this work&#x2014;crime prevention and things of that nature. He makes many speeches on these matters and is interested in social conditions. I have read through his speeches and have found that there is absolutely nothing in them, absolutely nothing.</p>

There is nothing in them, and I say this for this reason. In the first place, there is not one single punishment mentioned by Mr. Justice Steyn, nor any line of thought referred to by him, for which provision has not already been made in our Code&#x2014; not a single one. He may do this and he may do that, and he may do anything. There was the case of Magistrate King, who recently sentenced a person to working for the Red Cross. Such a sentence is quite in order; there is nothing wrong with it. As far as the legislation is concerned, i.e. what statutory reforms we are to effect in order to achieve his objectives, I would not be able to say. I say that in our Code provision has been made for any punishment which a judge may feel inclined to impose.</p>

<p>The hon. judge mentioned figures and said that for every 100 000 people we had 417 people in prison.

<block name="quote">25 in the Netherlands, 61 in Sweden, 70 in France and 72,5 in Britain.</block>

<p>It sounds fine, and this is indeed a low figure. What was he comparing? Surely he was not comparing the same thing. He was comparing the homogeneous populations of Britain, France, the Netherlands, etc., with the entire population of South Africa. Unfortunately he was making the same mistake which the United Party is making by wanting to take the various population groups together.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>But there are 50 million people in Britain. [Interjections.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is quite correct. There are 50 million people in Britain, and I have visited the very best prisons of those people and I know what is going on. But whether there are 50 million or whether there are 14 million or whether there are 2 million, the fact remains that we are working here with a ratio of so many out of 100 000 people. The size of the population does not make the least difference to that ratio. What is more, those are populations with a tremendous tradition and history. These go back over centuries. However, let us leave the matter at that. I do not want to make a point of it; I am just pointing it out in passing. Surely he cannot compare it in our case, with our Whites, Coloureds, Indians and Bantu all taken together. After all, this is an unfair comparison. Incidentally, I want to point out that he said that for every 100 000 people in the Netherlands 25 were in prison. However, do you know what the position is there? They have approximately 6 500 prisoners inside the prisons, but do you know how many prisoners they have outside the prisons? They have 20 000 outside the prisons. In other words, their prison population is 26 000. If one multiplies that figure of 25 proportionately, one arrives at a figure quite different from 25 out of every 100 000. They have a different system in terms of which people are put on probation. Here we have a system of probation.<span class="col_7061-7062" refersTo="page_0485"/> Why do we not do the same? Am I to prescribe to the judges that they are to put people on probation? Am I to tell the inferior courts that they are to see to it that they put these people on probation? If we do put them on probation, by whom are they to be taken on probation? My standpoint is that this must be the same organization which Mr. Justice Steyn has, the Institute of Crime Prevention and Rehabilitation of Offenders. One could put such a person on probation. That would be a very good thing. If this organization would, on its own initiative, recruit people of high standing and integrity for taking such persons on probation, I am telling you, Sir, that under our existing system there is nothing to prevent any court from doing so. It is true that the judge knows about this. Hon. members are fond of referring to &#x201C;pick-up people&#x201D;. Are they aware that the head of the department sent a circular to the magistrates, not an instruction, in which he asked the magistrates to be so kind as to give consideration to this matter? He pointed out all the possible penalties and wanted to know whether they, as the persons administering justice and as presiding officers, would not in cases of this nature apply the short-term sentences in such or such a manner.</p>

If he does agree, does he, as Minister of Justice, intend to take any steps to remedy the position?</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, the hon. member has now interrupted me to a certain extent, but I shall reply to it. I should perhaps have mentioned that if one took our White population, the figure would not be 417 per 100 000.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is not the population&#x2014;there you are! Look, surely one should compare similar cases and not dissimilar ones. I say that if one takes the Whites, it is not disproportionate at all, for there are so many countries which have a figure of 81 or 82,5 per 100 000. I have had ours worked out, and I think it is 86.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>But what about the non-Whites?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Wait a minute. I think it is 86 and I do not regard it as being disproportionate at all. I regard it as being very reasonable as compared to other White countries with the same standard of civilization. If that is done, there is nothing strange about it, for we are on the same level as others are. I had it worked out carefully in order to get the figures. While I was taking that tour, I had the figure and worked it out at every place I visited. I took our figure of 86 per 100 000 in respect of the Whites, and we compared very favourably. I had these figures checked this morning. The other two figures that are nearest are 82,5 and 81. Our figure of 86 is therefore not disproportionate. Unfortunately the figure in respect of our nonWhite prison population is a high one. I think it is high, but in that respect one should also make allowances for the various groups who are living under different circumstances. In some places liquor plays a major role. I think that here in the Western Cape liquor plays a tremendous role as far as the crime rate is concerned. In respect of others one has to have regard to the fact that their standard of civilization is not a high one. In having regard to all of these things, one finds oneself faced with a difficulty: how is one to handle the matter if there are so many people? I do not know how I am to handle it. That is the trouble. If the hon. members know, I would be very pleased to hear it. But I just want to say that a suggestion to this effect has not yet been put forward by Mr. Justice Steyn and his organization. If anybody would make a suggestion, I would be only too grateful, for we have a large prison population, especially Black and Coloured people. But now one should also remember that one may not simply make so many allowances for a person&#x2019;s standard of civilization that one lets him go unpunished. In that regard influx control once again plays a role. I told the hon. member before that influx control had a major effect. In that respect, as we view the matter, we have one of the possibilities which we are trying out to see whether we cannot correct these people in some way or other. Other than that I do not know what one can do. One cannot simply say, &#x201C;This is a pity; this chap is after all not a White man; unfortunately his standard of civilization is not yet as high as that.&#x201D; Of course,<span class="col_7063-7064" refersTo="page_0486"/> some of them have reached that standard and others, again, have not. I am referring to the latter. If he has done rash things and committed crimes, one cannot allow him to remain unpunished for that reason. That is how it all fits together. This is the reply I gave the hon. member. This is also my reply to the question he put to me in regard to Mr. Justice Steyn.</p>

<p>I think this disposes of all the matters we touched upon. I am sorry I spoke for such a long time, but these were questions that were put by the main speaker on the Opposition side.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want, in the time available to me, to deal with the question of deaths in detention and to come back to the case which has been dealt with by me in this House before, namely that of the late Imam Haron. I also want to contest the statement made by the hon. the Prime Minister in the noconfidence debate that an inquest is in fact the same as a judicial inquiry. Every lawyer, and every layman even, such as myself, knows that an inquest is a legal proceeding of a very limited nature indeed. As my hon. friend, the member for Zululand, said in this House on 2nd February, this year&#x2014;</p>

<p>Evidence which is placed &#x2026;</p>

<p>That is before an inquest&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; is placed there by a prosecutor of the magistrate&#x2019;s court who is an officer who operates under the instructions of the hon. the Minister of Justice.</block>

<p>Now, Sir, because of the limited nature of an inquest, as my hon. friend here says, no cross-examination is allowed as of right to anybody, be it a representative of the deceased or anybody else. Then the hon. member went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am quoting experts. I do not pretend to be one myself. I am intelligent enough to do that. In any case, then the hon. the Prime Minister replied to the hon. member for Zululand. The hon. member for Zululand had said that the hon. the Prime Minister had made himself guilty of trying to lead the country to believe that an inquest could be equated with a judicial inquiry and that the public mind should be put at rest accordingly. The Prime Minister&#x2019;s reply was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I still say so. That is a fact, and you know it.</block>

<p>To which the hon. member for Zululand replied that if the hon. gentleman still said that, then his understanding of the legal position in South Africa was far less than he imagined it to be.</p>

<p>How can the hon. the Prime Minister or this hon. Minister here square that statement with what the Prime Minister told an international Press Conference organized by the Minister of Information in Pretoria on 22nd November last year? He was asked the following question by Mr. A. B. Wessels&#x2014;I quote from the Department of Information&#x2019;s statement of that date, on page 11&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">With regard to the fact that 16 or 17 people died while being detained by the Security Police and that 50 per cent of these deaths were suicides, and the fact that there has been a public outcry over the matter from all shades of opinion, my question is why, if the Security Police have nothing to hide, do you persist in refusing to appoint a judicial commission of inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the deaths and methods used by the Security Police?</block>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister replied as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I find that of the 15 six died of natural causes and nine committed suicide.</block>

<p>He further said&#x2014;</p>

<p>But that is a complete contradiction of what the hon. the Prime Minister said during the noconfidence debate. If there is a degree of uncertainty, I would like to know why there was no judicial inquiry into the death of the late Imam Haron. In the course of the no-confidence debate this hon. Minister analysed the causes of death of nine people during their detention as witnesses under section 6 of the Terrorism Act since 1967. Three, he said, died of natural causes. Of the remaining six cases, he said, one had not been finalized&#x2014;that is the Timol case&#x2014;and of the remaining five, he said, that three were clearly cases of suicide. But about two cases there was not certainty. One of these concerns the death of the Moslem leader, the late Imam Haron.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister himself admitted this degree of uncertainty. If the hon. the Prime Minister says that if there is uncertainty, there must be a judicial inquiry and there was not one, then how do you reconcile the manner in which this was done? This hon. Minister stated in the no-confidence debate that there had been a pathological examination after this man&#x2019;s death and that the papers were forwarded to the Attorney-General. He said that at his request the Attorney-General had examined the papers a second time&#x2014;I quote him here&#x2014;and said &#x201C;he could find nothing which would justify a prosecution&#x201D;. The Minister then went on and accused me of having acted irresponsibly because I revealed the name of a certain Security Police officer, Sergeant Andries van Wyk, who, after very careful checking as to the source of my information, I stated in this House in 1971, appeared to have been involved in the assault&#x2014;I quote my own words&#x2014;&#x201C;upon the prisoner and that the assault was directly responsible for the subsequent decline in the Imam&#x2019;s physical condition during the last week of his life which finally led to his death&#x201D;. Those were my words in this House.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister was correct in stating that when the Attorney-General wrote to me asking for the source of my information, I claimed parliamentary privilege. It is quite correct. I refused to give the information. But before the hon. the Minister accuses me, I want to say that there are further points which have never been cleared up in regard to this case. The Police themselves pleaded privilege at the inquest, when asked to explain what happened to the Imam when he disappeared from the Maitland Police cells for two days shortly before his death. Why was that? Two fellow-political detainees involved in this case were released immediately after his death became known. Why was that? No one except the Police and counsel for the family know who they were. Then the senior Police officer in charge of the case was transferred to another province immediately after the prisoner&#x2019;s death. Why was that? There must have been some grounds which had nothing to do with security, for releasing two fellow-prisoners at the drop of a hat and for transferring the officer in charge of the case immediately after the death of the detainee.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Police told me in reply to a question this year, that this matter was closed. I want to tell him that it is by no means closed and that public anxiety continues in regard to it. In view of the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s clear statement on 21st November, 1971, which I have quoted here, namely that where any element of doubt existed over the manner in which any one died whilst in detention, the law prescribes&#x2014;these are his own words&#x2014;that a judicial inquiry should be held, I want to make a few observations in connection with this case.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, before the House adjourned, I had referred to the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s statement last year that if any element of doubt existed over the manner in which anyone died whilst in detention, to use his words, &#x201C;the law prescribes that a judicial inquiry should be held&#x201D;. What we asked for all along, of course, was a judicial commission. Hon. members will appreciate that there is a difference there. I think the hon. the Prime Minister himself was confusing the two matters when he replied to the hon. member for Zululand earlier this Session. The magistrate&#x2019;s final finding at the inquest on the Imam Haron read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whether the death was brought about by any act or omission involving or amounting to an offence on the part of<span class="col_7067-7068" refersTo="page_0488"/> any person, a substantial part of the said trauma was caused by an accidental fall down a flight of stone stairs. On the available evidence I am unable to determine how the balance thereof was caused.</block>

<p>When I questioned the hon. the Minister of Police in 1971 as to why only certain policemen involved in the case were called upon to give evidence at the inquest and not others, he replied that it was not the function of the Police to choose witnesses, but that of the Department of Justice. In other words, he passed the buck as I have said before. The Department of Justice, I was told, had decided that certain evidence would be a duplication and therefore was not necessary. On those grounds, flimsy and unconvincing as they are, Sergeant Andries van Wyk was never called upon to give evidence at all. It would be interesting to know on whose instructions this officer was omitted from the list of those who gave evidence. If, in the view of the Attorney-General, to quote his words, &#x201C;there were no grounds for prosecution&#x201D;, why was the Imam&#x2019;s widow subsequently awarded an <i>ex gratia</i> payment of R5 000 arising out of her claim for legal damages against the Ministers of Justice and Police? The matter, as the hon. Minister knows, was settled out of court.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Prinshof&#x2014;I am sorry he is not here&#x2014;gave the game away last year, I think, when the matter was raised in this House, by saying: &#x201C;I think it is virtually impossible for the widow to prove her claims.&#x201D; By implication that means that, since the Police were the only possible witnesses of what really happened, the facts would never be revealed unless, of course, there were a judicial commission, which we asked for in the first place. In the same debate the hon. the Minister of Police said that the <i>ex gratia</i> payment of R5 000 had been made, and I quote his words, &#x201C;because of the legal risks facing the Police Department&#x201D;. Just what did he mean by that? What were the legal risks involved? Of course, no one will ever know.</p>

<p>At the beginning of this Session I asked the hon. the Minister of Police, on 15th February, whether any of these Security Branch officers who were involved in that case were still serving in the Security Branch, where they were stationed, what they were doing, what the nature of their duties was, whether any of them had been promoted and, if so, what type of promotion, etc. The hon. the Minister gave a very interesting reply. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The matter to which the hon. member refers has been finally disposed of and, in fairness to the members of their families, I consider it not to be in the public interest to furnish this information.</block>

<p>He went on to say that the members concerned were all still serving in the Force and that he was not prepared to make any mention of whether they had had promotion or not. This was a very strange reply indeed. What made the hon. the Minister say that &#x201C;in fairness to their families&#x201D; he was not going to give the information? It was not in the public interest, nor had it to do with security. I will tell the House why the hon. the Minister said that, even if he was not prepared to do so. My information is that last October Sergeant Andries van Wyk became ill and went to hospital. When he resumed his ordinary police duties, he began to behave very strangely indeed and it is my information that, at times, he gave the impression that he was an epileptic. He suffered from fits of acute depression and threatened on more than one occasion to commit suicide. He talked about making his will and things of that kind. Eventually, although he remained at his post for a time, the firearm which he usually carried as an officer of the Force was removed from him by his superior officer. When Sergeant Van Wyk began to show serious signs of a loss of memory and mental instability, he was eventually committed to Stikland Mental Hospital at Bellville for observation.</p>

<p>To my knowledge he is still there. He is certainly under observation for medical reasons. I want to know whether the hon. the Minister is prepared to contradict my facts. Why should this man now find himself in a state of mental collapse? One can only guess what agonies of conscience may have caused this to happen. If this is the case, then this is retribution indeed. One thing is quite clear, namely that if it was not in this man&#x2019;s family&#x2019;s interests to reveal these facts, it was not in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s interests either. That much is quite obvious by the way in which this case has been handled. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I just want to make the following comment on the speech of the hon. member for Wynberg which she read out here word for word. A thorough investigation was made of the Imam case and the Attorney-General refused to prosecute. Subsequently further evidence was submitted to him, and once again he refused to prosecute. The hon. member for Wynberg was not satisfied, upon which she was asked to make her information available to the Minister of Justice, after which she wrote a letter and pleaded for Parliamentary privilege on 28th September, 1970. After all this, there are still attempts on her part in this House, where she enjoys Parliamentary privilege, to drag people&#x2019;s names through the mud.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to come back immediately to the hon. member for Durban North. I want to say to him, as the main speaker on Justice on that side, that after his performance in this House on Wednesday evening, his arrogance is much too big for his small political shoes. Furthermore, I want to say to the hon. member that this Legodi bomb has exploded in his face for one reason, namely that he is a marionette of Joel Mervis. We know that last year, or in 1970 already, Joel Mervis said that he was responsible for the additional seats the United Party had won, and that they were his marionettes. The hon. member for Durban North only strengthened this proof. He attacked the hon. the Minister of Justice and the Government. It is the usual attack we get year after year on section 6 of the Terrorism Act and on section 215<i>bis</i> of the Criminal Procedure Act. And, by the way, he may have been qualified to do so, but Mr. Judge Botha found that section 215 <i>bis</i> of the Criminal Procedure Act is in fact necessary. But, since he has made this attack, one asks oneself whether this type of security legislation is applicable only in this country; such a line and cry is raised about it by the Opposition and other liberals.</p>

<p>In the time at my disposal I want to mention only one civilized Western country, namely Canada, where there are in fact two language groups but where, as far as being White and as far as civilization are concerned, the population is completely homogeneous. In October, 1970, only two people were kidnapped, viz. James Cross, the senior British Trade Commissioner, and Pierre La Porte, Quebec&#x2019;s Minister of Labour and Immigration. Only two people were kidnapped and only one of them, viz. La Porte, was murdered. What was the reaction of that Government? Prime Minister Trudeau who, as we know, is a liberal socialist, implemented the War Measures Act of 1914 again. What does this War Measures Act provide for? I quote from the <i>Readers&#x2019; Digest</i> of April, 1972:</p>

<block name="quote">It is designed for war-time emergencies or crises, or real or apprehended insurrection. It gave the Police virtually unlimited powers.</block>

<p>In other words, this is something similar to our legislation, but it only goes much further. When Trudeau was attacked in respect of these powers he was assuming, his reply was:</p>

<block name="quote">Society must defend itself. There are a lot of bleeding hearts around who do not like to see people with helmets and guns. All I can say is: &#x201C;Go and bleed&#x201D;.</block>

<p>This was the reaction of an enlightened Western country. I ask myself now why is there this criticism in this country of measures which are far less drastic? It is very easy to understand; it is because this Opposition and the hon. member for Houghton continually set the ball rolling in order to induce liberals in this country and the liberals abroad to slander this type of legislation. Why do they do this? They do so simply because they are filled with unbridled hate against the National Party Government in power. I want to quote an example of this from the speech of the hon. member for Durban North. In respect of the Supreme Court, he said:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; this one remaining thing which serves South Africa, our democracy and our civilization, despite everything this Government has done, then I want to tell him that this country will not stand for it.</block>

<p>There you have it. The hon. member says: &#x201C;Hear,<span class="col_7071-7072" refersTo="page_0490"/> hear!&#x201D; In other words, the Supreme Court is the only thing which stands between us and barbarism. In other words, this Government and its officialdom are a lot of Nazi&#x2019;s. Therefore our Police are Gestapo and our warders Dachau warders. This is what the hon. member for Durban North and the other stupid member who made an interjection a moment ago, want to indicate to the outside world. I want to go even further. The hon. member for Durban North said here that according to the information at his disposal, the Rev. ffrench-Beytagh should never have been detained in terms of section 6. It is true that he was found not guilty in the Appeal Court, and we respect the Appeal Court&#x2019;s decision as, indeed, we respect any court decision. But does the hon. member for Durban North think we are childish enough to believe what he says? If a person is found guilty in the court of first instance and is sentenced to several years&#x2019; imprisonment, does he think the Police should be in the same position as any judge to decide there and then that there is not enough evidence to detain that person in terms of section 6? Who is the hon. member protecting? He is protecting the Rev. ffrench-Beytagh. What did this gentleman say when he was safely back in England? According to the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> of 3rd May, he said:</p>

<block name="quote">I am not a pacifist and I would support a revolution if I thought it had a fair chance of success.</block>

<p>This is what he said in respect of South Africa. Furthermore, he said that all trade unions in Europe should realize that they were committing high treason if they sent their qualified artisans to this country. This is the type of person for whom the hon. member for Durban North is pleading. I want to say to the country that if one ever wants a pink Progressive policy in this country, one should place the hon. member for Durban North in charge of Justice in this country.</p>

<p>It is all available to the Police Force and to the Attorney-General. I may just say that both the individuals to whom I refer have since left the Republic. There is no longer any doubt in my mind at all that the Minister and his department together with the hon. Minister of Police were determined to keep the facts of this case concealed from the general public. In dealing with this case in this House earlier this year, with particular reference to charges made by me, the hon. Minister pointed an accusing finger at me, quoting a directive issued by the South African Communist Party. He then accused me of assisting them. The hon. Minister quoted from a directive which read:</p>

<block name="quote">We must force our enemy onto the defensive, if necessary by lies and false accusations. We must muster all our energy both outside and inside prison to villify our enemy. We the accused must become the accusers.</block>

<p>Having quoted that document in question the Minister looked across the floor at me and said: &#x201C;This is what they, the Communists, are doing and you are assisting them.&#x201D; Had the hon. the Minister made that statement anywhere but in this House I would have sued him for defamation to the tune of R100 000 or more. In conclusion I want to say that it is not I who stand accused of obstructing the cause of justice in this unhappy case, but that it is he and his henchmen who are doing so. That is all I have to say on the matter, but it does seem to me that fate has brought its own retribution to the man concerned. I want to assure the Minister that public apprehension and concern over this matter has by no means abated nor died away.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it was a very good thing that the National Party came into power in 1948. If one listens to the speeches which have come from the opposite side, this country would have been in the hands of the communists long ago if that had not been the case.

<p>Subsequently, after we had come into power in South Africa, we came across communists everywhere in South Africa. When we introduced legislation in 1950 to combat communism in South Africa, that side of this House opposed the Act. When we again introduced legislation in regard to communism in 1951, they acted in the same way again. In 1952 they pleaded that Sam Kahn should remain a member of this Parliament. In 1954 there was another amendment to the legislation in regard to communism, and the United Party opposed this once more. Sitting on that side of this House today, is one of the persons who also voted in favour of this Act on communism when we introduced it. This person is Mr. Japie Basson.

We would again have heard the cry that the individual was being deprived of his freedom. It is even being said today. The United Party would have failed to introduce any legislation to combat communism in this House of Assembly, and then not only the Whites would have suffered as a result of it; not only the Bantu, the Coloureds and the Indians would have suffered as a result of it, but all the peoples of South Africa would have been in slavery.

<p>Those are the people we had to deal with firmly because they wanted to undermine this State and our system of government. That state of affairs would have continued if this Government had not accepted legislation on communism. In 1950, when the Suppression of Communism Act was passed in this House, the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Strauss, said it was fascist despotism. He said the Minister was being given despotic powers, and that the measure was an unbearable infringement on the freedom of the citizens. Those same words are still being used today. Sir, I also have here what Gen. Smuts said once. Gen. Smuts said many things. The one day he advocated apartheid and the next day he did not support it. Gen. Smuts said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That new technique is what since the Spanish Revolution has come to be known as the Fifth Column. Its character is well known.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, what I believe we should be concerned about today is to ensure that in combating Communism we do not use the methods of Communism. The hon. member knows perfectly well that it is acceptable to us on this side of the House that a communist should be treated in the same way as a person found guilty of high treason in this country. That was the attitude of this side of the House. Sir, I want to come immediately again to one matter which I believe is causing concern in this country and which I believe does a lot of harm to the good name of South Africa, and that is the application of section 6 of the Terrorism Act. I believe that the hon. the Minister of Police, in dealing with the case of Mbombo. a witness in the Pietermaritzburg trial, has corrected what he stated in this House in regard to this Particular witness. This witness was detained in Cape Town in terms of section 6 (1) of the Terrorism Act on the 10th February, 1971, where he was held in solitary confinement as provided for in subsection (6). In other words, the Minister of Police accepts that it is obligatory in terms of subsection (6) to hold a person in solitary confinement. This man was later transferred to Pietermaritzburg, where he was held in the same cell with another detainee and was further interrogated after the 11th May. In other words, for three months he was in solitary confinement. He subsequently gave evidence on the 24th September for the State in the Pietermaritzburg trial and was thereafter released. The problem which arose in this particular case was this: This man was detained when he had been working continuously for a firm for a period of 18 years. Actually, the employers were anxious to know why this man had been detained. It is true that they were told, but they were merely told that he was being detained in terms of the Terrorism Act. Whether he was to be a witness or whether he was to be an accused, was never divulged, and in fact when a request was made, the information was refused. Now I would say this to the Minister of Justice, that I believe that in terms of section 6 (1) it is obligatory upon him to approve such conditions as are laid down by the commissioner. I know the hon. the Minister reads the word &#x201C;may&#x201D; as being applicable to him. I believe that that is a wrong interpretation and that the responsibility is on the Minister of Justice for any person held under section 6, in regard to the conditions under which he is held. In this particular case, what happened? The employer, the personnel manager of the firm, says that this man has a wife and three children and if he makes an allowance to that family he is likely to be in the same kettle as the various Christian church organizations are who get raided because they help the dependants of detainees. Sir, I believe the Minister is doing an injustice if employers are not informed as to why a person is held under this particular section. At least the employers should be informed. This man was eventually released in September and I might say that the only way in which the employers eventually found where he was, was when they read a newspaper report of the trial in Pietermaritzburg and saw his name as a witness. Sir, that is not the way to administer justice in this country, and I hope the Minister will look into this because it is doing incredible harm to the reputation of South Africa when these unnecessary acts are committed for the purpose of fighting terrorism.</p>

<p>I want to go on to one or two other matters in the short time left to me. I want to ask the hon. the Minister of Justice whether<span class="col_7077-7078" refersTo="page_0493"/> he will not motivate some action in regard to the consolidation of the laws relating to the expropriation of property in this country. At present the expropriation powers are contained in some twenty four Acts of Parliament and more than half a dozen provincial ordinances. Those powers stretch from one ministry to another. They are not restricted to Community Development or Education but they stretch over the whole spectrum and I believe the Minister would be doing a great service if he were to instigate an investigation by possibly the Law Revision Committee into this question of consolidation of expropriation laws of South Africa. I believe there are two things. The one is the codification of a set of rules for determining compensation when a person is deprived of his property and the second aspect is the uniformity of procedure. The hon. the Minister will know that the Expropriation Act of 1965 gives the power to the lower courts for amounts up to R3 000 and to the Supreme Court for amounts above that figure. But I believe attention should be given to the possibility of establishing, as is done in other countries, a land tribunal as a division of the Supreme Court to deal with these questions of expropriation and the settlement of compensation.</p>

<p>That brings me to a another aspect of the administration of justice in this country, an aspect which I believe needs the attention of the hon. the Minister and that is the handling of commercial litigation in this country. The Minister will be aware that the president of the Association of Law Societies has recently suggested what he terms a &#x201C;commercial division&#x201D; of the Supreme Court. The mere fact that most commercial disputes these days are not taken to the courts but are taken to privately arranged arbitration, indicates that there is something wrong in regard to that aspect of justice. I believe that one of the matters is that there is unnecessary publicity attached to what is essentially private litigation between the parties. That matter can easily be dealt with in the same way as it is dealt with by the special income tax court, whereby the facts can be reported and the law can be known and the decisions can be made known without in-dentifying necessarily the persons involved in the litigation. I hope that matter will also receive the attention of the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to come to the question of the State&#x2019;s responsibility for legal costs when officials of the State are involved in litigation. The Minister of Justice advised me in reply to questions that in dealing with the case in which the hon. the Minister of Community Development was involved, payment was ordinarily made in accordance with the fixed policy where Ministers or officers are involved in litigation in the execution of their duties, and that that was the case here. One can understand that litigation arises where a police officer in the discharge of his duties uses more force than the court finds was justified, but I cannot for a moment see how the Minister can justify meeting the costs of an action which is brought about by the loose tongue of a Minister in carrying out his functions as a Minister. The Minister of Community Development used unnecessarily harsh language towards municipal officials, as was found by the judge in this case. The whole matter could have been settled amicably had the Minister of Community Development not adopted an attitude of not being prepared to make such apology or <i>amende honorable</i> right at the commencement of these proceedings. The result is that the State has had to pay the costs. The disbursements were R34 000 and in addition to that there are the costs of the State Attorney, another R6 000 which brings it up to R40 000. The Minister shakes his head. The attorneys&#x2019; fees for the plaintiff, for party and party costs, were taxed at R6 000 and I would assume that the attorney and client costs, as between the Minister and the State Attorney, would not be less then the party and party costs, so that brings it to the tune of R40 000. I believe the Minister and the Government were wrong in accepting responsibility in this particular matter because of the very nature of the action. Secondly, when it comes to ministerial involvement in litigation, one must remember that there is a difference between a Minister and an official. The official is subject to disciplinary action in so far as exceeding his authority is concerned. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>I think I must respond at once to what the hon. member for Green Point said in respect of the case of the 13 who were convicted in Pietermaritzburg. The position in regard to the person detained there&#x2014;the hon. member knows to whom I am referring&#x2014;is that he was an accused.

<p>As far as I know the employer was told that he was being detained, but the reason was not divulged.

<p>He was detained among the accused from the beginning. He was detained among them for the simple reason that if they had taken him away, they would have known immediately that he was going to give evidence against them. He was detained with them for a considerable period of time until it penetrated through to them later that suspicion was being cast on him, and at that stage they removed him at once because they feared for his life.

There was nothing strange about it. The person co-operates with them; he is going to be their witness. This is what happened to him. He was eventually paid his witness money.

<p>Well, I do not know. However, according to law, he is entitled to it and could do so. I do not know whether he did so, but it appears to me that he did.</p>

<p>I come now to the question of expropriation. I do not want to say much, except to mention that a departmental committee is investigating in this regard at the moment. The Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure and others are involved in it. At present the report is being awaited; it will be handled by the hon. the Minister of Agriculture and submitted to the Cabinet later. Therefore the whole question is being considered at present.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of commercial courts. I think Mr. Malherbe expressed an excellent idea here. The suggestion in fact comes from Mr. Malherbe, who is the present president of the Association of Law Societies. It is something one may consider. I shall ask my department to investigate the matter and after the arguments have been heard and if it still appears necessary, it may be referred to the Law Revision Committee. If such a proposal is submitted to me, I shall consider it. Basically, it seems to me as if it is something worth considering.</p>

<p>Then we come to the question of legal fees. This is a matter which we have discussed at length and I do not believe one can say much more about the various aspects. The fact is that it is the policy of this Government to pay and to accept responsibility. When the opposite side of this House comes into power, they are free to modify this system. In the meantime, however, it remains in force. If the hon. member thinks it is wrong, he should use the political platforms in order to convince the people that they should kick out the Government and place them in its place. [Interjections.] Of course, that is the way to do it.</p>

<p>Hon. members can like or dislike it, but that is what is taking place at the moment. It is going to remain like that as long as this Government remains in power. That is the position. We need not argue over<span class="col_7081-7082" refersTo="page_0495"/> it. The correct way is to persuade the electorate that we are incapable of ruling the country and that the hon. members over there should be placed in power. Hon. members are at liberty to do that, by all means.</p>

<p>*But what foolishness we have here! In the past mention was also made of disciplinary action. I remained silent on purpose, perhaps for good reason. But this time I am going to say this. Who tells hon. members that a Minister is not subject to disciplinary measures? Where do hon. members get hold of that story? [Interjections.] The Prime Minister may dismiss any Minister who makes a mistake in this regard, early tomorrow. What greater disciplinary powers can there be? Therefore hon. members should rid themselves of this nonsense about the question of disciplinary steps. Discuss these matters with the electorate, convince them, accept the Government and change the position.</p>

<speech by="#coetsee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to ask the Minister whether it has come to his notice that the Hotel Association, Fedhasa, has started a fund known as the Trade Defence Fund. It seems to me to be a strange step for an association such as the Hotel Association to take, and consequently I should like to know from the hon. the Minister whether he has any information in this regard.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I now wish to revert to a matter which poses a threat to the safety of the State and which aims at the destruction of our legal system. This Committee will recollect that during discussions on the Vote of the hon. the Prime Minister, attention was drawn to a speech delivered by Mr. Derek Watterson in November, 1971 in the Natal Provincial Council. As a member of the Executive Council, Mr. Watterson must be considered as one of the most important spokesmen of the United Party. After all, Natal is the only province that is being governed by the United Party. May I remind the Committee that the gist of his speech was (a) that Cabinet Ministers know that their policies are driving us to a situation which we may not be able to contain. Evidently he was referring to the position on our borders. In respect of his second point, I quote from his speech as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If this blood is shed that the Ministers keep on telling us is going to be shed&#x2014;and remember that in the last month or so at least three Ministers have come out with this sort of blood and thunder stuff&#x2014;then I would say that cetain of these Cabinet Ministers, knowing that they have created the situation, knowing that they have driven this country into a situation of bloodshed, may have to answer as criminals against the State of South Africa.</block>

<p>It is also significant that Mr. Watterson lives in Durban and apparently shares a portion of his constituency with the hon. member for Durban North.</p>

<speech by="#coetsee">

<from>Mr <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>It is also significant, Mr. Chairman, that in the self same speech and in the same context, Mr. Watterson, referring to the motion he was discussing, according to his Hansard, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is the motion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; is merely trying to make as clear as possible to the public that this country is in a parlous state. I have and my colleagues have tried to make this clear. We are not treating this purely and simply as a political platform. There is no election in the offing but we do believe that even as a result of ministerial statements that we must say our piece to let the country know what we think.</block>

<p>We on this side agree most wholeheartedly with Mr. Watterson that the country should know what the United Party is thinking. In the course of his speech, Mr. Watterson, in order to strengthen his argument, referred to the courts which dealt with criminals against humanity after the last war. It is obvious, Mr. Chairman, that Mr. Watterson has the Nuremberg model for South Africa in mind. It will also be recalled that during the Vote of the hon. Prime Minister, the United Party and the hon. member for Durban North, as spokesman for Justice, were challenged to say whether they supported Mr. Watterson or not. They, however, preferred to remain silent on this topic, and so they have to this very day. We on this side of the House maintain that we are entitled to construe their silence and reticence as<span class="col_7083-7084" refersTo="page_0496"/> support for Mr. Watterson, just as we are entitled to conclude that Mr. Watterson has voiced the thoughts of his United Party colleagues in the Natal Provincial Council in what he in fact said. Mr. Chairman, the implications of what I call the Watterson-Nuremberg plan are clear, and I wish to spell them out today to the United Party.</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) Retribution against the National Party will be put into operation when the United Party comes into power and capital punishment is included in the programme; that is obvious;</li>

<li>(b) despite the fact that our hon. Cabinet Ministers are carrying out the policies of the National Party by virtue of their election to the office in terms of the South Africa Act, our Constitution, which we regard as a holy pillar of democracy, and at least of Afrikaner nationalism, our Cabinet Ministers will be put to trial for so-called offences against the State;</li>

<li>(c) to achieve this Watterson-Nuremberg plan, it is clear that the United Party, and then in person the hon. member for Durban North, would have to overthrow our Constitution, and would have to act against its very spirit, hence against democracy itself.</li>

</ol>

<p>Therefore we maintian that the Watterson-Nuremberg plan poses a serious threat to the safety and security of the State. Furthermore, to execute the Watterson-Nuremberg plan, either our existing courts would have to be degraded to political weapons or a new legal system would have to be introduced. In both instances the sanctity of our courts is at stake. You will recall, Mr. Chairman, that on Wednesday night the hon. member for Durban North, with a halo around his head, was paying lip service to the sanctity of the courts. Now he is silent.</p>

<p>I have only mentioned a few of many serious implications of the Watterson-Nuremberg plan. In view thereof, the lip service to which I have just referred, becomes the laughing stock of this House. In fact&#x2014; now I shall express myself in jargon wellknown to the United Party&#x2014;people are suspicious that Mr. Watterson has active accomplices even outside the provincial council, and people are suspicious that the chief perpetrators of the Watterson-Nuremberg plan are sitting in this hon. House. Indeed, this whole plan, coming from a man who cannot even speak Afrikaans, has the smell of conspiracy and of the death of the Republic.</p>

<p>The hon. member who represents Bloemfontein West was probably too young to exercise an option at that time, but judging from what he has said today there is no doubt in my mind which way his option would have been exercised.</p>

<p>Let me come back to the hon. the Minister. The hon. the Minister, when dealing with the question of appointments to the Bench and the position of the Bench and the Bar, mentioned the position in Natal in the latter part of the colonial regime. This really surprised me and I cannot think why he should have mentioned it. It is common knowledge amongst the lawyers of this country that during the period the hon. the Minister mentioned, from about 1900 to 1910, Natal had one of the weakest Benches in the country. This is common knowledge. Indeed, there are jokes told at the Bar that &#x2026; [Interjections.]</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The interesting point is why the Natal Bench was weak at that time. It was weak at that time because there was no Bar in existence in Natal from which the judges could be chosen. It was weak for the very reason given by the hon. member for Durban North, namely because judges were appointed from a variety of positions in the State, other than the Bar. They were civil servants, they were ex-magistrates, they were law officers of the Crown, or law officers in the armed services. All these people were appointed to the Bench, and because they did not have the training and the discipline which a Bar engenders, you had one of the weakest Benches in the country in Natal at that time.</p>

<speech by="#greyling">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>That is an absurd argument.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>At that time they had a system which went on until the mid-1930&#x2019;s in Natal, which was known as<span class="col_7087-7088" refersTo="page_0498"/> the dual practice, that is to say, persons practised as attorneys and there was no Bar. From the time of the establishment of the Bar in Natal, you had a change, and today Natal has, acknowledged amongst all the lawyers of this country, one of the finest Benches in the country because it has a strong Bar. It is not a strong Bench which makes a strong Bar. It is the other way round; it is a strong Bar which makes a strong Bench, provided your appointments come from that source. One of the reasons, indeed, the principal reason, why the Bench in South Africa together with the Benches of one or two other countries in the world, like Great Britain and one or two others, stand so high wherever you go in the world, including the United Nations of all places, is that South Africa is one of the few countries that has a separate Bar from the Side-bar, a separate institution. It is this institution which breeds a strong Bench provided, and to make the point that the hon. member for Durban North made, you make your appointments to the Bench from that source and from no other source. That is the principal objection we have against the point of view apparently expressed by the hon. the Minister. I say the point &#x201C;apparently&#x201D; expressed by the hon. the Minister, because after the hon. the Minister has spoken for over two hours we still do not know what his point of view is on the appointment of judges from the magisterial bench.</p>

<p>I should like to raise with the hon. the Minister another point which I hope he will clear up. There was a joint statement by this hon. Minister and the hon. the Minister of Bantu Adiministration and Development on 29th March in regard to responsibility for the magisterial districts in Natal. There was a statement that certain changes were to take place in the administration between the Department of Bantu Affairs and the Department of Justice in regard to these magisterial districts. The statement which was made is ambiguous; it is not clear, firstly, as to why these changes are being made. Apparently it is brought about because the Bantu Reserves are to be administered by the Government of Kwazulu so far as the administration of justice is concerned, while White areas are to be administered by the departments of the South African Government. I do not understand why a magisterial district, for example, which was formerly administered by the Department of Bantu Administration, is now to be administered by the Departments of Bantu Administration and Justice while one which was formerly administered by the Department of Bantu Administration will now be administered only by the Department of Justice. I do not understand how this will facilitate the administration of the Reserves by the relevant department of the Government of Kwazulu unless there is to be a complete realignment of the magisterial districts so that the Department of Justice of this Government administers only the White areas and the Department of Kwazulu administers only the Native Reserves. That is not what is said in the statement. The statement is ambiguous and lacking in clarity. I hope the hon. the Minister will find the opportunity to tell us what the position is in that regard.</p>

<p>The other thing is that he says in the statement that interested parties will have to be consulted and for that reason this will be a very slow process. Who has to be consulted? It strikes me that this is a matter only between the various Government departments, or do others come into the picture, If so, who is it that has to be consulted and what form will this changeover and this slow process take? I could understand it if the hon. the Minister were to say that all the Native Reserves will be under the Justice Department of Kwazulu and that all the White areas will be under the Department of Justice of this Government. But that is not what the statement says. So far as I can judge, there is confusion in this regard. I understand further that in this change-over the hon. the Minister will have, is certain districts, joint control with the Department of Bantu Administration and the Department of Justice because you have, for example. Bantu townships in the White areas. But that is the case with virtually every magisterial district you deal with. There are substantial numbers of Bantu people resident either on the farms or in the Bantu townships in whichever White area you go to in Natal. That being so, one would assume that every magisterial district would be under the joint control of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department and the Department of Bantu Administration. That is not so. This has caused a certain amount of confusion and a certain amount of anxiety, because despite what is said in the statement, people regard changes in this direction as indicative of changes of land ownership as between the White Republic and<span class="col_7089-7090" refersTo="page_0499"/> Kwazulu. That is why it is necessary that this matter be cleared up. If the hon. the Minister could find the opportunity of doing so in this debate, I would be grateful. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice_and_of_prisons">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE AND OF PRISONS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in regard to the last matter the position is that the Kwazulu Administration has already been established. As regards the consultation, this must be settled between the two departments, because it concerns making it White in the White areas and Black in the Black areas. That is the position. Furthermore I assume that the Bantu locations, the residential areas of the Bantu in the White area, will form part of the White area. This is my contention and I think it is in fact the case. I think that is a full reply to the hon. member&#x2019;s question. In other words, the hon. member&#x2019;s interpretation is quite correct in regard to why it is being done. He is quite right as regards the consultation; it is between the two departments. It is also correct that the areas which are going to become White will be administered by the Department of Justice, and those that are going to become Black will become Bantu magisterial districts or Bantu Commissioner districts under the Zulu Government. The locations will be regarded as part of the White area.</p>

<p>I can just tell the hon. member in passing that as regards the judges of Natal, I do not know the history of the matter. I quoted them last time because Ellison Kahn happened to mention them. In addition I just want to tell him that I have further particulars of other judges who were appointed. There was Sir William Henry Solomon&#x2014;I do not know what he was, but the Solomons are a well-known legal family. Another one who was appointed was Sir Michael Henry Calway. That was very long ago. Apparently he was attorney-general in Natal between 1857 and 1890. I mention this for what it is worth. Someone who was really an outstanding man was Johan Hendrik de Villiers. He eventually became judge president and he was a figure on the Bench.</p>

<p>I mentioned Lansdown this morning. I did not really make as issue of it. Now the hon. member says I did not take a stand in regard to the question of whether they are to be appointed or not. I quite agree that a good Bench develops, <i>inter alia,</i> from a good Bar. That is so. That is the right line of reasoning and I do respect it. It is my opinion as well, but my contention is that the people and the judge of the Eastern Cape division said that the magistrates cannot be fearlessly independent. The member over there on the other side, the main speaker on Justice, also said so. I did not express an opinion on whether they are in fact to be appointed or not. I do not have to express an opinion at this stage either. It is not a matter which was raised by me or by the magistrates. In fact, I must emphasize that the magistrates themselves expressed an opinion on this matter. The judge and the member for Durban North accused of wanting to manipulate, of wanting to do something as untoward as that, and of not having said anything. The Association of Magistrates told the Secretary: &#x201C;You tell the judge, on our behalf, that no pressure is exerted on us at any time, that we are absolutely independent.&#x201D; Surely this is the right way to do it. There are other people who say whether they are being influenced. In regard to the real question, whether they are to be appointed or not, I just pointed out that this point of view, that they cannot be fearless and independent, it is the greatest nonsense in the world. Furthermore I said that the hon. member could convince me in other ways and on other points, but that he could forget about the fearlessness and the independence.</p>

<p>I must say I find it very strange that the hon. member did not reply to what was said by the hon. member for Bloemfontein West. Why does the hon. member not reply to it? Why does he not repudiate Watterson? Why does the hon. member not repudiate that person? I think I should be one of those persons who would have to appear before the Nuremberg Court if these people were to come into power.</p>

Today the hon. the Prime Minister gave notice of legislation relating to state security. In that debate, and in the debate on the General Law Amendment Bill which will be introduced towards the end of the session, we shall have speeches from this side of the House and it will be placed on record, beyond any doubt, what the United Party&#x2019;s record has been in respect of State security legislation in this House since the Communism Act was piloted through this House in 1950.

<p>I should like to associate myself with the remarks made by the hon. the Minister of Justice this morning with regard to the hon. member for Durban North. We have become used to setting ourselves certain ethical codes in this House. One of those ethical codes is that the front benchers on our side&#x2014;our Ministry&#x2014;and those on the other side, the senior members of the Opposition who are known as the shadow ministers, or the chairmen of their groups &#x2014;act with the required dignity of speech in this House. I personally, as a fellow legal practitioner, looked to the hon. member for Durban North, who does not even have the decency to listen to what I am saying to him now &#x2026;</p>

<p>That Boerehater should just keep quiet, so that I can talk to him. Over the years I was one of the people who looked up to the hon. member as the chairman of the Justice Group of the opposite side. I want to tell hon. members that as I sat listening to the hon. member on Wednesday evening, I asked myself: &#x201C;Mike Mitchell, could you be more petty than this?&#x201D; That, in actual fact, is the impression he left on this House, and I want to make a serious request to the hon. member to show the courage and the decency this afternoon to get up&#x2014;he may differ from the hon. the Minister of Justice as much as he likes&#x2014;and at least tell the hon. the Minister of Justice, one of the greatest gentlemen in this House, that he had no reason whatsoever for speaking as disparagingly about the person of the hon. the Minister as he did on Wednesday evening. If the hon. member for Durban North wants to do this, I do not think he would sink in anyone&#x2019;s estimation in this House. On the contrary, he would be making a contribution to giving one new respect for him. For the rest, he may differ as strongly as he likes with the hon. the Minister of Justice on the particular aspects of his argument, but I think he could at least do this, and when he has done so we should once again like to debate matters with him across the floor of this House.</p>

<p>I expect the hon. member to reply, because I know him as someone who will reply; that is why I am talking to him across the floor of this House. The hon. member for Durban North became particularly acrimonious here about the possible appointment of senior regional court magistrates to the bench. As was quoted by the hon. the Minister of Justice, the hon. member had suggested in interviews with the Press that one of his gravest concerns was that the State, the Government, would be able to influence such magistrates, or would be able to direct their thinking along avenues which would suit the Minister and other political leaders. What did the hon. member for Durban North do in one of his statements with reference to the ffrench-Beytagh trial? In the <i>Sunday Express</i> of<span class="col_7093-7094" refersTo="page_0501"/> 16th April of this year, the hon. member said that that was exactly what he expected from the hon. the Minister of Justice and from the Minister of Police, because he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Ministers concerned should have seen to it that the whole case against the Dean was handled with far more diplomacy and circumspection. One wonders what control is being exercised by Mr. Pelser and by the Minister of Police, Mr. Louwrens Muller, in the institution of proceedings in a matter such as this.</block>

<p>&#x201C;What control is being exercised?&#x201D; In other words, here the hon. member for Durban North was implying that the two hon. Ministers should have interfered with the rights Attorneys-General have to exercise in cases of this nature. Later in the same report one finds confirmation of this standpoint adopted by the hon. member. Sir, I do not want to express an opinon here on the question of whether senior regional court magistrates should be appointed to the bench, but I just want to say that the hon. member should not act as sanctimoniously as he did the other evening on the possibility of these people being influenced, while he himself, in the case of the Anglican Deacon, when it suited him, asked why the Ministers had not interfered with the Attorney-General in the exercising of his rights, and why they had not interfered with the Police. Sir, I do not think it is worthwhile to argue any further with the hon. member. I feel as loathe to have further arguments with him as the hon. the Minister of Justice did this morning.</p>

<p>I should like to raise another matter which arises from this to a certain extent. I want to ask the hon. the Minister of Justice whether he would not be so kind as to inform the Committee later in the debate on this Vote, if it suits him to do so, of the possibility of granting civil jurisdiction to regional courts, and of what the scope of such jurisdiction would be. Personally I think it would be a very interesting and fine development in our courts if civil jurisdiction could be granted to our regional courts. I do not think any one of us doubt the ability of members of the side bar to hold their own in those courts, even if enhanced jurisdiction were to be granted to them. This offers a great many advantages. We certainly cannot continue with the position as it is at present in some divisions of the Supreme Court owing to the pressure of work. The granting of civil jurisdiction to regional courts will also have a good effect on the reduction of costs for litigants; it will be far more convenient because it will be possible to deal with more cases locally. This offers many advantages, and I would appreciate it if the hon. the Minister could give us an indication in this regard.</p>

<p>Another matter I should like to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister is one concerning the Liquor Act. I am very glad to see that the Secretary for Justice envisages in his report that a new line of thought will probably be introduced next year as far as the Liquor Act is concerned. Sir, there are members of Fedhasa who are apparently very concerned about the whole question of off-sales and also about the whole question of non-White bars. The matter I actually want to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister, is the question of off-sales. I should like to refer him to a statement dated 17th June, 1970. purported to have been made by Mr. Le Roux, the Chairman of the National Liquor Board. The statement reads as follows (translation)</p>

<block name="quote">It is my impression that Whites are rebelling more and more against the behaviour of non-Whites who consume liquor in White areas. I should not like to hazard a prediction, but it would seem to me as though inquiries of this nature, as to whether the supply of liquor to certain persons or in certain areas will be prohibited, will increase in number&#x2026;</block>

<p>He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It would also seem to me that the pressure exerted on Whites for the closing of all liquor facilities for non-Whites in White areas will increase, and I include off-sales in this.</block>

<p>It is in fact on account of this that concern has been expressed to me. and if the hon. the Minister would be so kind as to give a little more clarity about this, perhaps by way of repetition, I would particularly appreciate it.</p>

<p>Then, with reference to this, in regard to the activities of the National Liquor Board, I want to say that it has been published fairly extensively that members of<span class="col_7095-7096" refersTo="page_0502"/> the Liquor Board will shortly accompany the Chairman and one or two other officials of the Liquor Board on an overseas visit. This will be an extended visit to various countries of Europe and the two Americas, something which certainly is quite necessary and will give good results. But now it appears that only a few members of the National Liquor Board will be going on this visit, and not the others. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister would not be so kind as to give this House an explanation of the whole object and scope of the visit. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>It is rather difficult to discuss a matter with the hon. the Minister of Justice, when the information or the facts upon which he debates are different from the facts with which we on this side of the House have been supplied by the hon. the Minister of Police. Let me come back to this question of detention under section 6. In terms of section 6 (1) of the Terrorism Act, a person who is to be kept for interrogation may be kept at such place in the Republic and subject to such conditions as the commissioner may, subject to the direction of the Minister, from time to time determine. As I read that, the Minister has a continuing responsibility when once a person is detained in terms of section 6. It is not that he &#x201C;may&#x201D; intervene, but that he has a continuing responsibility in regard to that person&#x2019;s detention. Now in the case of Mbombo, this man was detained, according to the Minister of Police, by the Police on 10th February, 1971. The information was only given to his employer and to his next-of-kin that he had been detained under the Terrorism Act. No information was available as to whether he was an accused or whether he was merely being held for interrogation. As I understand the Minister of Justice, he understands that this man was kept as an ordinary arrested man until such time as he agreed to give evidence, or it was decided that he would give evidence, and he was then kept apart for his protection.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister is in direct conflict with what the Minister of Police has told us. The Minister of Police tells us that this man was in solitary confinement until 11th May, probably from 10th February to 11th May. After 11th May, he was then kept with other prisoners or detainees, and he was investigated and interrogated, and it was only on 24th September, the day he gave evidence, that it was decided to use him as a State witness.</p>

<p>Under what powers was he detained for the second time?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Well, he was detained continuously from 10th February to 24th September, the first three months being in solitary confinement. Now the Minister of Police, correcting the reply he gave in the House, says that he was later transferred to Pietermaritzburg, where he was held in the same cell with another detainee and he was further interrogated from 11th May until his release on 24th September. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When the State Advocate decided on the 24th September that Mbombo should be used as a State witness, he was immediately released from detention.</block>

<p>Now, Sir, what are the facts? This is the confusion which arises because the hon. the Minister of Justice himself has not been applying his mind to his responsibilities under section 6 (1) of this Act.</p>

<p>There is another matter concerning the application of this Act. If one reads the letter of the hon. the Minister of Police, it would appear that the Police are interpreting section 6 (6) as being obligatory that a person detained for interrogation shall be detained in solitary confinement. In other words, if a person is detained under section 6, it is obligatory that he should be detained in solitary confinement. We have never heard that advanced by the hon. the Minister of Justice. I have never had that reason.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>After he had given a statement to the Police, one would expect that he should have been detained for his protection, and not placed amongst the accused. This is the sort of administration of this Act that causes disquiet. There can be no reason why a man who has been in one job with one employer for a period of 18 years and who is to give evidence in a Terrorism trial case&#x2014;which he gave and in respect of which the judge commented very favourably&#x2014;should be kept from 10th February to the 24th September in detention and for three months thereof in solitary confinement. He was detained with no concern whatsoever, except for the charitable act of the employer as to what was to happen to his dependants. No allowance was paid while at the end a lump sum of R220 was paid out to him. When certain persons and churches feel it their Christian duty to look after these dependants, they are immediately accused of aiding saboteurs. I believe this to be a wrong which should be put right by this hon. Minister. It should be assured that when people are detained in this way and are necessarily detained under the conditions that the Minister sets down under section (1), that there should be provision for the welfare of the next of kin of the person concerned, particularly in the case of a witness. Witness&#x2019;s fees are paid afterwards. The hon. the Minister said a few moments ago that if this man now claims compensation, he will get it. But what was to happen to his family in the meantime? I believe that this is a matter which we should look into so that we are not going to use the methods of Communism to combat Communism and terrorism.</p>

<p>I want to return to the question of legal costs. The hon. the Minister says that we can argue as much as we like and that it was a Government decision. It is most extraordinary that the Minister involved in this litigation wrote an article in which he said that the plaintiffs could hide behind their city council if they wanted to, but he, the hon. the Minister, was not going to hide behind the Government. He went on to say: This is a personal matter between him and me, and I will not hide behind the Government. If that is so, why must this charitable act of paying R40 000 of the taxpayers&#x2019; money be offered to the Minister? Why must this be done? The hon. the Minister of Community Development himself acknowledged that this was a personal matter in which he had chosen to use language which was subsequently regarded by the judges, shall I say, as improper to be used. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether that is going to be the criterion in future, no matter whether personal actions are involved, personal actions falling outside the scope of a Minister&#x2019;s normal duties. I cannot see that it is within the scope of the function of the Minister to defame officials of municipalities. If that is going to be the case, there is no limit to the Government&#x2019;s use of the taxpayers&#x2019; money to pay for litigation brought upon themselves by members of the Cabinet. I believe this to be a wrong decision and one which should not have been adopted by the Government. I believe this to be a decision which will not bring credit to the actions of this Government in so far as dealing with members of the Cabinet is concerned.</p>

<p>These are the people who refer from time to time to the &#x201C;police state&#x201D; in which we are supposed to live. The hon. member for Durban North and others, as well as the hon. member for Houghton, come to this House from time to time with questions which, on the surface, appear completely innocent, while a barb is contained in each of them. It is these hon. members who come with speeches which always contain in simuations and which art aimed at undermining our jurisdiction in this country, which is in fact our greatest asset and of the most distinguished in the world. They are accessories in undermining it, sabotaging it and in subverting it. It is the hon. member for Durban North and his colleagues who, by means of these sweeping statements which one sees in the <i>Sunday Times</i> and other newspapers every week, are not only harming our jurisdiction, but in truth placing it under suspicion and completely breaking it down in the outside world. As a result of that, one finds students on the campus of the Witwatersrand University who are already imitating what these hon. members say. They say it is a police state and that there is no freedom of thought in this country. Where do you think those students get these ideas from, Sir? It is as they are prompted by people such as the hon. member for Durban North. He, who is a senior member of the legal profession, should know better. He should know that it is the aim of this Government and of everyone in this country to keep our jurisdiction absolutely above suspicion and above all criticism. He knows we would rather&#x2014;this was proved very clearly recently again&#x2014;let 99 guilty people go than convict one innocent person. This is the norm of our jurisdiction in this country, and we cannot understand why the hon. member, who is a member of the profession, and his colleagues, are not proud of this achievement as well. Surely it is part of their profession. The reason must probably be that when they speak here, they speak as members of the United Party. Then they have that warped sense of justice which is characteristic of the United Party, not only this afternoon, but through all these years. The same United Party which governed the country during the war years, is still sitting on the opposite side of this House. It is that United Party which, on the flimsiest of evidence, on the statement of a complainant, regardless of who or what he was, was prepared to grasp a man by the scruff of his neck and throw him into an internment camp&#x2014; then they are the people to talk of &#x201C;detention without trial&#x201D;.

Some of them are sitting in this House today. That United Party on the opposite side went even further. The United Party are the people who sometimes put innocent children into internment camps. Let them deny it! I maintain that if it were ever to happen that the United Party came into power again, as shamelessly as it is sitting in a glass house, it would not hesitate to imprison Afrikaners, nationalists, again on any pretext. In the same way as they did so during those years on the pretext of &#x201C;there is a war on&#x201D;, they will do so again, although it may merely be the war in Vietnam or wherever it may be. They would push us as Afrikaners into internment camps again.</p>

<p>Let this be a lesson particularly to the Afrikaners of Brakpan. Let them take note of this. I want to predict&#x2014;that if the United Party came into power, this is what would happen; because it has only been a United Party Government which has put Afrikaners into gaol.

<p>Sir, before I become excited, I want to discuss another matter. The legal profession is indeed, as has been said, notoriously conservative in its view of matters. But we are also prepared to adjust gradually as it may become necessary in our modern society, and especially in a multi-national<span class="col_7101-7102" refersTo="page_0505"/> country such as South Africa. That is why we disposed of the jury system in the course of time. That is why we introduced regional courts which in fact to a large extent perform the task which was performed in the past by the circuit courts. We have the position that where circuit courts sometimes sat for as long as three weeks and a month in the rural areas, this system has been replaced by the regional courts and consequently this bothersome, clumsy procedure has been eliminated to a large extent. But, Sir, to link up with what the hon. member for Potchefstroom said, I want to ask the Minister to consider extending the jurisdiction of our magistrates&#x2019; courts and, in addition to that, introducing regional magistrates as presiding officers with increased jurisdiction.

He and his colleagues obviously took very little notice of what the hon. the Minister appealed for, namely a calm discussion of a Vote such as the Justice Vote. I would also like to remind that hon. member as well that this side of the House during the course of this Vote, has not been critical of the standard of justice as dispensed from the Bench. We have not been critical of our system of justice as conducted by our judges and our magistrates, as conducted by our judiciary. The objective of this side of the House has been to be critical of the Minister, because he has a department for which a large amount of money is required to be voted for the administration of that department. Irrespective of what the thinking is with regard to how this criticism has been expressed, that is nevertheless what has been done by members on this side of the House. We have been critical of the actual administration of the department.</p>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to go into detail now. I am merely reminding the hon. member who has just sat down, that his premises were entirely wrong, because far from a discussion on Justice, one would have imagined that this was some other debate, such as possibly a no-confidence debate or any other debate which could deal with any aspect of the country&#x2019;s affairs. I think we should confine ourselves, as the hon. the Minister has said, to the Justice Vote with which we are dealing.</p>

<p>I want to deal with a specific aspect of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department and ask him whether he could perhaps give some attention to this particular matter. I refer to the question of the erosion of our system of deeds registration, or to be a little more to the point about the matter, of the registration of ownership of property and all that goes with it in our country. This question of deeds registration is an age-old system. If the hon. the Minister has an opportunity of studying it. I will give him references to an article later&#x2014;he will find that it was already prevalent in the fourth and fifth centuries. In the time of the Romans already a system for the transference of land ownership was in vogue. It was then done in the form of some symbolical means of transfer. This system was developed so that during the eighth century, it became the practice for a local judicial officer to conduct these formalities. Thereafter, in Holland, from which country a great deal of our laws stem, in the year 1217 the principle of <i>coram lege loci</i> was established, namely to appear before some judicial tribunal in order to effect transfer. We in South Africa will find that almost within five or six years of the landing of Van Riebeeck, the <i>corum lege loci</i> was already established in regard to the transfer of property. About 100 years ago the first deeds registry was actually established in the Northern Cape. The history of deeds registration, the system of ensuring a form of security to those who acquire property, has therefore been something which has been the concern of all forms of regulated societies over almost the last 2 000 years. We in South Africa have always been very proud indeed of the system which we believed we had perfected to a very great extent. It is now regarded as being part and parcel of a well established system of registration in this country. There has been a tendency of late for Government departments, through legislation dealing with the acquisition of land, to erode this system and the essential formalities by providing a system of endorsement of title so that the transference of title takes place purely by the provision of some certificate or letter from a department to the effect that an endorsement should be made on the title deed. I think this is not very sound. We have criticized it from time to time in discussions over the various<span class="col_7103-7104" refersTo="page_0506"/> pieces of legislation that have appeared before the House, but I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that he should give a little more thought to this matter and perhaps give a policy statement himself, not necessarily today, but perhaps at some time when his own department has been able to investigate this matter more thoroughly. I would refer the Minister to the very interesting address which was delivered recently by the hon. Mr. Justice De Vos Hugo, the judge-president of the Northern Cape Division of the Supreme Court. I found it an extremely fascinating story. One does not have the time to go into all the details. I merely want to give the hon. the Minister a bird&#x2019;s eye-view of the extent of the principle that was here evolved. Almost since the birth of our knowledge of judicial systems, we have had this question of land registration as an important factor. I do think that this is something to which a lot of thought should be given.</p>

<p>In the few more minutes that remain to me, I would like to deal with this question of solitary confinement. I want to deal with it in relation to section 215<i>bis</i> of the Criminal Procedure Act. I want to talk purely as a citizen without necessarily having a technical legal view-point about it. It must be perturbing to a citizen that solitary confinement, which is one of the most harsh sentences that one can pass, and, as we have known in earlier times, has been passed when people were declard habitual criminals or when they had committed some serious breach of prison regulations, could become something that could be used perhaps with more regularity than one would like to see in circumstances which I do not think fully warrant it. I know what section 6 of the Terrorism Act says, and I know that the question of detaining a person is not made entirely clear. If someone is detained alone in a cell, one must obviously look upon it as a form of solitary confinement. I am really concerned with this other section which deals with it from a point of view of the detention of a witness. Mr. Justice Botha, whose remarks are contained in the report of the commission of enquiry into criminal procedure and evidence, took the attitude that has been adopted on this side of the House. In paragraph 11.20.7. of the report he says the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It cannot be denied that it is in the interests of the administration of criminal justice &#x2026; (to have a witness) present at the trial to give his evidence freely and without fear.</block>

<p>He also says that witnesses should be available at trials and that they should not be intimidated or tampered with. In the following paragraph he says the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is on the other hand equally in the public interest that, except in abnormal circumstances where the safety of the State itself is threatened, the liberty of the individual should not be arbitrarily interfered with or should not be interfered with to a greater extent than is essential for the maintenance of the public welfare.</block>

<p>This is a very serious statement. I want to tell the Minister of a case which I had not so long ago where a person was charged with culpable homicide, the victim having been killed in a motor accident. He left a family consisting of a wife and two children. When the case was brought before the courts, the principal witness could not be found. I discovered later what the reason was. He did not appear. The case was remanded, and at the second hearing the witness again did not appear. The court then heard formal evidence and the accused was found not guilty and discharged. But because of an effort through my own office&#x2014;in fact, personal investigation on my own part&#x2014;we were eventually able to trace the whereabouts of this important witness. We found him in the Northern Transvaal. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as regards the enquiries of the hon. member who has just sat down, I believe the hon. the Minister will duly react to them. I think the hon. member is correct in saying that one may be critical. One ought to be critical, but never insulting. I am also pleased the hon. member for Jeppes had accepted the guidance of the hon. the Minister and continued this debate in a cool and calm manner. This brings me to the idea that the hon. the Minister is a leader; he is not a driver. I think his department knows him to be a leader. In the Department of Justice the merit system is in operation. It is applied in a fair, scientific, just and very human way. The result is that efficiency and dedication reign supreme in that department. Accordingly, the hon. the Minister showed this morning that he was<span class="col_7105-7106" refersTo="page_0507"/> one of a great organization, i.e. the Departments of Prisons and of Justice, which he guided in a proper way. I am pleased the hon. the Minister gave guidance here this morning, because I believe that if we were to have sat much longer Wednesday evening, we probably would have had some fireworks, as the saying goes, in this House.</p>

<speech by="#prinsloo">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. P. PRINSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>Or the chips would have been down, as the hon. member here to my left says. The hon. member for Durban Point set himself up as judge here and judged the hon. the Minister of Justice in blatant and angry terms. I am now going to judge his statements, attacks and conclusions on merit&#x2014;I think I am competent to do so, because I have vast experience in that regard. I should like to show up his incompetence.</p>

<p>When it comes to his ability to judge, I want to say that the hon. member acts on hearsay evidence, i.e. newspaper reports. He does not consult the proper sources, i.e. the Minister or the department. He issues precipitate statements and he condemns without a hearing or consideration have been given to the other side. This is a very basic principle in the administration of justice. In this regard he is completely incompetent to judge.</p>

<p>When it comes to responsibility and reliability, we find that he accepts unverified newspaper reports as the gospel truth and that he poses as an angel of truth in that murky light. To my mind he falls short of the mark in this regard too. As far as his knowledge is concerned, he confines himself to newspaper reports only and to information he gleans from them; for the rest he fishes on dry land.</p>

<p>As far as initiative is concerned, I want to tell him that he allows himself to be dictated to by newspapers. He is inspired by them and he does not show the slightest signs of enquiry and veracity.</p>

<p>Then I come to human relations. In fact, by his references to &#x201C;scandal&#x201D; and &#x201C;disgrace&#x201D; he launched a cynical and bitter attack on the hon. the Minister and his department without his giving any indication whatsoever of dignity and confidence radiating from himself. Now, if I had to allot a symbol in respect of these few characteristics I have mentioned, it would be an F. An F stand for &#x201C;failure&#x201D; in the Department of Justice. If he scores low marks, I think it is well for the Department of Justice and the people to know who the person is and what the ability of the person is who aspires to become the Minister of Justice.</p>

<p>What do we find on the other hand? Here we have a department which has at its disposal extremely capable officials who watch over the inviolate honour of the Republic&#x2019;s legal system. It is also quite clear what steps are being taken to improve the qualifications of the people in its employ. The introduction of the various courses of which mention is made in this very informative annual report, is proverbial of what is being done. It gives a clear and comprehensive picture of the excellent results which are obtained. A sustained activation and motivation is required in order to ensure that the people who retire, or those who resign, or those who leave the service for whatever reason, are succeeded by well-trained officials. Indeed, I do not think there can be any doubt as to the integrity and the ability of the officials of the Departments of Justice and of Prisons.</p>

<p>There is one question I should like to ask the hon. the Minister. I regret I had to read in publications that the former president of the Law Society of South Africa had voiced sharp criticism with regard to the administration of justice, with the accent on so-called bureaucracy in the department. This criticism, i.e. that there were people who would supposedly come up against the so-called bureaucracy in the department, came as a surprise to me. In my many years of service in the Department of Justice, from my junior days until I eventually occupied a very senior post, and also subsequent to that in my dealings with the Department of Justice and its officials, I have never encountered any tendency of the kind. I would be pleased if the hon. the Minister could give me a little more information on this matter, because especially those of us who were in the service of the department, and the average member of the community, have great respect and praise for the Department of Justice, and we should not like to hear that anything of the kind was the truth. As far as I am concerned, the hon. the Minister and all his officials render a service of oustanding quality. As far as I know, this has always been so. I am, therefore, amazed at this publicity.</p>

<p><span class="col_7107-7108" refersTo="page_0508"/>Mr. Chairman, there are a few other matters I should like to mention. The hon. the Minister and his department are loyal in the service of the Republic in respect of 10 divisions of the Supreme Court, 63 regional courts and 322 magistrates&#x2019; courts. All these divisions are staffed by properly qualified and efficient officials. It is indeed a proud record for the department that it was able to do as much work, as stated in the report of the Department of Justice, with as low a percentage of complaints as 0,001. Law and order is maintained with the assistance of this department, and the department sees to it that we have the necessary machinery for fighting and combating terrorism, Communism and other evils and for ensuring the security of the State. When it comes to these matters, the hon. the Opposition must please stop acting in a destructive and disparaging way and complicating the task of the Police and the indicature.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice deals with 200 pre-Union and post-Union laws which relate to its secretariat and for which it is responsible. As far as the courts are concerned, it administers not only these laws, but also numerous other laws and ordinances in the country. Our courts apply these laws, of whatever nature, with the greatest efficiency and, let us say, without being intimidated by criticism. We on this side of the House support the Vote of this honourable, dignified and efficient Minister of Justice. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is a pity that the hon. member who has just spoken, did not direct his remarks to the hon. member for Ermelo about keeping his speech calm and dealing with the facts of the department and the Vote. The hon. member for Ermelo, who, as one would expect from the calibre of his speech, hit and ran away, said some things which cannot be allowed to pass unanswered. I want to say&#x2014;and I say it with a full sense of responsibility&#x2014;that, when this side of the House is the Government, we will deal with saboteurs, terrorists and fifth-columnists with every weapon at our command and with total ruthlessness. We will deal with them as we dealt with Fascists. Whether they be Fascists, communists or any sort of &#x201C;ists&#x201D; or &#x201C;isms&#x201D;, if they undermine the security, the safety or law and order in South Africa, we as a party when we become the Government will deal with them ruthlessly and without mercy. It is proven in history and it is proven in the very complaint of the hon. member for Ermelo that, when we were the Government, we acted harshly against people. If it must be, it will be. The people we were acting against were people who were sabotaging law and order and the authority of the State. We did not ask whom they were or what they were, but what they were doing. It was for what they were doing that we acted, and it is what we will do in the future.</p>

<p>I now want to turn to another matter, namely the question of the Liquor Act. As is known, that is a matter on which we have a free vote. We do not have free liquor, unfortunately, but we do have a free vote on this side of the House. Therefore I place on record that I speak in my private capacity. I want to start by congratulating the chairman of the National Liquor Board for having achieved their ambition. According to the annual report I see that they are now top of the pops. They are the first &#x201C;aspect worthy of special mention&#x201D; in the report of the Department of Justice. They take up 25 per cent of the two-page report and seven or eight pages of the statistics. Again they made the top of the pops by being first in the statistics. It is interesting in passing to note that apart from deeds and liquor the whole of the rest of the Department of Justice&#x2014;the over-loaded rolls of the court, the staff problems and all the difficulties of their department take up only 16 lines of the report.</p>

<p>At least we have here a glimmer of light namely the welcome announcement of the consolidation of the Liquor Act, and in that respect I agree with the hon. member of Potchefstroom. The report states that the time is undeniably ripe for this. I would like to say that the time is not ripe, but that it is over-ripe. The hon. the Minister knows what happens to things when they are over-ripe. Therefore it is no use just consolidating. I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister to send this measure when it is introduced, to a Select Committee. As the report correctly states, there have been 30 amending Bills, 16 of which were passed over the last ten years. One of these Bills contained over 116 clauses. It is like chipping away with an ice-pick at an iceage mentality to get the Liquor Act brought up to date with the age in which we live. The main objective used to be, and I quote from the report of the Secretary:</p>

<block name="quote">To safeguard the interests of a multiracial population.</block>

<p>Over the years this approach has been liberalized, freer supply of liquor has been introduced, and now after some great and daring experiments ladies&#x2019; bars, for instance, have been introduced. The ladies&#x2019; bars are an innovation and so is the employment of bar maids. This appears to be quite popular. So we now have a different basic objective. But instead of achieving these different basic objectives, i.e. those set out by the Malan Commission, we seem to be tying up the whole question of liquor more and more in red tape. We tie it up with red tape, regulations and complications. We find that there are 18 classes of applications which must be made for a liquor licence. Seven of these alone apply to hotels after the hotel has received its basic licence. The Liquor Act classification provisions have achieved their objective. They have raised the standard of hotels, in fact, I believe they have over-achieved this and have gone past the point of raising the standard to acceptable level. They have pushed them up to such a high level that today many ordinary family people cannot afford to use an hotel. I only have a few minutes and I do not have time to argue it with the Minister. It is not the Minister&#x2019;s fault. We supported the principle, but I say it has been over-administered and has forced hotels out of reach of the ordinary South African citizen who wants to take his family on holiday. My appeal to the hon. the Minister is the old one of the ice pick that keeps chipping away. Let us cut off seven of these eight octopus grips that the National Liquor Board has on hotels, and confine its control to the granting of the original licence. This should be the protection; the location and the original standards which the National Liquor Board can decide upon. However, the other seven octopuses, the ladies&#x2019; bars, the late hours, this, that and the other&#x2014;I do not have the time to deal with them all&#x2014;whether women may go into a bar and the employment of bar maids, these things have nothing to do with the National Liquor Board and the control of the Liquor Act. They are part of running the hotel. Let the liquor side of the hotel be controlled, but thereafter let us hack off seven of these eight tentacles of this octopus.</p>

<p>Sir, in the minute I have left I want to refer to the investigation into on-consumption premises, as well as off-consumption. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that irrespective of what that report may contain, he must remember that if he<span class="col_7111-7112" refersTo="page_0510"/> should close those legal channels, he will force liquor into illegal channels. Here I have a newspaper which says: &#x201C;Mr. Pelser, the toast of the shebeen queens&#x201D;. They are dreaming and hoping that legal channels for obtaining liquor under decent conditions will be removed so that the shebeen queens can come into their own. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Following up on what the hon. member for Durban Point said, and as a result of what was said by the hon. member for Ermelo, I can tell the hon. member for Durban Point that the National Party, and those of us sitting here, are not at all concerned about meeting the South African electorate should they form a kind of tribunal to judge the actions of the National Party. I can tell him that we long for the day when we can again hold a general election, when we can compare the achievements of the two parties. When that day comes, the debate we have had here since the discussion of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Vote, can certainly be used to judge what the achievements of the various parties are. In the first place the actions of the chief speaker on the Opposition side will have to be judged, and his actions will be judged in the words of the hon. member for Musgrave when he said very indignantly, as a result of a statement by the hon. member for Potgietersrus&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Potgietersrus accused the hon. member for Durban North of being unprepared this evening. It was a very serious allegation to make against the leader of the Justice group on this side of the House. What did the hon. member for Durban North do?</block>

<p>And then he gives the answer&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He quoted facts.</block>

<p>Shame, Sir, If there are facts then these facts, which the main speaker of the Justice group on that side used, are going to be employed by us when we come before the tribunal of the electorate to tell the voters of South Africa that that hon. member has no interest in seeing whether the facts he so readily wants to quote are correct. But, Sir, we shall also have to look at the hon. member for Wynberg. The hon. member could just as well have stood up and asked the Chairman whether she could not simply have handed in her speech and whether it could not be regarded as having been read, because it is the third successive time she has made the same speech. The public as a tribunal has never taken any notice of what she has had to say on the subject she spoke about again today. Then there was also an interjection, which was made here by the hon. member for Jeppes, which we cannot allow to pass. When the hon. member for Ermelo referred to Afrikaners who were caught and placed in concentration camps, and asked whether they were terrorists or communists, do you know, Sir, what the hon. member for Jeppes then asked? He asked: &#x201C;What were they?&#x201D; Those are the kind of facts, in the words of the hon. member for Musgrave, which we shall place before the tribunal. I should also like to refer to another case to which the hon. member for Musgrave referred on Wednesday evening in respect of a newspaper report about what the chairman of NICRO allegedly said with respect to penal reform. The hon. member said that what the chairman of NICRO was asking, was precisely what they on that side are advocating.</p>

<p>He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I will couple that also with the proposals that we have made from time to time from this side of the House and which I cannot repeat.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister then asked him what their proposals are. With reference to the idea that penal reform should take place, I took another look at the Criminal Procedure Act. I find that in the Criminal Procedure Act there are two sections&#x2014; actually three&#x2014;i.e. sections 334 and 335, as well as section 352, which have been amended on several occasions since the commencement of the Act in 1959. Important amendments were introduced, <i>inter alia,</i> in 1965 and 1968. If we look at those<span class="col_7113-7114" refersTo="page_0511"/> three sections we see, as far as the presiding officers at any trial are concerned, that a tremendous amount of discretion is allocated to them which they can exercise in imposing punishment. In the case of crimes which we previously regarded as capital crimes, amendments were introduced in terms of which a punishment other than the death penalty can be imposed. It is therefore merely a question of the use of the existing machinery in terms of the three sections I have mentioned here.</p>

<p>Sir, what is also interesting is that when these amendments were proposed in 1965 and 1968 with respect to that Act, we did not obtain any appreciable support from the Opposition for these amendments which provided for more flexibility in the imposition of punishments. We acknowledge &#x2014;the hon. the Minister of Justice said so himself&#x2014;that as many as 42 per cent of the prisoners being held in our prisons today are people serving sentences of four months or less. Sir, it is no use hon. members on that side simply making allegations. The hon. member for Musgrave &#x201C;must quote facts&#x201D;, as the main speaker on judicial matters on that side does, but he must just do it a bit better, because the facts the hon. member for Durban North quoted here we unfortunately cannot use in a debate. We can perhaps use them outside in a different way, but we cannot use them in a debate in this House.</p>

<p>Sir, I should like to refer to another matter. To date we have had to listen to a great deal of criticism here about our prisons. Today I just want to make a few remarks about our prisons, and in particular our prison staff. I want to mention to you, Sir, how many members of the prisons staff have academic qualifications. There are 93 with B.A. degrees; there are 13 with Honours degrees; there are five with Masters degrees, and there are some studying for Doctors degrees. There are also 139 engaged in under-graduate studies, and there are 15 engaged in post-graduate studies. Over and above these already qualified people, and those who have completed their studies, we also find that the department goes out of its way to offer courses to members of the prisons staff. It is interesting to see to what extent those people attended these courses.</p>

<p>In 1968-&#x2019;69 376 people attended the various courses. In 1969-70 the number was 558, and in 1970-&#x2019;71 it was 740. And in addition, in the past report year, there were 745 people in the Department of Prisons who were engaged in extramural studies and who obtained financial assistance from the department to qualify themselves further. Sir, I think this is truly a splendid picture. A large percentage of these 42 per cent of the prisoners who must serve terms of four months or less, are there because they clashed with the law as a result of drunkenness. I am aware of the fact that there are several institutions and that in terms of the sections I mentioned here the right is granted to the presiding officer to send people to those institutions. But I advocate that the hon. the Minister should consider establishing, at our prisons themselves, a specialized division where we can treat these people, who usually do actually land up in gaol after the second or third offence, and where we can look after their rehabilitation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice_and_of_prisons">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE AND OF PRISONS</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to reply to a few of the speakers. I think that I must first say something about liquor. There is more than one hon. member who mentioned this subject, like the hon. members for Durban Point and Potchefstroom. In connection with liquor the hon. member for Durban Point particularly mentioned the question of what is known as &#x201C;dual control&#x201D;. His view is this. He says that if an hotel is classified we must only look after the liquor and leave the other aspects. They must be left for someone else to look after. That is also the Hotel Board&#x2019;s standpoint; they also wanted it. They say that they can still look after the annual renewal of licences, but they think they ought to be renewed automatically if the Hotel Board issues a certificate.</p>

<p>I cannot accept that proposal. I definitely cannot accept it for the simple reason that the Liquor Act, as it now reads&#x2014;and I should not like to have it any other way&#x2014;provides for licences. It is stated that no licence may be furnished without accommodation. The accommodation forms the basis for the licence. One cannot obtain an hotel licence without supplying the accommodation. That is so. Very well, let us then simply go on until we have eventually classified the hotel. The hon. member, who criticized me so much about the classifications, is now completely silent about the matter. The whole lot have now been classified, except for perhaps a few.</p>

<p><span class="col_7115-7116" refersTo="page_0512"/>This was done with very little inconvenience.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<p>But many sold out.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No. There are some which were classified and then sold out; there are some who felt that their land was worth so much that they could not sell out, and there are a small number who changed over to beer and wine, but generally speaking the classification was a complete success and we have obtained thanks for it throughout the country. But what complicated the matter is that they did not stop at classification. They went for stars and began to build these expensive hotels, but that has nothing to do with my administration. We only ensured that the minimum requirements were met and we gave long extensions of time where necessary. We worked nicely with the people throughout South Africa. For all practical purposes the scheme is a success.</p>

<p>It is true that hotel prices have increased, but that is not attributable to classification. It is because they incurred heavy costs in order to obtain extra stars. But that is just in passing. They have now been classified, and once an hotel has been classified, the hon. member states, I must leave it alone and the Hotel Board must keep an eye on it. The Hotel Board would then send me a certificate. They would perhaps only go round once a year to see what is going on. But I cannot accept that proposal. I gave it very serious attention. I discussed it with the management of Fedhasa. How can I now do this? There is the Board, and there is not the slightest control over its officials. Now I am not speaking of administrative control, and I do not want to do the Hotel Board any harm. I am speaking of the legal controls by a Minister. There is simply nothing of that kind, and I am acting on their recommendations. They appoint an inspector. I take it they appoint good inspectors, but Heaven only knows they could also be bad inspectors. Such an inspector could come along to an hotel and the licensee might say he would supply him with liquor for the rest of the year. If he is found out the worst thing that can be done is to discharge him. But this is not so with our classification officials who are Police officers. The Police officers are responsible people.</p>

<p>Once or twice a year the Police officer just gives the hotel a once-over to see whether it is in the same condition it was in when it was classified. If everything is in order as far as they are concerned, the annual request is granted, if there are no other objections that have come from the Police. The main reason why I cannot deviate from this system is that I cannot depend on a Board whose officials are not legally responsible to me. That is my basic difficulty which I cannot circumvent. Eventually I also told Fedhasa as much, and I think Fedhasa accepts the fact. Well, they may be grumbling, and they may have told that hon. member something, but they have not spoken to me again. I stated my view to them frankly, and it is my impression they accepted it.</p>

<p>No, I ask the Board. Let us understand each other well. You must keep it clearly in mind that liquor constitutes 73 per cent of the clear income of an hotel&#x2014;I am now speaking from memory. Liquor is a controlled article and as long as it remains a controlled article we must keep an eye on it. I cannot accept that. It is not a question of an &#x201C;empire&#x201D; or any ting of that kind. I say again that hotel costs are not higher as a result of the classification, but because they are trying to compete for stars.</p>

<p>Then there is the National Liquor Board. And what is wrong with that? The fact of the matter is that we should also take off our hats to the National Liquor Board. The amount of work those people are doing&#x2014;for example the investigations I direct them to carry out&#x2014;is tremendous. They deserve the utmost praise and credit for that. Perhaps the secretary knew they are doing first-rate work, and that is why he apparently mentioned them first.</p>

<p>I cannot say what his reason was. Someone else spoke about the question of the overseas trip of members of the Liquor Board. That is the case. Four of the six members are going on the trip. It is not a question of a distinction being drawn as far as the members are concerned. Fortunately this is not so. It was chiefly a question of expense. I was actually afraid, in these difficult times, to go to the Cabinet to ask for the necessary money so that the visit could take place. It was therefore a question of expense. Three of the members are in the Public Service and we are footing the bill as far as they are concerned. The fourth member is not in the Public Service and must cover for his own costs. That is the condition on which he is going. There is no reflection whatsoever on the gentlemen who remain behind. The fact that they are not going is because we actually cannot afford it. I must say that we made a slight mistake in this connection. We neglected to ask the gentlemen whether they did not want to go along at their own expense; unfortunately we did not think of that. However, there was no ulterior motive. All of them are first-rate members and they are all doing very good work.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>There is still the question of an inquiry into on-consumption and off-consumption.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I am coming to that in a moment. There was a question in connection with on-consumption and off-consumption by the hon. members for Potchefstroom and Durban Point. In 1968, after careful consideration, the Cabinet decided to close down on-consumption. There are certain problems in that connection, and I shall refer to them. It was decided to close this down since the position had become untenable. This is particularly the case here in the Cape. To what extent this applies in Natal I cannot say. My information is that the situation is much better there. It was the Cabinet&#x2019;s standpoint that the Whites should not go and drink in the residential areas of other colour groups; we do not go to their areas and make ourselves repulsive there by drinking too much. Since this was the case, why must the people be allowed to do it here in our areas. That was our view. As the responsible Minister I consequently made a statement in this House, on behalf of the Cabinet, to the effect that we would close down on-consumption. I said that at the same time there should be as little inconvenience and disruption as possible. Although I did not express any opinions about the matter, I nevertheless mentioned the question of consortiums as a possibility. I said that we would investigate the matter. I then instructed the National Liquor Board to investigate the matter. They were instructed to find ways and means of removing these people with the least possible disruption in accordance with the stated policy of the present Government. They have already made extensive progress, and according to the Chairman of the National Liquor Board there is still one organization that must give evidence before them. After that they hope to be able to draft a report. Something strange happened there. When Fedhasa was asked in evidence how this could be brought about with the least possible disruption, Fedhasa stated that it was not interested in the matter and did not actually want this. Fedhasa is opposed to the principle of the matter. I am only speaking of Cape Town&#x2019;s non-White bars in the White area. As I understood it they went along and established a &#x201C;fighting fund&#x201D;. The hon. member for Potchefstroom also spoke of the &#x201C;fighting fund&#x201D;. They obtained a senior advocate, Mr. Snitcher, as well as two economists, i.e. Prof. S. P. Cilliers of Stellenbosch and another person from the Transvaal. I cannot remember at the moment what his name is. They established the &#x201C;fighting fund&#x201D;, but hon. members will know that one cannot establish a &#x201C;fighting fund&#x201D; without money. Somebody must pay for it. They then decided to ask their members for contributions. I take the members here in the Cape are willing to give contributions, because many of them have bars here in the Cape. But in the Free State and in the Transvaal there was apparently some resistance. Those people said they were not interested, because they do not have bars. As I understand it the people in Natal contributed, just like the people in the Cape, because they were also interested parties. It now appears that the position is such that Fedhasa is saying to all its members: Look here, it is not only on-consumption that is implicated; you must know that your off-consumption will also be affected; you run the danger of your off-consumption being closed down at a later stage. What their reaction is does not specifically make any difference. I think they will again give evidence with a view to this. There is, of course, not the slightest<span class="col_7119-7120" refersTo="page_0514"/> danger, and it is not the intention of the present Government to touch off-consumption privileges which Coloureds and other coloured races have, i.e. those relating to the purchase of their liquor in White areas. They need not fear that that facility will be taken away from them. Unpleasant incidents also sometimes occur in the White areas because of off-consumption. If hon. members knew of the lot of complaints I receive, what pressures are exerted on me and the problems I am saddled with, they would be surprised. When a decision was taken about the matter at the time I said we would see if we could take certain steps in that connection to establish the necessary powers.</p>

<p>On an individual basis.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, on an individual basis. I shall tell the hon. member how this works in practice. Let us suppose a complaint crops up in Bellville, Wellington or Belfast. It makes no difference where. The complaint is that there is a crowd of people who are behaving badly in the vicinity of a specific bottle store selling liquor for consumption off the premises. There is a request that the bottle store&#x2019;s licence be suspended. I cannot simply suspend licences. The relative person is then firstly notified that there are complaints and that we intend to institute an inquiry. At the same time, or perhaps even before the time, we let the complainants know that we are instituting an inquiry and that they must ensure that they obtain witnesses to prove their case. Then I instruct the National Liquor Board in terms of section 118, and they consequently go to investigate the position <i>in loco.</i> Even before we go that far, the local police have already kept an eye on the position and drawn up a report. As a result of what they report, we may or may not take action, or we take steps to ensure that action is taken, or we do not take action. There have already been so many cases of complaints where conclusive proof was furnished that it was not liquor the people were looking for there. That is a contributing factor, it is true, but there are also 10 or 12 other factors. In such a case I cannot take any action. It would be unjust and unreasonable. In other cases the report of the National Liquor Board convinces me that action should be taken. Then we close the non-White section for a period of 12 months in terms of section 100<i>quin.</i> It has already happened that after the space of a few months things are much better. Then we again ask the police to make an investigation. If they then say &#x201C;yes, it is all right,&#x201D; then we say: &#x201C;Very well, we lift the restrictions we placed on you; but we want to warn you&#x2014;you must watch out. If it happens again we are simply going to act. If it does not happen again, well, then you suffer no damage&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Can on-consumption not be handled on the same basis?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No. A definite decision has now been taken, and we have committed ourselves to that since 1968, I think. I myself do not intend to do it. Let me just conclude with this. There need not be the slightest fear that off-consumption will be prejudiced. There is always the condition, of course, that the bottle store or off-sales agent behaves himself properly, sees to it that things run smoothly and that no disturbance is caused. Subject to that condition there is not the slightest danger. But as far as on-consumption is concerned, we are just waiting. We shall consequently have to decide about that. I cannot do that before I have seen the National Liquor Board&#x2019;s report. I think that more or less concludes what I wanted to say about that.</p>

<p>While I am standing I also want to tell the hon. member for Green Point that we shall have another shot at the Mbambo case he referred to. His position is that he was arrested in terms of section 6 for questioning. He was detained here in the Cape for a considerable length of time. Here he was in complete solitary confinement for interrogation. At a certain stage during the period of his detention here, it appeared as if this man wanted to talk. However, so much for that. He was subsequently transferred in a group to Pietermaritzburg as a detainee for interrogation. However, there he was not in solitary confinement. There he was locked up with someone else. I do not know who the person was or what his circumstances were. However, he was still detained for questioning in terms of section 6. He was thus detained until 24th September of the specific year.</p>

<p>He was freed for those nine days to give evidence, as I also said in the statement I made. In the meantime an application was made to the Attorney-General for the detention of this man in terms of section <i>215bis.</i> If there had been the slightest indication that he should be detained in terms of that section it would have been used. This was also done with a view to being able to pay this person witness fees. And from 2nd October he consequently received, witness fees until the case was concluded. I said that the amount the Minister mentioned was a fairly large one. However, I do not know whether it was compensation. My present information is that it does not include compensation.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. I would say that the position is that from the time he made a statement&#x2014;I do not know whether this was on the 24th or on what date it was&#x2014; until the termination of the case, the man ought to have obtained not only witness fees, but also compensation in respect of his work.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member must not interrupt me now. Further information that I have indicates that they are not authorized to pay him witness fees for the period of 24th September to 2nd October, although he was present for this purpose. The Act does not provide for this. However, I shall go into the matter and see whether we should not approach the Treasury in order to compensate this man partly or fully for the period he was there. I do not know what the position in respect of his employer was. This is an awkward case. One can surely not say that the moment a person is arrested, if he is suspected of terrorist activities, for example, the State must also accept responsibility for his dependants. I am sorry, but I really cannot make any concessions in this connection. However, I am in favour of the fact that the moment it becomes clear that a person is going to become a witness and give voluntary evidence that person must be paid witness fees, plus the amount he would have earned had he been working.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I can only speak about the period from when this became apparent. A good case could be made out for this. It must be submitted. I do not know what the circumstances are. And I do not want to go into that now either. That is the position as far as this fellow is concerned.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Innesdal asked me a question which I do want to refer to. He says he has personal experience of the Department of Justice. He also says that he saw in the newspapers that the previous chairman of the Association of Law Societies, Mr. Vorster, had made certain statements. Mr. Vorster is from the Free State, and that is perhaps why the hon. member for Innesdal knows him. I also saw those reports and I did not feel happy about them either. I asked Mr. Vorster whether he would come and discuss matters with me when he came to Pretoria again. He subsequently informed me that he did not know when he would again be coming to Pretoria, but that he would be coming one day. At a later stage he let me know that he would be in Pretoria on a certain day and that he would be able to see me then. He did so. I need not say what took place behind closed doors, but I spoke candidly to Mr. Vorster. I told him that I really felt he had done us a disservice; I also told him that I had looked up to him. but that I was now disappointed. Other things were also said, but it does not matter what took place there. I thereby thought that the matter involving Mr. Vorster had been cleared up. I will not say that I thought the matter had been cleared up completely, because both the department and I are involved. Mr. Oberholzer, the Secretary for the Department, and I, then waited to see if there would be any reaction, not from Mr. Vorster personally, but from the Association as such. Unfortunately there was no reaction. I received a letter from Mr. Malherbe, the present chairman<span class="col_7123-7124" refersTo="page_0516"/> of the Association of Law Societies, when he was designated to the post. He is from the Cape. In that letter he more or less said that he would like to assure me of his co-operation and that he would endeavour, as far as possible, to clear up any misunderstanding that had cropped up in the past. He gave that indication. Earlier this year he was elected as chairman of the Association. The gentlemen of the Association of Law Societies paid a courtesy visit to me. We discussed various matters. They also said it was only a courtesy visit, and so they departed. I understand that they also paid a courtesy visit to the Secretary for Justice. I cannot say whether they discussed this matter. But nevertheless, after that visit the Secretary for Justice came to me and asked me if anything had been said about the matter. I told him that nothing had been said. He also stated that nothing had been said during the visit to him. The Secretary for Justice then sent a letter to the Association of Law Societies in which he stated in a nice way that he did not feel happy about the matter. He said he expected the matter to perhaps be raised in Parliament and that he would then like to be in a position to reply. There was a nice reponse to that letter. The reply to his letter was received recently. I have the letter here with me. It is signed by the Secretary of the Association of Law Societies. Mr. Louw. He says he is writing on behalf of the Executive Committee. He says that nothing is being held against us. He says they also have another duty and that that is also a good thing. I just want to have a look here&#x2014;yes, here I have it (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have been instructed by the Executive Committee to convey to the hon. the Minister of Justice and to you and your department the thanks and appreciation of the attorneys&#x2019; profession for the way in which you carry out your taxing duties.

<p>Yes, but at the request of the Executive Committee.

There are other people who also spoke to me, but forget about that. I am quite satisfied, and I take it the Association is also satisfied. They can be sure of our co-operation, because in the past there has been very cordial co-operation. I want to tell the hon. member that we spent many hours on matters that come from the attorneys. We shall forget about that.</p>

<p>I should like to broach another matter which was mentioned and which I really do not want to forget. While the main speaker on the Opposition side was speaking the other day, an hon. member on this side of the House made an interjection and asked: &#x201C;What did Blackie Swart do?&#x201D;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE AND OF PRISONS</person>:</from>

<p>No, I do not know who said it, but it was said; it happened a little while ago. This relates to the powers of the Attorney-General. I can also link this up with the Beytagh case, which was also referred to. It was also indicated, I think by the hon. member for Durban North, that we should handle this case in quite a different manner. I should like to say something about that. Under this Government the position is&#x2014;and I know and believe that under the Prime Minister, when he was Minister of Justice, it was also the case&#x2014;that we simply do not interfere with the Attorney-General. It is simply not done. The furthest we would ever go is to say that we would appreciate it if the Secretary of the Department would please request the Attorney-General to look at a particular matter personally. It does happen at times, for example, that<span class="col_7125-7126" refersTo="page_0517"/> people from a certain district make representations for one to take action in respect of some case or other, or something of that nature. I cannot do that. I do not want to interfere with the Attorney-General. We simply do not do so. It is true that he carries out his duties subject to the control of the Minister, but this has an interesting history, which I can perhaps just refer to. Mr. Blackie Swart is not the person who said he thinks he is making a mistake. That was always the position under the Prime Minister. The hon. member for Transkei, Mr. T. G. Hughes, asked: &#x201C;What did Blackie Swart do? He changed it.&#x201D; No, Blackie Swart did not change it. That is not how things stand. The position is that prior to Union the prosecution was completely in the hands of the Government. It could instruct an official to institute an investigation, but it had to make the decision. With the advent of Union they apparently debated this matter, so I gather from the speech of the late Mr. Patrick Duncan. They debated the matter and then placed it exclusively in the hands of the Atorney-General. Things went on like that; I do not know what happened. I have an idea of what it is all about, but I do not want to express an idea. Eventually, in 1926, the late Tielman Roos, as the then Minister of Justice, raised the matter in this House. He referred to it and said there were two systems: The one is the extreme on this side, the Government, and the other is the extreme on the other side, the Attorney-General. He wanted to find the mean. As a result of that he made the Attorney-General subject to the control of the Minister. This system worked provisionally for a certain period, but what was very interesting in that debate was the attitude of Mr. Patrick Duncan. At the time he was not a supporter of the National Party, unless history leaves me in the lurch. He never was at any time. In 1926, in respect of Mr. Tielman Roos&#x2019;s proposal, Mr. Patrick Duncan adopted the attitude that it would be no good because it did not go far enough. He was of the opinion that it should be placed with the Government and with no one else. He said (translation): &#x201C;What is the use, in this respect, of using an official and then, every time a case comes before Parliament, hiding behind the official? &#x201D; Mr. Roos then said: &#x201C;Well, the position is actually that I am doing this because the Attorney-General is not responsible to me or to Parliament. That is why I am doing it&#x201D;. That is why it subsequently happened, but I find Mr. Patrick Duncan&#x2019;s attitude, in saying Mr. Roos did not go far enough, very interesting. He wanted it to be placed back in the Government&#x2019;s hands, where it had been throughout the years. So it happened, but what is interesting is that it was again amended, or rather again confirmed. It was again confirmed in 1935. That is important, because I just want to say that the National Government was not yet in power. It was confirmed again in 1935&#x2014;the 1917 Act apparently&#x2014;and, if my memory serves me correctly, it was done by none other than the late Gen. Smuts, who was the Minister of Justice at the time. He confirmed it just as we are also doing today. Therefore, accusations must really not be flung across the floor of this House about whether you changed the Act or whether we did. The old United Party has as much of a hand in this as we do. In fact, some of their members wanted to go further than we went. That is the position.</p>

<p>I cannot say; I do not know the relevant history. I just know there were Attorneys-General who were a little rough in their handling of things. If people had to go and see them they would have had to visit them elsewhere if they were not at their offices. But that is just in passing; I do not want to speak about that.</p>

<p>I just quickly want to reply to the hon. member who has already left, i.e. the hon. member for Potgietersrust, who apologized for his absence. The point he touched upon concerns the question of prison farms. He asked for more prison farms. I now want to tell the hon. member that we have quite a few prison farms. In the Transvaal we have five prison farms, i.e. those at Barberton, Baviaanspoort, Zonder-water, Leeuwkop and Nigel. Then there is also land available at Modderbee and Standerton. There is also land available at Heidelberg and Klerksdorp. Eighteen morgen of irrigation land is available at the latter. In the Orange Free State we have<span class="col_7127-7128" refersTo="page_0518"/> three farms, i.e. Groenpunt, Goedemoed, and Grootvlei, situated respectively near the Vaaldam, near Bethulie and near Bloemfontein. In Natal we have three farms, i.e. at Kandaspunt, Waterval and Sevontein. Then we also have a fairly large piece of land available for agriculture at Pietermaritzburg. In the Cape Province we have two farms and five prisons with large grounds. They are the Victor Verster prison, Brandvlei, Allandale and St. Albans, near Port Elizabeth. At East London, George and Worcester, we also have quite a bit of land. That is what we have at present. The hon. member said we should try to obtain land in the Bantu areas. I want to mention to him that in the Transkei we have farms at Bizweni, that is near Umzimkulu and at Wellington, near Umtata. The two farms must still be developed. Then there are also farms in Natal. I can tell the hon. member that it is necessary for us to obtain more prison farms. We are also in the process of purchasing two in the Transvaal, i.e. at Spring Valley and Rooigrond. This project has not yet been finalized, but we are in the process of making the purchase. Then there is another area we are in the process of purchasing, at Kouransdrift. We have not quite agreed yet about this scheme. We also envisage buying farms in the vicinity of Tulbagh and Caledon. I just quickly want to reply to what the hon. member for Wynberg said. Unfortunately she is not present at the moment. I have just received a note in connection with a matter she raised.</p>

<p>She referred to Sgt. Andries van Wyk who dealt with the Imam Haron case. According to her Sgt. Andries van Wyk is now in Stikland. This Sgt. Andries van Wyk never had anything to do with the Imam. The hon. member&#x2019;s information is therefore wrong. I obtained this information from the Police after the hon. member had raised this matter this morning. I am just mentioning it because she is not present at the moment.</p>

<p>I have already referred to the hon. member for Potchefstroom. He referred to the magistrates&#x2019; courts and to the liquor boards. He referred, in particular, to a specific case in that respect. I have already dealt with the matters raised by the hon. member for Jeppes. The hon. member for Potchefstroom also raised the matter of the jurisdiction of magistrates&#x2019; courts. That is so, and I have already mentioned that we are thinking along these lines. The difficulty is that we cannot go on in this way with the amount of work and the number of judges increasing. The number of judges has increased from a figure in the forties to a figure in the eighties. I do not want a position in which one is kicking out a judge at every turn. That would cheapen the profession, even the office. We will definitely not allow that. Therefore I think that we must leave more civil jurisdiction to the magistrates&#x2019; courts. We are still thinking along those lines. It seems to me it can easily be done by increasing the jurisdiction as it stands to a maximum of say X. We have not worked out the details of the matter completely yet, and therefore I am just mentioning this provisionally. That will then be the jurisdiction with the proviso that if the claim is for an amount of more than Y, the case cannot be tried by an ordinary magistrate. Such a case will then be referred to a regional court to be heard. That is how we think to deal with it.</p>

<p>There was also a reference to Minister Coetzee. I think the hon. member for Green Point mentioned it.</p>

<p>The hon. member said that the Minister said it was a case between himself and the other party. Yes, that is true, he did say that. He also did it to a certain extent, but not quite. I think the damage was quite considerable, i.e. in the region of R7 000. He felt honour-bound to pay the damage himself. He also did so. As for the rest, as previously indicated, that is our policy and consquently that is how it remains until the Government changes it.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to say a few words in regard to the actions of the chief speaker on Justice matters on that side of the House. The hon. member has recently played a particular role in this House. When we review his actions, we shall see that he has done all the dirty work on behalf of the United Party. It was he who dealt with the Agliotti case in an exaggerated manner.<span class="col_7129-7130" refersTo="page_0519"/> It was he who raised the Excelsior immorality case some time ago, it was he who raised the case of Gen. Bester, and it was he who made certain deprecatory remarks in connection with the death of Timol. The hon. member for Durban North has left a trail of mud through this House in recent times. Let us see what Ministers&#x2019; resignations he has demanded in his impetuosity. We notice that it is quite an impressive list. He asked for the resignation of Minister Uys, the resignation of Minister Pelser, of Minister De Wet and of Minister Coetzee. I say that the hon. member has left a trail of mud through this House in recent times, and the adverse remarks that he has made about the authorities and bodies responsible for the safety of this country are of a very serious nature. The United Party&#x2019;s and his vilification of the Police and the department entrusted with the safety of the State is something which this House, this Committee and the people have to view in a serious light. Of course, I do not want to comment in any way on the Timol case, but I must refer to certain vituperative remarks passed by that hon. member. According to the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> of 2nd November, 1971, he had, <i>inter alia,</i> this to say:</p>

<block name="quote">What reason can there possibly be for wanting to use it &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is section 6&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; when judges are available except &#x2026;</block>

<p>And then he went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; that you don&#x2019;t want judges to hear both sides of the matter &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is a scandalous remark! Then he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; that you don&#x2019;t want judges to lay down conditions for detention. You have absolute <i>carte blanche</i> to use the detention for interrogation for whatever business you want, especially knowing that the Prime Minister supports you.</block>

<p>[Interjections.] The hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central must be careful; I shall tell his father-in-law if he does not conduct himself properly. Apart from what the hon. member for Durban North had to say, the Leader of the Opposition himself, according to the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> of 4th November, had this to say:</p>

<block name="quote">Sir De Villiers Graaff last night called for the appointment of a judicial commission to investigate and to report on (amongst other things) the methods used by the Security Police to interrogate without trial detainees.</block>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition wants the Security Police to be investigated. Sir, why is he asking for this investigation? It is because he wants to make the Security Police, and the Police generally, suspect among the people&#x2014;the body responsible for the safety of the State. On 6th November, the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> stated: &#x201C;Mitchell blames Vorster&#x201D;, and then had this to say:</p>

<block name="quote">Recent statements by the Prime Minister, Mr. Vorster, and the Minister of Justice, Mr. Pelser, could only have encouraged the Security Police to feel that under the Nationalist Government the courts were no longer a factor in the determination of the freedom and integrity of the individual.</block>

<p>We find, Sir, that the Security Police are gradually being run down in this way. But all these things reached a peak in an issue of the <i>Sunday Times,</i> in which the hon. member for Durban North had this to say. I want to tell him that I regard his actions as reprehensible. I quote:</p>

<block name="quote">Public suspect torture, says Mike Mitchell: Mr. Vorster losing control of Security operation.</block>

<p>And then follow these words, which I want to quote to the hon. member, because he ought to be ashamed of himself&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Rightly or wrongly the man in the street has reached a state of mind where he strongly suspects that detainees are being tortured in dark little rooms and fears that methods of the Gestapo have been used by the Security Police, Mr. Mike Mitchell, United Party shadow Minister of Justice, told the <i>Sunday Times</i> yesterday.</block>

<p>He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The events in South Africa during the past week suggested that Mr. Vorster had lost control of security operations in the country and that effective control<span class="col_7131-7132" refersTo="page_0520"/> had passed into the hands of the Security Police themselves, Mr. Mitchell added.</block>

<p>Then follow these very important remarks to which I want to draw the attention of the Committee&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This blunt allegation was also made yesterday by Mr. Colin Eglin, the leader of the Progressive Party. In statements to the <i>Sunday Times,</i> Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Eglin warned that the Security Police were becoming a law unto themselves.</block>

<p>We on this side want to tell the people outside that the United Party is displaying a cynicism about the safety of the State, a cynicism which renders them incapable of handling the safety of the State. Sir, in the modem times in which we live, war is no longer what it was in the past when one country declared war against another country and when the forces of one country marched against another country. A &#x201C;state of war&#x201D; is something which has to be redefined today, because a country or a group of interests which wants to do battle with South Africa today does not do so openly. They do so through the medium of citizens in South Africa; they do so through people whom they want to use to infiltrate organizations like the Police and others in South Africa. Sir, the hon. member says that they can be trusted with the safety of the State, but we know that they do not understand the delicate assault on South Africa; we know that they do not recognize the dangers threatening South Africa, and we know that for this reason they are unable to give the requisite consideration to the means necessary to ward off the threat to South Africa. We live in difficult times; we live in a dangerous world, and at this stage South Africa is one of the world&#x2019;s focal points. The people of South Africa must be encouraged to support the Police Force and the Government in this connection. Sir, that side of the House has a duty towards the people and towards the future of South Africa to inspire confidence in our Security Police on the part of our citizens. They have a duty in this connection, and I want to tell the hon. member that this is a duty which he is neglecting shamefully. But what is more, his actions, whether calculated or caused by ignorance, have the effect of helping South Africa&#x2019;s enemies.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I am sorry that the hon. the Minister adopted the attitude that he did here this morning. Sir, hurtful things are said about us all. But the hon. the Minister must accept that there is no such thing as a ministerial person. I am not interested in the person of the hon. the Minister; I am concerned with the office of the Minister and the person, whoever he may be, who exercises the power of that office. For the hon. Minister to say that he is not going to call me &#x201C;die agb. lid&#x201D; any more, that he is going to call me &#x201C;die hoofspreker&#x201D;, is carrying things much too far, and it is absolutely unnecessary. I want to emphasize that when you become a Minister of the State, you are responsible personally for every act of that department and for the act of every official in that department. And this is the system of democracy that we have. This is how it works. We will never have, I hope, the situation where officials responsible for administration are to be attacked by us here, for the very reason that they cannot defend themselves, but the Minister can. And what is more, it is the job of the Minister to protect those people. This is the point that has been missed here in so far as Mr. Oberholzer, the Secretary, is concerned. It was left to Mr. Oberholzer to make this statement and then he was attacked and he cannot defend himself. He was not defended by the hon. the Minister. I want to say this. The hon. the Minister spoke here for two hours this morning in reply to my speech on Wednesday night. What happened in those two hours? We got no answers to the questions which were posed.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#member">

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>You were crushed.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Crushed? Let me tell that hon. gentleman this. In the first place, as far as the 180 days detention is concerned, and as far as Legodi was concerned, the question that was asked was &#x201C;Why was he put in solitary confinement from the time he was arrested until the time he gave evidence, for 129 days?&#x201D; The hon. the Minister knows because the hon. the Minister admitted that he knew all about this detention right from the very beginning. One wants to know why he was put into solitary confinement. After all he was being detained so that he could give evidence for the State, and one hardly imagines that 129 days of solitary confinement was going to encourage him to give that evidence, or to put him into a fit state of mind to give it. Then there was some suggestion by the hon. member for Prinshof that he was not an innocent witness; he was an accomplice. It does not seem, from what the hon. member for Houghton read of the judgment of Judge Margo, that he was an accomplice, but even if he was, the same would apply. Let us take it even further and say that he was not just an accomplice but that he was the main perpetrator, the accused. Then he would be held as an accused person in gaol. They would not be able to put him in solitary confinement, and if he had been actually convicted of murder and sentenced to, say, life imprisonment, again he could not be<span class="col_7135-7136" refersTo="page_0522"/> put into solitary confinement. But this person is given solitary confinement for 129 days. That is the question, and we have hadi no answer.</p>

<p>Then there is the other question as to the suggestion that this Government may think of appointing regional magistrates to the Supreme Court Bench. There we have had no answer at all. The hon. the Minister, aided and abetted by all the other hon. gentlemen who said that I was misquoting the Minister, admitted that what I quoted was what came over the SABC. I may say that that is where I first heard it, that he said that he was the first person to appoint a woman to the Bench. What I heard and what the hon. the Minister confirms now, was that the SABC said, as did the Press, that he hoped to be the first person to appoint a regional magistrate. From that day until this day the country was under the impression that that is what he said because he did not correct it, and he cannot blame anyone for thinking that. But the position is not made very much better by his explanation. He now says that under him and under this Government it may be&#x2014;the question is still unresolved &#x2014;that he will appoint regional magistrates to the Supreme Court Bench. The most significant thing of all is what was not said. Not one of those hon. members, who are members of the legal profession and who have spoken in this debate sought to defend the suggestion that regional magistrates should be appointed to the Bench. I congratulate them on this. Not one of them will defend it and I knew that from the beginning. But I do not understand what is happening here because when the hon. the Prime Minister was Minister of Justice his predecessor made certain noises, indicating that he, Mr. Erasmus, as Minister of Justice, was prepared to appoint magistrates to the Bench of the Supreme Court, and the Prime Minister, as Minister of Justice, squashed that altogether; it was finished. But now it has raised its ugly head again, and the hon. the Minister himself has raised it and has left in the air without giving us any answer at all. Let me say this to the hon. member who has just sat down. It is a great pity that he has left the Chamber. I would like to address these remarks also to the hon. the Minister. They say all this does South Africa&#x2019;s image a lot of harm. What does? To talk about it, to keep the Government on its toes? Let me say that there is no Government&#x2019;s policy which does more to help and encourage the growth of the communist doctrine than this Government&#x2019;s own policy. Let me say that the object of every communist regime and movement is to subvert the democratic processes in that country. There is not one communist country which is not totalitarian. There is not one communist country where there is freedom for the individual, where there is a court which is the arbiter of his rights. Let me say, Sir, that if this process of subverting those democratic processes of the courts, especially, is allowed to continue, if it is allowed to take place at all, that in itself is a subversion of those processes and an achievement of the objects of Communism itself. I want to say to the Minister and to the hon. member who has just sat down also, that nothing does the image of this country more good than the knowledge that there is a healthy democratic society with a healthy political campaign and healthy political parties. That is what does us good, the very fact that it is there. If these things were not raised by the Opposition, if things could happen without demur, that would do us a great deal of harm. But I will tell you what will do a lot of good. That is that when these things are raised there should be a little more frankness on the part of hon. Ministers, that something was wrong and that they will not countenance it and that they will see that it will not happen again. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. B. SCHOEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>With reference to the main speaker on the side of the Opposition, I want to content myself with the following. He said this House was a place where we were concerned with politics and that this was not a high school debate. I just want to remind him not to make the mistake of confusing politics with a lack of propriety. If that is his idea of politicising in this House, I am afraid he is in the wrong place. We must maintain a sense of proportion here and we must keep the person of the Minister of Justice and his Vote where they belong. Furthermore, I want to remind him, since he accused this Government of allegedly being responsible for the breeding-ground of communism, that there have been many from his profession in this country who have lost their sense of proportion and have come here with this type of suggestive argument, and who are the main henchmen of communism. That is enough about him.</p>

<p><span class="col_7137-7138" refersTo="page_0523"/>I should like to address the hon. the Minister and in the first place express my personal appreciation to him for having granted, after several years of negotiations, a full-fledged magistrate&#x2019;s office to Randburg which previously had a detached office. I just want to assure him that I am speaking on behalf of the legal profession of Randburg who appreciate this very much, as well as the fairness and reasonableness with which he handled the whole situation, making one concession after another after he had become satisfied over the years that it was in fact justified. In the second place, and farther to what was said by the hon. member for Christiana, I want to mention something in regard to the Leeukop prison. If there is any institution which meets the requirements of an ideal institution, both as regards adjustment in and to the community in which it has been placed, that institution most certaintly is the Leeukop prison. Here we have an institution which converts punishment into a blessing and an advantage. We have practical proof of this, because as from as far back as 1966 prisoners have been trained in the building industry and up to now as many as 470 Bantu prisoners have passed their trade tests. In this way they have attained full artisan status in the building industry. Because the prison is situated in my constituency, I had the privilege of visiting these training centres. Sand, for example, is used instead of clay so that Bantu prisoners may be taught how to build straight walls. It is done so that the smallest possible loss of money is involved. The care and precision with which this is done, commands respect. In a different field I also have in mind the training of cooks and waiters. Because meals are served in the large recreation halls, the prisoners have the opportunity of receiving practical training under excellent guidance. We can only express our greatest respect and appreciation towards the Whites who supervise this.</p>

<p>I want to point out that we have an institution here which sets itself the task of protecting our flora and fauna and it affords the Bantu, the Black man, the opportunity of developing respect for it as well. The protection of wild birds, fish and wild animals is enjoying active attention and the prisoners have the opportunity of working with these things so as to teach them to respect them and not to harm, damage or eradicate them. These are things which happen unseen every day. Here we have a case of a group of pioneers in this field, the White staff in charge, doing their duty day after day also in regard to the less privileged Bantu.</p>

<p>Before I resume my seat, I want to express my appreciation of the wonderful shooting-range the Leeukop prison has made available to the shooting commandos of North Rand and Johannesburg West. Their leadership in regard to pistol shooting for ladies and gentlemen, is commendable. The South African championships were staged there once, and will most probably again be held there next year. The sacrifices these officials make in the interests of the community in which they have been placed, also in the wider sense of the word, as well as in the interests of our guardianship over the Bantu in that they train the Bantu who have been placed under their supervision, compel me to hand this bouquet this afternoon to the Minister and his staff who assist him in this regard.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to begin this evening with a non-contentious matter and that is the position of the Section Titles Act. There is a good deal of concern throughout the country regarding this Act as to whether or not it is going to be promulgated and, if so, when. Furthermore there are rumours which, I am sure, have been brought to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the effect that the Government is now having second thought concerning the whole operation of this Act and that it is going to be deferred for many years. This is the rumour.</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>It is going to be deferred; it is going to be postponed for several years. The hon. the Minister should be aware that the longer this Act is kept off the Statute Book, the more damage is being done to the construction of flat accommodation which is much needed. I do not want to go into great detail in this Vote&#x2014;I shall deal more fully with it when the Community Development Vote is dealt with&#x2014;but I should like to refer the hon. the Minister to one statement. That is a statement by the Chairman of one of the big construction companies<span class="col_7139-7140" refersTo="page_0524"/> which is concerned with the building of housing accommodation. I refer to Mr. Schachat, the Chairman of Schachat Cullum. This is what he said in his latest chairman&#x2019;s review, dated 28th April, 1972&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Due to the deferment of the Sectional Titles legislation and the high prevailing interest rates, the group postponed the building of any further blocks of flats, but will again enter this field when conditions become more favourable and particularly when this legislation becomes operative.</block>

<p>This is the sentiment of a great many on the flat-building entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>What I ask the hon. the Minister to do, is to use the opportunity of this Vote to clarify the position. I believe he will do so if he answers the following questions which I wish to put to him. I ask him to answer these questions. In reply to a question which I asked him at the beginning of February, the hon. the Minister indicated that he hoped the Act would be put into operation by the end of 1972. I ask him firstly to answer this question: Will the Act be put into operation this year? Secondly, if it will not be, because the regulations are still not ready, will he give an undertaking, not merely an expression of hope, that the Act will be brought into operation, let us say, during the first half of next year, or, if that is not possible, will he give an undertaking that it will be brought into operation during the second half of next year so that the people will at least have a definite undertaking to which they can work? At the moment the position is so undefined that, as I say, many people are beginning to believe that this is being postponed indefinitely.</p>

<p>The third question which I believe the hon. the Minister should answer is this: It has been suggested that if it is put into operation, it will be put into operation in certain areas at first and gradually extended throughout the country. I should like him to say whether the Act will, in fact, now be put into operation throughout South Africa at the same time, or in certain areas first and then gradually extended until it becomes applicable to the whole country. If it is to be put into operation in certain areas first, the suggestion has been that Cape Town will be the first area because the Deeds Registry here is well on top of its work and ought to be in a position to cope with the extra work.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Did you refer to Cape Town?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. Rumour has it that Cape Town will be the first area where it will be put into operation. As I say, I ask the hon. the Minister to say whether, in fact, it will be put into operation in respect of certain areas at first and, if so, which will be these areas? If it is Cape Town, I suggest to the hon. the Minister that he should give further thought to this, because although the Deeds Registry may be well up to date here, this is one of the areas which has had least experience in regard to the buying of flats, which, as the hon. the Minister will know, is common practice today, but not on the sectional title basis. It is on a block-share basis. If he does intend to put it into operation in respect of certain areas first, I suggest that he should start in Durban, not through any parochial reason, because I happen to come from Durban, but because Durban happens to be one of the areas in the country which has had the greatest experience on this whole subject of block-share buying of flats. I believe that if he does intend putting it into operation in certain areas first, this will be the best place for him to start.</p>

<p>Now I come to the fourth question I should like him to answer. Again it has been rumoured that the Government is having second thoughts regarding certain provisions of the Act, that it is thinking that certain provisions are unworkable, and that it will therefore not promulgate this Act until it comes to the House to introduce further amendments. I ask him to say categorically whether the Government intends making any changes in the Act before it is put into operation. I believe that if he answers these questions, he will put people who are interested in the building of flats, in a position where they will know precisely where they stand and can then make their arrangements in advance for whenever the Act comes into operation.</p>

<p>In the short time left to me, I want to deal with a few more matters. I want to come back to the question of the prison population. The hon. the Minister accepted that the non-White prison population in South Africa is high. I am not now dealing with a comparison with other countries,<span class="col_7141-7142" refersTo="page_0525"/> just with the fact that it is high. I do think that as Minister of Justice, it is his duty to give further consideration to this question than he has given already and to see whether ways and means cannot be found for reducing this population. If he does not like the suggestions of Judge Steyn, I think he ought to get somebody working on it, so that suggestions can be found for ameliorating the position.</p>

<p>In regard to the suggestion made by the hon. member for Potchefstroom that civil jurisdiction should be given to regional courts, I suggest to the hon. the Minister that if the Government wishes to seriously consider this proposition, they must tread very carefully. Whilst there may be quite a lot to be said in favour of it, there are also problems which could be faced. I do not have time to discuss it in detail, but I do urge that this whole question should be very carefully investigated if serious consideration is to be given to it before introducing any measures along these lines.</p>

<p>Then I want to say something to the hon. member for Kroonstad. He said that Judge Botha found in this commission of inquiry into criminal procedure and evidence that section 215<i>bis</i> is necessary. I had a look at the section dealing with it, and I can find nothing in his report which is to the effect that he finds section 215<i>bis</i> necessary.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should have liked to avail myself of the opportunity to say a few words to or intend a few words for the two hon. members over there&#x2014;I am sorry that one is now leaving. Unfortunately my time has been cut by half and therefore I rather prefer to keep myself occupied with something which may be of a particularly local nature, but which I nevertheless regard as something of special importance.</p>

<p>Sir, I should again like to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the question of the condition of the magistrate&#x2019;s offices at De Aar. This building is old, obsolete and inadequate, and I believe it should have been replaced years ago. When I say &#x201C;inadequate&#x201D; I really mean that problems arise there. It is situated on the main road, practically on the pavement. On a Monday morning, after all the weekend arrests have taken place, there is an enormous flocking together of people in the main road, because those people who have to appear before the court, witnesses or interested parties, have no place to assemble in the courtyard. It really is a danger. There is no courtyard. I am aware of&#x2014;and have in my possession&#x2014;the replies which the department has already given, viz. that the replacement of that building or the erection of a new building complex is not included in the five-year plan which, if I remember correctly, expires in 1975. I am also aware of the fact that at a higher level consideration is being given to carrying out temporary alterations which may serve as temporary relief. I have a polite request to make to the Minister and his department and that is to bear in mind that the population there is increasing all the time. At present the population is more than 20 000. We should not lose sight of the fact that the circuit court also sits there periodically. My request is&#x2014;it will be in the interests of the department and everyone&#x2014;rather not to think in terms of temporary alterations. I do not think these alterations can in fact serve the purpose, and I do not think they would be worth the money spent on them. My final request is: If it is in any way possible, would the hon. the Minister and his department mind considering the matter once more in order to try to see whether that work cannot be placed on the priority list? I realize that the work will be at the expense of some or other project, but this is a very polite request, and it is also one on behalf of my voters, and the local bodies in particular.</p>

<p>&#x2026; that there is nothing barring the way. It is simply a question of funds. He asked us to see whether we could place it on the priority list. I do not want to make any promises here, but I shall ask the departmental head to go into the matter and see what he can do. It is not that we are unsympathetic. I know there are many places experiencing difficulties with buildings which have to be replaced. Unfortunately one cannot do everything at the same time and some have to wait. But I promise the hon. member that we shall have a look at De Aar. Sir, I think I shall leave it at that. I do not think he expects me to say any more at this stage.</p>

<p>In regard to what the hon. member for Musgrave has said, I think I can put his mind at rest immediately. There is not the slightest intention to delay the Sectional Titles Act. All that is worrying us at the moment is the fact that we have to consult with such a large number of institutions and people who have a direct interest. We are experiencing some trouble in getting the necessary replies speedily. We received one reply a day or two ago. They come in slowly, but as they come in they are being attended to. There is not the slightest intention to delay or postpone the putting into operation of this Act, or to alter it. We may find it necessary, after having studied the suggestions and regulations, to make slight alterations; I do not want to say that we will not alter it at all. However, that is the position. We have to consult with town councils, surveyors, and a lot of other bodies, and that is what is delaying its being put into operation at the moment. But we do not have the slightest intention of postponing the coming into operation of this Act or of altering it. The hon. member also asked how this measure will be put into operation. I do not know what suggestions the department may make, but up to this stage there is not the slightest intention of putting it into operation in different areas on different dates. The idea is that once we are ready to publish the regulations, it will be put into effect immediately in all parts of the country. It is not a case of Cape Town being given preference. We do not propose to do so. The reason for it is that they are up to date with their work. As a matter of fact this is the case all over the country now, so that there is no reason why one area should be given preference over the other. I hope the hon. member will report that to his colleague.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I am sorry. I forgot to mention it. We have every reason to believe that we will be able to promulgate it this year. Hon. members know what can happen, but this is all I can say at the moment. There is no reason why this measure should be delayed and we hope to introduce it this year.</p>

<p>*There is something I should like to bring to the attention of this House in a few words if time allows me to do so. It is something which we on this side of the House experience often. We are often accused of having the Communists after our blood and of being the reason why Communists are active here. However, we should labour under no misapprehension in this regard. The Communists are after all of us, without any exception. There are no exceptions. They are after anyone who is not a Communist, and after any country that is not under Communist control. That is the position. I just want to mention a few of the things they say. What I want to mention is not rumours but facts. That is what they themselves say. I can give hon. members the references to where these things are to be found. However, I do not believe that it is desirable to do so here in this House now. They said, for example:</p>

<block name="quote">The political, economic and social structure of South Africa rests on the foundation of a colonial dispossession and enslavement of the African people. To maintain and perpetuate that structure is the cardinal policy of all sections of the White ruling classes. The differences between<span class="col_7145-7146" refersTo="page_0527"/> them are and have ever been related only to the question of how best to achieve this policy.</block>

<p>They went on to say:</p>

<block name="quote">The dominant British imperialists and Witwatersrand finance capitalists&#x2019; interests represented traditionally by Smuts and his South African Party strove to cover the brutal reality of the State behind a facade of respectability and humanitarian benevoltnce &#x2026; Smuts and his followers entered Hertzog&#x2019;s Cabinet as junior partners. Hymns were sung to unity. In due course the Saps and the Nats, with the exception of a few bitter-enders headed by Dr. Malan, merged into a single party, the United Party. The price of this politicians&#x2019; honeymoon was paid by the working people as unemployment and depression spread through the country. As part of the deal Smuts and the liberals dropped their opposition to the Hertzog Bills &#x2026; The Nationalist Party steadily increased its support among all the White groups during the 1960s. The United Party grew increasingly frantic in its search for a way of arresting its decline and began to pose absurdly as being more anti-African than the Nationalists. The Progressive Party stagnated and the Liberal Party disappeared.</block>

<p>They continued by summing up the situation as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">In South Africa a very good percentage of even those who vote United Party or Progressive Party feel safe under the protection of the Nationalist Party.</block>

<p>What I have just read is very interesting. The summary is theirs and not mine. They continued:</p>

<block name="quote">They vote for the Opposition only for traditional reasons or for the maintenance of the two-party system and the English language.</block>

<p>That is what they say. [Interjections.] Wait a moment; we must not quarrel about this. It is in the interests of both parties. They continued:</p>

<block name="quote">To the voters the meaning of apartheid (literally separateness), was clear enough. The degradation of the majority of the population and White supremacy, already entrenched and fortified by every Union Government since 1910, were to be tightened up and extended in every field of South African life, economic, social and political. Essentially this programme was a continuation of the policies pursued by the Smuts Government and its predecessors. The United Party, headed after Smuts&#x2019; death by J. G. M. Strauss and Sir De Villiers Graaff, hastily doffed the &#x201C;liberal&#x201D; garb it had assumed during the Second World War.</block>

<p>This is evidence which was given in court. Then they spoke about the N.E.U.F., some Non-European United Front, and said the following:</p>

<block name="quote">The N.E.U.F. is duty-bound to its principle of working for the emancipation of the non-European people and is honour-bound to the confidence reposed in it by the masses of the people to carry on the struggle against the pass laws, poll tax, pick-ups, anti-Asiatic legislation, segregation, Colour bar in industries, low wages, sweated labour, poverty, unemployment, and all the other laws that oppress our people, and must fight for the recognition of African Trade Unions and full rights of citizenship.</block>

<p>Now hon. members can guess who says this. This quotation was taken from a statement in a court of law.</p>

I say it might well have been the<span class="col_7147-7148" refersTo="page_0528"/> case. But I leave it at that. This shows you, Sir, what their feelings are. Let me read another passage&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the African, the Coloured and all truly democratic peoples of South Africa and the world to declare their solidarity and support for the just struggles of the Indian people against the fascist measures of the Union Government.</block>

<p>They do not refer to &#x201C;the Nationalist Party&#x201D; but to the &#x201C;Union Government&#x201D;. Here I have another document dealing with South Africa. Unfortunately I cannot quote from it, because time is marching on. They say this of all countries. Here I have a document dealing with the United States. I do not want to trouble the House with it. Here I have a document dealing with Israel. They condemn it. Next I have a document dealing with Finance; they condemn it. Here I have a document dealing with Western Germany; they condemn it. Here I have a document dealing with Madagascar; they condemn it. They say that Madagascar is only concerned about its tourist trade and then they proceed to abuse Madagascar. Here I have a document dealing with the Sudan. Here I have a document dealing with Portugal and other African States. I think there is sufficient time to quote the following short passage&#x2014;which is of local interest&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The recent demonstration against the 22 &#x2026;</block>

<p>These are the 22 people detained after a certain case, and for whose detention we were severely upbraided, also by that side of the House&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The recent demonstration against the 22 by Nusas has given rise to some comrades over-exaggerating the importance of the White campuses. &#x2026; Of course, the impact of world students and revolutionary forces inside South Africa leave their marks, but there is the White lager and the Black bogey to counter plus the effect of the Afrikaner student group.</block>

<p>But now you must listen to the next bit. It is very interesting and significant to me. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I welcome the support shown by the White students in support of our comrades, the 22.</block>

<p>These people are their &#x201C;comrades&#x201D;. These are the people on whom I place restrictions, something for which I was blamed. What does the House think of that? Here is another document dealing with the courts. We are to see to it that these people are brought before the courts and not simply detained. I want the House to hear what is said about the courts. The document reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is a reference to the students and others&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; demand the release or trial of the 22.</block>

<p>That side did the same thing. It continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; Where? In fascist courts by loyal and subservient law officers &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is what they want. It reads further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They are satisfied with the fascist laws and courts&#x2014;or maybe not, maybe they simply do not understand that those courts have become a farce and an instrument to the oppressors.</block>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I understand that in the near future the hon. the Minister of Mines will be introducing a Bill which will deal with pneumoconiosis and allied diseases. I am not certain when this Bill will come before the House, but I think that this is a good time to exchange a few thoughts about what is contemplated as far as the health of the mineworker is concerned. Because of the growing complexity of the mining industry and allied industries, I find that pneumoconiosis alone cannot be considered as the only disease that is affecting the mineworker,<span class="col_7151-7152" refersTo="page_0530"/> for which compensation is required. Pneumoconiosis as we know it has been subdivided and there are other conditions as well which we now have to take into consideration when we are dealing with compensation of the mineworker. The main one that is taken into consideration now is tuberculosis, and another one of the subdivisions of pheumoconios is that is compensated for is asbestosis. But there are others; we have to consider cardiac diseases and bronchitis.</p>

<p>It is chronic bronchitis that I want to say a few words about now. An experiment, known as the Carletonville Study, was conducted. The hon. member for Carletonville probably knows about this. Some remarkable findings were obtained as the result of this study. Up to now chronic bronchitis has not been compensated for, but as a result of this study we find that the time has arrived when consideration must be given to compensating miners who are found to be suffering from chronic bronchitis. There were two groups of people who underwent this investigation. 265 people were not exposed to a dusty atmosphere. Of those 265 people, only 19,6 per cent were found to be suffering from bronchitis. 562 people were exposed to a dusty atmosphere and of this group, 39,3 per cent contracted chronic bronchitis, and have not been compensated for the disease. When the Minister contemplates introducing new legislation, I feel that he must not only bear in mind those diseases which are already being compensated for, but he must include chronic bronchitis, because we know now that the disease is aggravated by the dusty atmosphere, that they do suffer from this disease, and that it is debilitating, and I feel that they should be compensated for it.</p>

<p>There are allied diseases which the Minister of Mines, in his capacity as Minister of Mines and Minister of Health, will have to take into consideration. One of the reasons why I suggested that the Division of Industrial Health should be expanded, is because, in general industry, cases of pneumoconiosis have been found in the following industries: Monumental masonry, ferrous foundries, refractories, ferrous and non-ferrous foundries, engineering (especially where grinding is taking place), asbestos products manufacturing, metal polishing and buffing, stock brick manufacturing; pottery, tile and pipe manufacturing, face-brick manufacturing, ornamental pottery manufacturing. All these industries are employing people who suffer from pneumoconiosis as a direct result of contact with dust. Sir, I want to leave that for a moment, but I want to impress upon the Minister how important it is for him to take all these diseases into consideration when he is dealing with pneumoconiosis. I want to ask him to take these people who are suffering from diseases in allied industries under his wing for treatment and to see that they are compensated on the same basis as the mineworker.</p>

<p>I want to say a few words again about the accident rate on the mines. I spoke about this briefly last year, and in the few minutes left to me I want to say to the hon. the Minister again that something must be done to try to lessen the accident rate on the mines. In 1970 on the gold mines there were approximately 425 000 people employed. We had nearly 25 000 accidents on the gold mines. Of these 24 thousand were not fatal accidents. All in all, we had 524 fatal accidents. On the coal mines we had 79 deaths out of 1 788 accidents. On the diamond mines we had 21 deaths; in other mineral mines we had 146 deaths. All in all, in 1970 there were 813 deaths on the mines. The position is very unsatisfactory because many of these accidents in which people have been killed could have been obviated. Here I have a few examples to show what is taking place&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A guard was killed when he fell into a hopper whilst operating a radial door in a chute and was covered by the broken ore from the box. No person noticed the awkward position in which the operator had to work and neither did the operator complain. During 1970 &#x201C;Trucks and Tramways&#x201D; claimed the lives of 7 Whites and 143 non-Whites and injured 165 Whites and 6 003 non-Whites. The total number of accidents and casualties during 1970 on mines and works were: Deaths 58 Whites and 763 non-Whites, injured 2411 Whites and 28 579 non-Whites.</block>

<p>Sir, these are injuries which are not trivial; they are injuries which resulted in the workers having to be put off work for not less than 14 days. How long can an industry be allowed to go on when the casualty rate is as high as that? In an industry fraught with such great potential health and accident hazards, where two people die<span class="col_7153-7154" refersTo="page_0531"/> almost every day and where there are over 30 000 non-fatal accidents every year, I feel that the pensions and the compensation paid to these people working in the mines are totally inadequate. The pneumoconiosis pensions and the compensation paid in respect of accidents and deaths should be reassessed and re-adjusted immediately to what we regard as rational and reasonable figures. I feel that the hazards to which people working on the mines are exposed must be taken into account when determining compensation, otherwise I am certain that we are going to find that as the years go on we are going to have fewer and fewer young people entering the mines. It is impossible to go on like this, and I ask the hon. the Minister to take these matters into consideration when he introduces his new Bill. I feel that people working on the mines have not been fully compensated in the past for health hazards. The same applies to the accident rate, where people are disabled or killed and where the widows simply cannot make ends meet on the compensation that is now paid to them. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I rise immediately to reply to the few points raised by the hon. member for Rosettenville, and I should also like to raise one matter with him. The first point is in connection with accidents. I am referring now to all mines and works in South Africa. Let me say, firstly, that the incidence of accidents, and death as a result of accidents, is of course a matter about which we are always concerned. It is a matter which we handle with the greatest circumspection at all times; it is a matter to which the Government Mining Engineer devotes his personal and continual attention. Secondly, when one compares these statistics with mining in the rest of the world, one should not overemphasize the incidence in South Africa. I think that would be wrong. I also want to tell the hon. member that since I have held this portfolio, I have not received any specific complaints or representations from the mineworkers in regard to this matter. In other words, they realize that within the limits of the dangers which, in any case, are inherent in mining, there is the closest co-operation on the part of the authorities, mine management and the mineworker to keep the accident figure as low as possible. The position last year, for all mines and works, was that 824 persons were killed and 30 046 injured. When one compares these figures with those for the previous year, one finds that the accident figure per thousand is the same. The fatality rate last year was slightly lower than that for the previous year. In 1970 it was 1,18 per thousand, as against 1,14 per thousand last year. In other words, there was no increase. I can also tell hon. members that the main causes of accidents in mines other than coal mines are rockbursts or falls of ground, while accidents in the coal mines are caused mainly by traffic&#x2014;in other words, trains, rail traffic and so forth. In the second half of January this year, I launched a campaign at the Blinkpan Mine in the Eastern Transvaal which was aimed at reducing the number of traffic accidents in the coal mining industry, if at all possible. I also want to say that the Chamber of Mines as well as the mineworkers&#x2019; unions were represented, and that every effort is being made to make a success of this campaign. So much as regards accidents.</p>

<p>Now, as far as occupational diseases are concerned, hon. members will remember that during the discussion on this Vote last year, I announced that I intended to introduce legislation this session to amend the Pneumoconiosis Compensation Act, 1962. Briefly, the historical facts are these: This legislation has been in operation now for about 10 years, 10 years during which a great deal of good has been forthcoming from the operation of the Act for the unfortunate mineworker who has contracted pneumoconiosis. However, we also learnt a great deal during this decade. This legislation was drawn up by my Department last year and it was discussed with all interested persons. I may say that I also had exhaustive discussions with the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union and with the Federation of Mining Trade Unions. I am pleased to say that we reached a very large measure of agreement. In this connection I want to emphasize that this legislation does not relate to pneumoconiosis only; it will be called the Occupational Diseases Act. The hon. member for Rosettenville intimated that chronic bronchitis would possibly be such a disease. There are others as well. I shall say a word or two about that just now.</p>

<p>I have also had this legislation made available to all interested parties, including the Chamber of Mines, for their comments. We are still having talks with them. This is a very important piece of legislation and we envisage far-reaching changes. Without going into detail, allow me to<span class="col_7155-7156" refersTo="page_0532"/> mention just two things. The one is that it is intended now to have two stages instead of three. The second principle is to pay a person a lump sum instead of a pension, and that amount will now take the same form as an amount disbursed under the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. In other words, if a person has contracted an occupational disease, it is his right to be compensated in that regard. Hon. members will, of course, also realize that one must not act precipitately with legislation as far-reaching and as greatly improved as this, nor do I want to place this House in the position of having to decide overhastily in this regard. I want to say furthermore that as far as the financial implications are concerned, the Cabinet instruction was very clear and the Federation of Mining Trade Unions and other interested parties are aware of it. The instruction was that these lump sums of money had to estimated actuarially in such a way that they would involve no increase in current expenditure. Any increase is a matter for the Cabinet itself to decide, and a decision has still to be reached in this regard. Because these discussions have not yet been finalized, I do not intend to introduce this legislation this year, but to discuss it further with interested parties during the recess and, if possible, to publish it. If possible, visits will also be paid to other countries and places, either by my Department or by myself, so that we can acquaint ourselves with what is being done there in regard to occupational diseases generally, not only pneumoconiosis.</p>

<p>The further point I want to emphasize is that this legislation will apply not only to the mineworker, but to all workers in South Africa who are employed in mines, works or factories. I have taken the liberty of introducing this legislation a year later because I have experienced a great deal of goodwill among the representatives of the mineworkers and because, in any event, at the beginning of the session next year, I intend not only to introduce the Bill, but to have it referred to a Select Committee. I think it is fair and equitable to deal with such an important matter in this way, because we must not forget that this legislation, the pneumoconiosis legislation already on our Statute Book and the legislation we envisage, is legislation which really gives the lead to the entire world. We are in the van in regard to modern legislation concerning pneumoconiosis and, once the new legislation is placed on the Statute Book, that will be the position with regard to occupational diseases generally. I am aware that there are certain pneumoconiosis sufferers who are finding things difficult at the moment, but they are also conscious of the fact that this Government has always been more than generous to them. During the five years that I have been responsible for this portfolio we have effected increases on no fewer than four occasions, and I think it was quite unexpected that, notwithstanding the economic conditions prevailing in the country when the Budget was introduced, we were still able to give relief to the widows of pneumoconiosis sufferers and to pneumoconiosis pensioners. I therefore want to appeal to the mineworkers in general and to their representatives to be patient and to enable us to make use of this further year so that eventually we can produce what will really be model legislation. In the meantime they do still have the benefit of the concessions made in the last Budget.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to other possible occupational diseases in respect of which compensation ought to be paid. Just let me give the hon. member the following facts: The first is that the National Research Institute for Occupational Diseases came into being under the wing of the Medical Research Council with Prof. Oosthuizen as Chairman of the Institute. All interested parties, including the Department of Labour, my Department, employers and employees, are represented on that Institute, and they are doing research in regard to occupational diseases. I inaugurated a mobile unit recently which will visit various industries to give lectures and to carry out tests. The hon. member for Virginia has raised the question of schlerodermi in the past. I want to give the House the following information so that hon. members will have some idea of the enormous amount of research required before one can say with reasonable certainty that such an industrial disease is of a compensable nature. On my instructions, research has been done in this connection over the past 18 months; 89 263 cases among South African Railway personnel have been investigated; 20 000 cases in the military services have been investigated; and 33 917 cases in the Mine Benefit Society have been investigated. This deals with the whole history of the case, including the findings. 7 440 post-mortem examinations were carried<span class="col_7157-7158" refersTo="page_0533"/> out, 6 000 at a certain clinic in Johannesburg. In other words, each of 156 000 cases was investigated properly by scientists. The files from 1953 at the Miners&#x2019; Medical Bureau and all the out-patient files from January, 1970, to October, 1971, at the Johannesburg Hospital were examined. From this research it appeared that there were 136 cases of schlerodermi. Of those 136 cases, there were 115 which had in some or other way been connected with mining. In other words, there is a strong indication that the incidence of the disease schlerodermi possibly has some connection with mining. If it is proved that there is some connection, provision will be made under the new legislation for compensation to be paid in such cases. I think that answers the questions of the hon. member in connection with accidents as well as in connection with the pneumoconiosis legislation. There will most probably be other hon. members who will want to discuss this matter.</p>

<p>I want now to raise a matter with the hon. member which to my mind is of great importance as far as our miners are concerned. My colleague, the hon. the Minister of Labour, has already referred to it. During this session the chief speaker on labour matters, the hon. member for Yeoville, said here on behalf of the Opposition that it was the policy of the United Party that Bantu workers should be given affiliated trade union rights. This is the way he put it&#x2014;and I quote from his Hansard&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We believe that it would be much better if our Black workers in South Africa could be encouraged and our trade unions could be encouraged to come together and accept the Black workers at the outset perhaps as affiliated members. They can have their own organization, but they should be affiliated to the White trade unions. They could speak with one voice &#x2026;</block>

<p>And so he goes on. The hon. member for Wynberg also made a statement on this matter before she was gagged. She had this to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Surely Black workers should have the right to organize themselves for the purpose of collective bargaining and the improvement of working conditions in conjunction with existing trade unions and their leaders.</block>

<p>In other words, what has been suggested by the Opposition during this session is that the present situation in regard to trade unions in South Africa should be changed so that the Bantu could become organized; so that, as the hon. member for Yeoville said, they could be affiliated with the White trade unions &#x201C;at the outset&#x201D;&#x2014;in other words, with the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union as well&#x2014;and so that they could then speak with one voice. Firstly, they are in favour of changing the present situation; secondly, they are advocating that the Bantu should have their own organization; thirdly, they are advocating the affiliation of that organization with the White trade unions, and fourthly, that they should speak with one voice. There is one question that I want to ask the hon. member for Rosettenville immediately. It is not clear to me what the hon. member for Yeoville meant by the words &#x201C;at the outset&#x201D;. What does he mean by that? Does he mean that this will be the beginning and that it is an interim arrangement which will have to develop further at a later stage? I should like to know this from the hon. member.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. member now that our policy is diametrically opposed to this. I am not going to enunciate the policy now, because the hon. the Minister of Labour put it very clearly during the past two weeks. What is clear, however, is that the policy enunciated by the hon. member for Yeoville is in conformity with the policy not only of the Progressive Party, but also of Tucsa. Tucsa has been working towards a situation of this nature for some years now. I want to state very clearly that not only must our trade unions, and specifically the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union, take note of this, but that they ought also to express their views in this regard. The Mineworkers&#x2019; Union in South Africa is a trade union which acts very responsibly, a trade union with which we have sound co-operation. However, it is a trade union which is very careful to ensure that the colour bar in the mines is maintained. It is exclusively a White trade union and I think that they should state whether they agree with the policy of the United Party that the nonWhite, and specifically the Bantu, should be organized to affiliate with them and to speak with one voice with them. The second question I should like answered is: If they are to speak with one voice, how is this to happen? Will the Mineworker&#x2019;s Union be asked under United Party policy to allow the Bantu to affiliate with them in<span class="col_7159-7160" refersTo="page_0534"/> the mining industry? That is clear from what the hon. member for Yeoville has said. If this is so&#x2014;and I have no reason to believe that it is not so&#x2014;I want to say that what is now emerging in South Africa is a terrible thing. It flabbergasts me that we have had the suggestion here, completely unsolicited, that the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union, together with the other trade unions, should become affiliated with the Bantu, or the Bantu with them, so that when they come along to talk to me, as they have come along to discuss this legislation with me, they can speak with one voice. I shall be pleased if the hon. member will give us some clarity in this regard. Our mineworkers must know that, should the United Party come into power, this is going to be the policy. They must know then, as we on this side of the House see the policy, that it constitutes a most deadly threat to any mineworker in South Africa. If a policy of this nature is applied to the mineworker in South Africa it will not only be a dangerous policy. The labour peace which we enjoy on our mines and in our industries, the labour peace on which the security and the future of the mineworker are based, the peace that he has known down the years because his trade union has negotiated responsibly with us during this period&#x2014; this is done because there is adequate machinery to provide for the needs of the Bantu&#x2014;will be threatened. That labour peace will be affected. I want to say today that if ever such a policy is applied in South Africa in regard to the mineworker, not only will the mining industry suffer, but the whole of South Africa will face possible ruin. I want to ask the hon. member for Rosettenville whether this policy which the leader on his side in respect of labour matters has advocated&#x2014;the changing of the present situation, the affiliation with the White trade unions&#x2014;applies to the mining industry as well and whether it applies specifically to the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union. I think the miners in South Africa are entitled to replies to these questions from the hon. member from Rosettenville. I can come to no other conclusion than that that is the policy. It is inherent in the words of the hon. member for Yeoville and in the statement of the hon. member for Wynberg. Let me say on behalf of this Government that, together with the mine-workers, we shall oppose a tendency, a direction, a policy of this nature to the utmost, because it is in the interests of nobody.</p>

<speech by="#grobler">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. S. J. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, on behalf of the hon. members who represent mineworker constituencies, I at once want to thank the hon. the Minister for the very strong standpoint he has adopted in connection with the matter to which he has just referred. I think it is a good thing for us all, including every mineworker, to take note of the standpoint of the Government.</p>

<p>In the few minutes at my disposal I want to raise a few local matters with the hon. the Minister. Very recently, there on the East Rand, we had to take note of the closing of the office of the mining inspectorate. I want to say that we are very sorry that this office has had to be closed after so many years. We understand that the requirements of the service make this essential, and we accept it as such. I think it is fitting that we express appreciation here today to those people, who manned this office throughout the years, for their excellent service, including their services in the interests of the mineworkers on the East Rand.</p>

<p>If one looks at the annual report one sees&#x2014;the closing of this office has a bearing on that&#x2014;that the mines on the East Rand are slowly but surely disappearing. They are gradually closing down. Now we have another problem in this connection. It is also true that as a result of the proposed closing of the mines there, an increasing number of miners are actually being pushed out into the street at a relatively advanced age. Provision cannot be made for these people at other mines. I do not want to say that this is going to cause a social problem, but I do want to say that many of those families experienced quite extensive financial problems, particularly recently with the economic recession which has prevailed and which has restricted employment opportunities. I do not know what the solution is, but I want to know whether the Department of Mines cannot institute an investigation into what can be done for these people.</p>

<p>I also want to refer to a matter which was raised here by the hon. the Minister, i.e. the question of accidents on the mines. As the hon. the Minister rightly indicated, one must be grateful that the death rate due to accidents has decreased in the past few years. But now there is also another matter that bothers me in that connection. In the light of the proposed closing of the<span class="col_7161-7162" refersTo="page_0535"/> mines, particularly there on the far East Rand, I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he can give us the assurance that the safety measures for the protection of the workers will be applied as strictly at those mines which are closing down as they normally are at other working mines. I do not want to make allegations in this connection, but there is a bit of talk about this matter from time to time. One sometimes gains the impression that a little slackness creeps in when it comes to the application of these safety measures.</p>

<p>I now come to the last matter I want to touch upon. If one looks at the annual report one sees on page 3 that in order to aid pneumoconiosis pensioners and their widows who are old, ill and needy, as far as medical treatment is concerned, a procedure was. in addition, decided on under which such persons could be provided with free medical services by District Surgeons similar to those with which civil pensioners were provided who could not afford medical costs. It has now come to my attention that there are some of these pneumoconiosis pensioners, and also some of their widows, who are expected to pay their monthly medical fund contribution at the mine as in the past. This is taken from the pensions they receive. The other day a case came to my attention of a family from which R8 per month is taken in this respect. These people&#x2019;s standpoint is rightly that it is very difficult for them to still furnish this considerable monthly contribution to this medical fund. I should now like to ask the hon. the Minister, in the light of what appears here in this annual report, if an arrangement cannot be made to exempt these people from this compulsory contribution which they must pay every month. It might sound like a very unreasonable request, but I do nevertheless wonder whether an arrangement could not possibly be made whereby they are not simply referred to a district surgeon but, particularly with respect to the older people, whereby consideration is given to allowing them to retain their family doctors for the purposes of medical services and that those services then be granted to them free of charge. I am honestly convinced that this minor concession would mean a tremendous amount to these people.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I must say that the House has been extremely surprised to hear the Minister intervene in the debate at this early stage in order to deliver his message to the voters of Brakpan, by trying to drag in some suggestion&#x2014;he need not look at me in surprise&#x2014;and express his pious determination to support the rights of the White miners in this country. I do not think that the House has ever listened to such blatant electioneering for many a year. The hon. the Minister knows very well indeed that we have advocated that any change in the labour pattern in this country will only take place in full consultation and through discussions with all recognized registered trade unions in South Africa. The Minister knows that extremely well. He knows, furthermore, that in fact the problem is in his court at the moment. He has to deal with mining development in the homelands and with the opening of fresh mines there. He has to exploit the minerals in those homelands. He has the problem of introducing the indigenous labour of that country to skilled and semi-skilled occupations. That is a problem he will have to take up with trade unions. In fact, this matter was raised last year when the hon. the Minister was told &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. P. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask the hon. member a question?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>No, it will be too stereotyped. The position is that the hon. the Minister knows that there is a great scarcity of skilled labour in the country. Not only was this pointed out to him last year when he said he was quite satisfied with the situation, but even in this year&#x2019;s report of the Secretary for Mines for the year ended December 1970 we find that he lays great stress on the shortage of skilled labour in this country in the mining field. He is in the awkward position that he cannot even complete the geological surveys which have been demanded of his department, because of his lack of satisfactory employees. So bad is the position that he admits that at this stage already, there is a backlog of 15 years. He goes on to say very pertinently: &#x201C;The inability to do so &#x2026;&#x201D;, that is to carry out these geological surveys in regard to minerals, &#x2026; &#x201C;not only hampers development, but also causes prospecting companies unnecessary and fruitless capital expenditure&#x201D;. He goes further and says this: &#x201C;It is clear that unless a satisfactory solution for the geological survey&#x2019;s personnel problem are speedily found, the development of the country&#x2019;s natural resources will<span class="col_7163-7164" refersTo="page_0536"/> be seriously hampered and important development projects retarded.&#x201D; This is in an age when SAFTO is having a special seminar with regard to the question of the export of base metals from this country which it says will be the capital growth of the country in future years in so far as minerals in this country are concerned. It says: &#x201C;South Africa&#x2019;s best hone for its exports is to sell base metals.&#x201D; That very phase, which one of my colleagues, I am sure, will deal with in the course of the debate, is one of the most serious features which the hon. the Minister has to face. This is where he should direct his attention&#x2014;not to electioneering speeches, but to tell us what steps he is taking to deal with this problem. Did not he himself, when he opened the National Institute for Metallurgy, draw attention to the fact that there was a serious shortage of young men who are entering the fields of mining, for example, in extraction-metallurgy or mineral beneficiation? He knows himself that our universities, of which we only have two providing these courses at the moment, cannot attract sufficient satisfactory students to these departments. Does he not know himself that in his own Vote there is only a small sum of R200 set aside for scholarship bursaries at the University of the Witwatersrand? The maintenance and general expenditure for training schools, in fact, has been reduced by R60 000. Where is the provision the hon. the Minister should have been making in his Vote in order to cope with this particular problem? This is not a case which you can throw at the feet of the private sector, as we are often told we should do in the field of labour. Here is something of which the country should take note. Does he know, for instance&#x2014;I am sure he knows it&#x2014;that only 200 students approximately are at the moment being trained in these important fields? A country like Australia, which is very similar to ours with regard to prospecting for and exporting base metals, has over 1 000 students already at ten universities in which they have departments of mines and metallurgy, where they are encouraging students to study in order to equip the country for the future. When a country stands at the brink of such enormous developments as South Africa undoubtedly stands, one would expect the Minister to make a statement of important policy as to how he is going to meet this situation. Then we know that the Chamber of Mines themselves have said that, despite all the talk about gold dwindling in so far as its production is concerned, we will within the next 15 years be short of over 20 000 skilled workers in the mines&#x2014;White workers, let alone the shortage of another 100 or 150 000 non-White workers in the field of mining. These are facts to which we would like an answer from the hon. the Minister, because these are important matters which certainly deserve attention.</p>

<p>Sir, I would like to draw attention to another aspect with regard to the Vote. I notice that the amount of money that has been provided this year for the low-grade mines is less than last year. It has been reduced by a considerable sum. I would like the hon. the Minister to tell us whether, in view of the fact that there has been this tremendous increase in the price of gold, and the importance to this country of extracting every ounce now that it can, he is going to take some steps with regard to a reduction of R5 million in the assistance to needy mines. I think this is an important factor. I am not being critical at the moment, because, obviously, when the Budget was drawn up, the hon. the Minister was not aware of what was happening or what was to happen to the price of gold. I am a little surprised, though, in that the Minister of Finance always had faith in the fact that the price of gold would increase, and to his great pleasure and extreme surprise, I am sure, it has increased to the remarkable sum that it is now, namely over $50 an ounce. That is something which I think the hon. the Minister should explain to. us, and give us some enlightenment of what is taking place. Furthermore, I think that in view of this remarkable development, in view of the fact that the question of Saldanha Bay is becoming vitally important, and in view of the fact that we have had negotiations with large buyers like the Japanese, this is an occasion when, instead of listening to a tirade, we should rather hear from the Minister what his policy is in regard to mining in general in South Africa. What steps does he intend to take in order to ensure that we can now prepare, for a period of 15 to 20 years ahead, a complete plan to build up what is South Africa&#x2019;s natural export product, something which will help us to build up our G.N.P., which will help us to maintain our balance of payments, and which will raise the whole level of the South African economy, both for those who live within the economy now, and those who<span class="col_7165-7166" refersTo="page_0537"/> will be here in days to come? This is the sort of story we should like to hear from the hon. the Minister. I think it is time for him to tell us this. I notice, from what he said last year, that whilst he skirted around a number of subjects, including labour and so on, he has not given us any sound and direct policy.</p>

<p>I should like to support the hon. member for Rosettenville with regard to the question of industrial diseases. We are aware that the question of a new pneumoconiosis bill has been in the offing; we are just a little surprised that we have not had an opportunity of seeing a copy of this bill, so that we could study it and contribute our thoughts in this regard. In this way we could assist the Minister with regard to the structure of a bill of this nature. The hon. the Minister knows that over the years it has been the concern of this side of the House that workers should be adequately compensated. We have assisted the department and the Minister by constantly seeking new avenues into which we could direct their thinking, to ensure that sufferers, who have become victims of this disease, should have some improved form of income. This is a disease about which we knew very little at one time, but we are improving our knowledge in this regard; we are, however, not assisting those who have suffered from this disease in days gone by.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. J. C. ROSSOUW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to link up with the hon. member for Springs and thank the hon. the Minister for the fine, detailed explanation he gave us in connection with the envisaged legislation he will introduce shortly, or otherwise early next year. We hope and trust that the Act will be a great success. I am not going to follow up on what the hon. member for Jeppes said; the Minister will square accounts with &lt;u&gt;him &lt;/u&gt;when he replies.</p>

<p>Today it is my unpleasant task, not to follow up on what someone has said, but to reply to two Press reports. The first appeared in the publication of the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union of 19th April, under the heading: &#x201C;Mnr. Koeks Rossouw het ons gewis baie teleurgestel.&#x201D; The report appears under the name of the general secretary, Mr. Paulus. Then, Sir, I also want to reply to a letter which appeared in the <i>Western Transvaal Record</i> of 5th May, under the heading &#x201C;Miners Angry&#x2014;Rossouw fails to see them in Cape Town&#x201D;. Sir, if there is one matter which even the Opposition cannot blame me for&#x2014;and for which I believe no one can blame me&#x2014;it is the fact that I shall act in the interests of the mineworkers in season and out of season. I believe there is a misunderstanding here, and that I must put this right today. I shall begin by saying that in mid-February I was contacted telephonically by Mr. Arie Paulus, the secretary. He informed me that on 2nd March, at 9 o&#x2019;clock, he would be having an interview with the Minister of Mines. He also asked me whether the mineworkers&#x2019; group of the National Party could give him a hearing at 8 o&#x2019;clock in the morning. In that same conversation I informed him that unfortunately I would have to offer my excuses. 1st March is municipal election day throughout the Transvaal. On 1st March elections were also held at Stilfontein and Orkney and I have to be there. No less than 90 per cent of the candidates who stood for election in Orkney and Stilfontein on 1st March were mineworkers or persons connected with the mining industry. Sir, I briefly want to put it to you in these terms: In the previous issue of the publication, which I have just mentioned, the issue of 23rd February, Mr. Arie Paulus makes an appeal and states: &#x201C;Support miners in election on 1st March.&#x201D; He appeals, in addition, for mineworkers to support their people in the municipal elections. In that same newspaper the local member, who represents the mineworkers in the districts of Klerksdorp, Orkney and the surrounding mines, Mr. Fanie Coetzee, also asked the mineworkers to support their people during the municipal elections. A year ago I already committed myself to that appointment. I committed myself to being in my constituency on that day. That is also how I put it to Mr. Paulus in our telephonic discussion. I told him that I could not be present here on that day, but that I would make arrangements for the deputation to be given a hearing. I immediately contacted the Minister of Mines and he informed me that it was not fitting that we should give Mr. Paulus a hearing before he had given him and his delegates a hearing, advising me however that we could contact them as individual members. I then took it upon myself to contact the various members. I shall mention their names: I mention the name of Mr. Van Wyk, the chairman of our group. I also contacted Dr. Brandt and told him. I also<span class="col_7167-7168" refersTo="page_0538"/> told Dr. Paul Bodenstein, who is not here this afternoon. I also informed Mr. Gielie de Wet. I am mentioning by name these persons who represent large mining constituencies. I also contacted various other members. I shall also mention the names of Messrs. Willie Grobler and Cas Greyling. There are also other members who, like myself, could not be here on that day, but who were busy at some town or other conducting a municipal election and helping their people. I explained all these things to Mr. Paulus, and now I want to say this: It is a pity that he took the very first chance to grab a pen and try to discredit me in the mineworkers&#x2019; newspaper. It is also a pity&#x2014;after I had put the matter to him in these terms&#x2014;that his representative, Mr. Fanie Coetzee, also tried to discredit me in the <i>Western Transvaal Record</i> which circulates in Klerksdorp and Potchefstroom and in Orkney and Stilfontein.</p>

<p>I am thankful for the results obtained in the discussions the Minister held with the deputation on that day. I am glad we have got to the point where shortly we shall be introducing an amended Act. We must make a great success of the said Act. But today I want to lay at the door of Mr. Arie Paulus&#x2014;and I also say this in all due responsibility to this House&#x2014;that it will depend on Parliament whether we pass this Act during this Session, and everyone, on the Government side and the Opposition side, looks forward to this Act being amended. We worked hard to get it this far. Initially this Act could even have been passed this year if he&#x2014;and now I am mentioning his name&#x2014;had not boycotted it at the start. Sir, it is a pity that one must cross swords with people that are one&#x2019;s friends, but unfortunately I must do so. I have here in my hand a memorandum, which I am keeping in my charge, in which the General Secretary of the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union condemns the new draft Bill to amend the Pneumoconiosis Act. If he had also co-operated in the beginning, I believe this Act would have been passed this year. But this Act will be passed next year, God willing. It will, as the hon. the Minister informed us, be called the Occupational Diseases in Mines and Works Act; it will not only be applicable to the mines, but will also include other industries which will fall under this Act in future. Sir, pneumoconiosis is not the only disease in the mining industry. There are also other diseases, as we have heard here today from a doctor. We agree that chronic bronchitis is also one of the causes. It is up to the doctors to convince the Minister and the department that provision must be made for that in the Act. Sir, this Act must be a success. Since we play a leading role throughout the world, we cannot allow this Act to fail again, as the 1956 and 1962 Acts failed.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>I do not know why the hon. member for Stilfontein came to this Committee to cross swords unilaterally with the leaders of the trade unions. I doubt whether we will be able to help him with his problems very much. As far as we are concerned, we are having discussions with people; they take place peacefully, and there is mutual confidence, and I hope the hon. member will be able to have his further discussions with the trade unions on the same basis.</p>

<p>f Mr. Chairman, I want to refer briefly, first of all, to the staff position in the Department of Mines. I raise this matter with a great deal of sympathy for the Secretary of the department and for this staff, who have a heavy responsibility at a time when the South African economy needs to be revitalized, when our foreign trade position is in considerable difficulty and when we are all searching for opportunities to redress our balance of payments. It is at a time like this that the Department of Mines is obliged to say that it has not got the staff to do the job that it is required to do. It indicated by implication that because of the vital role it has to play in the development of mining, the inadequacy of staff is, in fact, acting as a brake on the rapid development of mining in this country. These words will be found in pages 1 and 2 of the report. I might add, Sir, as a matter of regret, which I am sure the department shares with me, that we have to debate this important matter on the basis of a 1970 report. Sir, it is true that certain departments are able to produce reports which take us well into the preceding year, that is to say, into 1971 in the case of this year. The Department of Mining does include in its report a good deal of statistics. It is obviously not able to put together all the information which it is necessary for us to have in this report as a basis for a debate in 1972 unless it has the staff and the means to do these things. We read in the report that some three years ago it asked for a five-year review<span class="col_7169-7170" refersTo="page_0539"/> of its staff position. In 1970 the department was informed that the five year programme which it had drawn up could not be implemented because it was merely a first step; and that implementation could not occur until after a review by the Public Service Commission. Now this review by the Public Service Commission was postponed, it was said then in 1970, until 1st April, 1972. I hope that in view of the importance of this matter and the brake that the staff situation is putting on the development of mining in this country, the hon. the Minister will be able to give us the assurance that a review of the staff position is taking place or has taken place and that the measures necessary to equip this department to do its work will be put in hand as soon as possible.</p>

<p>I stress this with particular reference to geological survey. The reason is that the Department of Mines has to do the pioneer work in geological survey. Private enterprise has done a great deal in prospecting in order to chart the future of the mining industry in this country, but because of the high cost of prospecting, private industry can never look ahead for more than about 25&#x2014;30 years. It cannot carry the high capital costs of geological exploration and prospecting and drilling for more than such a period ahead. A country is safe if indeed raw materials and minerals can be found sufficient to provide for the foreseeable future of about 30 years. If one wishes to plan further ahead and one wishes to decide where to conserve, where to reduce development and where to expand development, it is in fact, through the Department of Mines and its geological division that this future planning and design must be conducted. We regret that they talk in this report of such small matters as one Land Rover being equipped with first rate instruments and that this will be started in 1971. We hope that the Land Rover has got started. In a country like this with its vast size and its vast geological resources, we should have a division of geological survey with a fleet of aircraft to conduct aerial surveys. It should have many Jeeps and Land Rovers on the ground; it should in fact be exploring the country in a far more intensive way and in greater depth than is at present taking place. However, we understand the difficulties of the department. We know that the manpower shortages are universal and we hope that the department, with the Minister&#x2019;s intervention, will do what it can to remedy this situation as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>In the short space of time available to me, I wish to touch on another specific subject and to seek the Minister&#x2019;s guidance and to get information from him. This relates to oil exploration. According to the department&#x2019;s report&#x2014;and again we have to base our information on the 1970 report&#x2014;on page 51, it appears that some research is going forward and some exploration is continuing but there is nothing to report, up to that date at any rate, which is truly economic or truly exploitable. We see no new hope in the land surveys being conducted by Soekor, of which this department is the technical adviser; there is nothing to justify any high hopes. We find in the report of the Industrial Development Corporation more recent information. This is what the IDC report for 1971 says:</p>

<p>Soekor: The results of exploration work during previous years indicated that only three areas on land justify further exploration: the Zululand, Algoa and Northern Karoo basins.</p>

<p>They go on to say what they have done and it turns out that very little has in fact been proved which justifies further work. Now Soekor, which leads land exploration for oil in South Africa, has spent upwards of R30 million, or had spent that amount by 1971. It also has extensive participation in oil exploration at sea. I would guess, although the figures are not available, that it has expended in the order of R40 million in the search for oil. This kind of money could well be justified if the prospects continue to be favourable. If the prospects are dwindling, if, in fact, the prospects of finding oil on land are virtually nil, as these reports seem to indicate&#x2014;I am talking of economic oil&#x2014;then has the time not come to review our position, to write off our losses, and to decide whether we might not with more advantage spend our capital resources on things which will yield greater results? I have in mind some other mineral resources which could well be developed. I have in mind the matter I raised when I started, namely that our geological survey could well be expanded to conduct exploration in other fields, which are almost certain to yield greater results than the apparently fruitless oil exploration. We share with the Minister his hopes that this most important and strategic material will in fact be found, but let us not waste our years<span class="col_7171-7172" refersTo="page_0540"/> and our millions of rand on a fruitless endeavour. We do not have the information on which to base a decision or an opinion on this matter, and we ask the Minister to tell us what the real position is at the moment and what a realistic assessment indicates we should do, particularly with regard to exploration for oil on land.</p>

<p>Briefly, I would also like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he has any progress to report in respect of the development of atomic energy. I refer particularly to the pilot plant for the enrichment of uranium in this country and, secondly, to the development and choice of a reactor for the first nuclear power plant to be erected in the country. I should like the hon. the Minister to give us an indication, if possible, of the progress made, what kind of economic results can be predicted and what sort of dates he has in mind for bringing both of these two projects into effect. If he has time, I should be grateful if he would also mention to us what progress has has been made in respect of fuel reprocessing. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#van_wyk">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. VAN WYK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this afternoon I should like to express my personal thanks to the hon. the Minister for the assurance he gave us to the effect that next year we are going to obtain revised and consolidated legislation in connection with pneumoconiosis. This will be the fulfilment of a promise made in 1962 when the 1962 Act was introduced. We trust that not only will the shortcomings of the 1962 Act be ironed out, but that, as the Minister promised, the net will be thrown wider so that other diseases, which also occur in mines, can be covered by it. In addition I am particularly glad that he gave us the assurance that the disease schlerodermi would possibly be included under this wider cover. And then I also want to congratulate the Government and the Minister on the far-sighted policy they have adopted in recent years to grant assistance to our marginal profit gold mines. The record price obtained on the market over the past few days is proof that the Government&#x2019;s confidence in gold was not misplaced and that the effort is now being rewarded. This means certain advantages for the gold-mining industry, for the mine-workers and also for the State. In that connection I want to point out that in: recent years the marginal profit mines received State aid to the tune of R31 500 000 to enable them to mine low-grade ore. This ensured work for 10 000 White mine-workers and 125 000 non-White workers. The gold production of these mines realized about R115 million per year. This was calculated at the official gold price. If a calculation were now to be made with the free market price as a basis, that amount would be in the region of R175 million&#x2014;as against a total amount of R61 500 000 already spent on the marginal profit mines. This points to only one thing, and that is a far-sighted policy adopted by a good Government.</p>

<p>Thirdly I should like to discuss a small matter with the hon. the Minister. It has been my unpleasant experience during the past year to have had a few of my voters arrested and sentenced as a result of illegal diamond transactions. According to newspaper reports doubts have been raised, in this connection, about the decoy system. Church bodies also expressed doubts about this system. In addition I also want to say that newspaper reports sometimes create the impression that innocent people are exposed to temptation by police traps which subsequently lead to lamentable results for them. Therefore I thought fit to go and find out from the Department of Mines which with the Police, is jointly responsible for the administration of the 1946 Precious Stones Act, what the actual state of affairs is. It was alarming to hear that in the past few years there have been between 500 and 700 per year arrests for contravention of the trade provisions of the Act. Secondly, during the past 12 years uncut diamonds with an overall value of R2 million have been found on persons who have obtained them illegally. These are not diamonds in respect of which traps were set, but diamonds stolen by employees in the course of their work at the mines and diggings. One must accept that only a small percentage of the actual cases in which diamonds were stolen was discovered. Therefore the true amount involved in the illegal diamond trade will amount to many millions of rand. In the first place this activity causes a great loss to the State. In the case of large diamond mines the Treasury receives from 60 per cent to 80 per cent of the profits from the undertaking. In addition, the raw and uncut diamonds exported out of the Republic and South-West Africa are subject to an export duty of 15 per cent and 10 per cent respectively. If the diamonds to the value of R2 million, to which I referred, were not recovered, the State would have lost between R200 000 and R300 000 in export duty. In the second place we must also<span class="col_7173-7174" refersTo="page_0541"/> think of the diggers who struggle to make a living because most diggings have been exhausted, while the possibility of getting profitable new diggings is extremely small. These people deserve the protection of the State, because this is their livelihood, and one cannot allow them to be deprived of their hard-earned incomes by unscrupulous law-breakers. I think that every right-minded person would like to see the illegal diamond trade combated. There can be a difference of opinion as far as the methods are concerned. However, the fact is that it is a difficult matter. A diamond is an article that can easily be hidden, transported and taken out of a country. That makes the policeman&#x2019;s task that much more difficult. The Police also tangle with unmitigated rogues, people who have a great deal of money and the contacts to sell the goods. The Police assure me, however, that they do not set traps without a good reason. It is only done after reports are received about the person and after the reports have been properly verified. A subsequent watch is kept on such a person&#x2019;s activities for a long time. Besides, we all know that not everyone is free to buy diamonds, and that ought to be sufficient warning not to take part in similar illegal activities. Those engaged in illegal diamond trading are robbing the State and the producer on a large scale. For that reason one does not want to advocate anything that restricts the actions of the Police, but since the Minister has appointed a commission to investigate the diamond industry, I trust that the commission will also give its attention to this matter, even if only to eliminate the stigma attached to the police trap system.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Virginia, who has just sat down, and the hon. member for Springs, followed a theme which I should like to develop. Before I do that, I should like to express my thoughts as far as the &lt;u&gt;minin&lt;/u&gt;g industry is concerned, with reference to pneumoconiosis and other dangers attached to working on the mines. It is well to know that a new Bill will be introduced into this House. It is disturbing to find at this late stage in the mining industry we do have this devastating disease with its effects on the workers. I hope that when the Bill is passed through this House, the miners will receive such compensation as to assist them when they are of no further use for the industry.</p>

<p>The point that I should like to develop is the question of the dying mines. The hon. member for Springs made a point here in regard to the difficulty of absorbing the workers of these mines into other mines. The hon. member for Virginia also drew our attention to the higher price of gold. At this stage I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he cannot bring us up to date in this regard. We are dealing with an outdated report. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether, in the light of the high free price of gold, a review has been made of the position of those mines that may or may not close down. It would appear that a number of our mines that were on the border line with the price of gold at $35 an ounce, will now probably have a completely new lease of life. I think the Government owes it to the country and to the mineworkers to tell us what the future of these mines is. I am fairly certain that a number of the mines on the East Rand and on the West Rand, that were on the verge of closing, may be able to carry on much longer in view of the new higher price of gold. I think the Government should tell the country what the future of these mines is. When a mine dies, unfortunately the towns surrounding that mine die as well. Then an industry has to be built up with great difficulty in an effort to absorb the population, the shopkeepers and so forth, of that town and to make the town viable again. Some towns, of course, never become viable again. I think that at this stage in the mining industry, the Government should make a statement as to what the future of those mines will be. One becomes distressed when one reads in the papers that a certain mine has given notice that it will have to close down in a year or two years&#x2019; time. It is disturbing not only to the local population, but to everybody concerned. In view of the new stabilized price of gold on the free market&#x2014;it seems to be stabilized and it does not seem that it will drop to any extent&#x2014;I feel that a number of these mines that would have gone down the drain, will have another lease of life. I remember that some time ago, before we had devaluation, the then mining engineer gave the Reef, I think, another seven years of life. That was quite a long time ago. Today we see with the new price of gold what is happening. I feel that we have now come to a new stage where a number of our mines will be able to be saved. I know that the Government has spent a lot of money in order to save the border-line mines. But things have changed and with the new inflow of<span class="col_7175-7176" refersTo="page_0542"/> money from the new gold price, we expect to see a change in the industry.</p>

<p>It is interesting to read in this outdated report that 95 per cent of the revenue of the mines is spent on stores and wages. This goes on from year to year and never changes apparently. I think they only transfer the figure of 95 per cent from one report to the other. This is the major expense of the mines. One can therefore imagine what an effect it has on many other people, other than miners. I want to support the hon. member for Von Brandis in expressing my concern over the cut-back of geological surveys. We are disturbed to find a cut-back in this respect. I feel that a greater amount of money should be spent at this stage on the surveying of our country. From ordinary prospecting we know of the vast mineral resources that do exist in this country. Whether they are payable it is hard to say. There are, however, no two ways about it that the Government is not doing enough in this direction. Even in this report, old as it is, it is disturbing to note the limited research that is being done concerning these vast mineral resources that do exist in the country. We must not only seek to export our ores but must also look to developing them and thereby building up the prosperity of our country. I think the Department of Mines is one of the most important we have in this country. The mining industry achievements have kept the future of this country going over the years and it must be kept up to date. Yet, one has a feeling when one reads this report that this industry is becoming a backwater. One feels that the department itself is leaving it to private enterprise to produce the reports and to obtain information instead of giving private enterprise and the country a lead. One can get very much better information outside than is produced in this particular Report. This is wrong. I think it should be the reverse&#x2014; the Government should take the lead. While private enterprise is prepared to assist I think the Government should take the lead so that one will not have to read outside reports by other sectors of the industry to find out exactly what is happening.</p>

<p>I would also like to deal with oil research. A lot of money has been spent on this research and I think that most South Africans are disappointed that we have not found oil in our country. I agree with the hon. member for Von Brandis that we might have to give this matter second thoughts. We must have another very good look at our coasts, to see what we can find in our seas. There are no two ways about it that oil companies agree that our future oil supplies will not come from the land, but from the sea. They never expected to find oil off the coast of Great Britain, but today they are finding vast new beds of oil. Whether it is going to pay to exploit these resources, is another thing, but it will keep Britain going. I am fairly certain that if more research is done in this direction, we may get somewhere. It is expensive, but I am fairly certain that everything has not been done as far as this search for oil in the sea is concerned.</p>

<p>The other item I want to deal with is the staff position. Other members have also dealt with this problem. I would like to suggest, notwithstanding what is reported here about the regrading of staff and the extra salaries, that the Minister should give further consideration to making salaries more attractive so that he can recruit the necessary staff in this very important department.</p>

<speech by="#greyling">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, firstly I just want to clear up a misunderstanding. I am compelled to do so. The hon. member for Stilfontein probably misunderstood me when he said that I also went to Carletonville on 1st March in connection with a municipal election. I just want to say that I had absolutely nothing to do with the municipal election in Carletonville. I was in the Transvaal on other business.</p>

<p>I think it is necessary for us to have a general rsum of the whole problem of sink-holes in the Carletonville and far West Rand area.</p>

<p>I think I shall begin by saying that there are five large water compartments. They are the Venterspos compartment, the Bank compartment, the Oberholzer compartment, the Boskop-Turffontein compartment and the Suurbekom-Gemsbokfontein compartment. In the Venterspos compartment are situated the Venterspos mine, the Libanon mine and the Kloof mine. In the Bank compartment are situated the East Driefontein mine, which is a new mine that is being developed, a portion of the West Driefontein mine, which was recently flooded, and another large-scale activity, which has now been threatened by the cave-in, i.e. the large brickworks called Brick or. In the Oberholzer compartment are situated the West Driefontein mine, the<span class="col_7177-7178" refersTo="page_0543"/> Blyvoortuitsig mine and Western Deep Level. The Venterspos compartment is about 44 square km in extent. The Bank compartment is about 117 square km and the Oberholzer compartment about 145 square km. Through the Venterspos compartment run 34 km of roads and 6,1 km of railway lines; through the Bank compartment run 84 km of roads and 27,7 km of railway lines. Through the Oberholzer compartment run 48 km of roads and 11 km of railway lines. For all practical purposes these compartments have already been dewatered, or are in the process of being dewatered. The new mine which the Johannesburg Investment Corporation, or &#x201C;J.C.I.&#x201D; as they call it, is establishing, lies in the Suurbekom-Gemsbokfontein compartment. The Elsburg and Western Area mines lie there. The Suurbekom-Gemsbokfontein compartment will not be dewatered. Through certain gravitation measurements they can so regulate their mining activities that it will not be necessary, in the foreseeable future, to mine there and be subject to the danger of a flooding.</p>

<p>In the Bank compartment there are still about 100 inhabitants left&#x2014;most of the houses have been evacuated. In the Venterspos compartment there are still about 9 000 inhabitants, and in the Oberholzer compartment there are about 72 000. The amount of work done in this area&#x2014;it is a fairly large area&#x2014;is tremendous, particularly if we take into account that in the Oberholzer compartment 119 000 gravitational observations have been made. In the small town of Oberholzer alone, with the intention of determining whether it is suitable and safe for building purposes, 2 000 gravitational observations were made. Twenty-two boreholes were sunk to determine whether it is safe. In the Suurbekom-Gemsbokfontein compartment more than 17 000 gravitational observations have been made to date&#x2014;I am now speaking of March 1972. In this area 1 029 boreholes were sunk by the technical committee. Two hundred and twenty-nine boreholes were sunk at a cost of R119 800. Thousands of not very deep boreholes have been sunk by the mining authorities. With the intention of inserting detectors to supply knowledge of any dangerous displacement of the ground. In addition there are 4 750 levelling points to determine to what extent the land is stabilizing. Water level readings are constantly being taken. Readings are taken at 165 boreholes. As far as building undertakings are concerned the area is divided into two categories. The first category is the &#x201C;acceptable risk&#x201D; category, where an owner can improve. The second category is the &#x201C;non-acceptable risk&#x201D; category where an owner cannot improve. Under those two categories, if they are again divided up, there are 349 cases in the whole area, out of a total of 1 652, which were acceptable risks. The remaining number, i.e. 1 302, constituted the non-acceptable risks. According to the policy those non-acceptable risks, where an owner cannot improve as a result of the nature of the caveins, must be reimbursed.</p>

<p>I now come to the payments. To date, since the Water Association was established, farm properties of 20 503,8364 ha have been purchased, for the sum total of R10 718 373. Eighty-nine improved urban properties were purchased and 1 504 unimproved urban properties. Since the caveins began there have been 250 sink-holes. Here 29 Bantu were lost, suddenly disappearing under the water together with the big crusher. There was also the family of four, the Oosthuizen family at Blyvooruitzicht and Mr. Nortier there at the tennis courts at Venterspos, who lost their lives. That is the loss of life. I now say that we cannot but commend, and if we want to be realistic, greatly commend, the handling of this whole problem. The development of these sink-holes was a new geological phenomenon as far as densely populated areas are concerned. Sink-holes are unique to dolomite areas. There are hundreds of sink-holes in the whole dolomite belt that stretches from Pretoria down into the Kuruman area. But then we come to those cases where mining activities were taking place and there was a concentration of the population, with the concomitant feelings when such a sink-hole occurred. Since that began, and since the Association was called into being, we cannot but give praise. Firstly for the Government&#x2019;s initiative; secondly for the technical committee established under the guidance of the Government to take care of the geological and scientific research and findings, and thirdly for the mining authorities.</p>

<p>I think I have now more or less given a sketch of the present situation. We are now saddled there with 20 503,8364 ha of land, which cost R10 718 373. They are all small nieces of land, which were fragmented. Most of those pieces were uneconomic as far as agriculture is concerned. In this connection I should like to suggest an idea today. In that whole area, which includes<span class="col_7179-7180" refersTo="page_0544"/> the towns of Carletonville, Fochville, Randfontein, Westonaria, Potchefstroom, Ventersdorp, Koster, etc., there is not a public holiday resort of any great compass where one can establish a game reserve, for example. There is water, there is land where cultivated vegetation can be planted, and there is space. I want to suggest today that we should consider establishing a large public holiday resort there. Perhaps the Chamber of Mines can be persuaded to do that, since the Government contributed 60 per cent of the amount which it lost in revenue&#x2014;that is after an amount was also deducted by the Association as working capital. The total amount is about R14 million, and the Government contributed about R7 million. I therefore make this suggestion. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>And then this Government wants to suggest that they are the patrons of the mineworkers and that they care for their interests.</p>

<p>I want to talk about pollution in the mining industry and point out that between Nigel and Randfontein on the Witwatersrand, there are approximately 368 mine dumps, of which 95 are sand dumps and 237 slimes dams. The biggest sand dumps cover approximately 76 ha, and the largest slimes dams approximately 200 ha. In the 1970 report it is mentioned that &#x201C;in order to meet the requirements of the Atmospheric Pollution Prevention Act, 1965, and the Water Act, 1956, the surfaces of the sand dumps and slime dams are shaped and then planted with grass or other suitable types of vegetation. By this means erosion by wind and rain is arrested. Considerable areas have been vegetated and steady progress with the project is being maintained&#x201D;. I want to ask the hon. the Minister of Mines on how many of these mine dumps vegetation has already been planted; how much is spent on them annually and by what organization the work is done. According to a Press report I saw, approximately R500 000 per year is spent on it. In my opinion the Department of Mines is performing a very good task, but it is not sufficient yet. We know that in order to get the vegetation established, they had to carry out many tests and experiments. In addition, we know that they had to fertilize the barren steep slopes, and that they even had to lay on sprinkler irrigation in order to get the grass established. But the rain still drains the salts, acids and other chemical substances from these mine dumps; they pollute our rivers and there is a layer of silt along all our steams and as far as the Vaal River. Mr. Laburn, the Chief Engineer of the Rand Water Board, said on an occasion that the 70 kilometre long Vaal River barrage was so badly polluted that in some years the water was not suitable for domestic consumption for more than 100 days. The cause of it is acids and undissolved salts which wash down in the tributaries on the Witwaters-rand, drain and accumulate in the Vaal River and increase the acid content above the levels which are suitable even for domestic consumption. The water can hardly be used, except if it is purified at a very high cost. The Rand Water Board has built 50 barrages across the different tributaries of the Vaal. Four officials are employed in a full-time capacity to measure the flow, to take water samples and test them for quality. If they find pollution, they try to trace it upstream. They have found that the pollution originates mainly from the industries and mines. It has been found that mine water pollution is on the decrease, except on the East Rand. There are still numerous mine dumps on the East Rand which are uncovered and which are washed away seriously every year, smother the streams with mine silt and pollute the water with acid. As a solution, Mr. Laburn proposed that all the run-off water from the mines which contains salts and acids, may be drained by channels to a series of separate dams before it reaches the Vaal. This mineralized water may also be pumped from the streams to natural pans on the East Rand, or even to dams which have been constructed without outlets, where the water may then evaporate gradually. The water may still be used for the non-sensitive industries and the dams may be used as pleasure resorts and for boating if the pollution is not too serious. This is already being planned on the coal mines. On page 36 of the report of the Secretary for Mines, he reports as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_7181-7182" refersTo="page_0545"/>In the Witbank field the major problem arises from the escape of acid-polluted water from old mines to the west of the town. Although the use of these workings for sewage disposal was halted over a year ago the quantity of water running out has not diminished. It has been decided that the only practical means of dealing with the problem, and preventing the polluted water from reaching the main drainage system of the region, is to construct a large number of shallow pans to which the water can be led and where it can be evaporated. Work on the survey and planning of this project is in progress. Close liaison with the Department of Water Affairs is being maintained.</block>

<p>Sir, we should like to see a similar scheme being applied on the East Rand, so that we may not be held responsible for the pollution of the Vaal River barrage. Furthermore, the Secretary for Mines says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In consultation with the Department of Water Affairs and the Department of Mines, the Chamber of Mines and the Natal Coal Owners&#x2019; Society issued codes of practice in regard to the prevention and abatement of water pollution at coal mines. In Natal, where the pollution situation had reached alarming proportions, the problem was tackled with great vigour during 1970 and a signal degree of success is within sight. Overall expenditure amounted to some R800 000 and it is estimated that a further outlay of R300 000 will be required to implement immediate requirements fully.</block>

<p>We should like to know from the hon. the Minister exactly how the money is being spent and what precisely is being done.</p>

<p>The other form of pollution in the mining industry is of mine air by gases and airborne dust. As we have often heard here in the past already it may cause tuberculosis, pneumoconiosis and asbestosis. It has been rigidly controlled for many years already and research is being carried out all the time. For the financial year 1970-&#x2019;71, R468 600 was voted for research in respect of pneumoconiosis and asbestosis. I should like to know what is being done in order to control the surface asbestos airborne dust which blows down from the different mine dumps. At the asbestos mines around Kuruman in the Northern Cape, there are numerous dry, denuded mine dumps which pollute the air. After many years, asbestos dust can cause a certain type of lung cancer known as mesothelioma. Various cases are known where adults have contracted lung cancer after they have moved away from the asbestos area, where they had perhaps played on these mine dumps as children.</p>

<p>Lastly, Sir, I should like to make a plea for the small tiger&#x2019;s eye mines which one finds situated on small farms in the asbestos mountains in the Northern Cape which are often exploited by private individuals. The export to overseas countries is restricted. In the past the small stone polishing works at places such as Niekerkshoop, Kuruman, Postmasburg and even Prieska served as a good market.

<p>I am sorry that the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, started on the tone in which he did. Unfortunately I shall have to refer him to the fact that those mine dumps of which he spoke and which pollute the surrounding areas to such an extent, were in fact placed there by the United Party in their time. They were placed there even in the time of the old United Party. They have a long history, but the tragedy of it is that the United Party did nothing during its rgime till 1948 to combat this pollution.</p>

<speech by="#brandt">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. BRANDT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member must not try to blame the National Party, because if there is one party which has in fact always borne the future in mind as far as this matter is concerned, namely of combating pollution, it has been this very party since 1948. Nowhere in any Budget in the time of the United Party, or even of the old South African Party Government, can you point out an item in a Budget which concerned the combating of this pollution of water and air as a result of mine dumps, etc. But as far as I can see, at the moment it is to a large extent a matter for the Chamber of Mines, which in fact operates under the supervision of the State Mining Engineer, and I believe this matter is in fact being given and will be given the necessary attention. The hon. member also spoke of the pollution of water. It is the position, of course, that over the years it has increased steadily. One gets a type of stone, especially the<span class="col_7183-7184" refersTo="page_0546"/> pyrite, in the rock formation, and if it is exposed to the air and oxidizes, this oxidation later forms sulphuric acid which is washed down the rivers when it rains. Of course, you will realize, Sir, that if a mine dump has been there since the Anglo-Boer War, for example the big mine dump at Randfontein, it is a big task to combat the formation of acid and on such a large mine dump, and as erosion takes place, more and more acid is formed all the time. As a result of oxidation, the acid increases all the time, and if one takes all the mine dumps on the entire Central Rand and on the East Rand, one would realize the extent of this problem. But this is not a matter which we should discuss under this Vote, and in fact the hon. member wasted our time by raising it here, because it comes under the Water Affairs Vote.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in regard to the pollution of the streams on the Witwatersrand, I merely want to say here again that when the United Party was in power nothing was done to combat this pollution of our water streams around the Witwatersrand and Pretoria.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Does that pollution not fall under Water Affairs as well?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#brandt">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. BRANDT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it should be under Water Affairs. Surely I have said so. The other point which the hon. member raised, was the question of tiger&#x2019;s-eye mines and protection in that regard. This is also a matter which has already been dealt with by the National Party Government, and as far as I can remember, since the commencement of his term of office, the hon. the Minister has appointed a commission of inquiry and the matter has been given considerable attention; so that what the hon. member said here is, in my opinion, in fact no constructive contribution to the debate.</p>

<p>But I want to adopt a more pleasant tone and deal with an aspect mentioned here in regard to the geological staff. While the United Party was in power, I was an official of the Department of Mines for 10 years, specifically a member of the Division Geological Survey, and I want to say that members opposite do not appreciate the problems. I want to refer to the hon. member for Jeppes, who tried to confuse the professional staff of the Department of Mines with the White trade union workers. He executed a neat political manoeuvre here in order to dodge the point the hon. the Minister had made here in regard to the relations between the Government and the White labourers on our mines and particularly with reference to the members of the mine trade union and the protection which the National Party gives them and which the Minister had emphasized. It is for the sake of our mining industry that that protection is given. Hon. members may realize for themselves what the position would have been if that protection for which our people shot each other dead in 1922, did not exist. We asked for that protection and in 1924 and subsequently the National Party gave it to our White workers in our mining industry. It brought stability in our mining industry. No person in the world can want to deny that we brought about that labour peace in the mining industry. We have had labour peace especially since the National Party came into power. It was brought about by the fact that we afforded our White employees in this industry protection. This is the aspect which the Minister proved very clearly here.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for Jeppes came along and referred to the report of the Department of Mines and said there was a shortage of the different professional people and asked why the Minister did not do something about it. The shortage of professional staff in the Department of Mines is a chronic phenomenon. It was the position when the United Party was in power and it will remain so in the distant future as well. The people in the Government departments who have had technical and professional training, are able to earn better salaries outside the Public Service. That is why a certain degree of perpetual staff shortages arises. In my time, when I personally resigned from the Public Service in 1946, I earned double the salary outside the Public Service than I received as a geologist in the Public Service. From this hon. members will gather why there is in fact always a shortage in the Public Service.</p>

<p>I want to point out the other facet in regard to prospecting now. The hon. members opposite do not realize the problems attendant upon prospecting. For example, we may consider the drawn-out process of prospecting on the Witwatersrand formation, which is a gold-bearing formation. In this regard I want to refer specifically to the prospecting on the West Rand. The first borehole was sunk shortly after the<span class="col_7185-7186" refersTo="page_0547"/> Anglo-Boer War where the present Venterspos Mine is situated. This mine was established there only in 1936, when production work started. There was a period of 36 years in which prospecting was done. Of course, it did not take place continually because in the meantime capital was also invested and prospecting was done on the East Rand which resulted in a period of non-activity on the West Rand. Of course, these problems are applicable to our search for oil as well. It will most certainly take a long time still. For example, I think of prospecting which was done in respect of base metals at a specific place where, for example, 30 boreholes were first sunk before success was achieved with another borehole which then led to further prospecting. Hon. members will understand that if the boring is not done on a large scale, prospecting may take a very long time. The position is such that when, for example, boring takes place for oil, only one or two boring machines are used, and not 50 or 60 large boring machines. Only when a positive result has been achieved, of course, can the extent of the boring be expanded, because then there will be justification for further prospecting. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I listened with a certain amount of amazement to the hon. member for Etosha who apparently holds the United Party responsible for the mine dumps on the Witwatersrand. I found it rather difficult to understand his logic in that regard, but perhaps he could tell us where those mine dumps and mines should in fact have been placed. Is it part of his party&#x2019;s policy that they should be moved to one of the new embryo Bantustans?</p>

<p>It is altogether wrong to say that nothing was done, because in those days the Department of Mines was constantly in contact with the Chamber of Mines in regard to this matter. If the hon. member went back into the history, he would find that over the past few years the Chamber of Mines has appointed a special unit which should investigate, <i>inter alia,</i> the planting of vegetation on the mine dumps. However, as my hon. friend rightly pointed out, the problem is much greater than this, and at present this Government is not doing enough. As he himself indicated, the problem is worsening as the mines become older. The Government has been in power now for well over 20 years; in other words, the problem is worse to the extent of 20 years than it used to be.</p>

<p>Another interesting aspect which I noticed today, is that the great friendship, brotherhood and comradeship which as always existed in the past between the Government and the mineworkers, is dying off somewhat. This is the conclusion I had to come to after listening to the speech made by the hon. member for Stilfontein. He criticized certain members of the Mineworkers Union, and one wonders what in fact went wrong there. It really seems to me as if the mine-worker is starting to realize that there is only talk and no action with that Government and that the actual friend of the mineworker and of the ordinary worker in South Africa is not to be found in that party, but in this party. Even more interesting is the fact that my hon. friend for Carl-tonville and the hon. member for Stilfontein cannot agree on where they were on a certain important date and that there was even a little dissension between them in regard to a very important meeting which they should have attended.</p>

<p>I believe in the trade union movement in South Africa, and I believe in the work they do for all workers, including those on the mines. I believe the mineworkers will know best and that through negotations with them by a sympathetic Government, a good solution will be found. That is our policy. What is your policy in that regard? This is my reply to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s question.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Carltonville pointed out the problem of the sink-holes, and it would appear that he, as a great optimist, apparently thinks the Government should be given high praise in this regard. I am not so sure. I should like to hear from the Minister the most recent figure in regard to the number of sink-holes there were last year. If I remember correctly, the figure the year before last was 60. I hope the figure was less last year and that he is able to divulge reassuring figures in that regard. These sink-holes remain a major problem with which we have to contend. If I understood the hon. member for Carltonville correctly, he wants both a holiday resort and a game reserve to be established in that area where the subsidences have taken place. Does he think it is a practical example? Is that what he proposed?</p>

In my opinion, the problem of the sink-holes has not yet been solved at all. Recently again we had the case of a collapse on a sports field near a school.</p>

<p>Yes, I made a note of it that that area had already been fenced off. I have it here in my notes. I want to say that it was fenced off. That particular piece of land is not dangerous. But I want a full assurance from the hon. the Minister this afternoon that after a while a penetrating investigation will again be instituted in the immediate vicinity in order to make 100 per cent sure that that area at a school and in the residential areas are 100 per cent safe and not 99 per cent or 95 per cent safe. In the past the hon. the Minister gave us a comparable assurance in regard to the Western Areas primary school. Does that assurance still hold? The occurence of these sink-holes unfortunately continues. As long as they occur, we shall want an account from the hon. the Minister, who is the responsible person, every year in regard to the combating of those unfortunate happenings.</p>

<p>The second item I wish to discuss in this Committee today is the question of atomic pollution with the growing use of atomic energy in South Africa today. I believe that the use of nuclear energy is a great and magnificent boon to mankind. It will be the fuel energy of the next century. I believe that we must make full use of it, but together with the use of this nuclear energy, there is this ever-present danger of atomic pollution by radio-active material in the sky, in the water, in the ground and in the animals and in the milk we get from the animals that feed on plants which can be contaminated with radio-active material. We are only on the threshold of the development of nuclear energy in this country. I am glad to see from the 1970 report by the Atomic Energy Commission&#x2014;I wish we could have had the 1971 report&#x2014;that they are taking steps&#x2014;these seem to me to be significant steps&#x2014;to establish the amount of radio-activity in the air, in the water and so forth in the vicinity of Pelindaba and also in our atmosphere as a result of the atomic explosions and the thermo-nuclear explosions we have had during the past years. If we are to make full use of nuclear energy in South Africa one day, we shall have to make the combating of radio-activity in our soil and our food one of our major tasks in the fight against pollution that we have in this country.</p>

<p>We shall need nuclear energy, for instance. for the desalination of sea-water. Perhaps the hon. the Minister can tell us<span class="col_7189-7190" refersTo="page_0549"/> how far the investigation that he started in 1966 has now progressed. We know there has been some progress. He told us about a committee that was appointed in those years. We should like to know what has been done in that respect.</p>

<p>Radio-active pollution can have an incalculable effect on the human being. It can cause cancer; it can affect the genes and the chromosomes of the human being. It can result in unfortunate mutations. It causes dangers. We saw that in the horrors of the atomic bomb. We remember the story of the Japanese trawler and what happened to the unfortunate crew of that particular vessel. Some radio-active material has a life of many hundreds of years. It is essential that when this atomic waste is being disposed of, we should think of this matter. There are strontium and cadmium isotopes being spread in South Africa today which have a lifetime of 600 years. These wastes have to be stored. Are they being stored satisfactorily today? We hear that they are being stored in the ground, under the earth, but we also hear that they are being stored in the earthquake belt in the United States of America. There leakages occurred after twenty years, while these wastes are only safe after 600 years. Therefore I say that it is now the time for a considered programme in this regard. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>It is praiseworthy that the hon. the Minister could announce this afternoon that he is already engaged in&#x2014;that is how I want to put it&#x2014; far-reaching legislation dealing with our mineworkers, whom all of us in this House are concerned about. It is far-reaching in the sense that we are getting away from the idea of the old Pneumoconiosis Act we had in the past, and that this now deals with industrial diseases. In other words, a wider spectrum of the health position of the mineworker is now being affected. It is also praiseworthy that the Minister is continually negotiating with all interested parties in this process, in particular with the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union. I think this Government has a very good record as far as its negotiations and consultations with the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union are concerned, including those in this respect. This Government has always been approachable as far as the mineworkers are concerned, because they are our people, and has always been prepared to negotiate with them about matters of interest. The hon. the Minister made a statement here and the hon. member for Jeppes replied to it. I am glad the hon. member is present in the House again. He said it is also the United Party&#x2019;s policy to negotiate, from time to time, in connection with certain matters such as labour relations and the amendment of mine regulations.

<p>I shall prove this statement. If I were a mineworker and a United Party wants to come along and negotiate with me on the basis that the colour bar should be removed in our relationships in South Africa, I would not speak to him. The United Party is in no position at all to negotiate with the mineworkers. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Yeoville said on several occasions that the Bantu should be placed in a position where he can sell his labour on the free market, so too in the mining industry. If there is one thing the mineworkers are really jealous of it is the colour bar which this Government has guaranteed them since 1924. The United Party cannot speak to them, because they will always reject that party.</p>

<p>I now come to a second aspect I want to bring to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention. The hon. member for Salt River also referred to it. It relates to the question of goldmining&#x2014;and all mining in South Africa&#x2014;being a vanishing asset. The hon. member said that the Minister and the Government should make a statement at some time or other about what the position is in respect of mines that cease operations, the danger existing that ghost towns could develop. That was more or less the gist of the hon. member&#x2019;s argument. I just want to point out that last year the hon. member for Odendaalsrus also spoke about this matter. I want to tell the hon. member for Salt River that we, who know the East Rand, know that there are several mines that have already ceased production and that East Rand towns like Springs, Brakpan&#x2014;and I want to<span class="col_7191-7192" refersTo="page_0550"/> emphasize Brakpan&#x2014;and others, are still progressing and expanding, despite the fact that many of the gold mines there are no longer in production. Where one does encounter a problem in this connection, it is true, is in the more rural areas where there is not the same high degree of industrial development as in the Witwatersrand area. Here I want to refer to one of the richest, newest goldfields in the Eastern Transvaal, i.e. the Evander area. Sixteen years ago a new town sprang up there. It is a limited mining field where there are only three mines, i.e. Kinross, Winkelhaak, Bracken and Leslie. This very fine town is solely dependent on the goldmining industry in that area. We are particularly grateful that there has been an improvement in the price of gold. This perhaps gives us an opportunity to be able to plan further if this problem develops in future. One of the most disrupting and demoralizing stories in these towns involves people asking what happens to these towns when the goldmines cease production. This creates frustration as far as private initiative is concerned and the danger that proper development cannot take place. This &#x2019;specific town was established at the time under the supervision of the then Natural Resources Development Council, and it was borne in mind that other industries must systematically also develop so that the town will grow systematically and in future be less dependent on goldmine development. I think it is essential for us to reassure the people in some way or other, particularly in such towns in the far-off rural areas, where one does not have this intensive industrial development ore has on the Witwatersrand.</p>

<p>Another matter I should also like to discuss with the Minister is the development of our coal reserves. I want to say at once that we are looking forward to the report of the Commission of Enquiry into the Coal Resourses in South Africa. The terms of reference of this commission are chiefly to report on the conserving of coal, bearing in mind the existing sources of energy in South Africa, and on the best way in which mining can take place with a view to optimum utilization. I say that we look forward to this report. It can probably also be discussed profitably in this debate, because there are quite a number of aspects in connection with mining which are certainly receiving urgent attention. I see many of these mines. There are 14 of them in my constituency. I therefore know what is going on. We have problems in connection with mining, and here I am referring particularly to the burning of these slag heaps. There are a large number of slag heaps that burn when the waste coal is dumped in the open air. This causes pollution due to certain gases released upon combustion. I am thinking, for example, of carbon dioxide. Many of the local communities are complaining about this problem. It causes air pollution. We would be glad if the Minister could explain to us what can be done in this connection.</p>

<p>I can also mention that we have the problem of surface subsidence in my area, where there are no proper supports and stope works underground and where the surface has consequently caved in completely. Certain areas must be set aside because they are regarded as dangerous areas. The other problem that develops as a result of mining in this area, is the question of water pollution. It is gratifying to see that the Natal Coal Owners&#x2019; Association has laid down certain codes of practice in connection with the pollution of water by coal mining in the Tugela catchment area. I now want to tell you that this mining area in the Eastern Transvaal lies chiefly in the catchment area of the Loskop Dam. It is very essential for us to have a similar system in the Transvaal and that discussions take place with the Natal coal owners to see whether they cannot lay down similar codes for this area as well to prevent unnecessary pollution from taking place there. We look forward with great expectation to the report of this commission, because some or other statutory provision will probably be made for the mining and the conservation of coal, also bearing in mind other factors such as water, surface damage, etc. I am thinking, for example, of the problem of the establishment and development of townships. We know that coal mining is chiefly shallow mining and that there are tremendous problems as far as building restriction matters are concerned. Witbank is a specific example of that. Someone said one should fly over Witbank to see how the town is laid out along the reefs. These are matters we shall have to give very serious attention to in the mining of coal. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am standing up to reply to the hon.<span class="col_7193-7194" refersTo="page_0551"/> member for Orange Grove in connection with the doubts he expressed about my proposal concerning the area of 20 503,8364 ha that was bought up. I did say that I proposed the possible establishment of a game reserve and a public holiday resort. The hon. member has certain doubts about that. I now want to tell the hon. member that he must stop talking about things he has no knowledge of. I want to mention three facts to him in connection with that area. Firstly, a large portion of that area was not bought up as a result of sinkholes, but as a result of dewatering and because of the fact that farmers previously obtained water from the Wonderfontein and Bankoog mines at a rate of 21 million gallons per day. That is why the association decided to buy up the land. It was not as a result of sinkholes, but as a result of dewatering. The second fact is that that land is still being inhabited today. The mines themselves carry out farming activities; the mines lease them to other people. It is not as terribly dangerous a business as the hon. gentleman wants to imply. Thirdly, the process of geological consolidation in that area has already made considerable progress. I think that no person with any sound intelligence would rush in like a bull at a gate and simply establish a holiday resort without linking this up with careful geological surveys and determinations. The hon. member must be careful, and if he gets up to speak here in the House he must make sure of his facts. I find it so strange that some of our people can sometimes talk such nonsense, and he is one of them.</p>

<p>In the second place&#x2014;I have a very limited amount of time&#x2014;I want to say that I think it is in the general interest for us to know that about a year ago some of the National members of the House of Assembly made suggestions to the Minister about whether a mediating committee could not again be appointed on the initiative of the Government, as was the case when salary were being negotiated, so that they can assist as mediators between the Chamber of Mines and the mineworkers&#x2019; trade unions. The Minister was in touch with them and obtained the following reply from Mr. Ken Du Preez&#x2014;I think he is the chairman of the Co-ordinating Council of Mineworkers&#x2019; Trade Unions (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Negotiations in connection with pensions never stand in isolation. They always form a part of wider negotiations with the Chamber of Mines about wages and other conditions of service. The Government has continually maintained the policy that wages and other conditions of service are matters for negotiation between the employer and the employee and that unless serious differences crop up, the State does not concern itself with such negotiations. Owing to this policy, and because pensions from an integral part of negotiations for wages and conditions of service, he believes it would be wrong if the Government became involved in the negotiations for pensions. He is convinced of the fact that this would only distort relations between employer and employee. Since it is merely a question of funds, and the State does not want to and cannot contribute to the mineworkers&#x2019; pension funds, he is convinced that a State mediator could serve no purpose whatsoever, and the trade unions are therefore not inclined to support such a proposal.</block>

<p>I am saying this so that all the mineworkers can know exactly what the position is.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>With reference to what the hon. member for Carletonville has just said, I want to say it is true that representations were made to me, specifically by <i>inter alia</i> Nationalist members of the House of Assembly and the mining group of our caucus, representations to the effect that in regard to pensions, in contrast to pneumoconiosis pensions, mediatory action could possibly be taken and assistance be granted to the mining trade unions in their talks with the Chamber of Mines. I was not reluctant to consider something of that nature, provided that such a request was to be made by the mining trade unions themselves. The reply which was read out by the hon. member for Carletonville, is the reply I had received an made available to every member of the House of Assembly for his own use. In fact, in the course of the talks we have had up to now on the new legislation concerning industrial diseases, the question of life pensions has never cropped up. I think it is proper for the two matters to be separated from each other completely, namely compensation for an industrial disease and a life pension received by a person upon<span class="col_7195-7196" refersTo="page_0552"/> his retirement from his ordinary work. What is more, in the latest talks and negotiations between the mining trade unions and the Chamber in regard to an improvement in earnings and other benefits, and also in their talks in regard to Republic Day&#x2014;which, to my joy, will now be a full public holiday for our mineworkers&#x2014;they also regarded and used this matter of pensions as an integral part. I think this is a most healthy situation, and I appreciate it that the mining trade unions are jealous of the fact that this is a matter which they themselves are handling with their employers.</p>

<p>Sir, I have risen to reply to this debate, which has actually been an amazing debate, in which general matters of interest were raised by us, and quite rightly so. But the decisive, cardinal matter to the mineworker in South Africa is the protection, in the first place, of the colour bar and, in the second place&#x2014;I am almost tempted to say the sacredness&#x2014;of his trade union. Now, hon. members opposite said they would consult with them on those matters, and they would speak to them. But on what basis will they do so? They are going to speak on the basis of affiliation of the Bantu, who have now been organized in the mining industry. They are going to speak to them on this basis, namely that they are speaking with one voice. In that regard the hon. member for Bethal is quite correct&#x2014;not one single trade union and not one single mineworker will say one single word to those hon. members on that basis.</p>

<p>Tell us the details.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall tell you in detail when I reply to you.</p>

<p>*Mr. Chairman, I shall come to the hon. member for Jeppes as far as this matter is concerned. As though he is so concerned about the Bantu homelands! By all appearances he seems to me to be a Japie man.</p>

<p>I want to start with the hon. member for Springs, who put a number of important questions to me. He apologized for having to leave. I quite understand this, but I am giving him these replies because he is a member who takes a special interest in mining, at all times, and because he had the courtesy to inform me that he would not be able to be here. He referred to the closing of the office of the mining inspectorate at Springs, and expressed his thanks for the work that had been done there. I may just add that I am grateful for that appreciation that was expressed to my officials. On 1st April this office, this mining inspectorate, was moved to Rustenburg, where major developments are taking place. Major developments are taking place in that whole area, up to Thabazimbi and beyond. Hon. members will appreciate that the office there is a properly established one if I point out that at the moment, notwithstanding the recession in the platinum market, there are still 82 000 workers who are being served by that office.</p>

<p>While mentioning the platinum market, I may just refer to the latest announcements in this regard in the U.S.A. Before the end of 1974 all motor cars which are on the roads in the U.S.A. must be properly provided with a certain apparatus for purifying exhaust gases. It is highly probable that this will imply a revival for the platinum market, since this apparatus, which is considered to be the most effective<span class="col_7197-7198" refersTo="page_0553"/> one today&#x2014;other inventions may still be made&#x2014;must contain a small quantity of platinum. I say it is a small quantity, but if one thinks of the large number of motor vehicles on the roads of the U.S.A., there will be a large market for platinum products from South Africa in that country. I may also add that I think we in South Africa will have to give serious consideration to whether we should not follow America&#x2019;s example in regard to our motor vehicles.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member spoke about an important matter, and that is the problem experienced by mineworkers&#x2014;especially on the East Rand, where more and more mines are closing down, and especially mineworkers who have reached an advanced age &#x2014;in finding other employment. Let me say in this regard that the mining companies are doing a tremendously great deal to have them placed at other mines. But, at the same time, the same mining companies have a major interest in industries in this same area. They are also placing these people in these industries, and in this regard the Department of Labour is also lending a hand. An interesting thing has now happened at Rustenburg, where, as a result of the temporary recession in the platinum industry, approximately 1 600 or 1 700 White mineworkers could not be retained as employees. A very small number of them went to other mines, especially gold mines. The rest of them found their way into industries, where, as hon. members know, there are many opportunities for employment. I want to give hon. members the assurance that the department will, as it did in the past, continue to do its duty by giving these people every possible assistance and advice so that they need not unnecessarily leave the area in which they have established themselves and which they would not like to leave.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member made the request that the precautionary measures applicable to these mines which are to be closed down in the years that lie ahead, should not be relaxed. I want to give the hon. member for Springs the assurance that this will not happen, but that, on the contrary, it is quite likely that the precautionary measures in such a mine will be tightened up. There are various reasons why the precautionary measures in such a mine must in fact be tightened up. I am thinking, for instance, of the pumping of water, etc.</p>

<p>The hon. member also made the request that mineworkers who retired on pension and who were obliged to go on making contributions to the miners&#x2019; sick funds, had to be exempted from doing so. I want to tell the hon. member that they are not obliged to make contributions. They have a free choice in this regard. However, as the Minister of Mines I want to give those people retiring on pension the advice to keep up their membership of the sick fund, if they can afford to do so, because this gives them access to the private doctor to whom they have grown accustomed over all these years as members of the miners&#x2019; sick fund; it gives them access to specialist services, and it gives them access to all the other benefits connected with the sick fund. I do not think that there is a sick fund which holds greater benefits for its members than in fact the miners&#x2019; sick fund does. Therefore I want to give them the advice to retain their membership even if they should find it difficult to do so. As regards those people who have not retained their membership, who are not members of the sick fund, we have made arrangements for their needs in respect of medical examinations and medicines to be catered for by the district surgeon, just as is done in the case of any other pensioner, and, of course, they are also free to report to the outpatients&#x2019; departments of the provincial hospitals. Through the Department of Health, in conjunction with the Department of Justice, I shall once again bring to the notice of magistrates the fact that in future it will not be necessary for those people to obtain the permission of the magistrate first, that they may receive the necessary treatment upon producing the pension card which they already have&#x2014;I am referring to persons receiving pneumoconiosis benefits&#x2014;and that they need not obtain a certificate at the magistrate&#x2019;s office.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Jeppes referred to the question of Bantu employed in the mining industry in the Bantu homelands. He wanted to know why we did not consult with the mineworkers&#x2019; unions. That is a problem that he must take up with the trade unions. Let me say to the hon. member that he is behind the times. It is not a matter for me to take up with the trade unions. That is over and done with, as I have said. I had prolonged discussions the year before last and at the beginning of last year for the last time, not only with the executive committee<span class="col_7199-7200" refersTo="page_0554"/> of the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union, but with the full body of, I think, between 50 and 60 members, for a full day, and the whole thing has been thrashed out. We have had three requests for exemptions, one from the Atok Mine in Sekukuniland. At that mine 12 Bantu are at the moment employed in certain jobs Which they did not do before. The regulations have been drafted and are in operation, and it has been done in consultation with the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union and also with the Chamber of Mines, and I may say that we have also asked them now to translate these regulations into the Tswana language, because it is one of the regulations, and also the policy of the company, that these Bantu must be a member of that particular nation. I may say this exemption is for three years. As I see it now, there is no reason why it should not be extended, but we thought three years was a good time, seeing that this is the first time that it is being done. There was also a second request from the Griqualand Exploration Company, but this is still under consideration. I have laid down certain procedures to be followed, and I think in the near future we will also be able to give a final answer in that respect.</p>

<speech by="#miller">

<p>Have you consulted with them?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, of course there has been consultation. But let us get this straight. There was consultation in so far as the practical application is concerned. As far as the policy is concerned, there is no consultation whatsoever, but consultation has been done, and the Government stands or falls by the policy of the Bantu doing more and more responsible work.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Is the training done by the White mineworkers?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Not necessarily by the mineworkers. As far as training is concerned, we insist that a certain training must be given to our satisfaction. Wo gives the training, and how it is done, is not a matter for the Government at all. This I have made clear over and over again also to the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union. It is a matter of agreement between the mine management and the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union, and up to now it has created no problem whatsoever.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member referred to the reduction in the allowance to marginal mines. I might tell the hon. member that there is a lesser amount on the Estimates for this year. That is because of the rise in the price of gold. When the Budget was framed the price of gold was of course not nearly as high as it is today. I should like to say to the hon. member that up to now a round figure of some R70 million has been spent since 1964 to assist these mines. Furthermore, the amount of gold produced by these mines from 1967 to 1971&#x2014;that is the only figure I have&#x2014;is a round R400 million. Furthermore, in 1967 the production of these assisted mines contributed 7,2 per cent of the total gold production in our country; last year it was 15,9 per cent and one would expect, of course, with the rise in the price of gold and with the lower-grade ores being able to be mined now, that perhaps this figure will go up. Then I may just point out in conclusion that as the result of the assistance to these mines, no fewer than 10 000 Whites and 110 000 Bantu have been able to work in these mines, whereas if the assistance was not given, the work would not have been available.</p>

<p>*Then the hon. member said we should &#x201C;come with a complete plan&#x201D; in regard to our mining industry in South Africa. Let me tell the hon. member that we do not do things that way. We do not come forward with blueprints, because mining in South Africa is mainly vested not in the hands of the State, but in the hands of private initiative, and let me say that this is where it should remain.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>What about the shortage of technical people?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to that in a moment. But that is where it should remain. I think that in regard to prospecting and mining they proved in the past that South Africa could rely on the mining bodies to carry on mining operations in South Africa properly, to their advantage and to the advantage of the State.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>The days when you wanted to take over the mines, are past now.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But, surely, Albert has left; he has after all joined you now. [Interjections.] But the State does in fact have a duty in regard to a number of things &#x2014;in the first place, in regard to metallurgy.</p>

<p>I think the hon. member knows that the National Institute for Metallurgy is an<span class="col_7201-7202" refersTo="page_0555"/> institution which is second to none in the world. I do not think the National Institute for Metallurgy can complain that the Government does not give it attention and all possible assistance. They are doing grand work, and on that scale, with their new buildings going up on the Rand, in Randburg, I am sure that their contribution, for which we are in a certain respect responsible, will increase in the years to come.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>I am concerned with the question of personnel.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to that.</p>

<p>*In the second place, in regard to the refining of our minerals, the Government has to lay down a policy, and that policy is clear for all to see. There is not a single mining house which is not aware that the State is in earnest about our minerals having to be refined to an ever greater extent. We are also aware that this is not something which one can do overnight, and that the refining of our minerals should always take place on an economic basis. But in examining the various reports of the various mining houses, Sir, you will see that they are continually proceeding with the process of refining minerals and, I may as well add here, the location, if this is possible, of these refining works in the areas where the mines are closing down, i.e. the refining of minerals which do not necessarily come from a mine in that area. In this way one has, for instance, the refining of minerals from Rustenburg, which is being done in Springs, and which, in turn, has brought more opportunities for employment to that area. As far as the exports of iron ore are concerned, I may also say that it is the intention that some or other processed form of iron ore should be exported, not necessarily the pig iron only, and that all contracts will be concluded on that basis.</p>

<p>The hon. member is also concerned about the personnel. What personnel? There are two aspects to the matter. The one is the State personnel, especially of the Geological Survey Division. I may tell the hon. member that there is an improvement. But, as the hon. member for Etosha rightly said, this is a chronic situation which one has in regard to State personnel and which we have had all these years. In the second place, it is an unfortunate fact in South Africa that a small number of students are interested in geology. The bursaries are available. The hon. members wanted to know why the provision on the Estimates had been reduced. This is so because we have learned from experience that these people simply do not come forward, and surely there is no point in making provision for something if no use is made of it. But let me also tell the hon. member that we in the department are doing everything possible, also recruitment abroad, to obtain people to fill these posts. You should not be confused by the figures you sometimes see, for these figures show the number of permanent posts filled. There are many posts that have been filled on a temporary basis. In other words, the work is being done. The work is being done in an excellent manner, but a greater amount of work can be done if only we have the people. Then I must also say that the training at our State mining schools has been improved to a considerable extent and adapted to the new circumstances; the mining industry itself sent two missions abroad in an attempt to recruit personnel. In that regard we are also experiencing a problem, namely that approximately half the students leave the State mining school before they have qualified. And the reason is obvious, namely the fact that South Africa is such a prosperous country and that it is doing so well A person may leave by one door and enter by another and perhaps get a better job. Then there is another point I want to mention in regard to the manpower we have. Hon. members should not forget that if we did not have the legislation we do have, and if we did not take the steps we are in fact taking, also on the part of the Government, in order to have labour peace in South Africa, the numbers in the mining industry would have been much smaller. We still have sufficient numbers for keeping this industry strong because a policy is being followed in South Africa in terms of which the worker feels that he is being protected while working in the mining industry. The hon. member should not lose sight of this factor.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for Stilfontein mentioned the question of a dispute or misunderstanding that was supposed to exist. I am sorry that it does exist, but I think it is a good thing that he put the matter straight. In this regard I want to say in general that I do not think it is correct or desirable for the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union to claim that it has fathered this legislation. This is simply not true. They co-operated, but at first there was opposition. Initially we asked them to prepare legislation, and<span class="col_7203-7204" refersTo="page_0556"/> they said it had to be done by the department. Not only during last year&#x2019;s parliamentary session and prior to that, but also during the recess, the mining group of our caucus met in Pretoria to be of assistance to me in regard to this legislation. They were not only of assistance&#x2014;I think I may as well say this now&#x2014;but also very difficult because they wanted the very best for the mineworker in South Africa.</p>

<p>So, what are you complaining about? However, I want to make it very clear that this is not my procedure. I do not think it has ever been the procedure. I want to make it very clear that outside organizations should appreciate that a caucus group&#x2014;whether it is a mining group, a tobacco group, or whatever&#x2014;is subject to the rules of the caucus. The function of such a caucus group is not&#x2014;in fact, it has been forbidden to do so&#x2014;to conduct negotiations as a group with any organization outside the caucus. If a group of M.P.s are interested in mining, wants to consult in season and out and day and night with the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union or whoever, it is not only a good thing, but also desirable. But the mining group as such should, just as is the case with all sorts of groups, be seen as an integral part of the caucus which has its function inside the caucus and not outside it.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<p>That is real gagging!</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Real gagging? But, surely, I have just said that these persons may hold any discussions as persons and jointly. What is more, I do not think that that hon. member&#x2019;s groups do things that way. At any rate, I do not want to concern myself with that aspect now.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Von Brandis referred to the report, which in his opinion is outdated. This has been the position since before the rinderpest. The hon. member knows that it is absolutely impossible for the Department of Mines to have a report on the 1971 activities ready in 1972. We have to rely on a very large number or organizations; there are all the mining companies and other organizations from which information has to be obtained. This will therefore remain the procedure in the future as well. If Parliament had sat in the second half of the year, this would have been possible. However, this is not possible at the moment. The report for 1970 which has appeared in 1972, is a new and a very good report, and I cannot change the position.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member asked me about the question of oil. I should like to make a statement on this matter. In the first place, as far as the search for oil on land is concerned, Soekor proceeded during 1971 with its prospecting programme in the cretaceous deposit in the vicinity of Port Elizabeth. Indications of oil were found in a few boreholes, but these are of no economic interest. At the moment a consulting firm from France is in the process of evaluating the prospecting results for us. Subsequent to that Soekor moved its drilling activities to Zululand. The first two boreholes. which were completed in 1971, were negative as far as oil or gas occurrences were concerned. The drilling programme in Zululand was concluded for the time being after two more boreholes had been sunk. In other words, four boreholes were sunk in Zululand. These two boreholes were sunk this year without any success, and Soekor is now moving its drilling activities to the North Karoo Basin. For the information of hon. members I may just say that the North Karoo Basin is that area which partly surrounds Lesotho, i.e. the area from Harrismith up to Zastron. The two off-shore drills, namely the Ocean Traveller and the Trans-World 61, which were still in commission at the end of 1970, disposed of their drilling commitments during the first quarter of 1971. On behalf of Soekor and a certain mining group the Trans-World 61 sank a borehole at Mossel Bay and another at Plettenberg Bay. Both were unsuccessful. The Ocean Traveller<span class="col_7205-7206" refersTo="page_0557"/> sank one borehole near Knysna and another one opposite the mouth of the Tugela River for two respective private consortiums. The hole near Knysna only showed indications of gas, and the other one was dry. I want to add, and this is important, that the evaluation of data on the offshore areas was continued during the year and that it is, hoped to have located enough drilling positions by the middle of 1972 for a continuous drilling programme of one year. In reply to questions I stated previously what amounts had been spent, and therefore I shall not go into that matter again.</p>

<p>As far as the off-shore drilling is concerned, private sublessees of Soekor have up to now sunk a total of ten boreholes in the sea-bed, and Soekor had a share in some of them. As I said before, I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that our total expenditure of R62 million over the past seven years is very modest in comparison with the amounts spent in other countries. I want to mention one example. In Australia, 700 million Australian dollars were spent on the search for oil over the past seven years. In South Africa, depending on the type of drill we have to use in South Africa, our drilling costs on land vary between R50 and R90 per metre. The off-shore drilling costs are calculated at approximately R30 000 per day.</p>

<p>As far as the future is concerned, I want to say the following: Soekor&#x2019;s activities on land have now been moved to the North Karoo Basin, as I have already said, and this will take approximately one year&#x2019;s drilling. The first drill is now being erected in the Harrismith district. The hon. member asked another question in that regard, and I want him to listen attentively now. The main object here is to try to find a sufficient number of reservoir properties in the Karoo formation, where small oil and gas occurrences have been located repeatedly. Depending on an evaluation report, on which we are waiting, additional drilling may be carried out in the Algoa Basin. According to our present knowledge, some of our offshore areas are more promising and renewed interest is being shown by international oil companies in actively exploring the sea-bed. Several off-shore areas have been sub-let by Soekor, and other negotiations for sub-letting are in progress. In recent times a scarcity of off-shore drills suitable for our waters, has been experienced. However, negotiations for the mobilization of an off-shore drilling platform&#x2014;for other reasons I am not keen to mention the name of the platform now&#x2014;have virtually been concluded, and it is trusted that after the modifications have been effected in the Cape Town harbour, it will be ready before the end of 1972 for starting drilling operations on the Agulhas Bank. Mindful of the necessity of carrying on the search for oil in South Africa in a purposeful manner and of granting every assistance to possible prospectors and developers, I announced in a Press statement as far back as 25th February of this year that the Government was prepared to consider proposals made by prospecting companies, proposals which would stimulate further the search for economically exploitable oil and/or gas resources and especially the more expensive search on the sea-bed. The House will remember that we made certain concessions at the beginning. We feel that we should perhaps go further now. The companies have been requested to submit economically founded proposals in this regard to the Department of Mines, which will examine these proposals in consultation with other interested Government departments and organizations and submit recommendations to the Government. As I have said, we have, of course, announced considerable tax concessions to the first discovers of oil and gas on land and on sea, but it is hoped that it will also be possible to find other ways and means for making the search for oil in our country more attractive to these companies.</p>

<p>In the last place, I just want to add that oil is not something which is found quickly. The soonest that oil has ever been found in the history of exploitable economic quantities, was here at Cabinda, after a search of nine years. Australia has at the moment, as hon. members know, fairly strong oilwells. They searched for 50 years.</p>

<p>The second point I want to mention, is that the Soekor Board, with Mr. Dawid De Villiers of Sasol as chairman, is adamant about undertaking the matter in a scientific way, for this is the only way. Every hole that is drilled, is not necessarily drilled for the purpose of searching for oil. It is always hoped&#x2014;and hope springs eternal in the human breast&#x2014;that even in that hole oil will be found. But several holes are drilled so as to ascertain whether the formation corresponds with the findings made through other methods of prospecting. I am saying this very clearly so that the idea should not take root in the public<span class="col_7207-7208" refersTo="page_0558"/> mind that every hole is sunk because the primary consideration is that oil or natural gas is specifically being searched for on that spot. This is not the position, although it may in fact happen.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member put questions to me on the question of uranium. I can give him a very short reply in this regard. I think I am going to read it as it is a very delicate matter. I discussed the matter in detail with the Ucor Board. As hon. members know, the names of the members of the Ucor Board are not known, and this is so for good reasons. I may just say in general that the pilot enrichment plant is doing very well. I just want to furnish hon. members briefly with certain information so that they may be informed.</p>

<p>In pursuance of the general policy of curtailing Government expenditure as far as possible without bringing about serious disruption by those means, serious attempts also had to be made to curtail the expenditure of the Uranium Enrichment Corporation wherever this was at all possible. In other words, they had to make a contribution, too. By way of a replanning of the erection of the pilot plant, the board of directors of Ucor succeeded in effecting a reduction in the funds for the present financial year. This replanning nevertheless makes it possible for the enrichment process to be proved on a part of the plant according to the original time-scale, but the completion of the plant as a whole will be effected on a somewhat later date than was originally planned. In other words, on a part of the plant, the enriched uranium will still be produced on the date we have in mind, but the plant as a whole will now reach the production stage at a somewhat later date.</p>

<p>The research and operating activities are progressing according to plan, and although technological problems have been cropping up sporadically, as was expected, it has been possible to meet all of them successfully. A most important aspect of the uranium enrichment project is that Ucor has to rely chiefly on having the spare parts and the components of the pilot plant manufactured by South African industries. This circumstance has stimulated our industry into gearing itself, to a greater extent than was the case before, for being able to undertake manufacturing complying with our exceptionally high requirements. It is gratifying to see that the industrial sector has very successfully been undertaking the tasks entrusted to it. Several industries are involved in this matter, especially on the Witwatersrand and also in other centres.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member asked me whether I could mention any dates to him in this regard. Unfortunately I cannot. We shall simply have to wait to see when the enrichment plant will start production. But, as I have already indicated, the original date still holds good for a part of that plant, but the plant as a whole will be completed at a somewhat later date.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for Virginia raised the question of diamond smuggling. I am glad he did so, for I think he furnished the House with information which is not only correct, but also very interesting and valuable. It is true that the commission of inquiry&#x2014;and I may tell the hon. member that the indication given by the chairman is that the report will be made available to me during the second half of the year; in other words, it is not a drawn out inquiry&#x2014;will, it is hoped, report on this matter as well.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Salt River wanted to know about the help we are giving to marginal mines. I may say to the hon. member that as far as the &#x201C;lease of life&#x201D; is concerned, I think it would be unwise for me as the Minister of Mines to give details about every single mine. All I can say to the hon. member is that we have very strict regulations and rules as to when we should give assistance to a mine and when not. If we are not certain that that mine&#x2019;s life will at least be extended for another eight years, we do not consider it. Secondly, with the high price of gold, it is quite true that the life of these mines will perhaps be longer. I do not think much longer, because again it is for the mines themselves to evaluate what the potential of their mines is. When a mine closes, the Minister of Mines has to be given notice well in advance. It is then thoroughly investigated by the Chief Mining Engineer, who then advises the department and the Minister. We may even go so far as to ask other instances to take over the administration and the working of a mine if we feel that it can still be run on a profitable basis. I think the hon. member will agree with me that it would be unwise to give the exact dates as to when these mines will close and when not. It is for the mining companies themselves to decide. I can assure the hon. member that they do inform their employees well in advance of what the situation is.</p>

<p><span class="col_7209-7210" refersTo="page_0559"/>*The hon. member for Carletonville raised the question of sinkholes, and spoke with appreciation of the work which was being done there by the technical committee, of the contribution of the State, etc. I note this with appreciation, because I think the knowledge we have of sinkholes is unparallelled in the world on account of our situation. The facts which the hon. member mentioned, are perfectly correct. It is the true history of the situation and of conditions as they are. As regards the land which have been bought out, it is in fact the position that the various mining companies have to pay a levy to the association. That association is obliged, under certain circumstances, to purchase the land and to perform other tasks. For example, they have to supervise the drilling of holes, etc. It is also true that the levy paid by the mines to the association is not subject to income tax. In other words, by way of a loss in revenue, the State makes a contribution to the purchase of that land and to the other tasks that have to be performed. In past years I went into this matter very thoroughly, because the hon. member had mentioned it to me long ago. I think this is the right way, because if the mines were to have prevented subsidences the water would have had to be drawn off, and that would have been infinitely more expensive than pumping out the water. In addition to that there would still have been the purchase of land and the other items of expenditure. If they had prevented subsidences in that manner, if it would have been possible to do so in practice, no tax would have been levied on all the money that would have been spent on preventing subsidences either. In other words, this indirect contribution of the State, or a larger one, would have been made in any event. Now the question arises, however, of what the association&#x2019;s policy should be with regard to the land which has been purchased. At the moment land which has been declared safe, is leased to farmers. The mining companies or the association is not carrying on any farming operations on such land that I know of. This land is leased to farmers. Secondly, the constitution of the association provides very clearly that such land which has been purchased, shall not be utilized for the profit of mining companies which pay the levies. Article 3 (b) of the association&#x2019;s constitution reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Association shall not aim to make any monetary profit or gain from the pursuit of its objects and any other such profits or gain as may accrue shall not be distributed to the members of the Association but shall be used by it in the furtherance of its objects.</block>

<p>In other words, these profits cannot accrue to the mining companies. The hon. member for Carletonville also came forward with the interesting idea that that land could possibly be used for recreational purposes. I do not think he has all the land in mind, but only portions of it. However, I want to tell the hon. member for Orange Grove at once that he spoke about something of which he really knew nothing. Negotiations are already under way to use this land for recreational purposes in that area. Of course, this cannot be done at the moment. It will only be done and considered once one has overall stabilization. However, scientifically we are absolutely sure, just as sure as we are that the sun will rise tomorrow, that we will have general stabilization. So the idea of the hon. member for Carletonville i s a perfectly good one. Perhaps, some day when we have attained a ripe old age we shall be able to drive around in that area and perhaps have a braaivleis in Greyling Park.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for Benoni raised the question of dust control at mine dumps. This is a function prescribed by an Act administered by the Department of Health. However, as the hon. member knows, part of that is administered in practice by the State Mining Engineer. In terms of section 27 of the Act, dust-control areas, which include 21 magisterial districts, have already been proclaimed. These include virtually all the mine dumps on the Witwatersrand. Secondly, a special unit was established by the Chambers of Mines in 1965. Some 3 000 ha of land has been put under grass, and more than R5 million has been spent on these projects. I may also draw the hon. member&#x2019;s attention to the fact that an amount of R70 000, which is the State&#x2019;s contribution for the next financial year, appears on the Vote of the Department of Health. In this regard I have to agree with the hon. member for Etosha, i.e. that this amount which the State provides on that Vote, appears in the Estimates specifically<span class="col_7211-7212" refersTo="page_0560"/> as a result of the years of United Party rule in which they did not do their duty in respect of this problem. One can no longer find the owners of those mine dumps, so the State simply had to say that it would make a contribution. The State contributes 80 per cent at the moment, if I am correct, while approximately 20 per cent comes from the land-owners and the local authority. The fact of the matter is that this is a difficult problem because the grass simply does not want to grow. However, we have made a great deal of progress in this regard, but this must in no way serve as an indication to the mining authorities or to my department that now we may proceed quite leisurely. August last year I myself drove through Johannesburg on a windy day and found that it was rather unpleasant as a result of the dust coming from the mine dumps which as yet had not been planted with grass.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke about water pollution. I just want to tell him that the available codes have been drawn up and made available by the Department of Water Affairs, the Department of Mines and the Bureau of Standards. There are two codes, one for the gold mines and one for the coal mines. The idea which the hon. member has of collecting large pans of water on the East Rand for other uses, is not quite practical. Where we are to get the land from, I do not know. However, I want to tell the hon. member that as yet my department and I have not received any specific complaints of water pollution from those areas. In any event, the inspectors of the department are always keeping a watchful eye not only on the prevention of pollution, for sometimes pollution cannot be prevented altogether, but also on restricting pollution to an absolute minimum, and they see to it that these codes are duly complied with. If he likes, the hon. member may peruse these codes, for they make interesting reading. Then the hon. member also mentioned the question of mesothelioma. It is a lung disease contracted by people who work in an asbestos&#x2014;loaded atmosphere. In such cases there is a high incidence of lung cancer as well. It is a disease for which compensation is paid. This is one aspect in respect of which we are extremely active. Research in this regard is being done at the clinic at Kuruman. A month or two ago at the new Unit for Occupational Diseases, which already exists under the Medical Research Council, I put into operation a mobile unit which will go from one factory to another &#x2014;not necessarily asbestos mines, but also in the building industry&#x2014;in order to see what the effect is on our overall working community.</p>

<p>Lastly the hon. member mentioned the question of tiger&#x2019;s-eye. I may just say that the export of tiger&#x2019;s-eye in its natural state had to come to an end and did in fact largely come to an end on 31st May last year. Since the imposition of the prohibition the Department of Commerce and Industries have still issued certain export permits, which amounted to approximatelymillion pounds. Unfortunately, however, the definition of tiger&#x2019;s-eye in the regulations was made too wide, and there are still people who get round the measure. Now we have tightened up the regulations so as to provide that it should be in a certain kind of processed state only. I do not want to tire you by reading out everything to you, Sir, but with the sound co-operation of the Police, we are combating the export of tiger&#x2019;s-eye which is not in a properly processed state. In this regard I may say that to my mind the public, and especially the people there at Niekerkshoop who are in the know, also have a duty to bring it to our attention when people who are not entitled to do so, export this particular mineral, which is found in South Africa only. That is why I want to make the plea, also through hon. members here, that if there is any information of tiger&#x2019;s-eye, which is not in a properly processed state, leaving the shores of South Africa, for such information to be brought to our attention, because that may simply not happen.</p>

<p>The hon. member spoke about the question of pollution by mine dumps. I am glad he raised it, because he will recall that it was during his years in the National Party that the United Party neglected their duty in respect of this matter. However, the hon. member also asked questions about the sink-holes. If he makes a careful study of the Hansard of the hon. member for Carletonville, he will find valuable information. I shall just give him a little additional information. Since we have become aware of sink-holes, there were 250. 110 of those developed in five areas from 1947 to 1963. From 1963 to 1972 there were 140. In 1970 there were 60; 57 in the Bank compartment and 3 in the Venterspos compartment. Last year there was none in the Venterspos compartment and 1 in the Bank compartment; in other words,<span class="col_7213-7214" refersTo="page_0561"/> there was a decrease of approximately 20. As far as the future is concerned, I think the hon. member may safely assume that in several areas&#x2014;I do not want to go into details now&#x2014;stabilization is setting in. In some areas stabilization is already complete. Furthermore, the Venterspos and the Bank compartments are now covered by an overall grid of 300 feet, as is the largest part of the Oberholzer compartment.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member raised the question of pollution resulting from nuclear activities. On that point I want to give the absolute assurance that we are extremely strict, to the complete satisfaction of the scientists who have to advise us. This is done, not only in co-operation with, but strictly in accordance with the international rules and regulations laid down. I may add that in the area of Pelindaba there is proof that this is successful, because as yet the readings and the tests conducted there have not in any way indicated that there is a disturbance of the normal atmosphere or of the water supply. But in this regard the hon. member will realize that we have to allow ourselves to be guided solely by international practices and by our own scientists who have served us for the best so far.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for Bethal voiced his concern over the mines which are closing down, and asked what was going to become of such towns.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, in the rural areas, especially where these areas are remote from the industrial complexes. In the first instance, I want to say that although they are a source of concern to all of us and although the Department of Planning is continually giving this matter its attention, as the hon. member knows, one must be realistic. One can only do that which one is able to within the present limits. In other words, the location of other industries can only take place if it can be done on an economic basis. The location of industries is not in the hands of the Government; it is in the hands of private initiative. Where we may possibly use our influence, as we in the Department of Mines do in respect of the refining of minerals, we do try to use our influence, with some success, so as to see to the location of industries in those areas from which mining may eventually disappear.</p>

<p>As far as the coal position is concerned, I may say that they have been specially charged with the aspect of conservation. Unfortunately I cannot tell the hon. member when we shall be getting this report, but I do know that they are hard at work in that regard. The hon. member will know that we were inclined to say in the past that South Africa had vast deposists of coal. We do have vast deposits of coal, but the coal is of a low grade. Conservation codes are being applied with great care in order to save our coal for posterity as long as possible. As regards pollution from coal mines and coal-talings dumps, the position is that these codes drawn up by the Departments of Mines and Water Affairs and the Bureau of Standards, were drawn up separately specifically for coal mines. Unfortunately I do not have any information on the implementation of these codes in the hon. member&#x2019;s constituency but if he approaches us with his particular problem, he will receive all possible assistance from the Department to have the codes applied, if they are not being applied&#x2014;although I have a feeling that they are being applied&#x2014;and if they are being applied, but are not been applied as they should be, to see that pollution is eliminated as far as possible.</p>

<p>Sir, what has been a feature of this whole debate is that the United Party has not been prepared in any way to talk about mining trade unions. As far as we on this side are concerned, the mining trade unions are of the greatest importance in the mining industry in South Africa. A rift has now opened up between the policy of that side and the policy of this side, one which has never existed before. This side is not prepared, as the United Party is, to tell mining trade unions that the Bantu on the mines must be organized. We are not prepared, as the United Party is, to say that the Bantu must be affiliated with the mining trade unions.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to say a few words firstly about the outbreak of malaria in the Eastern Transvaal. There seems to be a difference between the figures given by the hon. Minister and the figures made public by a Nationalist member of the Transvaal Provincial Council. At the beginning of this outbreak this Nationalist M.P.C. made a statement in the Press, and the <i>Argus</i> of 28th April repeated some of the things that this gentleman had said. The report reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Earlier this week it was reported in the Transvaal Nationalist newspaper that Mr. Van Rooyen offered to resign if it was proved that the facts he had made public over malaria were incorrect. He claimed that the department&#x2019;s statistics were twisted and incorrect. Mr. Van Rooyen action comes three days after the formation of an anti-malarial committee in Nelspruit.</block>

<p>Sir, if a group of people have to form themselves into an anti-malarial committee, then something certainly must have gone wrong with the prophylactic measures taken by the department and with the directives that were given by the Minister. This gentleman will tell the hon. Minister that there were two deaths from malaria and 89 positive cases. There were nine deaths at Elim Hospital, and at the Tsombe Mission Hospital there were 13 deaths from malaria; at Bushbuck Ridge there were four deaths from this disease. He gives a list of the numbers of persons who were suffering from malaria in the various hospitals. These figures differ considerably from the figures that were given officially by the hon. Minister of Health. The figures of the hon. the Minister of Health, quite rightly, are based on the notifications of malarial cases in the various centres. Either the Minister&#x2019;s figures are right or the Nationalist M.P.C.&#x2019;s figures are right. This M.P.C. says that the figures given by the Department were not only incorrect but that they were twisted. If the Minister is right, then this M.P.C. should resign his position from the Provincial Council of the Transvaal. They cannot have it both ways. This is a serious matter because the figures given by the Nationalist M.P.C. are far in excess of those given by the hon. Minister.</p>

<p>I am quite certain that this department knows how to deal with an outbreak of malaria, but I am rather surprised to find that the money voted by the Central Government to combat infectious diseases has been reduced by R260 000. I want to ask the Minister to reconsider the position and to ask himself whether that reduction was justified. Sir, I want to leave it at that because in the short space of time that I have at my disposal I want to deal with another very important matter and that is the continual rise in the cost of medical care. The Minister, with due regard to the requirements of the population, agreed that every encouragement should be given to the medical aid and medical benefit societies schemes. The doctors who belong to the medical aid schemes have had their fees pegged, and that pegging, as I work it out, will last for a minimum period of three years. The doctors are playing their part; they have agreed to this pegging. But what is happening in the other spheres? I cannot see how the medical aid schemes can keep going unless the State helps them to keep going. I know what<span class="col_7217-7218" refersTo="page_0563"/> the feeling of the Minister is. He has publicly stated that he will not subsidize the medical aid schemes but just see what it costs to be ill these days; just listen to these figures, that have been given to me by a medical aid scheme. A patient was treated for 19 days in a nursing home for a perforated peptic ulcer. The total cost of drugs, theatre and ward was R956 and the total hospital bill was R1 181 and the medical aid scheme had to face it. A male went in for a chest investigation and his hospital bill was R354 for 11 days.</p>

<p>The Minister will tell us that the cost of drugs is probably too high, but this Government imposes a duty on the importation of drugs and raw material, and the customs and excise that is put on by the Government swells the cost of drugs enormously, because the charges are the percentage charges from the time of the first handling until the time of the receipt of the drugs by the patient, and that keeps on going up and up and it is 30 per cent or 33 per cent, probably, on each handling. You cannot go on like this, and I say to the Minister that unless he helps the medical aid schemes in some way or other, those schemes will have no option but to keep on increasing the contributions they expect from their members. As a result more and more people will have to fall out of the medical aid schemes and will become a burden on the provincial hospitals, which are already overburdened. The Minister knows as well as I do that beds are vacant in hospitals because there are not enough nurses to man them. The nursing homes are overcrowded because the people cannot get into hospitals today, and when there are beds vacant there is a long queue of people waiting to get into those beds. Can we afford to let these conditions slide along without taking some sort of action? I say that competition by the nursing homes who are taking away the nurses be stopped. The salary scales for nurses must be increased and the conditions of service must be such that nurses will become attracted to the provincial hospitals and to the State hospitals. The nurses would much rather work in one of those hospitals.</p>

<p>Then give some to the provincial hospitals and do not hog them all for yourself. I want to suggest that the hon. the Minister gets Directors of private nursing homes together for talks and let him do to the nursing homes what has been done to the doctors. Let us see whether we cannot peg the charges which are being made by nursing homes for the next three years in the same way as doctors&#x2019; charges have been pegged. Then perhaps we will be able to review the position again. But let us now see whether we cannot stop the cost of treating the sick from skyrocketing or at least bring it down to a level commensurate with the general cost of living today. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>I do not really want to follow up on what was said by the hon. member for Rosettenville, who has just resumed his seat. In regard to the remark he made about malaria., I wonder whether the hon. member expects the hon. the Minister to furnish any other figures than those officially supplied to the department in terms of law as a notifiable disease. We fully realize that after the heavy rains which have fallen throughout the country, especially in the Lowveld, the conditions for the hatching of malaria mosquitoes are exceptionally favourable, although it is pathological it may perhaps be natural in any case for the incidence of malaria to increase considerably in this area. It is just as logical that people will become excited about this, particularly lay members of provincial councils, and other bodies as well, and will issue statements. But I leave the entire matter in the hands of the Minister.</p>

<p><span class="col_7219-7220" refersTo="page_0564"/>I should actually like to say a few words in regard to the training of medical students. When I speak of the training of medical students, I have to ask myself whether the training of our medical students has really been adapted to the requirements of South Africa. At present 11 500 doctors are registered with the Medical and Dental Council. For a population of 22 million this works out to be a ratio of one doctor for every 2 000 patients. For Africa this is satisfactory. If we compare it to European standards where there are approximately 800 to 900 patients to every one doctor, it is less satisfactory. If we consider only the Whites in South Africa, we see that the ratio works out to be one medical practitioner for approximately 400 to 500 patients. This is considerably better than the position in the European countries. But if we consider what the position is in regard to non-White medical practitioners as against non-White patients, it works out to be a ratio of one to 18 000, which is a rather alarming position. [Interjections.] Oh, my friend, is money all you think about? The fact of the matter is this. Recently there was a question in this House as to how many medical students had presented themselves at the various medical faculties, and how many had been refused admission. The important aspect is that the supply of Whites is considerably greater than can be accommodated. On the other hand, a man like Prof. Okkie Gordon, Dean of the Natal non-White Medical Faculty, recently said &#x201C;I have scraped the barrel&#x201D;. He had accepted all the nonWhite students whom he could possibly train, and still the number he could trian was insufficient. The reason is very clear; it is because in regard to pre-graduate training, pre-university training, the non-Whites have a considerable backlog, not because the necessary facilities are not being created for them, but for numerous other reasons, which I do not want to go into here today. The fact of the matter is there are simply not enough non-Whites, particularly Bantu, who are able to present themselves for training. If one bears those facts in mind the question arises whether the actual medical curricula which we offer are adapted to the actual demands made in South Africa on the medical profession. The question arises of how we can improve this, and whether we cannot offer a curriculum for auxiliary medical services among the non-Whites&#x2014;even if it is only on an interim basis. The people trained for auxiliary medical services should be able to assist with preventative medicine, health education and with minor medical and surgical requirements. However, I do not want to call these people second-class doctors. In English there is a term for them, i.e. medical auxiliaries. It seems to me that we could in this way bring about a considerable improvement in our medical services, particularly in the homelands, and particularly since the medical services which are being provided to non-Whites definitely differ widely from those which have to be provided to the Whites. With the Whites we have progressed to the stage where we in fact have an out and out hospital bed-centralized medical training. I doubt whether this is the best training for South Africa. I do not want to comment any further on how this should be changed, but we have a great many needs and possibly the fact that we are doing so little in regard to preventative medicine and other related services, and the fact that we concentrate on an out and out hospital bed-centralized service, should be attributed to the fact that our training is in fact of such a nature. It seems to me as if we should begin to concentrate to a greater extent on the study of health services, including social services. We should make a study of voluntary health organizations, local authorities, home problems, the duties of the Department of Health, such as those of district surgeons, isolation hospitals, immunization services, social welfare and lastly, but not least, geriatrics. In addition, a study should be made of permanent disability, such as paraplegics and rheumatoidal arthritics. The people suffering from these diseases are becoming more and more of a problem today. I think the Department of Health is by no means to be absolved from this problem. The reason is probably because the training facilities for medical students consist only of what is provided by provincial administrations. There to one side, quite isolated, one finds for example a mental hospital; all one hears from a district surgeon is that no one is acquainted with immunization services. Visits are paid to a T.B. hospital only by way of exception. I can only see us providing the best services for South Africa if all these services, at least at the places where the medical schools are, are made available in a single building. When I say that, I do not mean that the T.B. hospital should also render its services there. What I mean is that the district surgeon&#x2019;s services, immunization<span class="col_7221-7222" refersTo="page_0565"/> services and the services rendered by local authorities at clinics, pre-natal clinic services, out patient services, and so on, should all be made available near to these medical schools. I can only see our obtaining proper training if we can integrate the services rendered by the provincial authorities, by the Department of Health and the local authorities. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Fauresmith has referred to the question of training Bantu medical auxiliaries. He has referred to the present ratio which exists of general practitioners to the population as a whole. I believe that it is impossible to get a realistic conception of the picture because of the uneven distribution of the medical practitioners in South Africa which creates an imbalance in medical services throughout the country.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the cost of medicines and of certain medical services. I realize that in the limited time at my disposal, it is impossible to deal adequately with such a complex matter. I wish to refer to the Snyman Commission report. The Snyman Commission was appointed in 1960, and the report became available in 1962. It was appointed to investigate the high cost of medical services and medicines. We realize that in this complex matter this particular Minister is vitally concerned because he is concerned with the administration of the Drugs Control Act and also of the Medical Schemes Act. We know that the Minister exercises rigid control and supervision over the cost of medical and dental services which, however, have been rising appreciably nevertheless. We know from facts at our disposal and also references made in the Snyman Commission report that the cost of medicines as such is controlled at various levels. It is interesting to record that the Snyman Commission report said in so far as the wholesalers involved in the distrubution of medicine were concerned, that they did not contribute in any significant way to the cost structure because they worked on what was virtually a fixed profit margin of 15 per cent. I have read the Snyman Commission report and I cannot trace any specific complaint that the high costs of medicines were due to the last link in the chain, viz. the retail chemist who supplies the final product to the public. In fact, on page 118 of the commission&#x2019;s report it says that it would appear that the part played by the prescription fees in the total cost of the prescription is relatively small. I think that the hon. the Minister will agree with me, as a result of his discussions with the members of the pharmaceutical profession, that the economic position of the retail pharmacist at the moment has deteriorated and that many of them find it necessary to diversify into commercial avenues in order to survive. They cannot exist in so far as the remuneration for their professional services alone is concerned.</p>

<p>I believe that there are other factors in the constant rise in medicine prices. This is a matter which, we are all aware, is causing great public concern. My question to the hon. the Minister at this stage is: How do the South African prices of prescription medicines compare with the same brand in countries where the parent drug companies manufacture and operate? I believe that this is a matter which requires constant review in order to satisfy ourselves that at least the prices in South Africa bear some relation to the consumer prices in the countries of manufacture. I ask whether the hon. the Minister has any up to date information in this respect. I appreciate that devaluation has been responsible for significant price increases on imported medicines. But we have to bear in mind, as the hon. the Minister recently pointed out when he addressed one of the drug associations that 2/3 of the manufactured medicines are imported and that 2/3 of the raw materials are also imported.</p>

<p>I now want to come specifically to the recommendation made in the report of the Snyman Commission on page 189.</p>

<p>This is what is said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No justification for import duty on essential medicines that are not or cannot be manufactured in South Africa or on raw materials necessary for their production.</block>

<p>Now. Sir, this duty, as my hon. colleague for Rosettenville indicated, is applied at source. It therefore has some significant effect on the final price to the consumer. This recommendation was Tabled ten years ago. I want to ask the hon. the Minister what steps have been taken to investigate the feasibility of such a recommendation, and whether steps have been<span class="col_7223-7224" refersTo="page_0566"/> taken to implement the recommendation; if no steps have been taken, what are the reasons for not having taken steps? As I understand the Customs and Excise Act&#x2014; and I refer to section 401 of Schedule 4 of the Customs and Excise Act, No. 91 of 1964&#x2014;provision exists for exemptions by way of rebates. As I understand the position, the Central Government, the South African Railways and Harbours Administration, Provincial departments and certain other bodies are eligible on application for a rebate of the full extent of Customs duty in regard to medicines and other commodities. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether there has been an investigation which would indicate that there is virtually discrimination in the sense that those people who avail themselves of the services of State or provincial hospitals receive the benefit of medicines under some sort of rebate, whereas those members who are members of a medical aid scheme and in many cases receive their medical services from nursing homes are not in that favourable position because the drugs and supplies through the nursing homes are not eligible for the particular rebate which is provided for in the Act.</p>

<p>Arising from this I want to refer to the question of private nursing homes and to the manner in which some of them render their accounts. I believe that the medical aid societies are experiencing great difficulty in this particular matter. They claim that some charges appear to be excessive and that accounts are almost impossible to check. It is not always possible to obtain a doctor&#x2019;s prescription in respect of the drugs supplied to a patient while he is in a nursing home. They claim too that many of the accounts do not disclose sufficient details; that quantities are not plainly indicated; and in many instances the strength of particular medicines are also not clearly shown. It means that the accounts are complicated and that it is difficult for them to check. Photostat copies are sometimes very difficult to read and are not clear. There is therefore a waste of administrative time and money which is costing the Medical Aid money. They suggest that some sort of standard account form should be obligatory. They feel, too, that as far as the medical aids are concerned that they should only pay for medicines which have been specifically prescribed on a doctor&#x2019;s prescription, unless they happen to be drugs and other items supplied from the theatre where this would be difficult. They suggest there too that there should be a specific prescribed list and a limitation of quantities of medicaments prescribed from the operating theatre. They feel that failing this the Medical Aid should have the right to refuse payment of accounts which cannot be justified or substantiated. They also say that investigations should be made into the possibility of providing for the credit of unused and unopened items issued to patients. They quote vacolitres as a specific example. They also suggest that a set of rules governing nursing homes should be introduced to provide for a review of accounts which are subject to query. In addition they believe that there should be some attempt to standardize the theatre fees because most accounts apparently do not disclose the time during which the patient has made use of the operating theatre. They say that fees for theatre expenses differ from nursing home to nursing home for services of a similar nature. They also indicate that there is a variation in charges and that they have no means of checking in so far as the use of anaesthetic gases and oxygen are concerned.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. N. H. JANSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is not my intention to level criticism at the speech made by the hon. member who has just resumed his seat. Nevertheless I do want to make a few remarks, partly in reference to what he said. In the first place I think that it is necessary to read the Snyman Commission report in its full perspective, and not extract from it a few phrases, when this entire matter of the high costs of medicine is being discussed. What is quoted on page 118, and the recommendations on page 186, no matter how correct these are&#x2014;and I do not for a moment doubt their correctness&#x2014;are only a<span class="col_7225-7226" refersTo="page_0567"/> small component of a very bulky report drawn up by this commission, in which reference was made to a 101 different factors which draw attention to this high cost structure in meeting requirements in regard to illnesses. I think it is necessary that there should perhaps be an announcement by the Minister in this debate, or that he should perhaps give us more information, if he thinks fit, concerning the fact that the Public Health Act, which has over the years done good service in regard to the prevention and combating of diseases in this country, has been on the Statute Book since as long ago as 1919, and that it is only with great difficulty that changes and amendments were effected from time to time. I think it is probably of the greatest importance that cognisance should be taken of the fact that now, at last after all these years, there is a Select Committee which is going into this entire matter and which <i>inter alia</i> envisages giving guidance and direction in future in regard to the matters mentioned by the hon. member. I hope that it will be possible for the Select Committee to do this work. This work was tackled by the hon. the Minister and his department with opposition from many sides, which fortunately it seems possible to eliminate. This Select Committee is at present engaged in its activities and will, it is hoped, be able to complete them, because thorough preparatory work was done.</p>

<p>I want to agree with the hon. member that the question of the high cost of medicines is a disturbing factor, particularly for the less well-to-do sector of our population. I want to ask the Minister to consider that, according to my information, our medicines are imported principally from five countries, namely England, America, Germany, Switzerland and Italy. In the case of American and English firms the prices which their pharmacists have quoted in the past two years, between 1970 and 1972, have increased by between 20 per cent to 50 per cent. This is an unheard of increase. This is not the fault of the Government, but is apparently as a result of monopolistic conditions which arose overseas and the kind of mutual agreements firms are able to reach. The increases in the wholesale prices of medicines imported from Germany, Switzerland and Italy during the past four years were also in the region of 20 per cent to 50 per cent. One can therefore imagine what this must cost the less well-to-do sector of our population. I think it is also necessary, when discussing these matters, that we should note there are other factors as well which are beyond the control of the Government, factors to which the various auxiliary bodies should give serious attention. I think for example of what would happen if the pharmaceutical profession, of which the hon. member is a member, were to take steps to combat the tremendous incidental costs. I am referring <i>inter alia</i> to the soaring costs associated with the advertising of medicines. One cannot understand where these manufacturers find the money to keep travellers on the road advertising medicines in colourful variety, and distributing thousands of tablets free of charge to individuals and doctors. I think this is a clear indication that this artificial mode of increase, which is eventually recovered in any case from the client who has to buy the products, should be counteracted. A further contributory factor is that at times there are 10 different varieties of the one kind of medicine on the market&#x2014;this is the information I have from pharmacists. This is not something which a Government can control strictly by means of legislation. This is something which could to a certain extent be kept in check by the pharmaceutical industry if they were able to debate matters of this kind on a mutual basis.</p>

<p>In any case I want to ask whether the hon. the Minister cannot give his serious attention&#x2014;I advocated this last year as well&#x2014;to assistance being provided, by way of advice, encouragement and even, if it should become necessary, the kind of subsidy which is provided in other spheres, so that all the different medicines which are needed&#x2014;in any case the most essential&#x2014;can be manufactured in South Africa. I think this is a matter to which serious attention should be given. If we should reach a position&#x2014;in this world in which we are living&#x2014;where boycotts are imposed on us, I do not know if I am exaggerating the position if I say that the supply of medicines is one matter in respect of which we are almost totally dependent on overseas manufacturers. In this connection I am referring specifically now to Witbank, where a factory was erected but which, owning to various factors which I do not want to go into now&#x2014;for example the price of raw materials, etc., &#x2014;was unable to maintain production. I should like to know from the hon. the Minister what the possibility is of thinking along these lines in South Africa.</p>

<p>Then I want to conclude by referring to the other sector of the medical profession<span class="col_7227-7228" refersTo="page_0568"/> for which protection has to be requested, namely the pharmaceutical profession. I have heard that recently there has been a development where, unlike in other professional bodies, this profession, which requires a difficult course, one which is probably almost as difficult as that of a medical practitioner, finds itself in the position that they can for example have one qualified person in a business and may employ as partners and other assistants people who are not fully qualified. I understand that an attempt is also being made now on the part of the supermarkets to try to promote the supply of medicines by appointing one qualified person. I think of the pharmaceutical profession, particularly in small country towns. I turn to the hon. member for Berea.</p>

<p>Yes, will that hon. member and pharmacists in the major cities now support us in our attitude in respect of the position where major pharmaceutical firms have only one qualified pharmacist in service, and then employ a lot of people in inferior positions? But because that firm has one person in service who is qualified, it is able to control a whole chain of outlets, and virtually dictate the prices for an entire community. I think the smaller chemists in the rural areas and elsewhere in the cities deserve to be protected. I think the pharmaceutical profession ownes it to the smaller firms&#x2014;in the same way as other smaller business enterprises are being protected against these groups&#x2014;so that the pharmaceutical profession will be preserved as it has been preserved in the past, and continue to render good service to us.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think it is quite fitting that one who is neither a chemist nor a doctor should enter the debate at this stage. The problem which the hon. member for Witbank has raised, particularly the cost of medicines and the manufacture of medicines in South Africa, is, of course, largely linked with the patent rights which are vested in the overseas inventors or the original prescribers of these medicines. I believe that this is a matter which the hon. the Minister is looking into to see to what extent there can be reciprocal arrangements to get over the patent prohibitions that exist. The second problem, of course, is the recoupment of the vast amounts spent on research before the medicines were produced in the first instance. These manufacturing firms, where they are not supported by their Governments, have to recoup their expenditure on research. I am sure that that is a matter that the hon. the Minister will deal with. I want to come back just briefly to one matter that was raised by the hon. member for Fauresmith and that is the question of medical services in the Bantu homelands. Sir, the problem which the hon. member sketched is a very real one, particularly as we find in the latest statistics that the Bantu themselves are not producing the number of matriculants that are necessary to provide for the various professions in which they must become self-sufficient over the years.</p>

I want to raise with the hon. the Minister one matter which is of concern to what one might call the para-medical personnel who are working in the Bantu areas. I am infomed that the State health inspectors in the territories do not get the territorial allowances which are paid to medical officers in these areas. I refer to the health inspectors attached to the State Department of Health&#x2026;</p>

<p>Yes&#x2014;who are seconded to the Bantu areas. I think they should be encouraged to stay where they are and to continue doing this work. Quite obviously they have certain difficulties to cope with; their children have to be sent to boarding schools in the White areas, at extra cost to themselves, to complete their education. They should also therefore get this territorial allowance.</p>

<p>Sir, there is one thing that has become apparent in the debate so far. and that is that there is general concern in this Committee over the cost of medicine, medical<span class="col_7229-7230" refersTo="page_0569"/> treatment and hospitalization. If that is the feeling in this Committee this afternoon, then one realizes an everpresent fear in the mind of every member of the public as to what is going to happen if illness should overtake him, particularly some serious illness. Sir, medical aid schemes are assisting and they can assist, but they can only assist provided the subscriptions or membership fees which have to be paid to them are contained within reasonable limits. Basically these medical aid and medical benefit schemes are there to provide safeguards against the cost of illness. Naturally the subscription fees or premiums collected by these societies must be sufficient to cover the cost of the medical services given to their members. There is a tariff committee which looks after the medical practitioners&#x2019; charges, but I want to add to what has already been said about the lack of control of charges made by nursing homes and private hospitals. Many of these homes have absolutely prohibitive tariffs. Some of them, I would say, are blatantly profiteering, when one looks at the details of the accounts which they render to patients. If one goes to a certain type of specialist, you find that it seems to be quite <i>infra dig,</i> for you to go to a nursing home or private hospital unless it has a five-star hotel rating, with plush entrance doors and receptor rooms with armchairs together with coffee service, so that by the time one goes into the theatre for half an hour or an hour, one is conditioned to pay five-star rates for a short stay in the clinic. There seems to be an attempt on the part of each new medical centre to out-smart the previous one, and I believe that that is so because there is no restriction on the charges that can be levied for the services that they render. Sir, either these tariffs must be brought under control or the State, in collaboration with the provinces, should provide free hospitalization. It must be the one or the other. In any event, I believe that patients who are directed to a particular nursing home should be informed as to who are the proprietors or the beneficial shareholders of that nursing home. Alternatively, if a doctor or a specialist refers a patient to a nursing home in which he has a financial interest, he should be obliged by law to disclose that fact to the patient. In other words, where specialists or medical practitioners establish a nursing home, as many of them do, where the profits accrue to them, they should, if they refer their patients there, be obliged by law to disclose to their patients the fact that they have a financial interest in that nursing home. I believe that the present basis of provincial financing gives the hon. the Minister an opportunity to look into the whole question of free hospitalization. We have a new system now in which the provinces apply to the Central Government for the funds they require to run provincial services, and I think one should look at the position as it now exists. In the Cape Province, according to the latest figures I have available, the collections from hospital fees amount to less than 8 per cent of the total maintenance expenditure. In the year 1969-&#x2019;70, for example, I find that the estimated expenditure on the running of hospitals was R55 720 000 and that the estimated collection of fees for that year was R4 675 (XX). That is the position in the Cape Province; I am not sure what the position is in the other provinces, but I think the position there would be pretty well the same. Sir, there is an enormous amount of work involved in the collection of this 8 per cent. This 8 per cent is collected from a minority of the population, that is to say, from those persons who do not belong to medical aid schemes. Members of schemes would, of course, be turned away from provincial hospitals and be told to go to private hospitals. Others are admitted free of charge because of the means test.</p>

<p>They are, of course, admitted in cases of emergency or in those cases where they cannot get treatment elsewhere. I realize that basically there are exceptions. Sir, we have the same position in regard to motor vehicle accidents. When people involved in motor vehicle accidents were admitted to the provincial hospitals the hospitals tried to recover fees from the successful litigants. That has now been dropped and an arrangement has been made whereby the MVA Fund pays the hospitals R500 000 a year, I believe, to cover the hospitalization of persons involved in motor vehicle accidents. This has done away with the paper work.</p>

<p>Unless the Central Government is prepared to give the provinces the necessary finances the provinces<span class="col_7231-7232" refersTo="page_0570"/> are unable to introduce free hospitalization. The Minister will be aware that a new dispensation has been introduced as far as the financing of the provinces is concerned. The provinces no longer raise their own revenue; they cannot raise their own revenue by taxation. They look to the Central Government for funds. My request to the hon. the Minister is that he should make representations to the Cabinet that the Treasury should pay a sufficiently large amount to the provinces to enable them to provide free hospitalization. Sir, I want to say&#x2014;and I do not think that there is a single member of this Committee who would disagree with me&#x2014;that if the private nursing homes and private hospitals are permitted to go on charging what they are charging at the present moment, then inevitably the subscriptions and premiums payable to medical aid schemes will rise and continue to rise to a figure that is beyond the means of the ordinary man.

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. DE V. MORRISON</person>:</from>

<p>In the</p>

<p>main I want to agree with the hon. member for Green Point, who has just sat down, in his plea concerning the costs of private nursing homes. We who have experience of the fees charged by these private homes, know full well that in many cases, or in most cases, the fees charged by these people for accommodation in their homes, are exceedingly high. I want to associate myself with the plea made by the hon. member, i.e. that the time has arrived when the cost structure or the fee structure of these homes should be looked into.</p>

<p>Actually I am on my feet to discuss a matter which the hon. member for Berea touched on only in passing and that is the question of the maldistribution of doctors in the Republic of South Africa. My hon. friend, the member for Fauresmith, pointed out that in our White areas the ratio of White doctors to White patients was 1 to 400, which is a very favourable ratio. However, I want to make the statement that we are experiencing an acute shortage of the services of doctors in the rural areas at the moment. Even though this ratio is so favourable in our White areas, we are experiencing the phenomenon in the rural areas, particularly in the smaller towns, that White doctors are virtually completely unavailable. It is difficult to prove this statement with statistics. I have made enquiries at the Medical Council, but unfortunately the Medical Council does not keep its records in a form from which one may readily ascertain the distribution of doctors over the Republic. However, from my own observations as well as from talks with colleagues, I can testify to the fact that our rural areas are suffering under this shortage at the moment.</p>

<p>Further proof of this fact is that if one looks at the Department of Health&#x2019;s list of vacancies for district surgeons, one finds, in the Cape in particular, that 40 or more posts have been vacant for the past few years, and that these vacancies all relate to smaller places. These communities suffer because of this, and this situation contributes to the increased costs of their medical care as they have to call in doctors from neighbouring larger centres, and this costs money. The situation is so serious at some places that a columnist in one of our local newspapers recently wrote that a deputation of leading residents were even visiting medical schools in an attempt to persuade the younger students to come and practise at those places. Of course it is not the duty of the State to provide private medical services to such communities, but I do think nevertheless that since the position is beginning to assume critical proportions, the State does in fact have a duty. If one has regard to the fact that the training of a doctor costs the State between R10 000 and R12 000, surely the State should eventually have some say as to where and how such a doctor practises his profession. I do not want to advocate that the State should tell specific doctors that they should settle at specific places, but I think there may be some merit in the idea of conducting urgent discussions on this subject with the Medical Association. The Medical Association, too, as spokesman for the medical profession, has a responsibility to the public, and I feel that a fruitful discussion between the department and the Medical Association may possibly lead to finding a solution to this dilemma.</p>

<p>There are various reasons for this phenomenon of doctors no longer wishing to settle in the smaller centres as readily as they did in the past. It is symptomatic of the whole phenomenon of the depopulation of the rural areas, but I should like to mention a few of these causes and perhaps throw a little more light on them. In this regard I again want to associate myself with the hon. member for Fauresmith in his plea for more purposeful training of our students. I ask myself the question<span class="col_7233-7234" refersTo="page_0571"/> whether our training of medical students does not in fact discourage these people from settling in the rural areas. My hon. colleague pointed out that the students are taught to see a sick person as someone in a hospital bed, and they forget that there are also sick people who need care in their homes and on farms. Our students are trained up to a very high degree today, and for that one has great appreciation, but one also asks oneself whether these people do not, because of the climate, the background and the inspiration they experience in these medical schools, come to regard specialization in their field as the only course open to them and forget that there have to be general practitioners as well. Throughout the ages it has always been the view that the general practitioner in medicine is really the backbone of the profession. I am not advocating a lowering of the standard of our medical training; I am simply asking for an approach of encouraging these people to settle in private practices in the rural areas where fruitful work can be done, where enormous compensation is offered for the work one does and where one is able to realize oneself fully. I make the statement that this over-concentration of doctors in cities is one of the major factors giving rise to the increased costs of medical services. It is a fact that when there are too many doctors in an urban complex, all the doctors cannot draw to them the optimum number of patients who can guarantee them a reasonable living. We find the situation that doctors, and young doctors in particular, settle in cities; that they are not consulted by a sufficient number of patients to provide them with a decent livelihood and that they consequently persist in demanding an increase in the fees of medical practitioners. This is definitely a factor which contributes to the increased costs of medical services. The solution to this situation is not obvious. More training facilities in this country will not solve this problem for us. I have already referred to the question of discussions with the Medical Associations, but I am also aware of the fact that the Department of Health has, in its search for more district surgeons, given consideration to paying these people a subsidy which will enable them to settle in smaller places. I want to encourage this idea, and I want to ask them to press on with renewed vigour. The position is that they advertise a post in the rural areas where there is a vacancy for a district surgeon, a post to which a certain salary is attached. Over and above that salary, the prospective doctor is paid an annual amount as an incentive to settle there. Subsequently the amount decreases annually as the doctor&#x2019;s income from the general practice increases. I think this is a step in the right direction, and that it will make a large contribution towards meeting this serious shortage under which our rural communities are suffering.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I rise with trepidation to join in this distinguished field of doctors who are discussing the subject of health services, because I am neither a doctor nor a dentist. I am not even a veterinary surgeon. But I do sometimes get toothache, and for this reason I feel that I am qualified to venture into the field of dental problems. The hon. member who has just spoken raised the question of doctors in the platteland areas. I must say that I agree with him entirely and that he has made out a very good case. I hope that what he has said has not fallen on deaf ears. I remember only too well the old family doctor of days gone by, who was certainly a distinguished person in the community. I would certainly like to see that situation maintained and even improved upon.</p>

<p>The problem I wish to raise is one of dental facilities for indigent people. It has come to my notice that there is a drastic shortage of dental facilities for indigent persons. I refer more particularly to the area that I serve, namely Port Elizabeth. I believe this problem is not only confined to the area of Port Elizabeth; it is a problem which is probably nation-wide. To give some idea of the tremendous shortage of these facilities, I can say that to the best of my knowledge, in the whole of the Port Elizabeth complex, there is only one limited dental service or clinic for Bantu people, and I refer to Bantu schoolchildren especially. This clinic is a Red Cross institution; it is a charitable organization. This clinic, as the hon. the Minister may well know, is a place called Veeplaats. This service is given only once a month and then plus minus 50 patients are treated. The hon. the Minister must bear in mind that I am dealing with a population group of something like 200 000. Fifty of them are treated once a month at this clinic which, to a large extent, is a charitable organization. To illustrate the urgency of the reed for such a service, I want to tell the hon. the Minister that people start<span class="col_7235-7236" refersTo="page_0572"/> queueing at 10&#x2019;clock in the morning to attend this clinic in the hope of possibly being one of the 50 who will get some kind of service. I do not know what happens to those who are not in the front of the queue. What happens to the balance? The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s guess is as good as mine. I believe that this state of affairs is not good enough. I know that the hon. the Minister will agree with me. I have every reason to believe that the hon. the Minister is fully aware of the extent of this problem and of allied problems throughout the country. He has only to read, which I am sure he has done, this great big report of the commission of enquiry into dental services and the training of non-White dental surgeons. This is a tremendous report. In answer to a question tabled by my colleague, the hon. member for Berea, the hon. the Minister in fact said that consideration had been given to this report, but that only certain aspects of it had been accepted and that the others would receive attention later. I do not know which ones the hon. the Minister has already accepted and to which he will still give attention. I think we received this report in July, 1970. Time is going by and we have still not heard what the hon. the Minister intends to do in respect of the recommendations made in that report. I want to know from the hon. the Minister what steps he intends taking to alleviate the position that is highlighted in this report. I do not want to read it out, but it stands there as a serious indictment of inactivity in this field. It fully confirms the situation that I have just quoted at this clinic, namely a drastic shortage in all the big urban areas. I want to know from the hon. the Minister what he intends doing, not only in the long term, but also in the short term, because this matter has now reached an urgent stage. Obviously there has to be long-term planning to put this whole matter straight for the years that lie ahead, but I am also interested in what the hon. the Minister will do in the next six months or the next year to alleviate the position in my area to which I have especially referred.</p>

<p>As far as I can ascertain, there have been negotiations for a very long time in respect of dental clinics with the hope, perhaps, that something would be achieved. These negotiations break down because there is never any clarity as to who must ultimately accept the financial responsibility. Is it the local authority? Is it the provincial authority? Or is it possibly the Department of Health?</p>

<p>What is this?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kingwill">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>For dental services. I am still on dental services. I have consulted all the authorities that I could, and now I am talking to the hon. the Minister. He is the final authority, the final arbitrator in this matter. The Schumann and Borckenhagen reports are about the longest reports I have ever read, but I could not find anything authoritive in them. Now we have this report on dental services, and it makes it fairly clear, I think, that the financial responsibility rests fairly and squarely on this hon. Minister&#x2019;s broad shoulders. If that is so, when can we possibly hope to see a little action? If the hon. the Minister does not clearly state what the position is, we will have a period of complete inaction ahead of us, because the local authorities will sit back and say that they are not going to do anything because this is a State health matter. Provincial authorities will take the same attitude and we shall find that no progress whatsoever will be made. I think that if the Minister and his department are going to take the responsibility he should say so, so that this particular aspect of the matter can be completely cleared up. I accept that the local authority will have to continue to play an important part. It will most probably have to provide the infrastructure. I realize that the question of money is the limiting factor. What concerns me even more is that on the present Estimates there is absolutely no provision for any extended services. In 1971 already it was reported that they could not undertake anything more in this regard because there was not sufficient money. Now, in the Vote for 1972.&#x2014;the Vote we are consiring now&#x2014;there seems to be even less money available. Is one in a position really to expect that anything more can be achieved unless this hon. Minister has a confrontation with the hon. Minister of Finance with a view to having more money set aside for this very vital field?</p>

<p>I realize too that finance is not the only problem. It will be no use having the clinics established without the personnel to man them. It is therefore pertinent to ask what steps the hon. the Minister is taking to see that sufficient non-White people do become trained as dentists to provide the<span class="col_7237-7238" refersTo="page_0573"/> services which are urgently required by these people. As far as I could find out very little progress has been made in this respect. I think we are entitled to know from the hon. the Minister what steps he intends to take. Obviously, with a view to long-term planning this will play a vital role, namely the training of non-Whites to deal with the dental requirements of the non-White people themselves. I believe that at the Witwatersrand University at the present time there is only one Coloured man who is training to be a dentist. Where will this lead us? And we should not forget that in Port Elizabeth there are 200 000 Bantu people. I think if we did a survey of their teeth we would be surprised to find the enormity of the problem that exists. And there we have no Bantu dentists at all. We have a special problem in Port Elizabeth. We have no medical faculty, although I believe the hon. the Minister may promise us one. I think it is going to come out of his little magic bag. We hope for a medical faculty and even more so, for a dental faculty. But perhaps he may consider some plan to help our clinics get off the ground. Some of these students that are training could perhaps be flown out to our area to help in these clinics as part of their training. Something drastic of that nature will have to be undertaken.</p>

<p>This is really the essence of my plea. I hope that the hon. the Minister will give this matter clear consideration, but above all that he will give us a clear answer in this debate as to what the position is so that the local authorities can in future know what the plan of campaign will be and on whose shoulders responsibility rests. Above all, I think the hon. the Minister should take the responsibility to see that he with his authority gets something effective off the ground.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Walmer spoke for the most part about dental services in South Africa and what is wrong with them. I think he will probably agree with us that the dental services available in South Africa exceed those available in the rest of Africa. It is rather remarkable that the United Party could only offer a small measure of criticism in this debate this afternoon. I think this is really a feather in the cap of the hon. the Minister and his department. The fact remains that they did, in fact, comment on matters of a topical nature, for instance, the cost of medicine and the question of malaria. I think the Minister will definitely reply to these comments, but I am surprised that a member such as the hon. member for Rosettenville, who knows how this department functions, could say the things he did about the reporting of malaria cases. I think the Department of Health is probably one of the best organized Government departments we have. So I want to express my appreciation this afternoon to the Secretary and his staff. This department is for the most part concerned with functions in connection with the health of the nation. I think that one must really congratulate the Department of Health when one considers the mortality rate, which is decreasing gradually, the life expectancy, which is on the increase, the infant mortality rate which is dropping all the time among all the racial groups and the fact that we seldom, if ever, experience severe epidemics in South Africa. A further indication is the fact that almost 8 per cent of our total population consists of elderly people. These are the people who will in future make more and more use of the services provided by the State in the sphere of geriatric medicine. However, this does not mean that we have a perfect department in every respect. For this reason it has become necessary to improve even further this high standard we are setting as far as health in South Africa is concerned. That is why the Minister has thought it proper to have the whole of the Health Act of 1911, as amended through the years, rewritten. The Select Committee is carrying out this task at present, and I think this could only be to the advantage of health in South Africa generally.</p>

<p>We are also proud of our medical profession in South Africa. This profession is one which as proved to be capable of showing the way in respect of practically every facit of medicine in the world, not only in the surgical field, but also in the field of immunological research as well as the new medical techniques. The medical profession, which has been respected through the years, and which acts with autonomy, is naturally subject to certain limitations, viz. the principles of the Hippocratic Oath and the self-discipline instituted by the medical profession and applied by the Medical Council. For that reason instructions cannot easily be given to such a self-disciplining profession at statutory level. We can hardly tell these people how<span class="col_7239-7240" refersTo="page_0574"/> to conduct their profession. But in view of rendering a better service and considerations of cost in connection with medical expenses, we merely ask whether certain aspects of the conduct of the medical profession should not, after all, be scrutinized. The fact remains&#x2014;and this question of the high cost of medicine has been discussed in great detail here this afternoon &#x2014;that to my mind there are certain shortcomings in respect of certain other aspects not covered by the report of the Snyman Commission and which were not mentioned here this afternoon either.</p>

<p>It has been said here this afternoon that there are too many preparations on the market. When one consults the &#x201C;Monthly Index of Medical Specialities&#x201D; one finds that more than 2 000 preparations are mentioned there. These do not include the ordinary B.P. preparations which are also still being made to a large extent. I am of the opinion that there is a large measure of overlapping, as far as the use of these preparations is concerned, which must inevitably lead to unnecessary expenses. There is another aspect which I think is also an important one. Although we do not want to tell the medical profession what to do, it has become common practice with the Sick Fund of the South African Railways and Harbours, as well as with certain other medical funds, for certain preparations to be prescribed, but I want to suggest that the quantities prescribed must also be indicated. Because, Sir, I am of the opinion that in many cases excessive quantities of certain types of medicine are prescribed by doctors and not taken. One can walk into any home today and find numerous half-empty medicine bottles. The amount of money spent on medicines which are not used must be tremendous.</p>

<p>Then there is the other aspect of excessive treatment. I think, for example, how frequently antibiotics are prescribed for common colds. Probably the public is also to be blamed in this respect, because everybody wants only the best these days. In other words, they sometimes compel the doctor to prescribe antibiotics where it is probably not necessary to do so.</p>

<p>Then I want to draw attention to the serious abuse of the use of vitamins. Vitamins are only effective in the body when taken in small quantities. It is a fact that serious poisoning of the body may occur as a result of the excessive intake of vitamins. This is another factor which results in heavy expenses.</p>

<p>Then there is the factor of placebos which are liberally used and prescribed. Although placebos may have a salutary effect in certain psychological cases, excessive use is too frequently made of them.</p>

<p>I also want to ask that attention be given to uniformity in connection with the cost of medicine, because I simply cannot understand why here in Cape Town the very same preparations sometimes cost up to one-third or even more of the price paid for them elsewhere. This matter should be rectified by the pharmaceutical profession and it should receive the attention of the Department of Health.</p>

<p>I want to raise another matter, and I do so with some hesitation because this necessarily reflects on the professional judgment of our medical practitioners. This matter concerns the unnecessary and excessive special examinations carried out. You know, Sir, special examinations are extremely costly. I feel that far too many unnecessary X-rays are taken. I suggest that far too many and unnecessary blood tests are carried out in the medical profession today. It is a fact that the medical practitioner should probably again be allowed to make a special attempt to develop his clinical diagnostic ability. The time when the medical practitioner had this clinical diagnostic ability, when he was unable to carry out these special examinations, is fast becoming something of the past. For this reason I very much want to raise this matter, although I know that I am treading on dangerous ground because we should not like to restrict the professional judgment and the right of self-determination of the medical practitioner.

<from>*Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think it is a good idea that members such as I should also participate in the discussion when the Health Vote is being discussed. I want to make a few comments on a matter which nobody has mentioned in this debate up to now, and that is family planning, for which provision is made in this Budget to an amount which is five times more than the amount voted last year. We are very glad about this. It makes one think that the Government has at last come to realize that we are concerned here with one of our greatest problems in South Africa, i.e. the enormous population increase taking place among people where it ought not to be taking place. I want to say at once that my remarks are not directed at any group or race. My comments are directed at all who bring children into the world and cannot care for them properly. I do not want to tell the Government either what should be done about this matter. This is a matter of tremendous magnitude which affects so many bodies and persons that it seems to me that the time has possibly arrived for a conference of experts in all the various spheres to be called to discuss this matter properly.</p>

<p>We know there are certain countries that take this matter so seriously that they have taken drastic steps in this regard, and one wonders whether the time has not arrived for us in South Africa also to think of taking drastic steps in this regard.</p>

<p>Of course, there are people who will say that one should not encourage birth control while one is also encouraging immigration, which we are in fact doing, at the same time. I think the reply to that is this; the immigrants we bring into our country are all people who are capable of making a more or less immediate contribution to our society. But these unfortunate people who are brought into the world under these unfortunate circumstances, can perhaps make their contributions here only in 20 years&#x2019; time.</p>

<p>Our great problem is the backlog which already exists in various fields in South Africa. We should try to uplift our people and the best way of uplifting them is to create opportunities for them to improve their lot. The greatest enemy we have in the world today against the upliftment of mankind, is poverty. Poverty is the cause of all the other evils with which we have to contend, such as malnutrition, over occupation, etc. One is able to do less for these unfortunate children who have to grow up under these circumstances because they cannot be cared for or be fed properly. Unfortunately the irony of the matter is that the poorer the people are, the more children they bring into the world. There are many people in our country today who cannot look after themselves, let alone after children. One immediately asks oneself whether those people should simply be allowed to bring as many children into the world as they like. The more children brought into the world under these circumstances, the worse the position becomes, not only of those children, but also of their parents, and the State is loaded with an ever-increasing burden. We can no longer allow the position to continue like that. I think we should at least check this rapid population increase so as to enable us to make up the big backlog which already exists in our country.</p>

<p>When I refer to a backlog, I have in mind housing and employment opportunities for people who have not had training. I also have in mind the difficulties which exist in regard to the training of the large numbers of people who are off-loaded onto us; I have in mind the difficulties which exist in providing them with an education, and, lastly, I have in mind the health services which have to be provided for them.</p>

<p><span class="col_7243-7244" refersTo="page_0576"/>I am very pleased that it would seem as though the Government was at last beginning to realize the seriousness of this matter. I am not asking the hon. the Minister to rise today and to tell us what should be done in this regard. I think it is a very delicate matter. I think we should deal with it with as much circumspection as possible, and I hope that this matter will never be dragged into politics; it is too serious a matter for our country for it to be dragged into politics. With the best will in the world, the Government cannot solve this problem alone. I think we should encourage the public to make its contribution, too, in the matter of trying to provide information to these unfortunate people who do not have the necessary information.</p>

<p>Sir, if we cannot solve this problem, we may rest assured that all the other attempts we may make to uplift our people, will fail. The first thing we must do is to solve this problem. I have already said that poverty is probably the biggest danger which exists in any country. If we have poverty among a very large section of our population we may rest assured that at some time or other it will create social problems and eventual chaos in our society. We must remember that poor people, people who do not have an interest, people who do not have enough to eat, people who have no possession in the State, have nothing to lose either. If we do not halt this unfortunate rapid population increase &#x2014;and we need only look around us to see what is happening&#x2014;then, as I have already said, all our attempts in other spheres would be in vain.</p>

<speech by="#aucamp">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. L. S. AUCAMP</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member, who has just resumed his seat, must excuse me if I do not react to the speech he has just made. I think the Minister will give him a conclusive reply.</p>

<p>Firstly. I should briefly like to put forward a few ideas for the hon. the Minister to consider with respect to the Oranje Hospital in my constituency. It is the only hospital of that kind in the Orange Free State. In 1884 a start was made in erecting a building complex for White and nonWhite psychiatric patients. This hospital was erected on a building site of about 96 morgen, situated at the time on the outskirts of the city, but at present surrounded by residential areas, the boundaries of the back plots bordering on this particular area. At present there are about 1740 patients in this hospital, 1 200 being nonWhites. At the moment there is also still a need for accommodation for mentally deficient White children, but I am aware that this matter is already receiving the attention of the hon. the Minister and his department. At present the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department is also giving attention to the erection of additional accommodation for Whites and for non-White patients, and is also giving attention to the modernization of existing buildings. Before they continue with that, I want to submit for the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s consideration that attention be given to closing down the nonWhite section, which is situated within the heart of the White residential area, and that a new hospital be erected within the non-White residential area or within a nonWhite area suitable for that purpose. Should this step be taken, I also think it necessary to take a look at the present White section. If the 1 200 non-Whites are removed from this site, it is my conviction that the 96 morgen will be too big for a White section alone. I would appreciate it if the hon. the Minister would consider finding another suitable site, perhaps nearer to the university and nearer to the present new academic hospital, which will be suitable for the purposes of training medical students. A modern complex can be erected there, which would be in the interests of patients as well as being in the interests of the services supplied there. I am convinced that if the hon. the Minister takes this step he will obtain the full co-operation of the Bloemfontein municipality, and the full co-operation of the university.</p>

<p>In yesterday&#x2019;s debate hon. members of the Opposition lodged pleas for free hospitalization and for State contributions to medical aid funds. This leaves the impression that the White South African electorate must carry a very unfair burden in respect of hospitalization. Secondly, it also creates the impression that the State is doing nothing to assist medical aid funds. At this stage, and for the purpose of my argument, I want to make use of certain statistics. These statistics have a bearing on the White hospitals in the Free State. I am aware that in the other provinces there may be deviations here and there, although these would not be appreciable. At present about 60 per cent of the total number of hospitalized patients are members of medical aid funds. The 40 per cent of patients who are not covered by medical aid funds<span class="col_7245-7246" refersTo="page_0577"/> are therefore patients who must make their own provision for hospitalization. Of this 40 per cent about 21 per cent qualify for free hospital services in accordance with the existing means test. This means that about 19 per cent of patients in the provincial hospitals are responsible for their own hospital fees. It is now necessary for us to note what it costs the State and the provinces to establish accommodation for those patients. In academic hospitals the cost per patient per day is R24. In specialist hospitals it is R12-50 and in smaller hospitals, where no specialist services are furnished, it is R7-40. As against this the hospital fees for a private room in academic as well as in specialist hospitals is R6 and in a general ward R4 per day. This means that the State subsidizes this 19 per cent group of paying patients by 75 per cent to 84 per cent in the case of academic hospitals, while the subsidy amounts to 50 per cent to 66 per cent in specialist hospitals. As against this, paying patients in smaller hospitals are subsidized to the tune of 40 per cent to 60 per cent. This means that the State makes a big contribution towards bringing hospitalization within the reach of the more well-to-do group of people who land up as patients in hospitals. The question that now arises is how this affects medical aid schemes. I can state at once that hospital fees applicable to paying patients are also applicable to patients belonging to medical aid schemes. In other words, medical aid schemes are State-subsidized by this same percentage. This is a contribution which runs into millions of rand a year. Therefore it is an unjust accusation that a big burden is being placed on the members of medical aid schemes. If the cost per patient per day were to be recovered from medical aid schemes it would mean that the members of medical aid schemes would have to make much greater contributions to the schemes.</p>

<p>I do not think this plea for free hospital services is well thought out. The authorities can only furnish a service in accordance with the funds available. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Bloemfontein East dealt with the question of medical aid, and I think that it is important that the Committee should take note of what the hon. member has said. This is obviously an important factor when dealing with the high costs of medicine prevalent in the Republic of South Africa today. We on this side of the House believe that the medical aids perform a very vital role in providing people with security in time of illness, in a time of ill-health. We on this side of the House wish to see medical aid schemes extended and supported to ensure that they play a full role in this regard.</p>

<p>I would like to deal with two aspects which have been dealt with during the course of this debate. I would like to deal with the high cost of medicines and the shortage of doctors. In passing, however, I would Like to give my support to the views which have been expressed by the hon. member for North Rand when he dealt with the difficult problem of the family planning services which are being provided for in the Estimates before us. I believe that this is a vitally important problem. We can see from the Estimates that there has been a considerable increase in the amount of expenditure under Subhead K. Subhead K deals with medical poor relief and the amount to be expended in the coming year is R6,3 million in comparison with R3,7 million for the past year. When one considers the lack of education in many fields as far as family planning is concerned, I think it is certainly a matter which requires considerable attention by the Government and one in which the extension of these services, from an educational point of view, is vitally important. If we look at figures which were tabled in this House in reply to a question I put to the hon. the Minister of Statistics, we shall see that it also shows an alarming increase in the rate of illegitimacy in South Africa. Indeed, over the period of the past five years the number of illegitimate children amongst Whites, Coloureds and Indians amounted to nearly 200 000. Of course there are no statistics at all as far as the Bantu people are concerned, because it is too difficult for the Government to maintain any form of statistics as far as the Bantu community is concerned. The family planning service is of vital importance to the community.</p>

<p>As far as the high costs of medicine are concerned, one can see from the Estimates that there has also been a considerable increase under Subhead K, &#x201C;Medical Poor Relief,&#x201D; as far as medicines are concerned. On page 189 of the Estimates of Expenditure it shows, under the item entitled &#x201C;Medicines and Dressings,&#x201D; that the Estimates<span class="col_7247-7248" refersTo="page_0578"/> for the year 1971-&#x2019;72 have increased from R2,3 million to R3,3 million for the current book year. That indicates an increase of over R1 million under that particular heading. The position as far as providing adequate medical service in South Africa is concerned, is one which this hon. Minister is responsible for, and that is why I would like to refer to the position as far as the shortage of doctors is concerned.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Fauresmith gave certain figures in the House yesterday indicating the present shortage. He mentioned that in South Africa we have only one doctor for every 2 000 patients, and only one non-White doctor for every 18 000 non-Whites. In Europe they have one doctor for every 800 or 900 patients. I would be grateful if the hon. the Minister could give an indication to the Committee as to the estimate of the shortage of doctors in South Africa at the present time. I know it is a difficult figure to assess, but when you look at the number of doctors of all races, it appears that we have a shortage of doctors in this country. What is more surprising, is the fact that there is a lack of training facilities for students to study medicine. I realize that this is an aspect which falls under the responsibility of the Minister of National Education as far as medical schools are concerned. It does seem ironic that while we are talking about the shortage of doctors in South Africa, we have a position that many prospective doctors and many potential doctors are unable to gain admission to a medical school. The hon. the Minister of National Education indicated in a reply to a question earlier this session that of the 3 196 applications by students for admission in 1972 to the various medical schools, only 820 were successful. I believe that this is a most unsatisfactory position, and I hope that the hon. the Minister will be able to use his influence with his colleague, the hon. the Minister of National Education, in an endeavour to provide greater facilities for the training of doctors.</p>

<p>This shortage of doctors affects various spheres in so far as our medical services are concerned. I should like to indicate the shortage of district surgeons in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department. The hon. the Minister indicated in reply to a question by the hon. member for Berea that there was at that stage a shortage of 71 full-time district surgeons and 70 part-time district surgeons. This shortage of district surgeons has meant that there are too few having to attend to too many in many instances. I hope that the hon. the Minister wild be able to give some indication as to whether any improvement can be foreseen as far as this shortage is concerned.</p>

<p>But is there no indication in the reply?</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Not to my knowledge. I have the reply here. The hon. the Minister merely quoted the shortage and dealt with the other aspects which concerned the number of patients whom were attended and the memorandum. I refer to the reply to Question No. 351 which was replied to in March this year. The question dealt with the shortage of full-time and part-time district surgeons in the various racial groups.</p>

<p>This shortage also has an effect in providing a service to the indigent aged persons who are residents of old-age homes. In collaboration with the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions, the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department assumed responsibility for these people from the 1st April, 1969. I should like to indicate to the hon. the Minister that this particular group of the inmates of old-age homes, the indigent people who fall in the sub-economic income group, are reaching a stage where they often require urgent medical attention or more frequent medical attention. The Department of Health is endeavouring to provide that service, but it has been brought to my notice by these welfare organizations which administer such homes that there are many instances where the present arrangement has been found unsatisfactory. A certain organization mentioned a case where a resident suffered a scalding of the hand on a Monday, but it took until the Wednesday before a doctor was able to attend to her. The organization also raised other points which show that the service is inadequate as far as provision for the old-age homes is concerned.</p>

<p>I should like to suggest that the hon. the Minister give consideration to permitting private practitioners to attend to these people in certain cases and that these private practitioners are then remunerated on a <i>per capita</i> basis on a medical aid tariff so that where urgent attention is required, it will be possible to render such service expeditiously.</p>

<p><span class="col_7249-7250" refersTo="page_0579"/>Another aspect which concerns the shortage of doctors and the health services of our country affects the position of Bantu hospitals. In this regard we see on the Estimates a table showing the various Bantu hospitals in the Bantu homelands whose expenditure is provided for from the South African Bantu Trust Fund under the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. The hon. the Minister of Health acts as an agency to ensure that standards are maintained and that these hospitals are administered in an efficient and professional manner. Consequently we have in the Estimates the staff of these hospitals listed and tabulated. In this regard I should like to say that the question of the staff of these hospitals in the Bantu homelands has a direct affect on those hospitals which are administered by the provincial administrations. I should like to say that many of these hospitals and particularly those which are situate in White areas and are still under the provincial administrations are experiencing severe difficulties because they are completely over-burdened as a result of the position in the Bantu homelands where the hospitals are being run by the staff provided by the Department of Health. The position is now reaching such a stage that some of these hospitals are almost at breaking point. I refer to the fact that it has been said on a number of occasions that a new hospital is to be built in the Umlazi area providing for 1 500 beds. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there is a small matter I should like to bring to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention. It concerns the training of retarded children. Here I am thinking preeminently of the Lettie Fouch Institution in Bloemfontein and of the Lake Farm Institution of my friend, the hon. member for Algoa. I am quite aware that there was a commission of inquiry into these institutions. I am also aware that the Government apparently reached a decision about these institutions. I am also aware that an announcement was made to the effect that these institutions are going to be taken over by the Department of Education. However, at this stage they have not yet been taken over by the Department of Education. Neither can they be taken over by the Department of Education without legislation being introduced. This legislation was proposed last year, and apparently legislation in this connection will not be introduced during this session either. In the meantime these institutions find themselves in the greatest of financial difficulties. The simple reason for this is that they are all dependent on contributions from the public. After the announcement in connection with the complete takeover of these institutions, financial contributions from the public have simply stopped. The result is that an alarming situation has developed at these institutions and these people are actually in a financial fix. These institutions are extremely important, not only because they are out-and-out educational institutions, but also because these people still have to be held in safekeeping even after they have reached school-leaving age. It therefore still remains an open question to me whether these people really belong under the Department of Education or whether they do not perhaps belong under the Department of Health or the Department of Social Welfare. A short while ago the hon. member for North Rand lodged a lengthy plea for family planning. An alarming situation can develop if these people, who cannot think fully for themselves, are let loose when they have to leave school. We know that these people are sexually overstimulated and that if they are let loose they can create great problems for us. I therefore think that they should be kept under supervision for the rest of their lives. I think it is absolutely essential for the hon. the Minister to state here today specifically when that take-over will occur, and if it cannot take place this year, I think it is essential for him to say this to the Press and public, because at the moment these people are experiencing many problems with their funds.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to say a few words about the provision of new clinics in the Bantu homelands, a matter about which the hon. the Minister told the House something in February last year and the progress of which I have been following with some considerable interest.</p>

<p>First of all, I was interested to see on the Estimates of the Bantu Administration Vote that an additional R1 million have been made available for health services and hospitals in the Bantu homelands. I think this hon. Minister is responsible for the administration of that part of the department. It would appear from a reply to a question which I put to the hon. the Minister<span class="col_7251-7252" refersTo="page_0580"/> earlier this year, that there are now something like 462 clinic centres operating in the Bantu homelands. If these were all established in the course of the last year, since the hon. the Minister announced the scheme, I must say that it is remarkable progress. I must also say that his department, more particularly the Department of Preventive Medicine, and the team headed by Dr. Wittman and Dr. Erasmus and others, should be congratulated on getting going at such a pace with this very essential service.</p>

<p>I also see that R50 000 extra has been voted for the provision of protective food. I want to come back to that later, because I think this provision is hopelessly inadequate in view of the problem which is confronting this country in the field of malnutrition.</p>

<p>I want to say to the hon. the Minister that, while I congratulate him on establishing 462 clinic centres in the homelands, it does seem to me a tragedy that we have lost something like 25 years in the postwar period when these clinics could and should have been operating in the homelands. The hon. the Minister will remember that the National War Memorial Health Fund was actually initially designed to establish clinics throughout South Africa in the African reserves, and that a pilot scheme had actually been established at Polela in Natal, which was providing exactly the same sort of services, as far as I can see, that the clinic centres are now providing in the homelands. It does seem a pity that the Government abandoned the recommendations of the Gluchman Report and did not go ahead in providing the local clinics in the Bantu homelands, which could have been providing educational services as far as nutrition is concerned, as well as all sorts of out-patient services. It could have been providing the distribution of protective food, and so have obviated an enormous amount of malnutrition in South Africa. They could also have gone ahead and done a good deal of family planning, about which a lot has already been said in this Vote and with which I concur. On that issue, I would say that a slightly more intelligent psychological approach is necessary if one wants to get the co-operation of the Black population in this regard. There is no point in our exhorting the White population to produce many children&#x2014;as did the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development on one famous occasion&#x2014;paying family allowances to one section of the population and then hoping that you are going to get the cooperation of the Black, Coloured and Indian population when you tell them to limit their families. Family planning should be spread over all the groups in this country.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I certainly do think so. There are many very poor White families in this country who should not be encouraged to produce large families. There are many families&#x2014;with Whites among them&#x2014;where the general genetic picture is such that family planning is very essential. I hope we are going to go ahead with that.</p>

<p>Now I come back to the point I was talking about. I have mentioned the R200 000 now provided for the financial year 1972-&#x2019;73 for the supply of protective food. I am very glad, indeed, that this is an increase on last year; but I must say that I still believe it to be hopelessly inadequate for what is undoubtedly a very serious problem in South Africa. I quote Dr. Wittman here, taking part in a discussion of food supplementation in Durban in September last year, in which he said, talking about the subsidized milk powder scheme, which the Government is going in for: &#x201C;There is no doubt at all about the high incidence of protein calorie deficiencies, kwashiorkor and malnutrition in South Africa.&#x201D; I think that is borne out by the various studies which have been done throughout South Africa on the incidence of kwashiorkor. I want to say again that I am sorry that it is no longer a notifiable disease, because I do not see how we can study and follow the improvements in this field, and in preventive medicine generally, if we do not have basic statistics on which to base these surveys. So, again, I ask the hon. the Minister why it is that he does not reintroduce the idea of making kwashiorkor a notifiable disease. I believe we need a little more imaginative help for his department. He needs imaginative help from the Department of Bantu Administration, and I am going to mention one or two examples of what I mean by this. First of all I see from the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply that out of the 800-odd local authorities in South Africa, only 171 are availing themselves of the skimmed milk distribution<span class="col_7253-7254" refersTo="page_0581"/> scheme. I think that is a tragedy, and I feel that something should be done to persuade these local authorities that it is, in the first place, economically wise to partake of this scheme, because it is obviously much cheaper to prevent the incidence of kwashiorkor than to cure it, and also, that it is to the benefit of South Africa generally that we do not allow this high incidence of kwashiorkor to continue, because this is a disease which apparently has permanent results. If a child has suffered from kwashiorkor, it is difficult to reverse the damage caused by this disease in later life. I think that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department must liaise more closely with the Department of Bantu Administration, and both these departments must bring their very considerable authority to bear on local authorities to try to persuade them to take advantage of this excellent scheme, which has been initiated by the Department of Preventive Medicine, and which involves the distribution of cheap skimmed milk powder. This is the easiest and cheapest way of preventing and also of curing kwashiorkor. That is one example I want to give.</p>

<p>The other also concerns the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration, and I am glad he is here. The hon. the Minister of Health has told me that he has had to abandon the investigation into the fortification of maize scheme because of difficulties experienced in certain areas, where the pilot scheme research survey &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Well, not abandon, but postpone; it has been postponed for a year, until confidence has been re-established in the Department of Health. I have his answer here, Sir, This was as a result, you will remember, Sir, of an immunization campaign. There were some very wild rumours going around the townships in Pretoria, Soweto and elsewhere, about the so-called &#x201C;death jabs&#x201D;, and many Of the Africans refused therefore to continue with the immunization programme. In turn, this engendered a fair amount of suspicion of the Department of Health. I believe that all this could have been prevented with a little imaginative planning by the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration in co-operation with the Department of Information, or whoever would be responsible. They could, for example, have had a programme put out days and weeks before the beginning of this immunization campaign, over Radio Bantu.</p>

<p>That is exactly what we did.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Well, you did not do it in this case, or it was not sufficiently done. What was done, was that after the damage had been done, Radio Bantu tried to get some soothing messages over the air, to dispell the suspicion and to counter these wild rumours which were flying around the townships. I believe that if the population of the Bantu areas had been prepared for the campaign of immunization&#x2014;I do not know whether it was for polio or for chicken-pox, or whatever it was&#x2014;it would have been difficult for anybody doing this out of ignorance or <i>mala fides,</i> or for any other reason, to get these rumours going. I should like to sugggest to the hon. the Minister that closer co-operation in future be aimed at between the different departments before any campaigns of this type are undertaken. I do want to say that I hope very much indeed that the maize enrichment research project will be started again, perhaps earlier than intended; the date is apparently July, 1972. This is a very important research project which could do an enormous amount of good, not only in preventing and curing kwashiorkor among children, but also in preventing the other nutritional diseases such as pellagra among grownups. I am referring here to the protein enrichment of maize. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to start by expressing my special thanks to the members on both sides of this House for the excellent contributions made by them and for the dignified tone maintained throughout this debate. A debate of such a high standard is always a fertile one, and I can honestly say that in the 19 years I have been here, I cannot remember our having a debate of a higher standard than the one we have had here yesterday and today. On behalf of my officials I also want to express thanks for the appreciation shown for the work done by them. I am referring in particular to the hon. member for Newcastle. We appreciate it. But let me also add at once that we are aware of the shortcomings that exist. For instance, there are staff shortages. Furthermore, I want to say at once<span class="col_7255-7256" refersTo="page_0582"/> that everybody in South Africa is at least being cared for as far as medical services are concerned. One should remember that there are 27 notifiable diseases in our country, and, as far as we know, there have been no severe epidemics for years. As far as our medical science is concerned, hon. members will agree with me that we are taking our place amongst the nations of the world. Even in respect of the services we provide, with the shortcomings that exist, I think we should say in all humility that South Africa is a diamond in comparison with comparable countries in this field. South Africa is a sparkling diamond in regard to the services we provide, with due regard to the shortcomings that exist.</p>

<p>I should like to start by replying to the hon. member who spoke last, i.e. the hon. member for Houghton.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to a reply I gave to a question in this House some time ago in regard to a certain number of clinics in the Bantu homelands. We do not quite deserve all the praise that has fallen from her lips. Those clinics were not all established in the past year. They have been there for yaars, and there has been an increase in their numbers. We have problems, of course, and one of the big problems is housing for the nursing staff in those clinics. We are making progress; it is a matter of money. Another problem is that in certain of the Bantu homelands the nurses are not prepared to stay out at night, for fear of different things. I say &#x201C;in certain Bantu homelands&#x201D;; this is not the position in all of them. We are, however, making progress in this regard, as part of a comprehensive hospital centric service.</p>

<p>As far as protective foods are concerned, let me say that last year we made R90 000 available in the Budget, and only R72 000 was taken up by local authorities. On the Bantu Administration Vote R200 000 was made available and only R43 000, in round figures, was taken up. We are doing our utmost to encourage these local authorities to partake in this scheme. I even spoke to the Coloured Council the other day. Only as recently as 14th February this year, we sent round a letter to every local authority, bringing this scheme to their attention and encouraging them to make use of the facilities available, so I can assure the hon. member that what can be done from our side is being done at the moment. Of a total of R290 000 on the Budget last year, only R159 000 was taken up. I do hope that the position will improve in the year that lies ahead.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Bloemfontein East raised the question of the Oranje Hospital. The position is, as he rightly said, that when the hospital was built, it was situated quite some way from the city centre; it was situated on the outskirts of the city. Let me say now that whenever references are made to the Oranje Hospital, I have pleasant memories, for the National Hospital, where I completed my housemanship many years ago, is just next to it. As far as the moving of the nonWhite patients is concerned, it is the policy of the Government, and this also has the full support of my department, to move those non-White patients, the Bantu, to another home. Negotiations are in progress between the Department of Bantu Administration and the Mission Society&#x2014;I think it is the Methodist Church at Thaba&#x2019;Nchu &#x2014;with a view to making arrangements to the effect that the General Hospital which is being built there, may also make additional provision for these patients. Of course, this is a question of money and of arrangements which have to be made by that department. As far as the Whites are concerned, I may give the hon. member the assurance that the site available there &#x2014;I think we have another 60 ha there&#x2014; is situated in such a manner that it will be possible for the medical school, which is in the process of being established, to be served properly. Its situation is good enough for that purpose.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for Fauresmith referred to the day-work centres. I may say that there are 19 of them in South Africa. I think there are roughly 159 children in these centres. It is true that it has been indicated that this is going to become the responsibility of the Minister of National Education, since these children are educable. It is quite correct that legislation must be introduced. My colleague indicated that, for several reasons mentioned by him, this could not be done this year, and he made an urgent appeal to the public to make contributions in order to help these institutions to carry on with the splendid, good work they were doing. I may just tell the hon. member that according to my colleague it is the intention to introduce this legislation next year. Furthermore, I just want to call attention to the fact that in the past the State contributed 25 cents per<span class="col_7257-7258" refersTo="page_0583"/> school-going child. In these Estimates this amount has been increased from 25 cents to R1 in respect of every school day, which will be a tremendous help to these institutions. In other words, whereas they used to get 25 cents per child per day, they are now getting R1 per day, four times as much.</p>

<p>Then I want to come to a matter raised earlier on in this debate, namely the question of the incidence of malaria. I should like to confirm that what I said in previous statements, is now coming true, namely that there is a downward trend in the incidence of malaria. In fact, the latest bulletin, which we are releasing today, once again shows a downward trend im the incidence of this disease. But I want to sound the warning that it is quite possible that the statistics may show an upward trend next week or the week after that, in view of the fact that the great publicity which this matter has received, also in this debate, may persuade medical practitioners and hospital authorities to report cases which may not have been reported before &#x2014;in other words, outstanding cases. I just want to call attention to the fact that this is possible, and that it should not necessarily be assumed that there is no increase in the incidence of malaria at this moment. The increased incidence of malaria this year is chiefly attributable to the plentiful rains that have fallen in the Lowveld. The rainfall in the Lowveld is approximately 20 to 22 inches per annum. This year it has had between 50 and 70 inches of rain. The hon. Senator Ferreira told me that the average rainfall on his farms in Kaapmuiden is 20 inches per annum, and that in January alone they had 23 inches of rain. This is the principal cause of this increase. I want to tell hon. members that long before this increase was evident, my department had anticipated that there would be an increase and had taken certain steps. For instance, in comparison with the previous season, our field staff numbered 190 instead of 131; we used a far greater amount of sprays than we did before; we warned the public in season and out on the radio and in bulletins&#x2014;I myself and my department&#x2014;and we also introduced this weekly bulletin, which is not the normal practice of the department.</p>

<p>My regional director for medical services, as well as head-office officials, paid visits to those areas on several occasions, and I also paid a personal visit to the Lowveld. Furthermore, I want to say that I have been in constant touch with the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration, whose constituency is chiefly being hit by this outbreak, and that we have continually kept each other informed of what has been happening there. I may also say that only last Friday talks were held in Pietersburg with a view to steps which may be taken in the future. Now, in regard to the figures, it has quite rightly been said here that certain persons from those areas made the statement that our figures were not correct. Let me tell hon. members that this statement is totally devoid of all truth. In its bulletins the department only includes figures in respect of reported cases. In fact, this has been the policy since 1956, when malaria became a notifiable disease, and this is also the policy in regard to all of the other 26 notifiable diseases. In other words, only notifiable cases are included, and I want to give the assurance that all reported cases were included in the bulletins. But let me repeat now that it will remain the policy to include only notifiable cases in our bulletins. We are aware that more cases do occur, but it would be totally unscientific and ridiculous to include officially in one&#x2019;s bulletin cases which were not reported by a medical practitioner or by a hospital authority. In fact, that would be quite irresponsible. For that reason it must be accepted as a fact that figures compiled by laymen will not be included in these bulletins. I want to say, furthermore, that the department has no control over persons who have to report such cases, but what we are in fact doing, is to point out to them regularly that they should report such cases to our department. Now, unfortunately the Press also entered this matter, and reports were published which were absolutely inaccurate. For instance, it was reported in the Press that in the Bantu area Bantu children were dying of malaria at the rate of six a day. That appeared on the front page.</p>

<p>I had the matter investigated in full by two head-office officials, and no evidence was found to the effect that this was in fact true. There was a second report stating that a medical practitioner had died of malaria, whereas it has been confirmed that a heart attack was the real cause of his death. This medical practitioner was a very good old friend of mine, a university friend, and, as a matter of fact, if I may say this, he was the brother-in-law of the hon. member for Witbank. But the newspaper report stated that he had died of<span class="col_7259-7260" refersTo="page_0584"/> malaria. There was yet another case that was front-page news, i.e. that about 136 cases occurred at a certain time, whereas this was not malaria, but was presumably attributable to food poisoning. I am merely mentioning this to hon. members to show how quite out of context this matter was reported.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am dealing fully with this matter because it is important. Cases of malaria continually occur in South Africa on a permanent basis in this endemic area. It is absolutely wrong to assume that malaria has ever been stamped out in South Africa. This is simply not true. In fact, it is the type of thing that cam never be stamped out completely. Since 1956, when it became a notifiable disease, cases have been reported every year. Last year there were 365 cases, and in 1967 there were 761 cases. Every year, from 1956 up to this year, there have been deaths, varying from one to 13 a year. Therefore, this is still a danger to health, and this danger increases in years when we have good rains, irrespective of the combative measures we take. I want to give those areas and the country the assurance that officially we shall do everything possible to combat this disease. It is my intention to pay a personal visit to that entire area during the recess, and also to the world famous Anecke Institute at Tzaneen, and, in conjunction with our scientists, also to place every aspect of malaria, including our method and technique of combating it, under the magnifying-glass once again, and possibly to effect improvements or apply the method of combating it on a larger scale. Furthermore, I gave my colleague the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development the undertaking that I would have an interview with his branch committee of the National Party and even hold a public meeting, if necessary, in order to inform the public properly. Moreover, steps are being taken through the proper diplomatic channels for holding talks with our neighbours, Mozambique and Rhodesia, in an attempt to improve the position on our borders, which creates a real problem. I may also say that I shall also have talks with my colleagues the Minister of Transport, the Minister of Police and the Minister of the Interior in regard to this matter, which may also affect their departments. But now, in conclusion, I should like to make an appeal, a very serious appeal. This is, in the first place, that the Press and the inhabitants of endemic areas should not unnecessarily be involved emotionally in this matter, since experience has shown in recent times that this gives rise to reports nourishing disobligingness, definitely complicated the task of my department and does that area incalculable harm. In the second place, all inhabitants and visitors must take the necessary preventive tablets, which are available at any chemist without a prescription. In the third place, use must be made of the spraying of houses and huts with prolonged-action insecticides. This service is available free of charge and is provided by my department. I want to make a special appeal to Whites on farms who do not have their houses sprayed. In the fourth place, I should also like to make an appeal to my colleagues in medicine and in the hospitals to be scrupulous in future about reporting all cases of malaria.</p>

<p>Then there is a last point with which I want to deal. During the first week of May, as a result of talks between South Africa&#x2019;s representatives in Geneva and the DirectorGeneral of the World Health Organization, Dr. Candau, two world famous scientists came to South Africa and we allowed them to visit those areas, not only as guests, but also to show them everything which we could show and which they were keen to see. Fortunately they escaped the attention of the Press. They also paid me a courtesy visit, which, naturally, led to a discussion of the whole situation. I want to tell hon. members what these people said. What I am going to say now, I am saying with the permission of the Director-General of the World Health Organization. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the opinion of the representatives of the World Health Organization the methods of malaria control being applied in the Republic are in keeping with those recommended by the World Health Organization and which are being applied by many countries throughout the world. They also confirm our view that malaria in this area is hyperendemic and with the agro-economic development in the area and its associated population movement coupled with cyclic climatic conditions favourable to mosquito breeding, it will be essential to intensify all current efforts<span class="col_7261-7262" refersTo="page_0585"/> of control. This will inevitably result in increased expenditure.</block>

<p>Then I may just add that it has become apparent from the talks which were held last Friday, that the intensification of our methods will possibly require an additional amount of R250 000 during this year. Those talks will be held with the Treasury. This statement goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Furthermore, the World Health Organization&#x2019;s scientists are in agreement that large-scale larviciding in rural areas is not recommended on practical and economic grounds.</block>

<p>This is a reference to the larva control. It is not recommended, and consequently we do not do this, except in densely populated areas, where it is done by the local authorities. As hon. members know, we are not a member of the World Health Organization. However, we have nevertheless made contact in this scientific field, and it was agreed that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Technical communication on an informal basis between our scientists and their counterparts at the World Health Organization will be maintained and even expanded, not only on malaria but on other health problems of importance to the countries of Southern Africa.</block>

<p>I think that what we have done here is good work.</p>

<p>Then I want to say a few words about the Health Bill, which is receiving the attention of a Select Committee at the moment. I am doing this because there was dissatisfaction in many quarters, dissatisfaction about this Bill having been introduced and referred to a Select Committee without certain organizations having been consulted. Such a claim is based on ignorance, for this Bill was referred to a Select Committee before Second Reading. I would be pleased if the Chairman of the Committee and the officials concerned would take this opportunity to point out to all these organizations that the reference of this Bill to a Select Committee before Second Reading means that this is the method of consultation that would take place. After that my procedure will be as follows: When I receive the Bill back from the Select Committee, I shall, in accordance with an undertaking I have already given, consult with the Administrators of the four provinces as well as the Medical Council, which is always a pleasant task to me, and with other organizations, before I approach the Cabinet with this legislation and finally present it to this House. Furthermore, I understood from the chairman of the Committee that a tremendous number of memorandums, something like 56, had been received, and that it was virtually impossible to complete the work during this session. I want to say today that the Government has decided that if the Select Committee were to feel that it could not complete its business&#x2014; it seems to me as though this is going to be the case&#x2014;and were to request that this Select Committee be converted into a commission during the recess, the Government would consider it favourably. If that is done, it will be possible for us to introduce a Bill at the next session, be that an amended Bill or a totally new Bill.</p>

<p>Then hon. members, and particularly the hon. member for Fauresmith, mentioned the question of the training of medical practitioners. Let me say that the question of the training of medical practitioners is, of course, the responsibility of the Medical and Dental Council. I know that the Medical Council is at this moment giving positive attention to the question of whether doctors should perhaps be trained to a greater extent for the conditions of South Africa. I may also say that the question of assistance to doctors, that of persons who have not qualified as doctors but have in fact had a certain amount of training, was also discussed at the congress of the Medical Association held in the course of last year. I am very glad that the hon. member for Fauresmith said he was not agreeable to a second-class type of medical practitioner being created. I think this would be a retrograde step. The attitude we adopt in the department is that all medical practitioners must undergo ordinary basic training. If that training is changed, it is a task of the Medical Council in which we should not like to interfere. However, it is a good thing that this matter has been raised here so that they, too, may know that the public takes an interest and has certain ideas in this regard. Furthermore, the department is of the opinion that trained nurses at the clinics mentioned here by the hon. member for Houghton, and at other clinics, may relieve the medical practitioners and the hospitals, where they are constantly under the supervision of the medical practitioner, of a major<span class="col_7263-7264" refersTo="page_0586"/> burden of work. In this regard the hon. member for Umbilo said, &#x201C;We only have one in 2 000 doctors in South Africa for the European population and only one in 18 000 for the non-European people.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Are you repeating the figures?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I am repeating the figures. Now let me say to the hon. member that I do not think it is quite right to put it that way. I am not disputing the figures; they are more or less correct. However, I do not think we should use the word &#x201C;only&#x201D;, because I think South Africa has for its whole population a number of doctors available which is comparable to the best of any country which can be compared with South Africa. It is not &#x201C;only&#x201D; one in 2 000 and &#x201C;only&#x201D; one in 18 000. We are grateful that we are so progressive&#x2014;if I may use the word&#x2014;in the medical field that we have this number of doctors. He wanted to know from me whether I can make an estimate as to the shortage of doctors. I am afraid I cannot, because it would be a pure speculation and it will depend on the standards which one applies. In other words, we have no estimate at all; all we know is that this shortage which he indicated exists in our department, does in fact exist. I may also say that although there is a shortage, the services are being rendered on a session basis, in all these instances. In so far as indigence is concerned, where the district surgeon cannot do the work, private doctors are allowed and are remunerated on a session basis in these institutions.</p>

<p>* Reference was also made to the availability of doctors, especially by the hon. member for Cradock. He also expressed his concern about the fact that the rural areas had so few doctors. That is very true. I have here the February edition of the <i>South African Medical Journal,</i> which carries an advertisement which was placed by my department and in which no fewer than 70 posts for district surgeons in the rural areas are advertised. The over-concentration in the cities definitely creates a problem as well, for the reasons furnished by the hon. member. He said we had to have talks with the Medical Association. I want to tell the hon. member that this has already been done. We had a departmental committee under the chairmanship of Dr. Gilliland, the Director of Medical Services, who, in conjunction with the Medical Association, investigated the matter very thoroughly. They came forward with certain proposals. These proposals include improvements in regard to the circumstances of district surgeons. I have the particulars here, but I am not keen on furnishing them now as the matter still has to be discussed with the Treasury and one does not want to anticipate matters. However, I may say that the Remuneration Commission, which has just sat, has also made its contribution in the sense that the fees which doctors in the rural areas may levy for medical scheme cases, have now been put on a par with those in the cities. They have therefore helped in that regard. Then, as far as bursaries are concerned, I want to point out to the hon. member that bursaries are available to both White and non-White students. The Public Service provides bursaries worth R800 per annum for White students. This year 35 such bursaries were awarded to medical students. Therefore, the opportunity does exist, if people would only avail themselves of it. Opportunities also exist for Bantu and Coloureds, but I do not want to tire the House now with figures in this regard. As far as availability is concerned, I just want to point out to the House that it is tremendously expensive to train a doctor. The running costs involved amount to approximately R8 000 per annum. And this does not even include the capital expenditure. Therefore, the five medical schools which we have, together with the non-White school, really constitute a very big contribution on the part of the State towards the training of doctors. This is a tremendous expense to the State. I may just add that the position in our country is, of course, infinitely better than that in our neighbouring states. In fact, we are granting them assistance. Although we have a shortage, we are nevertheless helping them, because I think our neighbours ought to be helped.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Berea referred to the Snyman Report. The hon. member for Witbank quite rightly pointed out that one should see this Snyman Report in its totality, that one should not just extract certain of its recommendations. I should just briefly like to remind the hon. member&#x2014;I know that he knows about this&#x2014;that although this report is ten years old, a number of things have been done. The inception of the Drug Control Council and its activities, the Act on Medical Schemes, the Remuneration Commission and now also<span class="col_7265-7266" refersTo="page_0587"/> the rewriting of the Health Act are all matters which have come out of the Snyman Commission&#x2019;s report, recommendations which are now being implemented and are having the effect which we are seeing in our daily lives today.</p>

<p>*The question of sick funds was raised by several hon. members. Let me say that on 31st December, 1971, 247 sick funds were registered plus 5 Government funds, such as that of the Police and that of the Bureau of State Security, as well as 30 industrial funds. In round figures this means that approximately 80 per cent of our population are covered by medical insurance of some kind or another. This is a splendid situation. By whom is the remaining 20 per cent made up? It is made up of the very wealthy people of Houghton and other places, people who can look after themselves. It is also made up of pensioners and the indigent, whom we shall always have with us. I foresee that this 20 per cent will shrink in the future since the Medical Schemes Act specifically provides that when a person retires, or when his working days are terminated as a result of advanced age, poor health or other forms of disability, the sick fund has to retain him as a member if he wants to remain one. I am also pleased to be able to say that there are many employers who are contributing part of the membership fees to the sick fund, even in respect of pensioners. I want to recommend this. In 1971 there were 18 228 pensioners who were covered by medical schemes. In the past all those people would have been dependent upon the State. It is calculated &#x2014;this is a rough calculation&#x2014;that on an average 12 per cent of the members of schemes will be pensioners in the future, although at the mines this figure is already 20 per cent at the moment. I am merely mentioning these figures to show that we should not speak so lightly of subsidies for sick funds. The hon. member for Bloemfontein East rightly, and very knowledgeably&#x2014;for he worked with these matters as the M.E.C. charged with hospital services &#x2014;indicated here that the State was already making a tremendous contribution to the hospitalization of sick fund patients as well. It may appear in future, with regard to those members of a sick fund who are pensioners, that the State will perhaps have to see, as its commitment diminishes, because they are members of sick funds at the moment, whether it can strengthen sick funds in their financial position by those means. However, this is something for the future, because we are here at the start of a development and do not know exactly what it is going to result in.</p>

<p>Then the question of hospital costs was also raised, especially in respect of private hospitals. I just want to emphasize what was said by the hon. member for Bloemfontein, namely that sick fund patients are not excluded from provincial hospitals. They are in fact admitted to them. I can speak from experience, for one of my relatives recently spent months in a provincial hospital. It is correct that the cost is R6 per day. The question of private hospitals was also mentioned. Private hospitals have received my attention for many years. In the first place, they are licensed by the provincial administrations, and not by the Department of Health. In the second place, last year already I had talks with all four of the Administrators on this matter. Furthermore, only recently I had a meeting with the various sick fund associations, and I told them that they should please come forward with recommendations and ideas in regard to hospital fees and the control over private institutions and private hospitals. I also had the Private Hospitals Association with me last year, and I very clearly brought to their notice the fact that, in the first place, there had been complaints and, in the second place, that one was worried about the fact that one new institution after the other was being established whilst beds were empty in the provincial hospitals and the private institutions made no contribution towards the training of nurses. I also said I thought they were competing unfairly with us and the provincial administrations. In this regard I do want to put matters into perspective as well. The hon. member for Rosettenville, who apologized for his absence, read out here two cases of exhorbitantly high hospital costs. I am not calling these cases into question; in fact, I have one that is worse than those two, but one should at least retain one&#x2019;s perspective and state the average or general. We made a random test in regard to medical schemes and found the following: Of the moneys paid out by them during the course of a specific year, 45,7 per cent went to medical practitioners, i.e. private doctors, specialists and super specialists, 14,5 per cent went towards dental services; 17,7 per cent went towards medicine, and strangely enough, only 13,3 per cent went towards hospitalization. In other words, this is a fair-sized factor but not a tremendous<span class="col_7267-7268" refersTo="page_0588"/> one in the expenditure of our sick funds. I want to give hon. members the assurance, as I also indicated, that this matter is under consideration.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point is looking at me because he raised this question too. It is not only a question of perhaps pegging the fees of private institutions and private hospitals, but also the classification. I do not have the classification of hospitals in mind as we have in mind with hotels at all. There will have to be some classification, however, perhaps an A or B class or classes I or II. This matter is rather involved. Perhaps, when I have the views of the medical schemes, of the Administrators and of the private hospital associations, the correct step would be to appoint a commission to look into this matter; because it has very many facets.</p>

<p>The hon. member also mentioned the question of the rendering of accounts, and the problems encountered in that way. I will certainly bring this to the attention of the Central Council for Medical Schemes, because I have an idea that they might by regulation be able to regulate this, if not by regulation, then certainly by other means.</p>

<p>*Then, Sir, the question of the high cost of medicine was mentioned. I do not want to say that medicine is not expensive today, but I think we should be a little careful not to over-emphasize it. The cost is high and it is still rising.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>What is the reason for the price increase?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall come to that in a moment. This applies not only to medicine, but also to other services. Now let me tell you at once that this is because much of the work is not done by part-time or full-time people, but by private doctors on the basis of the tariff. In the main that is the reason for that increase to which you referred. But at the same time I do want to say that medicine is infinitely more effective today than before. After all, today the position is that disease can be controlled by a patient taking one or two capsules, whereupon that person can return to everyday life. We are grateful for that, but then we must also realize that it costs money.</p>

<p>In the second place, I want to draw the attention of hon. members to the fact that all the less well-off people in our country, of whatever colour, are entitled to free medicine, either from the district surgeon, or from our provincial hospitals, or from our clinics. In other words, there ought not to be a single less well-off person who need pay for medicines out of his own pocket, unless the choice is his. It is true that they have to go and wait in a queue or that they may perhaps not receive immediate attention, but that happens in the case of all things. In fact, yesterday the hon. member for Walmer quite rightly said here that as a private patient he had to wait three months before he could get an appointment at the dentist. So I want to say that it is not only the less well-off people who have to wait at times&#x2014;it is also those who pay who have to wait because we have a manpower shortage. As far as control over prices is concerned, I may add that the Department of Health has no powers whatsoever. That is in the hands of the Department of Commerce. There is also a sub-committee of the Cabinet which gives specific attention to the prices of various articles. Medicine is included in those articles.</p>

<p>Let me just give a few reasons why the cost of medicine is fairly high. The chemists are not the cause of it, because the fees of the chemists are laid down, i.e. 40 cents per item dispensed by them. So that is not the big problem. But from statistics it appears that approximately 5 000 new remedies have to be tested and retested over a period of years before one finds two to five that are really useful. In other words, the research work in this regard is enormous. Moreover, the average period for which such medicines remain on the market before they are replaced, is only eight to ten years. There is no sales duty whatsoever on medicine. As regards import duty, the practice has always been for some duty to be levied, especially as far as raw materials are concerned, because it is so difficult to determine whether all the raw material is going to be used up for medicine. Take olive oil, which is used in many medicines. It is quite impossible to determine how much of the olive oil is used solely for medicinal purposes. But now I also want to say that the Treasury extended an invitation in the Other Place for proposals to be submitted with a view to seeing whether some relief in the sphere of import duty could not be given.</p>

<p><span class="col_7269-7270" refersTo="page_0589"/>As far as raw material is concerned, I should like to give hon. members a few interesting details. They will realize that we have no control. The hon. member for Witbank spoke about local production and also mentioned the factory at Witbank. Of course, it is our policy that as much local production as possible should take place. However, we have no control over raw materials. Now I just want to give a few examples. The price of ascorbic acid (vitamin C), which we all know, increased by 23 per cent from 1969 to 1970. From last year to this year, the price increased by 111 per cent, and we have no control over that. I shall give hon. members another example, i.e. that of Jamaica ginger, which we all know. The price of Jamaica ginger increased by 100,14 per cent from 1969 to 1970. This year, on the other hand, the price decreased by 30 per cent. In the case of penicillin, there was an increase of 27 per cent last year and of 4 per cent this year. In the case of sulfadiazine the price increased by 40 per cent last year and it has just increased by another 18 per cent. I think hon. members will grant me that no Government has any control whatsoever over the prices of those raw materials in countries abroad. We are completely at their mercy. Now I may also add that the whole position fluctuates. I have here a full table of 55 materials, and there are also decreases among them. Here, for example, is a decrease of 42 per cent. I also see the figure of minus 29 per cent. In other words, prices fluctuate. The highest increase in one year was 156 per cent in respect of some raw material or other.</p>

<p>I now come to a final point in connection with medicine. It was said here that in the case of one type of medicine we sometimes had 10 different brands. This is a matter which one has to handle with great circumspection, because everything should be available to the patient. It is at the discretion of the doctor. If we were to impose restrictions, the question would arise as to who was to do so. Secondly, a monopoly might be created. In other words, this is a very delicate matter. But what I do want to say, is that the sick funds may not withhold anything from a patient which he has to have. However, the sick funds may, in consultation with their doctors, indicate, as the Railways are doing, with no disadvantage to the patient, that certain preparations are available, and that others are not, because they are the same. I want to encourage and recommend this practice.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Newcastle made a very practical suggestion. I think if one takes note of that suggestion, it will make an enormous contribution. This suggestion is simply that our doctors should make it their objective to prescribe smaller quantities of medicine. The patient may not be denied anything; I want to emphasize this once again. But I do think a smaller quantity should be prescribed so that these medicines will not be left on our shelves, as the hon. member rightly indicated they were. I think this is a very sound and practical suggestion.</p>

<p>Then, as far as pharmacy is concerned, just the following: There was a request from the pharmaceutical profession, a request circulated to every member, that the profession should be a closed one for pharmacists and druggists. I had an interview with them; they felt very strongly about the matter. The Prime Minister also had an interview with them. But before the Prime Minister had an interview with them, the Cabinet had considered the matter. The Cabinet decided, after everything had been taken into account, that this was not the right time to do so, particularly in view of the high cost of medicine. The Prime Minister, in the interview he had with them, indicated to them that if both sides of this House supported this matter, he would be prepared to have the matter reconsidered by the Cabinet. There is a very simple reason, actually a political reason, why he said that. The reason is that there is always some huckstering with the high cost of medicine, and if our friends on the opposite side get any kind of chance, they say it is the Government&#x2019;s fault. If they were to support this measure and if they were to refrain from saying that it was the Government&#x2019;s fault that the prices of medicine were even higher on account of this measure, then our pharmaceutical profession would have an opportunity of possibly having this position rectified. Personally I agree with their request, because they are a professional group.</p>

<p>As far as dental services are concerned, the hon. member for Walmer mentioned the problems of his constitency. Let me tell him at once that I am not satisfied with the situation as regards dental services in South Africa. We have an enormous shortage of dentists. The problem is that they have to study for 5 years, whereas<span class="col_7271-7272" refersTo="page_0590"/> that period is 6 years in medicine, and for that reason medicine is more popular than dentistry, although dentistry is a fine profession which also holds out good financial prospects. Since 1919 not a single dentist has, as far as I know, been on the staff of the Department of Health. It has never been laid down precisely where the responsibility belongs. Then came the report of the De Villiers Commission, and with one or two exceptions the Government accepted its recommendations as a whole. What were those recommendations? The first one was that the responsibility should rest in the hands of the Department of Health, in the hands of the State.</p>

<p>The second recommendation was the creation of oral hygienists, who will be another pair of hands for the dentist. A start has been made with the training of these people, and they will be registered by the South African Medical and Dental Council. Then there was a third recommendation, and that is that there should be dental assistants, especially in our Bantu homelands. This matter is still under consideration by the Medical and Dental Council because, after all, they will be the people to compile the curricula, conduct the examinations and register these people. We feel in the department that if we could have these dental assistants and if they could operate under the supervision of either a dentist or a doctor, they could be of great help, especially in our Bantu homelands, and I hope that the Medical Council will be able to give us some answer in the near future.</p>

<p>The other matter, of course, is the training of dentists, and I can assure the hon. member that as far as the Bantu are concerned, we have grave doubts whether the students are available at the moment. We think the students may be available as far as the Coloureds are concerned. As far as his own constituency is concerned, the facts that he gave are more or less correct. I am perturbed about the situation in Port Elizabeth. I was unaware of it until he raised the matter here. Prof. Dodds, who is the first person ever to have been appointed in the Department of Health as a dentist&#x2014;he was previously professor at the University of the Witwatersrand&#x2014;has already been in Port Elizabeth and has made certain recommendations. I have also asked my Director of Medical Services to give his personal attention to this matter in Port Elizabeth. I would like to say to the hon. member that he must not have too high hopes, because at most we can provide a service for acute cases, for the extraction of teeth; a prophylactic service is just not possible at this stage. We are doing a certain amount of prophylactic work as far as Coloured schoolchildren are concerned in Port Elizabeth, but that is as far as we can go because of the staff position.</p>

<p>Sir, I am inclined to take notice when ladies speak to me.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for North Rand delivered a fine and neat speech here on a matter which is of the utmost importance, i.e. family planning. His view is correct; his approach is perfectly correct. The hon. member referred to the enormous increase in the amount which is being voted here, i.e. from R290 000 last year to R1 650 000 this year. Let me just tell him that this is in respect of all races. To a certain extent this increase is linked up with the injection which has become available now and which is fairly expensive. I think it costs approximately R1 or 85 cents. This injection is being used to an increasing extent. This is a voluntary service. But we in the department have accepted full responsibility. A director of Demographic Planning, Dr. Roux, who is directly responsible to the Secretary and<span class="col_7273-7274" refersTo="page_0591"/> to myself, is in charge. He has already been in contact with all the provinces, the local authorities and agricultural unions, etc., and matters are now beginning to go reasonably well. I just want to say that the provinces are co-operating nicely. They will also be able to appoint a doctor, who will be in charge of family planning, to their establishment under their director of medical services, and we are, with the approval of the Treasury, prepared to pay his salary. We are also using films, etc., for bringing the matter to the attention of the public. Sir, one of the words the hon. member used was the wrong one; we should do nothing drastic as far as family planning is concerned. When one is dealing with family planning, one does not do drastic things, because it is a question of persuasion. I think it may possibly have been a slip of the tongue on the part of the hon. member. He also suggested that a conference should be called. I do not think that is necessary. We are fully conversant with what is going on in the world. As a matter of fact, last year we attended a conference and at the end of last year we also had a symposium in Pretoria which had been arranged by the Medical Association. But I am grateful to the hon. member for having raised the matter in such a responsible manner here, and I may give him the assurance that as far as all races are concerned, we are giving attention to this matter in a very responsible manner.</p>

<p>Are these not the figures given in Hansard?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, they are not only not the figures given in Hansard but they are wrong. I will read out exactly what stands in Hansard and then the hon. member can judge for himself. He either completely misread it, he did not understand the reply, or there was some mischievousness on his part. It is either one of the two because I dealt with two completely different sets of facts. In the one case I dealt with what we thought was the actual shortage and in the other case I dealt with the waiting list. Now let us see what I said in 1969. The question was asked by Mr. Wood (Hansard, Vol. 25, Col. 343):</p>

<block name="quote">What was the estimated shortage of houses for White, Coloured, Indian and Bantu persons respectively in each of the provinces on 31st December, 1968, and how many houses were made available for occupation &#x2026;</block>

<p>My reply was as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">As mentioned by the State President in his opening address, no general housing need worth mentioning exists in the country. My Department&#x2019;s estimates in respect of the demand for dwellings for the persons who qualify for housing, financed out of the National Housing Fund, as based on projections made by demographs, waiting lists at local authorities and the Department&#x2019;s regional offices, and particulars furnished by the local authorities, are as follows &#x2026;</block>

<p>And then I gave the figures and it amounted, as far as Whites were concerned, to 4 680. But what did I say in 1972?</p>

<p>*It has absolutely nothing to do with the extent of the housing shortage. It concerns something completely different. It concerns the waiting-lists. Then Mr. Hourquebie put the question to me:</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) How many persons in each race group are on the waiting-lists for economic and sub-economic housing respectively in (i) each of the main centres and (ii) in the rest of the Republic, and (b) when is it anticipated that housing will be made available to the persons in each of these categories?</li>

</ol>

<p>Then I divulged the waiting-lists, but added:</p>

<block name="quote">Housing is made available every year according to demand. It must however be mentioned that the above-mentioned figures &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is the figure of 12 000 he obtained only for Whites, in respect of whom there was a shortage:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; that the above-mentioned figures represent waiting-lists kept by both the Department and the local authorities and that duplication of waiting-lists is general. It is an absolutely impossible task to arrive at a logical conclusion in connection with housing needs by merely taking the sum total of the waiting-list into account.</block>

<p>Why did the hon. member not add that when he said that I had said there was a need for 23 000 houses in 1972? Why did he not add that I did not say there was a need for 23 000 houses but that there was a waiting list of 23 000? And, I especially went out of my way to say that you cannot rely on the waiting lists:</p>

<block name="quote">Not only does a waiting list soon become obsolete but it has been my Department&#x2019;s experience over a long period of time that applicants usually have their names added to the Department&#x2019;s list as well as the list of all the local authorities in the vicinity, which naturally brings about large scale duplication of applications. Many also have their names added to lists at the same body, for example the local authority, for renting as well as for purchasing a dwelling. Many persons who are well housed but who for financial or various other reasons require other, or less expensive housing, or wish to reside in another vicinity also place their names on the waiting lists.</block>

<p>And then I mentioned this example, and the hon. member for Green Point says that I said this was the shortage of housing. Then I mentioned this example:</p>

<block name="quote">A special inquiry in the case of Kimberley has brought to light that although600 names appear on the waiting list,<span class="col_7277-7278" refersTo="page_0593"/> the actual housing shortage can, at the most, be 100.</block>

<p>How dare he say that I said there was a shortage of 23 000 houses for Whites in 1972, when I said specifically that it was a waiting list and. that you cannot rely on a waiting list? And I mentioned the case of Kimberley where there was a waiting list of 600 and where we know that the shortage is only 100. But no, Sir, he comes along and says that I said the position deteriorated from 1969 to 1972 from 4 800 to 12 100 houses.</p>

<p>*Sir, I think either the hon. member did not mean what he said or he misread the two replies completely. But the fact of the matter is that he charged me here with something which is totally and utterly incorrect.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>He will reply.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>He may reply with the greatest of pleasure. But I think he at least owes me an apology, because in the one case I spoke of what our people had estimated the shortage of housing to be and in the other case I spoke of something completely different, namely the waitinglists. In my reply to that question I indicated that the waiting-lists were unreliable.</p>

<p>No, I think the hon. member did me and this House an injustice. I have a high regard for him and expect that he will rectify this matter, that he will rectify it completely and that he will do what is expected of a man in his position.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I have the privilege of the half-hour? The hon. the Minister has raised an issue on certain figures which I quoted from answers given in this House to questions in regard to the housing shortage. In the course of the time which is available, we shall give chapter and verse to the hon. the Minister to show that, although he now wants to say with a wave of the hand the waiting lists mean nothing and that they must be regarded as presenting purely fictitious figures, there is a serious shortage of housing in South Africa and we shall also indicate how serious that shortage is. I do not propose to give them at this moment, but this side will give the hon. the Minister the figures on which we base our accusation. I want to say at the outset that it is with regret that we again meet to discuss Community Development with an out-ofdate report. The report which we have before us is the report for the period ending on 31st December, 1970. We must therefore deal with the facts as we have them on the 31st December, 1970, and supplemented by answers to questions. I want to say at the outset of this debate that we on this side of the House wish to reiterate what we have said before during this session and what we said during previous sessions, namely that we are not satisfied that the hon. the Minister is in fact discharging satisfactorily the responsibility of providing housing in South Africa. Despite the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s bland assurances from time to time that there are no housing difficulties, those housing difficulties exist and they exist, it is true, in various degrees of urgency between different classes of people. In the course of this debate we shall place those facts before the Committee and we trust that the hon. the Minister will give his attention to those facts when they are place before him.</p>

<p>One of the problems with which we are faced at the moment is the long delay on the part of the hon. the Minister in acceding to a request for an inquiry into the Rents Act. Thank goodness that inquiry is at present being conducted. I believe that the commission of inquiry is working expeditiously. I want to say how much the country appreciates the manner in which the inquiry is being conducted and I am sure that the hon. the Minister will receive a report very shortly. I want to appeal to him right at the outset to make the report of that commission known to the public as soon as possible, coupled with the Government&#x2019;s decisions as to which, if any, of the recommendations of the commission it is going to adopt. I ask the hon. the Minister not to wait until the next session of Parliament because a revival of the tempo of the construction of dwellings, be they flats or houses, takes time and every month that can be used to revive confidence in the public sector to build letting units and selling units will be to the benefit of the country. In the interest of the country I hope that the hon. the Minister will make that report known as soon as possible and that he will also make known which recommendations the Government proposes to implement.</p>

<p>Then there is the second urgent matter which still remains. That is the question of the resettlement of disqualified persons under the Group Areas Act. Other<span class="col_7279-7280" refersTo="page_0594"/> speakers will refer to the numbers, but I wish to say that there are large numbers, many thousands. With this backlog in the resettlement of these people, each of those families is condemned to a life of uncertainty, whatever race they may belong to. When are they going to be moved; what must they do in their present abodes; must money be spent on repairing and maintaining; to what community and into what community will they ultimately be transplanted? The numbers of those who are waiting will once again be made known during the course of this debate. What is concerning us are the conflicting statements which the hon. the Minister and the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs make in regard to the compulsory removal of disqualified persons who own the properties in which they are now living. I have asked the hon. the Minister of Community Development twice during this session to say whether he agrees with the statement which has been made by the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs, and to say that he will adopt that statement of policy in regard to the removal of disqualified persons in so far as his department is concerned. One of the major concerns of the Niemand Commission still remains unsolved.</p>

<p>That is the difficulty of the price of land. I think the hon. the Minister owes it to the country to say what he intends doing in this connection. Group areas legislation as applied by this Government has done nothing to bring down the price of land. In fact, it has had the contrary effect. Property in areas which have been vacated by disqualified persons, has become the harvesting ground for amateur property developers. The prices have gone up as far as those properties are concerned. Many of them were exempted from the provisions of the Rents Act by this hon. Minister because they say that these are restored to their old pristine glory, whatever it might have been. Displaced persons wishing to purchase property in areas where they are qualified to purchase, and persons who are able to buy property&#x2014;like our non-White people&#x2014;are being held up to ransom because of the prices in those areas. I want to tell the hon. the Minister of a case which I came across only this week. In the Cape Peninsula there is the Rylands area set aside for Indians. Many Indians would like to buy their own property and build their own houses. Many of them want to settle there in the area which has been set aside for them. Does the hon. Minister know that property, vacant land, in the Rylands Estate is changing hands at the price of R1 per square foot? That price is in excess of the best land which can be purchased in Constantia. The Indians have nowhere else to buy. This particular person concerned is in a position that he wants a home and that he wants his family with him. The only place where he can buy is Rylands, and that is the price he has to pay on the open market. I believe the department is contributing not in Rylands only, but in general, to the increase in the price of land. I believe this department must look to shedding itself of its vast property ownings, many of which they have held for a long time.</p>

<p>At the end of the last session, or rather after the end of the session, I had drawn to my attention certain purchases of property in the vicinity of Cape Town by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department. The hon. the Minister took me to task for not raising it during the debate. I referred to the property purchased at Blaauwberg for an amount of approximately R750 000. The hon. the Minister and the Press took me to task for not raising it during the debate. I did not raise it because I was unaware of it at the time the debate took place. Be that as it may, the department purchased a strand area at Blaauwberg for a sum of R731 000. It is an area of ground which the Minister said was a reasonable purchase at a reasonable price. When he was asked about this purchase, he said that the price was reasonable, and that he had bought this property in order that it could be sub-divided. He in fact made the following statement and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We refused to sell because we want the land for much-needed housing development. Once we have supplied all the services for the housing scheme, we shall be selling 8 000 to 10 000 square feet stands for between R900 and R1 000 per stand. Similar stands in the vinicity developed by private companies are selling apparently between R5 000 and R6 000.</block>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Minister when this 1 000 odd morgen was acquired by his department from the seller, Mr. Visser. How many of those plots have been made available to individual purchasers? While that 1 000 morgen is being kept by the department, demand for ground in that vicinity goes on and the prices of the private developers are going up and up. I<span class="col_7281-7282" refersTo="page_0595"/> should say that the number of plots from this area of land should certainly run into several thousands. If the hon. the Minister will make these plots available on the basis he said, he will immediately be doing a great service towards bringing down the land prices in the Cape Peninsula area. This is not the only place where the Community Development Board owns property of this sort. Is the board finding that it is itself in the stranglehold in which property developers find themselves, namely that they cannot get on and get townships approved and completed within a reasonable length of time? Or is it that the department has become too much of a property owning department without the ability of being able to quickly transfer areas of this sort into saleable building plots to individual purchasers? I hope that the hon. the Minister will be able to tell us to what extent there has been progress with this investment of three-quarters of a million rand in property. The non-availability of this ground for development is, as I have said, one of the greatest contributing factors to high land prices in the vicinity.</p>

<p>I should like to deal with one other matter, namely the repetitive manner in which we find difficulties arising between the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department, or boards which fall under him, and local authorities. The hon. the Minister will recall the differences that existed with Stellenbosch Municipality over a period of time, which led to some acrimony between the hon. the Minister and members of the Stellenbosch local authority. Similar differences have arisen and have been ironed out over a time, I will concede, by tactful handling, between the department and other local authorities. I will not discuss the contretemps between the Minister and members of the Pretoria local authority. I want to say that as long as there is a feeling of strain between local authorities and the hon. the Minister, neither will succeed in getting anywhere in solving housing problems in South Africa.</p>

<p>Let me refer to a matter which occurred in Mossel Bay. This is a most extraordinary state of affairs. Towards the end of 1969 the Mossel Bay Municipality with the assistance of the National Housing Commission decided to build 89 dwellings for Whites. They obtained a tender price in 1969 to build these houses. In September, 1971, the council decided that it had a need for a further 100 dwellings for White people in Mossel Bay. It approached the tenderer who was building at the 1969 prices and he said that he would do an extra 100 houses at that same tender price. When the council found itself in this position, it immediately contacted the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s regional representatives and others and said that it was very lucky to receive such an offer and asked whether it could proceed to provide those extra houses. On the 29th November, 1971, the municipality received a telegram informing them that they could continue with this particular project. Eventually, on the 3rd December, the municipality received a letter from the regional representative in Port Elizabeth addressed to the Town Clerk in which reference is made to the economic housing letting-sale scheme for Whites. He referred to the letter of 20th September and said the following: &#x201C;Die Nasionale Behuisingskommissie het besluit &#x2026;&#x201D; The details about the advances and payments, etc., were set out in that letter in order to get on with the job. On 29th November this was confirmed in a telegram. On 19th February the Department of Community Development in Pretoria, writing in regard to the housing schemes for 1972-&#x2019;73, sent a letter to the Town Clerk of Mossel Bay including the amount for the additional houses and asking what draws will be required in June, September, December and March of the following year in regard to this particular work. Immediately after that telegraphic instruction comes cancelling the approval. When he was approached, the hon. the Minister informed the Press that &#x201C;die kennisgewing van die toewysing van die R300 000 is per abuis deur &#x2019;n junior beampte op 15 Februarie 1972 aan die stadsklerk gepos&#x201D;. What in fact happened was that the chairman of the Nationalist Party in Mossel Bay went to visit the Minister, or his department. He went up there and said that he thought that was wrong and that they should call for new tenders. Somebody in the department thought that this was a very good idea seeing it came from the chairman of the Nationalist Party at Mossel Bay. A letter cancelling the arrangements was therefore sent out saying that a junior clerk approved of it. How can this happen? Does the hon. the Minister really wish the country to believe that a junior clerk will deal with correspondence of this nature and write on behalf of the National Housing Commission from two different offices, viz., from the regional office in Port Elizabeth and from his own office in Pretoria? No, this nonsense does<span class="col_7283-7284" refersTo="page_0596"/> not wash with the public. This nonsense does not wash, and when one finds that this is the type of thing going on one is not surprised when one finds all the Police investigations that have to be made into various activities in the Minister&#x2019;s department resulting from officials acting irregularly. Where is the control and the direction at the top of affairs? I believe that when one has a municipality such as that of Mossel Bay doing its utmost in trying to solve a housing problem, it is unjust and unfair to the people in that area that they should be meted out with this treatment from the Minister. I might say that the Minister used his usual strong but polite language in telling the Press what he thought about those who were agitating about this particular action of his department.</p>

<p>I want to leave that and go on to another matter. We had an interesting discussion earlier this session when the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education indicated a change in policy in so far as Bantu bringing their wives into the cities are concerned. They could bring them if housing was available. There resorts under the Minister for Community Development a body called the Bantu Housing Board. The names of its members appear annually in the report and provision is made in the Revenue Estimates for an amount to cover allowances payable to those members who are not public servants. The report is completely silent as to what has been done by this Housing Board. From the schedules for the last few years I have compared, it appears that funds are being made available to the Bantu Housing Board at an economic rate of interest over the years. For the years 1965 to 1970 a total of some R37 million was made available, bringing the total up to R182 million in all. For sub-economic housing, that is the f and 3 per cent, the amounts have in fact been reduced between 1965 and 1970. There have been repayments and there is a lesser figure owing now, or invested in this subeconomic category than in 1965. When one comes to the grants for sub-economic housing to utility companies&#x2014;that is at a 1/20th per cent to enable the provision of real sub-economic housing&#x2014;I can find nothing having been advanced in the last seven or eight years to the Bantu Housing Board. What work in fact is this board doing? Or are all local authorities now being left to find other means to finance the housing of the increasing numbers of Bantu who are now within White local authority areas? I want to know what is the responsibility of this hon. Minister to provide housing for Bantu so that the policy of the hon. the Deputy Minister can be put into force and housing can be provided for these Bantu now to bring their wives with them when they take up jobs in the White areas. This is the responsibility of this Minister and I hope he will deal with it and tell us what supervision he does have over the Bantu Housing Board.</p>

<p>Coming to the question of Coloured housing, I want to be very brief with the hon. the Minister in asking him, when he replies, to tell us what he is doing in regard to the resolution passed by the Coloured Representative Council which has been referred to him. For his information and reference, I now refer to the statement issued by the Department of Information, dated 18th April, 1972, in which certain resolutions of the Coloured Representative Council were referred to this department. I want to deal with these items and read them quickly for the record. I hope the hon. the Minister will be good enough to deal with them. They read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>4.

<ol>

<li>(a) Coloured housing throughout the Republic of South Africa and the possibility that tenants of sub-economic houses be allowed to purchase such houses at erection cost plus a nominal rate of interest;</li>

<li>(b) the provision of suitable housing for Coloured public servants, teachers, members of the Police Force and prison services and the postal services where such need exists;</li>

<li>(c) involvement of disqualified persons in business interests in Coloured areas; and</li>

<li>(d) the protection of all places of worship in as far as such places may be affected by the Group Areas Act.</li>

</ol>

</li>

</ol>

<p>These are matters which concern the Coloured people and which I think the hon. the Minister can make a statement about in this House as to what he believes should and can be done in that regard.</p>

<p>In the few moments left to me, I want to turn to the question of White housing. The<span class="col_7285-7286" refersTo="page_0597"/> hon. the Minister knows and can accept it that we on this side of the House will support any steps which we believe and conceive will alleviate the housing needs in this country. The hon. the Minister has himself stressed the enormity of the task which is before him when he said on many public occasions that between now and the end of this century we will have to build as many houses as were built in South Africa from the time of Van Riebeeck landing up to 1972. That is the enormity of the task. We do not believe that the progress is sufficient to meet that challenge and that we are getting to grips with the problem of housing. There has been alleviation in some directions. I will concede that to the hon. the Minister. There has been some alleviation. There is less of a pressure in some directions than there is in others. But the efforts are too timid and too halting. I believe that more money must be made available from building societies and attracted to building societies. This nonsense of pegging the maximum number of loans at R15 000 must stop. It is not dealing with the problem. It should be more realistic, for example, at a figure of R25 000. The home savings plan which has now been introduced, a plan which was originally mooted by the hon. member for Parktown in this House, has its limitations. What happens? With the present higher rental costs faced by young couples, how are they going to find the money to save to really get this nest-egg which will eventually enable them to buy? Unless, of course, a man is wise enough to start saving before he marries. One wonders how many of us thought of that when we were young, and how many of the modern youth will do it. This plan is going to be of limited help. A man is paying for a modest flat R90 per month, and he must be earning less than R5 000. He is going to have very little money to put aside if he is married with a child, to benefit by this saving scheme. But this Government can help by reducing the direct cost of acquiring homes. I have pleaded, and I will go on pleading to every Minister that I can speak to in this House, with your permission, Sir, under their Votes, to see to it that the cost of transfer, the stamp duty and the transfer duty are reduced, and that there is a tax rebate on persons who are paying for their homes. I believe that this Minister can do a tremendous job if he were to authorize building societies to lend money on interest and minimum capital redemption over the first five or ten years while a young man is settling down in his business, with increasing repayments rates as he gets on in the world. The money he still pays back in 15 years; but you are enabling him to settle down; you are helping families to settle in homes. I believe also that this Minister can well look at the policies which have been adopted. I believe that the Conservative Government in Britain has been able to break the problem created by the Labour Government by allowing people to hire properties and then to buy later, and to buy them at the price at which they were built or when they went in as tenants. Those schemes can be put into operation. These are approaches which I believe are necessary now in South Africa in the interests of the young people of South Africa, and which are not even beyond the capabilities of the hon. the Minister of Community Development. They can be brought into operation. He has taken advice in other matters, and he can be assured that we on this side of the House are just as concerned as any person on that side of the House&#x2014;although some of them appear sometimes to be indifferent&#x2014; to see to it that adequate housing is made available for the young people in South Africa, particularly the young people who are to produce the know-how, the knowledge and the drive to the development of South Africa. Those are our young men who are in business and in the various trades and industries. I want to appeal to the Minister to look realistically at these problems and to accept some of these recommendations which we make. We will give him the support from this side of the House to see to it that this problem is really solved, or that we can see the light of day beyond to what is now an insurmountable problem in South Africa.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cruywagen">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. A. CRUYWAGEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the short time at one&#x2019;s disposal, one cannot even remotely try to reply to all the matters which the hon. member for Green Point raised in his speech. I jotted down only a few of them, and he touched upon approximately eight major subjects.</p>

<p>I just want to refer to one or two of them. The first is the question of the waiting lists. Waiting lists are an aid for determining certain needs. One cannot rely on the information on the waiting list, but neither can one, as the hon. member said a moment ago, simply discard the waiting list.<span class="col_7287-7288" refersTo="page_0598"/> It is an aid for helping one to determine needs.</p>

<p>I want to refer to what the hon. member asked in regard to the investigation into the Rents Act. All of us are probably eager for that commission to publish its report. But I wonder whether the hon. member really believes that once we have eliminated the problems in regard to the Rents Act, there will in fact be so much new accommodation available for renting.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>I said it would give it impetus.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cruywagen">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. A. CRUYWAGEN</person>:</from>

<p>That may be so, but I think we place too much emphasis on the Rents Act laying down too many restrictions in the provision of new accommodation; that it does give rise to problems, is true.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member referred to the struggle between the department and certain local authorities. I think the hon. member mentioned three, namely Stellenbosch, Pretoria, and a more extensive case, Mossel Bay. Those cases probably occur. Unfortunately I have been unable to find it in this report, but somewhere in the report there is a reference to the good co-operation between the department and most local authorities. In the same way as the hon. member mentioned those three cases where there possibly was tension and friction, one can probably multiply the cases where there has been excellent and sincere co-operation between the department and the various local authorities and where good work has been done.</p>

<p>Next I should like to refer what the hon. member said in regard to the provision of White housing. We on this side of the House are probably as concerned as those hon. gentlemen about the provision of housing, especially for our young married couples, but I believe hon. members could help us more in this respect. Attention may be paid to certain of the aspects mentioned by the hon. member for Green Point. They cannot complain that this Minister does not pay attention to certain of their suggestions. He referred a few moments ago to one suggestion put forward by them which the Minister in fact accepted; we give them their due. We always listen to suggestions. The Minister and the department are prepared to investigate certain suggestions from that side. But then the hon. members also make a mistake, which I want to refer to now. The hon. member for Green Point said he wondered whether young people were going to save even before getting married, and said he did not think so. Why does the hon. member for Green Point not in fact encourage these people to start saving at that stage? Surely this is something good and positive which we may request of our young people. We should not say to them: &#x201C;Oh no, this plan of the Minister is not going to work. Do not save before you are married&#x201D;. Instead of that, we should encourage our young people much more positively.</p>

<p>I should just like to bring a few ideas to the attention of hon. members. I want to refer briefly to the provision of housing. Over the years, projections have been made of anticipated needs. For example, a projection was made that in 1980 the anticipated need would be approximately-&#x2014;I am simply quoting round figures now&#x2014;26 000 to 29 000 dwelling units, which would have to be provided by the department, and by private initiative and others. Now, if we examine in what way that need is being met, we find that, in 1970, for example, approximately <i>26</i> thousand dwelling units were in fact provided. Therefore, they are keeping abreast of the needs. If one examines the housing provided by the Commission and by the Community Development Board in 1971, one sees that their building programmes also kept abreast of this need. If we add to this the housing provided by private initiative, we see that they are keeping abreast of these needs reasonably well. But we must remember that this is not the only activity of the department. There are associated activities. For example, there is group areas resettlement, slum clearance and urban renewal, savings schemes such as the new one which has been announced, the subsidizing of interest, etc. All those matters enjoy the attention of the department. If we refer to these matters as well, and if we take into account the entire sphere of the department&#x2019;s activities, then we see that impressive progress has been made.</p>

<p>I want to refer to something else now. Apart from the fact that we must concern ourselves with meeting the immediate needs, we should also look at a few other important matters, a few spheres of development which are going to present themselves in the future. One of the matters I want to mention, is the tendency which has been revealing itself over many years, and which is<span class="col_7289-7290" refersTo="page_0599"/> in fact increasing in tempo, and that is the problem of urbanization. This is a process which is in fact increasing in tempo as a result of industrialization and several other factors. A calculation has been made that the White urban population was 3,3 million in 1970, but that by the year 2000 it would have increased to 6,6 million. If one wants to express this as a percentage, one must say that in 1970 87 per cent of the White population was concentrated in our cities and the expectation is that by the year 2000 approximately 92 per cent of our White population would be concentrated in the cities. Experience has taught us not to attempt preventing this growth of metropolitan areas. Experience in other parts of the world has taught that it is not really of any avail to do so. But, Sir, the crucial problem is not the growth of these large areas; ultimately, the crucial problem lies in the management of such large areas, and in the growth of management techniques which must be related to the physical growth of these areas. Sir, my time is actually too short to discuss this very important matter in detail, but the people concerned with the control and management of large urban complexes, must not have fixed development and planning patterns: they must continually reveal a measure of flexibility. Alternative programmes must always be evaluated, tested and selected, otherwise we may come to a dead end eventually in the development of the large cities. Someone once said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The urban crisis is therefore really a problem in management pure and simple &#x2014;a failure to match physical growth with institutional growth and the associated and sophisticated techniques and methods of management that such growth in size, diversity and complexity demands.</block>

<p>This is what is important, Sir, The residents of the large city, the department and all of us-&#x2014;the whole country&#x2014;would not be saddled with the burdens which arise from the problems of the metropolis if we could also keep abreast of the management techniques of the metropolis. Unfortunately the metropolis is going to create one problem for us, and that concerns the price of land. As urbanization and the need for more land in urban areas increase, the price of land in the metropolitan areas will rise and we may eventually have a price crisis in the metropolis. Ways of combating this problem is something to which we should pay attention continually, because our one important aim and task is that we must try to provide cheaper housing for the middle income group, because they are the people who flock to the metropolis in large numbers. We must give our urgent attention to this problem. But I shall not venture today to try to tell you exactly where the solution lies.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down, at the beginning of his speech, expressed his concern about housing, quite rightly, and I shall attempt to deal with that in the course of my speech.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. the Minister challenged my colleague, the hon. member for Green Point, about the correctness of certain figures. He mentioned that his list of figures, about which he says there is some confusion, dealt with waiting lists. Sir, I am not going to deal with actual waiting lists; I am going to deal with the official figures given by the Minister himself. I want to say at the outset, from my own experience, that the actual position is always a great deal worse than that reflected in the official waiting lists in the hands of the department, but that is not the department&#x2019;s fault. These waiting lists merely reflect the names of people who put their names on the list; they wait seven, eight, nine or 10 years for a house, and when it is not forthcoming they no longer bother to put their names on the list and they tell their friends that there is no point in doing so. Let us ignore waiting lists for the moment. Before I start, I would like to say that my criticism of the department&#x2014;and I want the Minister to understand this very clearly&#x2014;is not criticism of the staff of the department. I have criticized the staff in the past. My experience now, particularly in my own area, is that the Regional Director of the department is doing a wonderful job and the whole atmosphere in that area has changed as the result of the work he is doing. I would like in this House to record my appreciation to Mr. Immelman, who is in charge of the department in Durban. Having said that, I now want to get down to some more important matters. The first is this: I want to repeat what I have said every year since I have been in Parliament. That is that I call for an enquiry by a commission into the activities of the Department of Community Development. I have called for it each year and I intend to go on calling for it every year until my request is granted. I<span class="col_7291-7292" refersTo="page_0600"/> do not wish to go into individual cases in this debate. I have done so in the past. The Minister simply brushes them aside. All I would like to say in passing on this particular matter in regard to staff, is that there is no Government department which has had more of its staff investigated by the Police than the Department of Community Development.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, that is the Minister&#x2019;s standard reply to remarks in this House. All I ask him to do is to get up and tell me the number of members of his staff who have been prosecuted in the last ten years. I have the figures from Hansard, supplied by the Minister himself. But be that as it may, I want to say this to the Minister: I have run out of adjectives to describe the operations of his department. By that I mean the operations of the Government and of the Minister who happens to run this particular department, and whether it is this Minister or any other Minister the adjectives would remain the same. This is a matter about which I wish to warn the country. If the hon. Minister or any member on the Government side would care to get out of their Cadillacs and Buicks and pay visits to some of the ghettos he has established for Coloureds and Indians, they would soon see that the attitude of the people living in these ghettos towards the White race, has undergone a change in the last few years which is shocking in the extreme. I want to say this to the hon. the Minister, and I hope he takes notice of it, although I must admit it is a very remote hope. I want to tell South Africa that the threats of terrorism on our border will be as nothing compared to the frustration, the bitterness and the absolute dislike that the occupants of these particular townships now hold for the White race in South Africa. If the security of the White race is ever endangered in the next ten years, that danger will come from these particular townships under that Minister&#x2019;s control. That is why I believe that the country should know that what is happening in these townships must be seen to be believed. This is the Achilles&#x2019; heel of South Africa; all the laws and all the Police forces in the world will not stop it, but this Minister has the power in his hands to do so.</p>

<p>I shall deal with townships a little later on, but dealing directly with the housing shortage, I want to deal with it by using the Minister&#x2019;s own figures which appear in Hansard. First of all, on 9th February this year he gave the official shortage of housing, and I do not intend to quote the figures. The Minister knows them himself. A little later I asked what was necessary to provide for the population increase of each race group in South Africa, and the minister gave me certain figures. I then asked, in a series of questions, how many houses had been built over given periods, and some very interesting information came out of these figures. In the first instance, in the last five years in South Africa, we have built for the White race 140 000&#x2014;odd houses. This sounds like quite a lot of houses. This is what we built in the last five years, but in fact we are not even keeping pace with the number of houses required for the population increase. Turning then to Coloured houses, we need 16 346 houses to cater for the population increase each year. These are the Minister&#x2019;s figures. In the best year for building Coloured housing&#x2014;and this is when the department is running at full steam and there has been money available &#x2014;we built something like 14 000 houses against a population increase requirement of 16 000, so we are already 2 000 houses short just on the population increase. But it is worse than that. At present 20 000 Coloureds still have to be re-settled in terms of the Group Areas Act; 21 840 is the Minister&#x2019;s official figure for the housing shortage for Coloureds. I have done a calculation, and on this basis I want to tell the Minister&#x2014;and if he chooses to ignore it, I want to tell South Africa&#x2014;that by the end of the next five years, we will be short in South Africa of 114 000 houses for the three race groups. This ignores the fact, for instance, that we still have to remove 30 000-odd from District Six, if my memory serves me correctly, and 12 000 from Grey Street in Durban&#x2014;I will deal with those figures in a moment. To bring it down to actual figures, in 1971 the department, local authorities and private enterprise built 48 339 houses, according to the Minister&#x2019;s figures, but to cater for the population increase in 1971 we should have built 51 296 houses. So there already we were 3 000 houses short, just to cater for the population increase, let alone group area removals and the backlog which, on the Minister&#x2019;s official figures for Coloureds, for instance is 21 000. Some authorities in Cape Town have estimated that almost one-third of the Coloured population in Cape Town is not housed <span class="col_7293-7294" refersTo="page_0601"/>adequately anywhere. But looking at the Cape Town Coloureds alone, for the population increase over a period of five years, we should build 37 000 houses. In the last five years&#x2014;and this is with the department working at its peak and there has been money available&#x2014;we built 29 000 houses. So here we have a shortfall of 8 000. And there have been cut-backs by the department in view of the economic climate. In addition to that, of course, we have 30 000-odd, as I said, to remove in District Six. If one looks at the position in Durban itself, we built 29 000 houses in the last five years. But we should have built 47 000. In fact, in almost every single instance we are building fewer houses than are required on the Minister&#x2019;s own official figures, to cater for the population increase. Can the hon. the Minister get up, as he has done in the past, and say there is no housing shortage? But from these figures&#x2014;and the list is far too long for me to read here&#x2014;we must deduct a sum total of 8 218 dwelling units demolished with the authority of the department in the last five years. So whatever figure we have built, we have to take off 8 218 for the demolitions authorized by the department. Now I want to say this to the hon. the Minister, and I want to warn him once again, that at the end of the next five years, and certainly at the end of the next ten years, there are going to be teeming thousands of non-Whites, Coloureds and Indians&#x2014;because Bantu housing comes under another Minister and people better qualified &#x2026; [Time expired.]</p>

He says he lacks adjectives when he rises here. We are perfectly aware of that; he exaggerates everything he says and one cannot rely on the contribution he makes in this debate. He is one of the biggest sour-mouths on the opposite side of this House when it comes to this type of thing which he can exploit.

There was not a single urban area in South Africa which was not surrounded by messy, stinking slums. Who were the people who were responsible for that? Not this side of the House! There they are sitting! In 1934 they passed a Slums Act and they remained in power until 1948. Let an hon. member on that side rise to indicate one case to me in which they ever implemented the Slums Act in order to clear a single slum. [Interjections.] It is easy to say there were no slums, but what did it look like around Johannesburg? One did not dare go there!

<p>Large numbers of Coloureds are still leaving the rural areas in order to come and live in the cities. They are attracted by high wages. If they are on the farms, the farmers are held responsible for providing them with decent housing. However, as soon as they have come to the cities, housing then becomes a burden of the State and of the local authority. The employer pays little attention to it. I think it is high time that we reprimanded these people and told them that unless they did something for their employees in this regard, we would have to introduce legislation to compel them to fulfil their responsibility towards these people.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>No, I have too little time. The hon. member may make his speech in a moment, and I shall reply to it afterwards. I therefore want to say to the hon. the Minister that if employers do not want to make use of the facilities on a voluntary basis in order to accept their responsibility towards their employees in this way as well, the State will have to force them to do so.</p>

<p>I am not making this appeal only in respect of people who employ large numbers of Coloureds; I want to make an appeal today to employers of Whites as well to help their employees with housing, particularly newly married people in their service. If they helped these employees with housing, I am sure they would have people who would stay with them and be loyal to them. Then they could expect that employees would give their best.</p>

<p>The State spends tremendous amounts on housing in this country. It is a tremendous task; in the decade from 1961 to 1971 it cost the State R745 million to provide housing. State departments set the example today in that they provide their employees with housing. The Railways, which is the biggest employer in South Africa, provides housing for almost 50 per cent of its White employees. I think private initiative should also do its share in this regard. Over the past five years we have built 22 600 houses for Whites, 50 854 for Coloureds and 15 276 for Indians. It is a tremendous task and in addition we must bear in mind that the same department is responsible for the clearing up of slums in order to prevent old residential areas from becoming depressed. Furthermore, it has to resettle the thousands of families who have become disqualified as a result of the policy of separate group areas&#x2014;the hon. members opposite say they too support this policy. The resettlement task means that, because of the proclamation of group areas, no fewer than 118 000 families had to be resettled. Of these 118 000 families, 1600 were White families. It is a colossal task. If we want group areas, separate residential areas, in this country, we must do this. If the United Party says we must not resettle people, they are destroying separate residential areas in South Africa. If this is the case, they do not mean what they say. One can only have separate residential areas in South Africa if one sets about it in the way this Government does. This Government has shown by deeds that it wants to place people in their separate areas. That is why, in recent years, it has placed 69 000 families who became disqualified in terms of the Group Areas Act. in areas which were declared for them. It is the position that of the 17 571 houses and dwelling units which the department and local authorities built and made available last year, no fewer than 5 000 were used for resettling people.

<p>Yes, one. In Chatsworth you find 13 or 14 people living in a two-bedroomed house. And the hon. the Minister says it is a model township. The medical officer of health at Durban turned round the other day and said that Chatsworth is overcrowded and that there is nothing he can do about it. How can you call it a model township? I should like the people of South Africa not to judge my words and certainly not to judge the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s words, but to get in their cars this week-end and go for a drive into the Cape Flats, into Chatsworth and other places in South Africa and see for themselves what is happening, see for themselves how this Government is housing these people. Let them gp to Mere-went in Durban and see the 600 families living in the tin shacks of Durban. They have been living there for ten years under conditions which many of us would not allow our dogs to live in. I have come to the end of my tether in dealing with a Minister like this, not for his sake, not for the Government&#x2019;s sake, but for the sake of South Africa and for the sake of the problems that will arise in South Africa because of his attitude. All I can do is to ask the South Africans to go into these townships, have a look around and then pray that we will get a decent government that will know what the odds are, who will know what the problems are.</p>

<p>Under this Minister this department&#x2019;s property holdings have jumped by R16 million in the last year alone. In the last 12 months the property holdings in this department have jumped from R84 million to R100 million at cost. Anybody can tell this House that that means that this department probably holds property to the value in excess of R300 million. I have called this Government the biggest estate agent in the world. I would now answer that it is also the most ruthless, the most heartless Government and that it is a monstrous organization. Over the last ten years this Government has spent 50 cents on building buildings like we have opposite this House for every rand that it spent on housing. I object strongly to the type of building that is being done in Government quarters. It does not fall under this particular Minister&#x2019;s Vote, but I would say that if the hon. the Minister would put his priorities right and build houses for people that need them, we would find that our security would be a great deal safer than it is. The department&#x2019;s holdings have increased, but the department does not pay the rates and taxes to the tune of millions of rand throughout our cities. Our ratepayers have to pay these rates because the department holds so much of this property and does not pay the rates on it. It owns one-third of the township of Queensborough, it owns half the township of Cato Manor. Five years ago, Cato Manor was going to be <span class="col_7299-7300" refersTo="page_0604"/>released, but not one site has been released yet. Then we come down to things like Block AK in Durban, frozen for something like ten years. The hon. the Minister would have planned Block AK. But in the meantime he has stymied Durban and it is estimated that that alone is costing the Durban City Council R30 000 a year in rates. There sits the hon. the Minister who can do nothing but blushter and &#x201C;Blah&#x201D;. But, I think, the cherry is put on the cake when we discover that if a religious organization wishes to build a church in an Indian area, it has to obtain permission from the hon. the Minister to buy that church site. Has this House ever heard anything so ridiculous, that a Minister of State can decide whether a church may buy a site in an Indian township? I should like this hon. Minister to give the reply across the floor of this House that it is his right, that he can decide and that he is the one that does decide. I should like to know when he started to play a game like this.</p>

<p>Is it something to be proud of? The Pietermaritzburg Mental Health Society decided that they should like to use the Pietermaritzburg City Hall for a charity concert. They put in an application to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department together with a deposit of R20. Last year, surprisingly enough, when the Lions wanted to hold the Republic celebrations in the Pietermaritzburg City Hall, it was in order. But when they wanted to hold a variety concert to raise funds for the Mental Health Organization, a registered charitable organization, the Minister not only refused the application, but he also refused to return their R20. And this is a department that has property to the value of R300 million. And the Minister sits there and smiles. These are the reasons why I am asking for an investigation. They sell a property and within 18 months or so the value of that property increases by 100 per cent. It is even stranger in Pietermaritzburg. They buy a property from an Indian&#x2014;and I have often wondered what right the department has to buy property from Indians in an Indian area&#x2014;and then sells it back to an Indian at a profit of something like R200 000. I believe in all sincerity that, if we are a democratic society and if we are a just society, we must for heavens&#x2019; sake have a commission of inquiry into the operations of this department and what it is doing to this country. I am sincere when I say that I do not believe that there is a nation on earth, anywhere on earth, even behind the Iron Curtain or behind the Bamboo Curtain, or anywhere else, that would operate in the manner that this department operates and get away with it. One can cite individual cases to this Minister. I have cited them to him in the past and he had threatened to resign if I brought him evidence of these things. I brought him evidence, but he is still there; consequently one can not pay much attention to what the Minister says. The value of the department&#x2019;s properties simply increases; the department interferes in everything one can think of; it builds where it does not allow anybody else to build; and it does not build in conformity with local authority by-laws so that if buildings happen to fall down, and I do not wish to mention the name of the place, the Minister simply bluffs and &#x201C;blahs&#x201D; and makes a lot of noise. The Minister and the Government benches can make all the noise they like, because it does not worry me one little bit. In conclusion I would like to say something to the hon. the Minister of Health, who is looking at me in a peculiar way. If one cannot get through to any other member of the Cabinet, perhaps h might persuade his colleagues in the Cabinet that what is happening in the townships is far more important than either he or the Minister of Community Development making speeches about Afrikaner-hate like they did a little while ago. In dealing with the serious conditions in our townships and in regard to housing, all the hon. the Minister of Community Development can do is to make a speech on Afrikaner-hate.</p>

<p>What do you know? You are a sheep, man! The voters of Oudtshoorn clearly expressed their lack of confidence in the United Party. I shall lay a wager with that hon. member that the voters of Brakpan will again reject the United Party in no uncertain terms. The hon. member for Port Natal now tells us that the people are praying for a change of Government. Who are those people? I shall tell him who those people are. They are the sour-mouthed people in South Africa, the racialists, the Progressives. They are the liberalists of whom he is one. He competes with the hon. member for Houghton to see who is the greatest Progressive. The enemies of Afrikanerdom are the ones who are praying for the Government to fall. They want those conditions again which we had in 1948. In 1948 there were slum conditions in every city in the Republic. There were thousands and thousands of slums. There we found White, Coloured, Bantu and Indian, every kind and colour, living together. Those people who are praying for a change of Government want those conditions again. They were the hotbed of communism. Not only were those slum conditions the hotbed of communism, but the United Party even harboured them in their Cabinet. Those were the conditions which prevailed under the United Party in 1948. The hon. member for Port Natal is not listening now. He is now engaged in a diversionary manoeuvre with two liberalists who are sitting with him. All three of them are competing to see whether they cannot outwit the hon. member for Houghton. All three of them would like to be the leader of the Progressive Party. He says that the people are praying for a change of Government. The liberalist elements, the Communists and the enemies of the Afrikaner people are the ones who are praying for this, and not the true voters of South Africa. They know that the day they reject the National Party and the United Party comes into power, it will be only a question of time before those slum conditions exist again and Communism runs riot in South Africa. Then it will also be the end of the White Civilization in Southern Africa. When that party was in power we had conditions where the Sam Kahns ran riot and preference was given to the Ballingers. Communist agitators flourished under those housing conditions. This Government knows that the housing problem is one of the burning problems in South Africa. We know that when a family has its own home, that family is not so susceptible to Communism and other dangerous influences which surround us today. That is why this Government is spending millions of rands on housing. The hon. member says he is also in favour of separate residential areas, but he knows, after all, that his party does not advocate separate residential areas. After all, it is the policy of the United Party that it should take place on a voluntary basis. Now I want to ask the hon. member what Coloured person, Bantu or Indian will voluntarily accept a separate residential area. The United Party knows, after all, what the conditions were when they were in power.</p>

<p>I want to confine myself, however, to what is important in my own constituency. I want to tell the Minister and his department that I appreciate what they have done in my constituency. In the vicinity of the Korsten lake they have largely cleared up the slum conditions. I also want to thank the department very much for taking away from the Coloured people one by one those slums in the White residential area of Ferguson, adjoining Uta Street, and for resettling the people in the Coloured area. A few Coloured people still remain, however, and I want to ask the hon. the Minister to encourage and perhaps to force the city council also to resettle those Coloured people who are still living there at the moment. Those remaining few Coloured people are holding out, because some of them have right of ownership, while others are renting houses which belong to Whites. <span class="col_7303-7304" refersTo="page_0606"/>I should like the department to intervene there. I want to bring to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s notice another matter which is vitally important to my constituency. I want to thank the Minister and his department for those 310 flats which are being built in Gould Street. Those fats are now nearing completion, and the first ones will be available within a month or six weeks. However, I want to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the fact that the rents which are being charged for those flats are not within the means of the people for whom they are meant. The rent will be approximately R70 a month, and this for people with an income of between R160 and R400 a month. I want to ask the Minister that where we have the sub-economic group with 1 per cent and the lower economic group with 3&#x00BE; per cent and the economic group with 8 per cent, we should also have an intermediate group of between 4 per cent and 5 per cent. It will then be possible to house the people with a low income as well, particularly those with families. I am worried about the people who have an income of just over R160 a month, who fall in the 8 per cent interest rate group. Those are the ones we cannot house, particularly those with children. There is housing for the lower and higher income groups, but people in this group cannot afford it. This is where I want to ask the Minister something. The principle of house subsidizing has already been accepted. We are in fact subsidizing the sub-economic houses. Food subsidizing has also been accepted. I think we are subsidizing food to the amount of approximately R68 million a year, to keep food prices under control. That food is subsidized for rich and poor. Now I want to ask the Minister, since we have already accepted the principle of subsidizing, the 1 per cent and 3 per cent concessions, that we should try to reduce that tremendous jump from 3 per cent to 8 percent. We must narrow the gap so that the middle income groups, particularly those with families, may also be given the opportunity to be housed.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, notwithstanding the bitter attack which the hon. member for Port Natal made upon the hon. the Minister, an attack which was indicative of a sour disposition and of bitterness and irascibility &#x2014;which one is accustomed to on the part of that hon. member&#x2014;I want unashamedly here today to pay tribute to this Department of Community Development and to the hon. the Minister for the tremendous job that they have done, particularly in the Port Elizabeth area, in respect of housing for Whites. If this Department had not taken the initiative in the early sixties and provided housing for Whites in Port Elizabeth, we would have experienced a housing crisis there that would have been difficult to believe. The 800-plus two- and three-roomed flats that were built at Algoa Park in the late sixties, eased a position that had become critical, and made provision for people for whom there was no other accommodation. Unfortunately, these buildings had to be erected in great haste and there was not adequate time for planning. In fact, it was also an experiment in prefabricated construction methods. For this reason, if one had the time today one would be able to improve considerably upon the planning aspect of those flats.</p>

<p>One very annoying problem of the occupants of those flats is that no provision has been made for hanging space for washing. This might seem a very trivial point to raise but the fact remains that the only place where these people can hang up their washing is on the small balconies next to their living rooms, and this looks very ugly and untidy from the outside. There is no space to hang the washing outside and, in any event, the wind blows it away. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister and the Department cannot consider meeting this requirement by perhaps having a centralized washing plant, a modern laundry, installed there where the washing can be washed and steam-dried. This is already being done at the flats we visited the other day. The occupants of Disa Park have no problem in regard to washing blowing away, being stolen or having to be hung up somewhere. If this can also be done at the particular flats I have mentioned, it might provide the solution to their problem. As I have said, because those flats at Algoa Park were actually built by way of an experiment and can perhaps be greatly improved as far as their planning is concerned, I want to ask most courteously that there should be no further increases in rentals in respect of those flats. A further increase in rental took place just recently. Although one realizes that the rental is still reasonable for a three-roomed flat, there must please be no further increases. In fact, I should like to ask that the rentals be reduced to their previous level. I <span class="col_7305-7306" refersTo="page_0607"/>should also like to ask whether consideration cannot be given to classifying a few of those blocks of flats&#x2014;perhaps the two-bedroomed blocks&#x2014;as sub-economic housing, even if only temporarily. There is a great need at the moment for sub-economic housing and housing for the lower income groups. The City Council&#x2019;s scheme in the Perseverance area has not yet been built and there is a great shortage in respect of this income group. I wonder whether we cannot perhaps consider earmarking one or two of those blocks for this purpose.</p>

<p>Secondly, Sir, I want to thank the hon. the Minister for the vision he displayed when we asked him earlier this year for money for the Despatch Municipality which had an opportunity to purchase 900 morgen of land between Despatch and Port Elizabeth at a very reasonable price. I am grateful that the hon. the Minister was prepared to make that money available. In the next 10 or 12 years homes for between 5 000 and 6 000 Whites can be built at very reasonable prices on those 900 morgen, which were bought for about R1 200 per morgen because the money was made available by this Department, simply because the land could be obtained so cheaply. I want to draw hon. members&#x2019; attention to the fact that private developers have paid up to R4 000 per morgen in that vicinity. If homes are built there by private developers, they will therefore be far more expensive. Sir, I cannot but compliment the municipality of Despatch on their acumen in providing cheap and yet attractive housing for our Whites with the assistance of the Department of Community Development. I think that these people have in fact set an example to many other local authorities.</p>

<p>There are no United Party supporters among them at all. They have set a very fine record there in regard to housing. I think that people throughout the country should go along to see the types of homes that are being built there for between R7 000 and R8 000 each.</p>

<p>Thirdly and lastly, I should like to raise a matter which I have discussed with the hon. the Minister on various occasions, and this deals with the question of increased housing loans to individuals. In a Press statement last year the hon. the Minister announced that the loans which were made available to local authorities for housing schemes had been increased from R6 000 per house to a maximum of R7 200 in respect of the larger type of home. Unfortunately, no provision was made at the time whereby the individual borrower&#x2019;s loan could be increased accordingly. I feel that the same concession ought also to be made in respect of loans to private individuals. I think that we agree that it is necessary that the private individual who wants to build his own little home according to his own plan and on a plot that he himself has selected, ought to be encouraged to do so. It is simply a physical impossibility to build a house for the small sum of R6 000 today. I know that it is said that there has been a levelling-off in building costs and that it is possible that building costs will fall but, Sir, that is just not so. What happens now is this: If a man has his own plot and he finds a builder who will build him a house for R6 000, the builder tells him: &#x201C;Very well, I shall build you a shell; I shall build you four walls and a roof, but you will have to find the additional money for your floors and your verandah and your fencing and so forth.&#x201D; This man has now to go from pillar to post; he may perhaps eventually obtain money from a banking institution or whatever the case may be at an interest rate of 10 per cent or 12 per cent in order to make his house liveable. I think it is only fair that people with a low income should be protected against these high rates of interest. Although we are grateful for the concession whereby private individuals can also obtain housing loans from the Department &#x2014;we are grateful for it and it is happening frequently in my constituency&#x2014; we nevertheless ask that some thought should be given to these people too. The levelling-off that has taken place in the building industry, and is perhaps still taking place, has made no contribution whatsoever towards lowering building costs; on the contrary, building costs continue to rise. I was informed recently that the price of paint has been increased by 15 per cent and that this is going to cost the building industry about R10 million per annum. We have these continual increases in this way and I think that care will have to be taken to prevent stagnation in the building activities of private individuals building with Community Development loans. I know that this is actually a matter for the National Housing Commission, <span class="col_7307-7308" refersTo="page_0608"/>but I want to ask the hon. the Minister to discuss the matter with the National Housing Commission in order to see whether these people cannot be given some measure of relief.</p>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>The last two speakers on the Government side have certainly supported the criticism that has emanated from this side both of the Minister&#x2019;s department and of the extremely serious situation that exists in the housing field. There is no question, Sir, that there is complete dissatisfaction on all sides with what the hon. the Minister is doing. I do not think that the hon. member for Port Elizabeth North, who in the past attacked the hon. the Minister in regard to housing at one of his party congresses and was described as an irresponsible person, has given much evidence of any improvement in his attitude in this particular matter, nor has the hon. member for Algoa, who thanks the hon. the Minister in one breath and in the next breath criticizes him in regard to high rentals and other disturbing features that one finds in the housing field today. I would like, Sir, to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to something which he said in the course of a statement which he made on the occasion of the investment seminar of the <i>Property Mail</i> in Johannesburg in October last year, when he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Financial assistance from the State is of necessity limited to the lower income groups. Building societies cater for the middle- and higher income groups. Basically assistance from the National Housing Fund stops at the White family head whose income reaches R400 per month.</block>

<p>Sir, we have long contended that it is time the hon. the Minister paid attention to the lower-income groups. Although he himself has stated that his department has the right to build for any income group, and that the department must maintain a balance, we on this side contend that he has no right to indulge in this form of luxury whilst there is such a severe shortage of housing for people who really cannot afford it. In a scheme which the department started in Jeppes, and which it has not finished allthough it was supposed to have been finished in, I think, September last year, we find that he has taken possession of some portion of this scheme and that one completed dwelling unit has already been provisionally let at a rental of R122-80 per month. Sir, this is in a working class area where you find mostly people who are tradesmen and operators in factories and for whom housing is urgently needed and who now have to pay a rental that only a person with an income of approximately R7 200 a year can afford. If you work on the basis of 20 per cent of the income this is the category for which the hon. the Minister put up a housing scheme costing well over R1 million, and I believe, as I have said on an occasion before, that he has gone in for far too expensive housing in that area. It is not the type of housing his department should put up. He should put up housing that is reasonably priced and has a reasonable rental. If one compares it with the scheme which his agents, the Johannesburg City Council, has put up&#x2014;in fact all local authorities are the agents for the hon. the Minister&#x2014;we find very good housing at an average of about R60 to R80 a month something which is within the scope and the reach of people who are wage earners and are not entrepreneurs, and who are running their own businesses and can command their own earning possibilities. I think the Minister will find that this is a scheme which he should not repeat in a hurry. Then I should like to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to another very serious inroad which I think is taking place in the administration of his department. I find that whilst an ordinary landlord is limited by the decisions of the Rent Board, and by the Act, in regard to the amount of rental he can get, based on 6 per cent of the value of the land and 8 per cent of the value of the building, together with rates and maintenance expenses, which often average out at a return of 9 per cent to 9&#x00BD; per cent, the Minister maintains very glibly that as far as he is concerned, he is entitled to get a return of 12&#x00BE; per cent or between 12&#x00BC; per cent and 12&#x00BE; per cent for his investment. He says only the Community Development Board is concerned with the acquisition of flats and houses and the rentals in these cases are determined according to the accepted policy&#x2014;I do not know by whom &#x2014;of 12&#x00BC; per cent of the acquisition cost. I have a case here in Jeppes, where a person, who is earning approximately R47 a week net, after paying his UIF and PAYE, lives in a house which has been acquired by the Minister&#x2019;s department, where the rental has been determined by the Rent <span class="col_7309-7310" refersTo="page_0609"/>Board at R43 a month. But the moment the department took it over the rental was immediately increased to R53 a month, and the tenant was told that if the change in rental was unacceptable to him, he must in terms of clause 3 of the agreement of lease, tender one month&#x2019;s notice of his intention to terminate the lease before the end of the then current month. In other words, if he cannot pay that extra money every month, which they arbitrarily decided shall be imposed upon him, here is a month&#x2019;s notice and get out! This is a place where working people cannot afford to find homes today because of the shortage of houses, and the Minister did not get up to make an opening statement telling us what he will do about alleviating this type of case. This is the sort of thing which goes on, and which I believe indicates that the Minister has completely lost touch with what is going on in the country. He has an enormous department and a huge budget and he just glibly goes on with the huge acquisitions and does not pay the normal attention which one expects to be paid in the interests of the citizens of a country. He boasts about the tremendous amount of housing that he provides and he takes credit for all the housing that is put up with the help of the National Housing Fund, which is after all a State-established institution with money voted by the taxpayer. He takes credit for all the houses being built with those funds by the local authorities, but when a local authority builds it is limited particularly with regard with the scope of its spending. It is limited in regard to the type of housing it can put up, so that it can cater for people earning up to R400 a month, as well as for the sub-economic strata of the community. But when the Minister wants to say something good for his department, he quotes these figures, which I believe are astronomical. There is another thing which I think is very unsatisfactory, and in keeping with what has been said this afternoon. I have raised the whole matter by way of question and answer with the Minister in regard to Triomf. That is the case of a township which the hon. the Minister well remembers was put up as a triumphant achievement in order to house people who needed homes there, particularly immigrants as well as others, and we find that after complaining for nearly four years, the department has at last decided to do something about repairing houses, which have become a danger to the community. In fact we have letters from an owner who says that according to the Community Development building inspectors the houses are in a serious condition and a few of the owners were warned to keep their children away from the walls; the first complaint was made in 1966 by him and other tenants. Now, it was only by way of question and answer, and a tremendous of Press publicity initiated not through politicians, but initiated by the individual himself, who went to the Press apparently because he could get no answer from the department, that something was at last done and efforts are now being made to put that scheme in order.

<p>I am amazed. The hon. member for Jeppes mentioned a few individual matters, but he said nothing about the overall shortage of houses. Several times today we heard about the shortage of housing. The hon. member for Jeppes will probably agree with me that a major cause of this shortage&#x2014;and I admit that there are places where there may be some shortage of housing&#x2014;is that in past years the Johannesburg City Council did not make use of the funds made available by Community Development.</p>

<p>They did not make use of those funds in proportion to the dwelling units built, and I challenge the hon. member to prove that I am wrong. The Minister had to warn them that if they did not avail themselves of the advantages and utilize the money for the provision of housing for the lower income groups, they would not have it for any other purpose either. For example, the hon. member knows that as far as housing for the Indians is concerned, the City Council of Johannesburg refused all those years to provide services there. He knows that at first they refused to participate in the renewal schemes at Jeppes and Vrededorp, and the hon. member knows that the United Party, for example in Johannesburg and other local bodies, is partly responsible for that shortage of houses. Then I should still like to make the statement that there is in actual fact not such a shortage of housing as is always said. Take my constituency in Johannesburg. In the past four years between the two elections 40 per cent of the people moved. Where did they move <span class="col_7311-7312" refersTo="page_0610"/>to? These are the people in the lower income groups, who had reasonably decent houses, but it suited them to move in that period of four years; 40 percent of the constituency&#x2019;s people moved to other places in that time. If they had been unable to obtain another house, they would not have moved away. Many times on visiting my constituents I ask an old gentleman, &#x201C;Where is Susan?&#x201D; To which he replies, &#x201C;Susan lives in a flat in Braamfontein.&#x201D; When I ask where John is, his reply is that John lives in a flat in Hillbrow, and he adds that if I want the telephone numbers, he can give them to me. The result is that there is a housing shortage and a telephone shortage at the same time. But I want to make haste. I should like to confine myself to my constituency as well as to the Jan van Blerk episode, the episode of Jan van Blerk who went over to the United Party. The reasons he gave and the United Party gave, included housing, the Chinese and the Indians.</p>

<p>I may just say in passing that this is the first time in history I know of that a representative of the National Party went over to the United Party. You yourself know that he could stand it there for a very short while only. It reminds me of the old story about the skunk that took refuge in a hole, only to flee from the hole a short while later because he could not stand the smell. I want to go into a few of these small matters in order to prove that the statements which Mr. Jan van Blerk made, and which the United Party confirmed, are complete nonsense. In the first place, I just want to mention that in past years we had Vrededorp. Mr. Jan van Blerk said he was part of Vrededorp, and he spoke about the housing in Vrededorp. I want to make the statement that I think Vrededorp is one of the suburbs in South Africa in which more was spent on housing and facilities for the various groups in recent years, and will still be spent, than was ever spent before.</p>

</speech>

<p>And who did that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_jager">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. R. DE JAGER</person>:</from>

<p>It was this Government that did that. If only the hon. member would listen for a moment, he might learn something, and then Jan van Blerk, to whom I shall come back later, would possibly go about things in a different way. I just want to mention that Vredepark was recently built at a cost of R1 800 000 in Vrededorp. At the moment a tender to the value of R140 000 has been accepted for that area. Included in the programme which has been approved, is a block of flats of 16 storeys, which is estimated to cost R500 000. This is housing for Whites which will be provided in Vrededorp. Vrededorp is only a very small suburb of Johannesburg. As far as urban renewal is concerned, the Johannsebrg City Council agreed more than seven or eight years ago to carry out the instructions virtually in concerted planning with the Department of Community Development and the Government. But nothing much has come of that urban renewal, apart from the new schemes which have been carried into effect. Under all these circumstances overhead planning has already been finalized. The detailed planning of the first phase will take place one of these days. I may tell hon. members that several thousand rand will be spent on these renewal schemes.</p>

<p>Then I want to dwell on another matter. I want to refer to the shopping-centre for Indians which is being built in Fordsburg. The first project costing R700 000, has almost been completed. I should just mention that there were many problems involved in getting that project off the ground. Negotiations had to be conducted about the site and arbitration had to be resorted to bring the matter to a head. As far as the second phase is concerned, the site will be handed over to the demolition contractors on 1st June. Then the real project will commence. I may just mention that according to the estimate that project will cost a further R8 million to R9 million. I do not think that in India itself there is any shopping-centre like the one for Indians in Vrededorp. The shopping-centre is in Pageview, but it is in actual fact in the area of Vrededorp. There will be no problems in settling the businessmen at Pageview.</p>

<p>What about the Chinese?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_jager">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. R. DE JAGER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall come to the Chinese. Of the 842 families in Page-view. 427 have already been settled in Lenasia. Of the 415 who remain, 126 have bought their own stands. I think there are fewer than 300 who still have to be resettled. The problem is that there are 250 <span class="col_7313-7314" refersTo="page_0611"/>of them with whom negotiations about the prices of the land are in progress. In addition there still are 60 cases of arbitration. The people cannot be resettled before these things have been finalized. I also want to mention that resettlement would already have taken place if the City Council of Johannesburg had initially been prepared to provide services to Lenasia. It was only during the past few years, when they saw that the Department of Community Development itself would provide the services, that they agreed to provide them.</p>

<p>Now I want to refer to the Chinese. We know what the problems in Johannesburg are. We also have the problem of satisfying everyone. The people of Houghton do not want the Chinese to live there; other people do not want them to live close to them. There was a suggestion that they should take Chinatown and develop it themselves. However, the Chinese are not prepared to do so, because they do not want to be on one side. I do not want to go into the matter. The hon. the Minister can go into the matter if he likes. My information is that in the near future the Government and the Department of Community Development will find a solution which will satisfy all parties.</p>

<p>I shall tell hon. members about Jan van Blerk now. A great fuss was made about Jan van Blerk. Jan van Blerk employed the same means as the United Party employs, and that is to blow one&#x2019;s own trumpet. He got hold of something, as the Unittd Party tries to do with housing, and tried to make something of it. Jan van Blerk is still in the running. They may try him again, because we as the National Party, his constituency and his regional executive have decided that we do not want Jan van Blerk anymore. Perhaps the story of coalition is possible now. There is a new party, and so there is a chance of a coalition. There is a chief leader and a chief whip in that party, and such a coalition may possibly be effected. I just want to say that the stories of the newspapers as to how many Nationalists in Vrededorp resigned as a result of the <i>volte face</i> of Jan van Blerk, are largely exaggerated. I have information in my bag, and I invite the United Party to come and have a look at it, information which points to the fact that nine persons resigned from the party. I may also tell hon. members that these persons are relatives and friends of those relatives. I may just mention that after that episode his wife and daughter did not resign from the National Party. Jan van Blerk, however thought fit to pack his bag and leave after that episode. He will probably still approach the U.P. and I shall be glad if they take him. That Jan van Blerk episode was an injection, a tonic, for my constituency; it made those people who had drifted away to some extent, stauncher Nationalists. If Jan van Blerk were to join the U.P. again, I would be glad if they would persuade him to resign. Then hon. members would see an election that would be far better than Oudtshoorn.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. A. VAN HOOGSTRATEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Mayfair will probably be very relieved if I do not dwell at any great length on the embarrassment which Jan van Blerk caused to him, his party and his constituency. This evening I want to deal in a non-political spirit with the subject of Distric Six and the restoration of certain historical building complexes. I do so at the request of the civic authorities in Cape Town, and it is for that reason that I should like to keep this as a non-political appeal to the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister will realize that for thousands of men and women who visited this country betweeen the two world wars, the thousands of seamen and the thousands of tourists, the mention of the name Districat Six holds a certain sense of excitement, a certain sense of danger. The fact that the area is now due for urban removal is not disputed. But there are areas of architectural interest in District Six which we understand from discussions between the civic authorities and the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department, it is intended to retain and, if possible, to restore. I mention particularly three areas, namely the Tyne Street complex, the Moravian Hill complex and the Vernon Terrace complex. These are areas which can be likened to our Malay Quarter on the other side of the town on the slopes of Signal Hill, or the Loader Street complex, which has just recently been restored and is now regarded as a first-class urban dwelling. These three complexes have had a great deal of interest shown in them by a group of architects who have studied their architecture, which represents periods in Cape architecture of the old Dutch <span class="col_7315-7316" refersTo="page_0612"/>homes of the honest Cape Burgers. This period goes back to the 1800s, then to the 1860s, with the first arrival of the corrugated iron roofs which became available, the period when the balconies had their particular faades in wrought iron and then, finally, the later era of 1900. It is the intention, we understand, of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department to retain these entire complexes. We appreciate that 90 per cent of District Six can only be demolished. The sooner the bulldozers do their job the better. These three areas which, I believe, have been settled upon are now being vacated by their inhabitants. The experience is that the moment a family is moved out, vandals move in. We have photographs showing Europeans with furniture wagons standing at street corners and young non-Europeans are going in and stripping the ceilings, the fagades, the Adams fireplaces, the floors, the shutters, the windows, etc. A part in one of these areas in particular, one could almost liken to the Spanish steps in Rome. The outside of the area has steps going down to an alley-way. There is a tremendous amount of cast iron. The walls have very attractive urns on them. The moment the families move out, the vandals move in, and what we regard as irreplaceable articles of hardware are being removed unnecessarily. In reply to a question put by me recently in this House, the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department indicated that they did not feel that much of this material was of any real economic worth. May I say that to replace genuinely and authentically the type of material that is now being removed wantonly and destroyed wilfully, will cost not only the hon the Minister&#x2019;s department, but also the State, many thousands of rands needlessly, when the ultimate task of restoring these areas takes place. I mention these areas particularly because in their vicinity are Moslem Mosques, Christian churches and chapels. I believe that there is a plan of the whole area which was produced by a Mr. Franzsen&#x2014;not of the Franzsen commission&#x2014;and that in the model sketch these particular areas have been phased into the new urban redevelopment of that particular part of the city. There are indications that, when a family has been moved out of these houses, their virtual demolition through plundering takes place almost within weeks. However, where non-Europeans are still living alongside these homes, there is evidence that the houses are in spick and span condition. The architects have photographed these properties before the removal of the families from them and shortly afterwards. They also photographed the houses that are still standing. It is not a question of these houses being so decrepit that they are falling down. Some of them are of Table Mountain granite and most of them are as good as the houses in the Malay Quarter which has been standing for 100 to 150 years and could well stand for another 100 to 150 years. They need very little restoration and one could almost immediately move in families. They could become most attractive town houses earning the State an economic rental. They would then, too result in Cape Town&#x2019;s retaining in this portion of the city which is vanishing so quickly, something that is true, genuine and authentic, someting that casts our minds back to the old history of this city. It has been said that there is so little of old Cape Town likely to be left, that even Capetonians within one generation will hardly recognize their city with the modern progress that it taking place in the heart of the urban area. I know that the hon. the Minister has a reputation for having regard to human and historical values. I know that he is interested in the preservation of such areas; Tulbagh complexes, for instance, were restored magnificently after the earthquake. One complex, a whole street of terraces which is due for retention, and the other two as well, are most attractive. These are very beautiful complexes. I merely want to put it to the hon. the Minister that if, upon moving families out of particular houses in this area, those houses could be either barricaded up or if families could be left in them on a caretaker-basis until such time as the Minister&#x2019;s department is ready to undertake the whole urban redevelopment of the area, this would be welcomed. Not only the Capetonians who are sentimental about this area, but also the rest of South Africa who know of its tourist merits, will be able, when they see the redevelopment that takes place on a more futuristic basis, to Visit these areas and have some reminders of what old Cape Town looked like in the days, let us say, before the Nats came in.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is a good thing that the hon. member for Gardens has advocated the reservation of certain historic buildings and maintained that every care possible should be taken to ensure that those structures are renovated appropriately. Let me tell him that if it were not for this Department and for <span class="col_7317-7318" refersTo="page_0613"/>the National Party which came into power in 1948, the hon. member would not even have had the opportunity of making the plea which he did make today. This same District Six deteriorated rapidly and gained notoriety. Now that that same District has started to become famous the hon. member can come along and advocate the restoration and preservation of certain historical buildings. Nobody objects to that. Indeed, it is part of the policy of this Department to do everything in its power to assist in cases where buildings can be preserved, where the preservation melds in with the planning and where antiques can be protected for the future. What is more, it will do so in any city or town in the Republic, not only in District Six. I can give the hon. member that assurance myself, but I think that the hon. the Minister will elaborate more fully in this regard. I began by saying that the country has been very grateful to the National Party since it came into power in 1948. Were it not for the application of the group areas policy, I believe that there would have been chaos in this country of ours today. The United Party opposed these laws&#x2014;the Group Areas Act and the Group Areas Development Act&#x2014;tooth and nail. The Department had sometimes to go over the heads of those who did not want to co-operate&#x2014;there were many city councils among them&#x2014;in order itself to implement the policy. As a result of the opposition on the part of city councils, the Department had in fact to go so far as to have a Group Areas Development Act&#x2014; later, the Community Development Act&#x2014; passed by this House so that the necessary machinery could be put into operation in order to effect this development. We have the privilege today of being able to appreciate the work done by the National Housing Commission. They are known universally for their work. We also have the privilege of seeing the work done by the Community Development Board, and District Six and many other areas are examples in this respect. The planning of South End in Port Elizabeth and that of other areas is also an example of what is being done by that Board as a limb of the Department of Community Development. Their achievements are becoming more widely known, as are the houses they build. In Durban&#x2014;the place about which the hon. member for Port Natal has such a great deal to say&#x2014; there are hundreds of grateful Whites who have been able to buy the houses which the Department of Community Development and its Development Board have been able to build in the various townships. It is so easily forgotten that an enormous amount of work had first of all to be done where slum conditions and squalor prevailed before the Department of Community Development could start building. Chatsworth is criticized today as being such a poor neighbourhood but I agree with the hon. the Minister that to its thousands of inhabitants it is a good, large town. If one would only consider what the circumstances of those people were before they moved into those houses, one would be ashamed to decry what is being done in Chatsworth. Group areas had to be planned there. Local authorities had to be consulted. Interviews had to be conducted in order to obtain suggestions from local authorities and other local bodies. Public opinion had also to be considered. Advertisements had to be placed and investigations had to be made in regard to group areas. Evidence had also to be obtained and recommendations made. The hon. the Minister concerned had also to be given the opportunity to sift all those recommendations very carefully before he could arrive at a decision. A start could only be made on the provision of housing and services after all these things had been done&#x2014; which in respect of some areas took a few years. Only then could the requisite planning be completed. We have no cause to rail against this hon. Minister and his Department. I think that there is every reason to complain about those people who are always making excuses and about those people who do everything in their power to hamper the work of the Department and to decry it, as has happened here today, by calling it a &#x201C;monstrous organization&#x201D;. I think that the words used in respect of that Department in this House today are hateful words. The person who used them should, in fact, be ashamed of himself, even though he tries to utter them with so much arrogant daring and conviction. As early as 1917, no less a person than Dr. Malan made a plea for a little house, a small plot with a tiny garden for people who moved from the rural areas to the cities. How much stronger a plea cannot be made for them today! How much more strongly must action be taken and continuous pleas be made that every member of the community be in the position to own his own property, his own small farm, his little plot or home, and that from his youth he should concentrate on obtaining these things. No <span class="col_7319-7320" refersTo="page_0614"/>matter what the sacrifice, this House must vote and activate the necessary funds, and encourage thrift, as has been done in this Budget, so that people in all spheres and activities of life can remain independent and find their niche in this country. We must all help to ensure that the task that has been undertaken, in which this Department is persevering, is accomplished, and that we stay ahead. This task can only be accomplished if we have a consistently sound organization, as is the case at the moment, and if there is the necessary inspiration forthcoming from all quarters to ensure that those items which are sacred to a man and his family are within his reach. In short, I can say: &#x201C;East, West, home is best&#x201D;; a home for everyone, if possible! It is his shelter; it is his repository; it is his place of rest; it is his place of beauty; it is his place of peace; it is the matrix of his family and friends. The hon. the Minister and his Department are working towards that goal.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Innesdal, who has just sat down, had quite a lot to say about the pressure that had to be brought to bear on certain cities before they were prepared to react to the demands of the Government or this particular Minister. I would like to remind him, and also the hon. member for Algoa, who was very high in his praise of the department, and implied that everything that has happened in Port Elizabeth, has happened as a result of this department&#x2019;s intervention, of the words of the hon. the Minister when he recently visited Port Elizabeth. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I offer my most hearty congratulations to the city council of Port Elizabeth on the success of their efforts towards adequate provision of proper housing for their Coloured community. I can only say that the progressive spirit is what I expected in Port Elizabeth, with its outstanding civic record.</block>

<p>That does not sound as though any pressure or coercion had to be brought to bear. These things happened in the cities where you have a well-conducted city council.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to raise one or two matters with the hon. the Minister that deal more closely with his portfolio. I refer in the first place to the area which has been developed by his department in the South End of Port Elizabeth. This has been going on for a considerable period of time. The demolition of the older buildings appears to have been half-way completed. My question to the hon. the Minister is whether he can give some indication as to when the rebuilding of this area will commence. I would also like to ask him to whom the ground which was taken over by the department will belong. Does it belong to the Department of Community Development? How will it be sold? Will it be sold by tender or auction, or how will ownership be transferred from the department into the hands of private developers? Will private developers be entirely responsible for developing the whole of the are? Another problem that I wish to raise with the hon. the Minister is this. Is he aware of the tremendous amount of pollution of the atmosphere in that particular area caused by the ore dumps at the ore terminal at the harbour in Port Elizabeth? I do not know whether the hon. the Minister is aware that this is a very serious problem. If there is not adequate consultation between the hon. the Minister and the hon. the Minister of Transport to see that something effective is done to stop this pollution of the atmosphere, any buildings that he erects in the South End area are going to be thoroughly despoiled. I ask the hon. the Minister to give this matter his serious attention.</p>

<p>Then there is another matter. The hon. the Minister will know that in recent months two flats have been converted from ordinary dwelling flats to so-called &#x201C;holiday&#x201D; flats. I think the hon. the Minister will agree that the conversion of these flats to holiday flats caused considerable disruption to the people who lived in these particular flats. He will know that I wrote to him and asked him to give me adequate warning if this was going to happen, so that this kind of thing would not happen again without proper preparations being made.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kingwill">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I understand that the Minister laid down a condition. In the case of the one block of flats &#x2014;Langerry by name&#x2014;which was fully occupied, the hon. the Minister gave permission for it to be converted into holiday flats, and now I see that the present owners of this block are advertising accommodation, so obviously this block of flats is now not fully occupied. The hon. the Minister knows that there is a shortage of flat accommodation in Port Elizabeth. He allowed this block of flats to be converted into holiday flats; it was fully occupied; the inmates had to leave, and now you have the situation that some of this accommodation is not fully occupied. I ask the hon. the Minister to see to it that the matter is thoroughly investigated, when ordinary residential flats are proposed to be converted to holiday flats, before this is allowed to happen.</p>

<p>Then there is a third matter. The hon. the Minister will know that in the North End area of Port Elizabeth his department erected a building complex, which was known as a free trading area, which saw sublet to displaced Indian traders from the South End area. I would say, Sir, that this building was most adequate; in fact, I would say that it was a prestige building. The Indians who rented these premises were thoroughly satisfied with what they had been given. But now I understand that this building has been sold. I want to ask <span class="col_7323-7324" refersTo="page_0616"/>the hon. the Minister on what basis it was sold; what was the profit that the department make? In other words, I would like to know what the erection of that building in fact cost him, at what price he sold it, to whom it was sold, and whether the purchaser was a resident of Port Elizabeth or whether he was an Indian from some other area. Is this Indian to whom it was sold qualified to live in Port Elizabeth? There was considerable dissatisfaction over the fact that this building was not in fact sold to a local purchaser. A further question that I would like to ask the hon. the Minister is this: Have the Indian shopkeepers occupying these premises a guarantee that the new owner will not charge them a higher rental than they were charged when the building belonged to the Minister&#x2019;s department?

<p>Sir, I did some paging through the old Hansards and came upon an interesting question put by the late Mr. Eric Louw to the then Minister of Health, a certain Dr. Gluckman, on 22nd January, 1946. It is very interesting, because it teaches one a great deal about the party sitting on the opposite side of the House. The question reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Louw asked the Minister of Health, Dr. Gluckman, how many houses have been completed under the national housing schemes.</block>

<p>To this the then Minister of Health gave this impressive&#x2014;unbelievably impressive&#x2014;reply&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">National houses (including sub-economic houses converted to national houses) 1 439; economic housing, 17171; sub-economic housing, 25 237; houses for the aged poor, 469 &#x2026;</block>

<p>Those are the same aged poor about whom hon. members on that side are now so concerned&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; a total as at 31st December, 1945, of 44 316.</block>

<block name="quote">May I ask whether the houses are ready for occupation?</block>

<p>I hope the hon. member for Orange Grove is now listening. To that question the then Minister of Health replied&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Of the 44 315 there are 1 234 ready or nearly ready.</block>

<p>Sir, if figures mean anything I hope that answer illustrates very well to that hon. member what the United Party Government did in connection with housing. Mr. Louw then asked: &#x201C;My question is, how many houses have been completed&#x201D;, and then he asked further: &#x201C;How many are ready for occupation?&#x201D; The then Minister, like some Red Indian chief or other, replied curtly: &#x201C;I have given the answer.&#x201D; In other words, the &#x201C;chief&#x201D; had spoken. Sir, this extract sketches the United Party men just as they were, and the 1946 and 1972 models are in no way different from each other. A great fuss is being made about the 44 000 houses and what is ludicrous is that only 1 234 being ready or nearly ready. That is the same United Party which, in 1946, at the tail-end of the war, on which it spent hundreds of millions of pounds to march up Africa to get <span class="col_7325-7326" refersTo="page_0617"/>Haile Selassie back on his throne, which subsequently marched further to save a lot of communist Russians and which had so much time for their friends in Abyssinia and Russia, which did not have the time or money to build, or almost build more than 1 234 houses. In contrast with this, Sir, I want to give you a strong and forceful image which South Africa has had for the past 24 years and is going to have for much longer under the National Party and the Government. What did they do? [Interjections.] I do not want to present you with castles in the air. I want to ask hon. members of the Opposition to read this Community Development report. We have now heard the very good figures that Minister Gluckman gave, but now I also want to give you figures and then ask you whether these figures do not have greater punch than the figures Minister Gluckman gave. Firstly we have the National Housing Fund. On 31st March, 1970, the capital of that Fund was R553 700 000, almost enough money to put another Haile Selassie on the throne, and further amounts were also added.</p>

<p>They are so royalistic that they like putting people on thrones. Then there is still the Community Development Fund. On the same date the Fund&#x2019;s assets totalled R107 million. I call this one of the big achievements of the Minister together with his officials, his department and the National Government, and I want to convey to them my heartiest congratulations. Here we see a dynamic department which has a tremendous programme with respect to the building of houses, the granting of loans, urban renewal, resettlement, etc. Then there are a few other matters affecting my constituency and in connection with which I want to link up with a few other hon. members. I just want to mention this to the Minister. For various reasons schemes are drawn up by local authorities and sometimes delayed. This is very frustrating for people who have applied, whose names are on the waitinglist, and who then have to wait for one, two or three years because the list is so long. Unfortunately there are sometimes small things that delay big schemes. I do want to ask the hon. the Minister, if small things occur to delay certain schemes, to ensure that they are cleared up as quickly as possible. I should also like to link up with what the hon. member for Algoa said. He asked that people in the top bracket of a specific group should preferably obtain higher loans so that they can build or purchase bigger houses. I do think one can make out a strong case for this, because shortly after the people have bought those houses with a loan, or have bought them directly from the builders, they are still going to be carrying out alterations to the houses. This entails a great deal of extra and unnecessary expense. The people who fall into the higher income groups can afford the house, after all, even though they had to pay a higher rate. There were on occasion interesting discussions about a matter referred to the Congress by the Pretoria West constituency. It involved municipal schemes. The request was that a small percentage of those schemes should include houses that are a little bigger so that these houses could be sold at higher prices.</p>

<p>Another matter I should like to touch upon relates to the group area Laudium, where the Indians live in Pretoria West. In that area, which has been proclaimed an Indian group area, enough space has been allowed for development over the next 25 to 30 years. Now it appears that it is a section that is unfit for use owing to sinkholes. That is the case in respect of the portion handed over for the Indian college, and what is more a rapid influx of Indians from areas outside Pretoria is taking place to this group area. That group area is going to become too small quicker than was originally foreseen. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister if timely thought cannot be given to what can possibly be done. Can there not be a second group area, for example, or can more blocks of flats not perhaps be built? The flats would allow for vertical construction as the population increases instead of horizontal development. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it was very difficult to follow the hon. member for Pretoria West. He jumped from subject to subject, and backwards and forwards. However, there is one question I must ask him. He had a complaint, or at least a couple of complaints. But why does he complain so softly? Does he believe that the Minister could hear what he was saying? If he has a complaint, let him have the courage of his convictions and put his complaint just as we do on this <span class="col_7327-7328" refersTo="page_0618"/>side of the House. This hon. Minister knows all about it. He likes a man to be positive in putting forward his arguments. The Minister and I speak the same sort of language, and this is the sort of language we should like to hear from the hon. member from Pretoria West as well. I am dealing with complaints against the hon. the Minister.</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>The first one I want to deal with is the celebrated case of Nel &amp; Roode vs. Minister B. Coetzee. I want to raise this pertinently this afternoon, because this is the only opportunity we have had of putting certain questions to the hon. the Minister and eliciting from him replies to those questions. I must admit that the question has been raised before, but always when some other Minister has had to answer. I think we can now get straight answers to straight questions from this hon. Minister. The first point we must make about this case is that the State is not joined in it. It was a straight case involving the hon. the Minister himself and not the State as well. We now find that the State is actually paying the Minister&#x2019;s costs totalling somewhere in the region of R40 000. We still have not got the final figure. I want to repeat that it was a personal action against the Minister in bis personal capacity. The Minister of Justice, in reply to a question asking why these costs were being paid, said that the litigation costs in the court <i>a quo</i> in the case of Nel &amp; Roode vs. Minister B. Coetzee will be paid from the State funds in accordance with fixed policy&#x201D;. This is in terms of policy, you will note, Sir, not in terms of any regulation or any law which required the Government to pay the costs of the hon. the Minister. The Minister says it was fixed policy. Let us accept that. That was the policy of the Minister of Justice. But what was the attitude of this particular Minister, and how can this hon. the Minister bring himself to accept that the State should pay his costs? I raise this question pertinently because of the article which gave rise to that whole action; it was an article which was published in <i>Die Beeld</i>. I want to quote a translation of the Minister&#x2019;s own words which appeared in that article in <i>Die Beeld</i>. The translation reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To me it is obvious that he, Mr. Nel, is not susceptible to reason and decency. Mr. Nel is obviously seeking war, and war is what he will get. I accuse Mr. Nel of misleading the Council in this matter. He says it is war between the Government and his Council. There is no war between these two bodies. It is between him and me. I will not hide behind the Government. He can hide behind Whomever he wants. It is untrue that there was a basis for agreement.</block>

<p>In the light of that statement how can this hon. Minister bring himself to accept that the Government should pay these costs? He said quite expressly that he was not prepared to hide behind the Government; that was not prepared to take advantage of his position in the Government, that he personally took full responsibility for everything that he was saying and took full responsibility for the consequences thereof. This is the question which I think this hon. Minister should answer today: How he can bring himself as a Minister and as a gentleman to accept that his debts, his delicts, should be paid for by the public of South Africa?</p>

<p>The second question that I want to raise with the hon. the Minister is the question of Oribi Government Village, a village which is situated in my constituency, where there are many people in the lower income group, most of them in the sub-economic group, who are housed in accommodation <span class="col_7329-7330" refersTo="page_0619"/>provided by this Government. You will notice, Sir, that I did not say that they were in houses. They are housed in accommodation and it is the condition of that accommodation which I want to discuss with the hon. the Minister. He will recollect that I wrote to him earlier during this session in connection with that village. I received a reply from him dated the 13th March. I submitted this reply to the complainants in Pietermaritzburg. They had to accept that this was the final word, because it came from the private secretary of the Minister here in Cape Town. I want to ask the hon. the Minister why he has adopted this attitude and whether he will not assist us further in improving the lot and the condition of these people.</p>

<p>I raised this question of certain roads and lanes that were blocked and the conditions under which these people were accommodated. The Minister&#x2019;s reply reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Your remarks regarding lanes and roads are correct, but it should be borne in mind that Oribi was not laid out as a village and therefore it does not comply with modern town planning requirements. The accommodation provided can only be regarded as a temporary measure.</block>

<p>How long will it be temporary? This has been occupied by many of these people, and it has certainly been occupied as a village administered by this Minister&#x2019;s department, for 26 years. How long is &#x201C;temporary&#x201D;? I know that his department is working in Pietermaritzburg; I know that they have gone on with schemes such as The Grange and various others in my constituency as well as in other parts of Maritzburg. We accept what they have done, but is the hon. the Minister satisfied that he is doing enough? He is always telling us that he is catching up with the backlog in housing, but when will he provide alternative accommodation for these people who in his own words, are being housed here as a temporary measure? This has been &#x201C;temporary&#x201D; already for 26 years. How much longer will they have to live there under these conditions?</p>

<p>I also raised the question of stormwater drains that are inadequate and frequently blocked and the answer of the hon. the Minister in his letter is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The blocking of drains is a normal occurrence in a densely populated area.</block>

<p>What satisfaction does this give the people in that village? Sir, I raise these as additional points. I know that conditions have improved in that village since I had this correspondence with the hon. the Minister and his department, but I believe that they can be improved further as long as we do not have this sort of attitude that we must just accept that this is a normal occurrence. The letter reads further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The provisions contained in the leases relating to tidiness of private gardens is being enforced and strict rules have been laid down regarding the maintenance of the grounds in the village.</block>

<p>I want to say to the hon. the Minister again that I do not know how they are being enforced, but they are not being applied. Conditions in the village have improved, but not in this respect and particularly not in respect of those sections of the village which fall under the control of the officials of his department. They are not doing their duty in cleaning up and keeping the public spaces of the village, clean and tidy.</p>

<p>Finally, I would like to ask him if he can just tell me what his department and his representative in Natal have done in regard to establishing a representative committee whose task it would be to promote the interests of the tenants. I congratulate him on this, too, because I believe it is a good suggestion. It is virtually in the nature of a vigilante committee consisting of residents of the village who will look after the village themselves and assist the department. I do not believe that anything has been done towards the establishment of the committee, and I do submit that the first move should come from this hon. Minister&#x2019;s department. It is up to them to make the first move towards the establishment of this committee. The people of Oribi want Oribi cleaned up. They want to make it decent. Many of these people are down on their luck. Many of them are there only temporarily, through circumstances which are very often beyond their control. I do not believe that they deserve to live in the conditions in which they are being asked to live today. I believe that this hon. Minister and his department could make their conditions far more amenable and make the occupation of Oribi a far happier one.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg-District <span class="col_7331-7332" refersTo="page_0620"/>kicked up a great fuss here about the lawsuit in connection with the Pretoria case the Minister was involved in. The hon. member knows as well as I do that when a Minister of the State becomes involved in a lawsuit in the ordinary execution of his duties, it is the custom, and has been all the years&#x2014;and the hon. member cannot show me a case where it was not the custom&#x2014;for the Minister&#x2019;s costs to be carried by the State, if there are any costs that have to be paid.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>He gave up that right.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kotz&#x00E9;">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>That is nonsense. The hon. member is talking through his hat if he wants to allege that the Minister gave up that right. And the Minister does not have the right to give up that right either. What the Minister did, is customary. I want the hon. member to use his intelligence. What did the hon. the Minister do? He said he was going to appeal and that in the case of an appeal he was prepared to pay his own costs. And he did so, like an honest man. Why does the hon. member not say that here? Why does the hon. member try to paint a crooked picture to try and besmirch the Minister in the eyes of the general public, alleging that he becomes involved in lawsuits and the State has to pay the costs? Why does the hon. member not say, in all reasonableness, that it is the custom that when a Minister becomes involved in a lawsuit in the execution of his duties, the costs are paid by the State. Every day there are cases against Ministers and Government departments for which the State pays the costs. But here the hon. member comes along and tries to discredit the hon. the Minister personally and to implicate him in something. However, Oudtshoorn and other places teach him that the United Party&#x2019;s discrediting of leaders in this scandalous way no longer makes any impression as far as our people are concerned. Our people have also developed an antipathy towards it. That is when they say that this emanates from hate towards Afrikaners in certain positions. [Interjections.] It is purely out of hate for Afrikaners in high positions that one finds this conduct. [Interjections.] The hon. member was looking for it and now he has got it.</p>

<p>In now coming back to the debate I should like to have a shot at presenting a picture of what the housing situation looks like in South Africa today. Members on the other side of the House are trying to paint a very dark picture. From the hon. member for Pretoria West we heard what the situation was like when we came into power. They built 44 000 castles in the air, but in reality they held that 1 400 of them would eventually become houses. There was a backlog of thousands upon thousands. At the time the hon. member for Orange Grove outlined the situation with photographs in the <i>Kruithoring.</i> He wrote pages and pages about the dire straits South Africa was in under the United Party men in respect of housing. The other day I had photostat copies made of the material, and I will give them to the hon. member. No other hon. member in the House could have done it better. We therefore began with that backlog and the National Party realized that it was a stigma on South Africa&#x2019;s name that had to be eradicated. I now want to tell hon. members, and they cannot gainsay me, that by the end of the fifties there was a housing surplus in South Africa, so much so that flat owners went from one person to another trying to persuade them to come and live in their flats. For years there was a housing surplus under this National Government. Then the industrial explosion took place. South Africa then began to reap the benefits of this National Government&#x2019;s work. This Government converted South Africa into an industrial country. People then began to move to the cities and a new problem developed. The National Party did its duty. It built houses, but over the years a backlog has developed. In the past few years we have, however, as far as White housing is concerned, been engaged in completely eliminating that backlog. I should like to prove this to hon. members. According to the figures which all the hon. members opposite obtained from the department, it was estimated last year that on 31st December there was a shortage of about 4 500 houses for Whites. In the best United Party times there was not merely a shortage of 4 500 houses for Whites. For Coloureds there was a shortage of approximately 22 000 houses, and for Indians there was a shortage of 11 000 houses. That is an estimate the department made. The annual need was also determined by surveys and projections of the department, in consultation with other bodies, <i>inter alia</i> the Department of Statistics and the Department of Planning. As far as it is humanly possible to determine these aspects, they determined&#x2014;and I am <span class="col_7333-7334" refersTo="page_0621"/>not saying they arrived at the exact number of houses, but that is how it was determined, and any other government would have done the same&#x2014;that for the proper housing of our population, about 28 000 houses would be needed for Whites, 16 500 for Coloureds, and 7 000 for Indians every year. The figures I am now giving are liberal estimates, in excess, actually, of the figures the department furnished. My figures are a little higher than those of the department. In respect of the housing for Whites the picture looks very promising. Last year, without State funds, the private sector alone completed 18 256 houses and 10 436 flats. The over-all majority of these houses were built for Whites, of course, because the private sector does not build many houses for non-Whites, although quite a few are built for Indians. These 28 690 dwelling units went chiefly to Whites. This is 500 dwellings more than the annual need for White people. Therefore, the private sector alone created 500 more dwelling units in one year than the projected needs for Whites. On the other hand the department and local authorities made 5 400 dwelling units available for Whites, which is 1 000 more than the backlog that exists. The picture is therefore not as gloomy as the one hon. members opposite are trying to paint. The fact is that as far as our White housing is concerned, things are not nearly so bad. However, one does gain the impression that there are people who feel the pinch because they are in houses and other dwelling units too expensive for them on the salaries they earn. We shall therefore have to accommodate these people. People who are in too expensive flats, look for a cheaper class of house. However, they are not without accommodation; they have places to stay. Sir, that is why I am saying that we will have to take a look at this middle income group. Our people have good housing; in fact, our people in South Africa are living too luxuriously; we must bring them back to more normal standards. Therefore I say that I hope our young people will make use of this housing plan, this savings plan which is linked to the building societies, and that employers will encourage them to save some of their money there so that they can build up a nest-egg for themselves to provide for their own needs. One also finds the tendency amongst our young people today to first get married and start a family and then look to the State for housing. We must not encourage the socialistic approach in our country either. The state must do its best. Private initiative must do its best. But the responsibility lies with every man to obtain a house for his family. He must do it by hard work, by saving while he is single and through the channels created for him. The possibility is there for him and his family to be able to live modestly, but nicely and effectively. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the few minutes left of this evening, I just want to follow on what the hon. member for Parow has said in regard to the new house-building scheme which was introduced in the Budget. It is interesting to hear that the hon. member for Parow and other members on the Government side have such confidence in this scheme, I would like to refer them to a statement made by two persons who are involved in producing housing for the lower to middle income groups, two representatives of the home builders&#x2019; section of the Master Builders&#x2019; Association and representatives of two of the larger companies, Gough Cooper and Omega Construction, who described this houseowner saving scheme as &#x201C;inadequate, unrealistic and likely to prove a monumental failure from the outset&#x201D;. These are strong words, Sir, but I do think that the Government must do a lot of re-thinking if they are indeed serious in their attempts to provide more housing for young couples; because there are undoubtedly serious defects and shortcomings in this scheme, which I would like to deal with a little more fully tomorrow when there is a little more time. In the minute or so left to me, I would like to ask the hon. the Minister to make a further statement in regard to the progress that has been made with the implementation of the Niemand Commission report on the high price of residential land. The hon. the Minister made a statement in the first week of February, setting out the progress that has been made up to that stage. I know that since then the Secretary has had further discussions with a view to the further implementation of this report, and I would be interested to know whether any further progress has been made since the beginning of February. I would also like to ask the hon. the Minister to make some statement in regard to the proposed symposium on high density housing which is due to take place in September this year.</p>
