<speech by="#deacon">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. D. DEACON</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the Minister of Immigration in any growing country occupies an extremely important and responsible position. This Minister has a double responsibility because he is also responsible for all official information on the Republic of South Africa which is sent out into the whole world.</p>

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>We are dealing with immigration.</p>

<p>The hon. member should listen and understand Afrikaans.</p>

<p>*For that reason the Minister&#x2019;s international and national responsibility may be seen as being next to that of the hon. the Prime Minister and of the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Therefore one would expect his conduct in a debate, as well as in public, to be such that it would reflect the outward-going hospitality, the seriousness and the responsibility of the Government. In this debate today I want to mention two incidents which took place within the past six weeks when the hon. the Minister, in my modest opinion, acted in a highly irresponsible way in relation to the Immigration Vote. I am mentioning the matters deliberately and intentionally in order to afford the Minister an opportunity of rectifying matters. As a South African patriot, I cannot allow false impressions to be created about my fatherland and simply to be left up in the air. The first incident took place during the unpleasant Second Reading debate on the Appropriation Bill when the hon. the Minister was speaking on 13th April and had a few words with my hon. friend, the member for Durban North. According to Hansard (col. 4821) the altercation went as follows:</p>

<p>And what about me?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">Minister</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Durban North is probably&#x2014;and I want to give him credit for this at once &#x2026;</p>

<p>I agree with the hon. the Minister&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; as good a South African as I, but I cannot say this of all English-speaking people in South Africa. I cannot say it of the terrorists trying to undermine South Africa. I cannot say it of the liberalists who are engaged in &#x2026;</block>

<p>This sentence was interrupted by an interjection from the hon. member for Transkei. Later, on the same day, the hon. the Minister reacted by way of an interjection while my Leader was speaking, and said the following (Hansard, col. 4835)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There are numerous English-speaking people who are not South African citizens.</block>

<p>I regard these two remarks, coming from the Minister of Immigration, as highly irresponsible. If there are people in South Africa who qualify for citizenship and do not accept it, I concede that they are not South African and are unacceptable. But what must the numerous immigrants of British and Irish extraction, who do not qualify for citizenship yet, feel? They have now been lumped under one cloak together with the terrorists and the liberals.</p>

<speech by="#members">

<from>*<person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBERS</person>:</from>

<p>Disgraceful!</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deacon">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. D. DEACON</person>:</from>

<p>Would they still feel at home and accept citizenship voluntarily by the time they did qualify to become citizens? I can tell the hon. the Minister that all these people have made big sacrifices in order to come here. It is not easy to uproot oneself from one&#x2019;s home country in order to come to a foreign country. Therefore I feel the Government should not be surprised if these people were to be sensitive after such a slap in the face.</p>

<p>The second instance was a speech made by the hon. the Minister in Brakpan before the famous election there Under the heading &#x201C;Government considering legislation: Bilingual settlers, State move&#x201D;, he was reported as follows in the <i>Sunday Express</i> of 30th April, 1972&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government is considering introducing a law which will force all immigrants to South Africa to become bilingual. This was disclosed by the Minister of Social Welfare, Dr. Connie Mulder, at the Nationalist Party meeting at Brakpan on Friday night.</block>

<p>The report continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In an emotional address to a packed hall he stated &#x201C;we want these people to be bilingual. One language is not enough for South Africa. The Whole matter is receiving attention at the highest level&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Sir, if this is a correct report, then I say &#x201C;what childish nonsense!&#x201D; Surely it is not every one who is blessed with the gift of languages. How does the Minister expect immigrants from the European countries of origin&#x2014;France, Belgium, Holland, Germany, etc.&#x2014;ever to become citizens if they have to learn another two languages in addition to their mother tongue? Does he expect they would still want to come if this obligation were placed on them? Will he tell us what form this legislation is going to take and whether he intends granting citizenship only to those who have become bilingual? And, if so, is he prepared to take the consequences of such legislation to its logical conclusion, and withdraw the citizenship of every unilingual person who is a South African by birth, because that would be the just thing to do. If this were to befall immigrants, it should befall our own citizens too. Or will the Minister be man enough to say that this was not his intention; that it was merely a party political speech made in the tension and heat of a party political campaign? But whatever the reply of the Minister may be and whatever his reason was, this Minister did his office, himself and South Africa great damage with this statement. Why could he not have said, as I would have said, that we bring immigrants here for their knowledge and skill, regardless of whether they are able to speak one or the other or none of our languages; we welcome them as long as they are able to make a contribution to our economy and the growth of the Republic and as long as they are prepared to accept our citizenship. We should do everything in our power to encourage them to be bilingual, for example, by making the language laboratory, etc., freely available. Amongst these things I just want <span class="col_7825-7826" refersTo="page_0867"/>to mention this. I want to inform this House of the commendable work done by the hon. member for Port Natal, that hon. member who was described disparagingly at one stage as being a monoglot. During 1965 and 1966 he gave free lessons to immigrants with the assistance of a qualified Afrikaans teacher. In the period from 1965 to 1966 he gave Afrikaans lessons to no fewer than 60 immigrants, with the assistance of that teacher. [Interjections.] This is what is needed to make our immigrants bilingual, not legislation. Furthermore, we are interested in the children of our immigrants, the children who will be South African by birth and who will receive their education here in South Africa.</p>

<p>May I ask a question?</p>

<speech by="#deacon">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. D. DEACON</person>:</from>

<p>No. I am speaking of the children of immigrants who will be South African by birth and who will receive their education here in South Africa. I say that any sensible South African, especially a member of the Cabinet, who talks of legislation in this case, is moving a damning motion of no confidence in our education system as a whole. If our education system cannot make them bilingual, no legislation on earth could. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#henning">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. HENNING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, what we have had to witness up to now in this Committee, in this debate, really has been pathetic. Yesterday evening the so-called shadow Minister of Immigration spoke. He tried to deal with certain immigration figures, but he had not acquainted himself with the matter, for he did not know how many immigrants had entered the country last year. If he had done his homework, he would have found that in the course of this Session the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens asked how many immigrants had entered the country in the past three years. The reply was that up to the end of October, 1971, 29 400 had come. The hon. the shadow Minister of Immigration spoke of 20 000 to 25 000 immigrants having entered the country. How ridiculous! How ridiculous when the main speaker in the debate does not know the subject he is dealing with! This debate is falling into exactly the same pattern as the one we had the past few years. The arguments raised are exactly the same. The hon. member for Albany will get his replies in due course.</p>

<p>In the course of my speech, I also want to dwell for a moment on the hon. member for Port Natal. I have said that the arguments raised here by them, have been exactly the same as in the past. The Government is consistently accused of bringing too few immigrants into the country. It is said that our policy is such that not enough immigrants are brought into the country. They see only one solution, and that is that we do not get enough immigrants from the United Kingdom. That is their solution, virtually the same solution as the one they have to the labour question. If one does not want to use Black labour, one should get immigrants from the United Kingdom. This is what they harp on from morning till night. The other thing they harp on, is that we should obtain immigrants from those countries where there is unemployment. My experience is that the man who is unemployed, is not always of the best. The employer first gets rid of those who are not good workers.</p>

<p>However, I want to come back to the member for Port Natal. He is the hon. member who told us last year how difficult it was for him as an immigrant to accept citizenship; how difficult it was for him to integrate and to adjust. I want to accept that it is most certainly difficult to accept citizenship in a foreign country. It is something one admires. Since it is so difficult for the hon. member, I want to ask him whether, after the remarks he has made in this country of ours, he expects that any potential immigrant will come to South Africa? I have my misgivings as to whether he has accepted this country as his fatherland. What did the hon. member for Port Natal say, he who wishes so much to teach others to become bilingual, but who has not vet taken the trouble to become bilingual himself? He is the person who likes criticizing us so much. With reference to the Timol matter, the hon. member said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The public should not be surprised at the actions of the Security Police and the Government&#x2019;s refusal to hold a public inquiry into the death of Timol. If the alarming trend continues and history repeats itself, even the official Opposition will be subjected to the same treatment.</block>

<p>Is this what a citizen says of his own fatherland? Did he accept his fatherland <span class="col_7827-7828" refersTo="page_0868"/>in that spirit? He is a person who tries to create the image that South Africa is a police state. He creates the image to the outside world that we may exercise no political freedom in this country. I want to ask him now whether he has in fact accepted citizenship of this country. I have my doubts. I do not know whether he really accepted South Africa on the day when he had to take the oath and led his allegiance to South Africa. I doubt it very strongly.</p>

<p>I want to point out what that hon. member said in this debate last year. I quote as follows from his Hansard&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We should not stare blindly at or further emphasize the question of language and religious affiliations.</block>

<p>This is what he said, <i>inter alia</i>. He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; that it is profitable to get more immigrants from the United Kingdom because they at least speak one of our official languages.</block>

<p>The he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Others have made statements in regard to religious affiliations of immigrants &#x2026;</block>

<p>He was referring to the Nats&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; when these matters are raised in regard to the question of immigration, when language and religion play a part, I doubt the sincerity of the immigration policy of the department.</block>

<p>He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; as far as I am concerned, the only criterion should be the use a man will serve to the country &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is what the hon. member for Albany, too, has said now&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and not the language he speaks or the religion he worships. The higher he is skilled, the better we can use him.</block>

<p>I want to ask the hon. member whether these are the criteria which they want to apply for bringing immigrants into the country.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. HENNING</person>:</from>

<p>They want to bring the Peter Hains and the Homes into the country. Bring in that type, they say. They get upset when we say that Gen. Smuts said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Bring in the good and the bad.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Port Natal and the hon. member for Albany advocated exactly the same thing. They still stand by what was said in August, 1946, i.e., &#x201C;bring in the good and the bad&#x201D;, as long as he is able to hit on an anvil with a hammer. They advocate inferior selection standards.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the decrease in our immigration figures. The hon. member for Geduld referred to them and if one takes a quick look at the figures, there was in fact a decrease. The actual number of immigrants we had last year, was 35 845. only 5 670 fewer than in the previous year. As the hon. member for Geduld rightly said, although there was a decrease of 5 000 in the total number of immigrants, there was a drop of only 400 as far as the number of economically active immigrants is concerned. I say that this is a minimal decrease. In the first place, we bring those people into the country in order to place them in employment and in order to supplement the manpower shortage. There was a decrease of only 400 in respect of the previous year&#x2019;s figures. <span class="col_7829-7830" refersTo="page_0869"/>Let us examine the reasons why there was such a shortfall, especially as regards immigrants from the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>If one makes an analysis, one finds that we received approximately 4 000 fewer immigrants from the United Kingdom. Now I just want to refresh hon. members&#x2019; memories a little. The hon. members will remember that in 1971 there were postal strikes in the United Kingdom which lasted virtually four months. In that period we received no mail from Great Britain. That is one of the major reasons why we received fewer immigrants from the United Kingdom. We received 1400 fewer immigrants from the African states. Surely it is obvious that we should expect that source to run dry at some time or other. We received approximately 1000 fewer immigrants from the rest of Europe. Now I want to say to hon. members that there is a reason for that as well. The hon. member for Geduld referred to it. In a country like Germany there are more than 3 million foreign workers. In France there are 2&#x00BD; million and in Britain there is more than a million. Surely we cannot expect to receive the number we expected from those countries. Our aim still is to get between 35 000 and 40 000 immigrants. What is more, we have maintained this. We are maintaining it without abandoning standards.</p>

<p>I want to plead with the hon. the Minister that we should never in any way abandon our standards or lower them. If we did so, we would be-making a fatal mistake. In conclusion, I want to bring one request to the attention of the hon. the Minister. It is a requirement that when an immigrant applies for citizenship, he should have a knowledge of at least one of the official languages. Today I want to make a serious plea, not in respect of the older immigrants, but in respect of the young immigrants, that when they apply for citizenship, they should have a knowledge of both official languages, especially when they are under a certain age. The older people may still fall under the old Act, but I want to advocate to the Minister that we should expect the younger immigrant applying for citizenship, to know both languages before he qualifies as a citizen of the country.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in reply to the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark, who has just sat down, I want to say that, if I was thinking of emigrating to South Africa after having heard his speech, I would certainly not set foot here. I want to deal with this hon. member as well as the hon. member for Boksburg, who made practically the same speech here, word for word, on Friday during the Police Vote. I shall read a translation extraction from his Hansard. The hon. member was referring to me in his speech on Friday. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to say to him that, should he make himself guilty &#x2026; action against him by the Security Police will have our blessing. Should that be the case, it will have our blessing if they lock him up. I want to know from the hon. member, should he have a desire to serve South Africa &#x2026; and let us look at this face to face, he should pack his belongings and leave South Africa, go to Britain where you can act with your spiritual friend, Peter Hain, in order to secure the downfall of South Africa.</block>

<p>That is what the hon. member said on Friday. The hon. member for Vanderbijlpark said something similar today. I want to say to those two hon. members that I came to this country with my parents as an immigrant, and I served in the uniform of South Africa during the war. I do not know where the hon. members were, but I want to say to them that I saw people die in the uniform of South Africa and no one asked them what language they spoke before they died. I further want to say to those hon. members that I do not know where they served when South Africa needed their services, but I served South Africa despite the fact that I came to South Africa and was not born here. I want to tell them that there are hundreds of thousands of people in South Africa like myself, who are just sick and tired of utterances of the sort that we have heard this afternoon and on Friday. I do not know how one can answer such un-South African attacks upon another South African in this House. I challenge both of those two members to repeat what they have said outside the walls of this Chamber. They will not have the courage to do so.</p>

<p>I would like now to come back to the hon. the Minister of Immigration who, after all, is the gentleman in charge of this portfolio. I want to say to him that, if he does not get up in this House this afternoon and repudiate what those two hon. <span class="col_7831-7832" refersTo="page_0870"/>members have said today and on Friday, every prospective immigrant to South Africa will know exactly how sincere he is with regard to immigration to this country. I want to say to him, too, that it is no wonder that only 10 per cent of the White population of South Africa are South African nationalists. To my mind it would be no wonder if those people who are living in South Africa today, people who came out here as immigrants, refuse to take out South African nationality if that is the sort of thing that represents South African nationality in this country.</p>

<p>As my friend here says, at least the voters of South Africa will soon come to their senses and rid themselves of a Government that expresses an opinion of that nature. You see, Sir, we come from a stock&#x2014;we immigrants can also talk of &#x201C;stock&#x201D;&#x2014;that is not easily intimidated by a bunch of bullies on the other side.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">CHAIRMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Order! The hon. member must withdraw that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#winchester">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>I withdraw it, Mr. Chairman. The hon. Minister&#x2019;s speech has been quoted to him by my friend from Albany and also by the hon. member for Zululand. He quoted the speech of Prof. Swart in Port Elizabeth. I ask the hon. the Minister, if he is sincere, whether he is going to get up and apologize for the speech he made and referred to by the hon. member for Albany, and whether he is going to repudiate the speech made by this professor in Port Elizabeth. If he refuses to do so, I and thousands of others can take it for granted that while the Government talks that it needs immigration it is certainly not sincere in getting immigrants. The only type of immigrant it wants is one that will support the Nationalist Party. If he does not support the Nationalist Party he is not wanted here as an immigrant. I have personal experience of this and I want to bring it to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention. I persuaded a friend of mine to come to South Africa. In our exchange of correspondence he told me that he had some doubts about coming to South Africa, because occasionally people here make anti-English comments. I then wrote back and told him that he had nothing to worry about and that those crackpots were fast disappearing from the political life of South Africa and that this was unlikely to happen. But after the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech in this House wherein he said that some English-speaking people would not be good South Africans this same friend of mine phoned me and said &#x201C;I thought you said that the crackpots were fast disappearing from the political life of South Africa&#x201D;. He has now decided to return to the United Kingdom and it is this Minister who is responsible for the loss of this particular immigrant, and probably many others too.</p>

<p>I would also like to deal very briefly with another matter, namely the question that is asked of immigrants what religion they belong to. We have had the incident in Durban where an immigrant said he had no religion and was then refused permission to take up residence in South Africa because of it. It transpired that this immigrant was perfectly honest. He was not a churchgoing man and subsequently said that he had no religion. What I find particularly strange is that the Government acts against such an immigrant because he has no religion, while religious workers cannot immigrate to South Africa. They can only come here on temporary permits or visas. I find this particularly strange. In the one instance the Government acts because a man says that he has no religion, but when a religious worker wants to come here, he is not allowed to come or restrictions are put in his way to make it difficult.</p>

<p>I therefore want to say to the Minister in all seriousness that surely such an attitude towards religion is nothing more and nothing less than sheer hypocrisy. While a person is asked whether he is a religious person or a Christian I want to ask what person born in South Africa can say, in view of some of the things we do, that we are a religious people? I therefore say to the Minister that he would have to go a long way to try to convince me that he is sincere about this question of obtaining immigrants.</p>

<p>In conclusion I would again like to say to those two hon. members, particularly to <span class="col_7833-7834" refersTo="page_0871"/>the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark, than he and other members on that side have raised the question of what Gen. Smuts is supposed to have said, namely &#x201C;Bring all, bring the good and the bad&#x201D; in 1946.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>I have on a previous occasion read out what Gen. Smuts said and he never said that at all. I do not wish to repeat it, because hon. members can see it in their Hansard. I think the matter came up two years ago. If I had the time I would read that speech out again, but that is certainly not true. Gen. Smuts never opened the flood-gates to all and sundry. I also want to say to that hon. member, before my time expires, that he must remember that he is a descendant of an immigrant himself. Everyone in this House is a descendant of an immigrant. I want to ask those hon. members whether their forefathers would be proud of some of the things their descendants say today. I am quite certain in my own mind that they would be ashamed of some of the things we have had from hon. members opposite. I want to say to all people who are thinking of emigrating to South Africa that they must take heart, because this Government is coming to the end of its tether, because every Government which behaves in such a manner should come to the end of its tether. The signs are there for all to see. Immigrants should come to South Africa, and those here should become South African citizens, because sanity will surely return to South Africa in the not too distent future.</p>

<p>The hon member for Port Natal who has just resumed his seat, made quite a remarkable speech in more than one respect, a speech which has struck one for various reasons. One of the first things that struck one was the over-sensitiveness he displayed on account of the references made by hon. friends for Boksburg and Vanderbijlpark to the spiritual kinship with Peter Hain. I have here in front of me a newspaper cutting, which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<p>However, he did so in a very improper way. He referred to it, but he did not deny that he had said it. Now I put it to you, Sir, that a person who says things such as those I have here in front of me&#x2014;and stands here in inverted commas&#x2014;can only be a person who has a spiritual kinship with Peter Hain. What right does he have to raise a hue and cry here about his attitude as far as these matters are concerned and to say that he is a good South African when this is the language he uses? What incentive is this for prospective immigrants to come to South Africa!</p>

<p>What is more, the hon. member also referred to those immigrants who do not accept South African citizenship. I can understand now that the hon. member, particularly in the constituency he represents, is very concerned that they do not accept South African citizenship. Here is the answer. The newspaper which supports them, the <i>Sunday Times,</i> of 27th June, 1971, had a very prominent heading, which reads&#x2014;Help us beat Nats; U.P. appeals to immigrants&#x201D;. This is the key to the question he has asked as to why they do not accept citizenship. This is the reason why he is concerned about it. He has always <span class="col_7835-7836" refersTo="page_0872"/>regarded the immigrant as a potential ally to bring the National Party, and in that way Afrikanerdom, on its knees. But I now say straightaway that neither that hon. member nor any of the other members of the United Party will succeed in estranging from the National Party any of the immigrants who come to South Africa and become good citizens of South Africa.</p>

<p>He also denied that Gen. Smuts had said in 1946 that both the good and the bad should come in. If he denies this he is either quite stupid or he is deliberately trying to mislead the committee; because here I have the words of Gen. Smuts.</p>

<p>Here I have the words of General Smuts, and they were not published in an Afrikaans newspaper&#x2014;it was published in the <i>Argus</i> of 14th August, 1946. This is stated here quite Clearly. It concerns a speech made by Gen. Smuts when he addressed the general committee of the United Party in the Transvaal. He was referring to the past and said&#x2014;</p>

This has never been denied. Here it is in Hansard of 17th February, 1948: Criminals who had 37 convictions against them came into the country. The United Party, which were governing at that time, refused to lift a finger because, in the words of Gen. Smuts, the good and the bad were to come in. and South Africa simply had to digest them.</p>

<p>Sir, we can carry on in this vein but I do not think this will bring us anywhere. I think that if we want to conduct a meaningful debate on immigration, it would be best if we nit the policy and standpoint of the United Party against that of the National Party as far as immigration is concerned. That idiom in which the United Party spoke when it was in power is the idiom in which members of the United Party are still speaking today. I think I have furnished adequate proof that this is so. Since last night we have found that the hon. member for Zululand has been complaining because not enough immigrants are entering the country at present. That has been replied to, but I just want to remind you, Sir, that we had 35 845 immigrants last year. Once again the inference one has to draw from this is that the United Party has ulterior motives. The United Party has always been outspoken on their standpoint as far as our labour problems are concerned. Their solution of our labour problems has always been that we should use non-Whites and not necessarily immigrants. They want the immigrants for a different <span class="col_7837-7838" refersTo="page_0873"/>purpose. I have evidence of that as well. When they complain that not enough immigrants are entering the country, there are other reasons for that. Major-General I. P. de Villiers, who was chairman of the immigration Board, said in East London in February, 1948, that South Africa at that time was the only dominion which had the full co-operation of the British Department of Labour as far as obtaining immigrants was concerned. He said the reasons for this was that South Africa&#x2019;s White population had to be supplemented and that the Commonwealth should have a firm basis in South Africa. That was the reason. That was in 1948, when that side of the House was in power; at that time they could still try and do these things. When they complain here that not enough immigrants are entering the country, they do so because they have ulterior motives, viz., to try and bring the National Party on its knees and in that way try to bring Afrikanerdom to its knees. This is the idiom in which they were speaking. As far as the National Party is concerned the policy is quite clear, i.e. that what counts is quality, not numbers. I want to say today that I am convinced that I am speaking on behalf of every right-minded person in this country when I say that we are grateful to the hon. the Minister, his department and his officials, who see to it that quality is the primary consideration when it comes to bringing immigrants to this country and that numbers is of secondary concern.</p>

<p>I want to put another question to the United Party: What happened when they were in power? Let us look at the history of this matter. It was not only Whites they allowed into this country; they also allowed non-Whites as immigrants into the country. I want to ask today whether they would do this again if they were to come into power. In 1947 over 800 non-White immigrants from various countries entered the country.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I was very amused by the diatribe we have just had from the hon. member for Springs. It was a former Minister of Immigration, the late Mr. Trollip, a Nationalist Government Minister of Immigration at the time, who told this House some years before his death, that the immigration policy of the Nationalist Party was exactly the same, when it came to sifting people for immigration purposes, as it was in Smutss day, except, of course, for the difference that this Government pays their passage, whereas we did not pay their passages. In view of the things he has said, I should like to ask that hon. member under whose administration Mr. Tsafendas entered this country in order to assassinate the Prime Minister.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_immigration">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF IMMIGRATION</person>:</from>

<p>He was never an immigrant.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>That hon. member made a very violent speech here today, and I should like to remind this House that Mr. Tsafendas, when he was in this country, working in this House as a messenger, was under a deportation order. So, just how safe can any of us feel under this administration?</p>

<p>I want to refer to the question of allowing people into this country or refusing them entry on the grounds of their religion. I want to refer specifically to the case of Mr. Eric Mller from Denmark who wrote &#x201C;no religion&#x201D; on his form. He was a constructional engineer, and before he was refused admission, he received a letter from the Secretary for Immigration which read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is noted from your application that you have stated that you have no religion. In the circumstances, please inform me whether you are a confirmed atheist, agnostic, humanist, etc. In this regard I shall nevertheless be grateful if you would furnish me with a brief exposition of the doctrine to which you adhere.</block>

<p>Leaving out &#x201C;atheist&#x201D; and &#x201C;agnostic&#x201D; in this instance, I may say that we know already, from the narrowness of the Government&#x2019;s approach, that a &#x201C;humanist&#x201D; suggests to the Minister and his cronies, a kind of <span class="col_7839-7840" refersTo="page_0874"/>neo-communist, a universal slob, a potentially dangerous individual, whose real object is the preaching of the gospel of equality, and who very often has sinister and subversive ideological political motives. But what did the official who wrote to Mr. Moller mean when he asked him whether he was a humanist? What had this, in the first instance, to do with this man&#x2019;s professional competence, and what is the Minister&#x2019;s definition of a humanist? Has anyone in the department given this matter any serious thought at all, apart from the clich-ridden replies to which we are accustomed? I should like to ask the hon. the Minister how competent the officials of his department are to judge these matters, or how competent the members of the board are, for that matter. Could any single one of them get up and define, if they were asked to, what they meant by a &#x201C;humanist&#x201D;, or do they decide according to popular political clichs alone? What qualifications, in the realms of theological, philosophical or metaphysical thought, have the six main members of the immigrants Selection Board to enable them to reject an immigrant who says firstly that, he does not have any specified religion, or secondly, that he might, for argument&#x2019;s sake, be a humanist It seems to me most unlikely that they have any of these qualifications because four of the main members of the board are public servants. I am not speaking now of the long list of Government officials whose names the Minister gave me in reply to a question, who sift the applications in the first place. But there are six main members of the board, who are appointed, and four of those six are permanent civil servants. I have yet to hear that theology or philosophy is a qualification that is necessary for membership of the Public Service. One of them is a former officer of the Security Police and, oddly enough, one of them, the late Mr. Trollip, who, as the hon. the Minister knows, was for many years a Cabinet Minister, was a member of that board himself. But the interesting thine is that the late Mr. Trollip, when challenged in a debate in the Other Place by the Opposition. about keeping people out on religious grounds, said this in his capacity as Minister (Senate Hansard of 15th February, 1968, column 216/7)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I wish to refute the. allegation that we discriminate on the grounds of nationality and religion.</block>

<p>When he was questioned again by hon. Senators on the Opposition side, the hon. the Minister, from that side of the House, went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; it is not&#x2014;and never has been&#x2014; Government policy to discriminate against any immigrant on grounds of nationality or religion. I want that on record.</block>

<p>Well, Sir, that is very interesting. Since when has the policy of the Government changed in this matter?</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>I want to know from the hon. the Minister why his views on this matter have suddenly changed. You know. Sir, there are people in this world who have written books on the subject of humanists. I have a book here which was edited by Sir, Julian Huxley. He himself wrote the foreword, and it is called <i>The Humanist Frame</i>. He mentions the alarming problems facing the world and the stimulating challenges, and he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What are those challenging monsters in our evolutionary path? I would list them as follows: The threat of super-scientific war (nuclear, chemical and biological); the threat of over-population: the rise and appeal of communist ideology, especially in the under-privileged sectors of the people; the erosion of the world&#x2019;s cultural variety; the widening gap between the haves and the have-nots.</block>

<p>This is his definition of the problems and the dangers facing people. He mentions these as a humanist. But I am quite certain that in terms of this Government&#x2019;s thinking, so little do they know about it. that a humanist to them means somebody who automatically has subversive views. Does the hon. the Minister not know&#x2014;I am quite sure that the members of his board do not know&#x2014;that all the early humanists were Christians anyway? Sir, I ask the hon. the Minister: Is it not possible that countless people in the modern world, who find the more rigid institutionalized patterns of the orthodox churches difficult to follow, may set themselves completely laudable ethical standards which are every bit as high as those of people who profess to <span class="col_7841-7842" refersTo="page_0875"/>adhere to any one of the orthodox religious denominations? In any event, Sir, who are we to judge in matters of this kind? If a potential immigrant from another country has a bad police record, or a history of political subversion, that is quite a different matter. But I think one&#x2019;s ethic, one&#x2019;s religion, is an intensely personal thing, and it is a gross violation of the individual&#x2019;s privacy for any Government department or any representative of any Government department to intrude in matters of this kind. We take the greatest exception to the manner in which this subject has been handled.</p>

<p>Sir, in the time left to me I want to ask what criteria the Minister or his board uses when it comes to refusing certain Indians the right of entry to this country. I have the case of an old lady called Mrs. Osman. Both the sons and their families have been permanently domiciled in South Africa for years and years. She was a widow aged 68 years. She had been married to her husband here in South Africa in 1928. She became a South African citizen. He died in 1940, and in 1941 she went alone to India to see her relations, and she remained there until she came back to see her sons in 1971. She is crippled with arthritis. She hoped to be allowed, when she came here, to remain with her sons until she died. She owns property to the value of R40 000 in South Africa, so she would not have been a burden to the State. The medical evidence was that she was not fit to travel again. After continued representationsby me, by the hon. member for Constantia and the hon. member for Gardens, who took the case over when I went overseas, permission for her to be allowed to remain here with her sons was summarily refused, and two letters were sent to her sons by the department, the first letter demanding to know the date of her departure and the flight number forthwith; and the second letter, a few days later, issued a further directive saying that the department would forthwith, within a matter of hours, utilize the R500 she had left here as a deposit as a visitor, unless they knew her flight number and the date of her departure, as though turning out a sick woman was really going to have all that effect upon the policy of this country. And this hon. Minister has the temerity to get up and say, as he did the other day in this House, with his hand on his heart, that South Africa is a religious country.</p>

<p>He said that in this House on 25th February. Sir, I would like to know just how religious we are in this country under these circumstances. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg has been in trouble on so many occasions during the past session. There were occasions when she was zipped. After having listened to the hon. member one asks oneself whether the hon. Chief Whip on the opposite side, would not have done this House a great favour if he had kept the hon. member for Wynberg permanently zipped, because she has spoken so much nonsense. In the course of my speech I shall come back to what was said by the hon. member. However, in the short time at my disposal I want, by way of introduction, to state briefly the positive standpoint of the National Party in regard to its immigration policy. I do this because I am aware of the fact that there are certain people in South Africa who are opposed to immigration. It is no secret that there are also Afrikaans-speaking people among our population in South Africa who, in the past, have been quite sceptical and even umsympathetic towards large-scale immigration. Even today there are still people who accept the Government&#x2019;s immigration policy with some measure of hesitation. The question now arises whether this National Party Government should proceed with its immigration policy as it was, particularly over the past decade, or whether we have to stop it. To secure work opportunities and a decent standard of living for all the inhabitants of the Republic is no easy task for the Whites with their limited numbers. The only policy which will ensure adequate work opportunities and a decent standard of living is the development of secondary industries in South Africa. In order to develop secondary industries we naturally need people with technical and professional skills.Let me say straight away that we are doing everything in our power here in South Africa to train our people locally, here in our Fatherland, in order to supplement the existing shortages. and particularly viewed in the light of the fact that we have had phenomenal economic development in South Africa over the past ten years and in order to maintain a reasonable growth rate as we should like to have in South Africa, it is basically important that we must allow at least 10 000 economically active persons to come to South Africa by means of immigration. <span class="col_7843-7844" refersTo="page_0876"/>This means a figure of more than 30 000 men, women and children. The doors of South Africa are not being thrown open for every Dick, Tom and Harry to come to South Africa. This was referred to by hon. members on this side of the House who preceded me. They referred to the good and the bad and I do not want to deal with that. But in this particular case I want to compliment the hon. the Minister and his department on the high standards that are being set to draw immigrants to South Africa, because the approach of this National Party Government is to obtain only the best people to come to South Africa.</p>

<p>I actually want to deal with another matter and I want to come back to the hon. member for Zululand and the hon. member for Port Natal. The hon. member for Zululand yesterday referred to a speech made by Prof. Marius Swart of the Port Elizabeth University. I want to tell the hon. member straightaway that where he challenged the hon. the Minister to say whether he agrees with that speech or not, I want to say in all honesty that I do not agree with Prof. Swart on what he said in that speech. Probably he is not aware of the facts and in the course of my speech I am going to refute some of the statements he made. I now want to ask hon. members this, and I am serious. I want to ask those hon. members why they were almost killing themselves with laughter when reference was made in this House yesterday to the Rapportryersvereniging in South Africa? I shall tell you, Sir, why they were laughing. It is because it is the aim of the Rapportryersvereniging of South Africa to promote the Afrikaans language and the Afrikaans culture.</p>

<p>Now, I cannot but make this further statement, that those hon. members, when there are organizations in South Africa to promote the Afrikaans culture and language, merely regard it as a joke. I am referring to the speech made by the hon. the Minister of Defence, and I say this once more in all seriousness. If you want to ridicule those things which are dear to us, as Afrikaans-speaking people, those organizations which have been established to promote the Afrikaans language and cultural possessions. I agree with the hon. the Minister of Defence that there are many Boer-haters sitting on that side of the House. They are Boer-haters and want to ridicule every attempt that is made in this country to promote the Afrikaans language and culture.</p>

<p>The hon. professor made certain statements I want to deal with briefly. It is a pity that these statements have been made; they have probably been made because the professor was not aware of the real facts. In the speech he made he said, <i>inter alia</i>, that fewer than 5 per cent of all the immigrants coming to South Africa join the Afrikaans group. This is a doubtful statement. This is probably an inference drawn from a doubtful source. What are the facts? In 1971, 25,7 per cent of our immigrants came from the Dutch countries of origin, immigrants who should naturally be able to affiliate themselves with the Afrikaans group. If the statement made by the professor is true, it is but sad evidence of the absorbing ability of the Afrikaner as far as people from his countries of origin are concerned. The hon. gentleman made another statement towards the end of his speech (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If our immigration policy in South Africa were to continue as we have had it, particularly over the past decade, it would mean the end of the Afrikaner by the year 1984.</block>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. W. DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>If this statement indicates that it would mean the end of the Afrikaner in 1984. merely 12 years hence, as far as his religion, denomination and language position as against other religions and languages in the country are concerned this&#x2014;and I say this in all modestv&#x2014;borders on irresponsibility. Therefore, the motive for this statement also has to be questioned. What are the facts? 49 per cent of the total White population belong to the three Afrikaans churches. A further 3 per cent of the population belong to the Apostolic Faith Mission which is also predominantly Afrikaans. The other Protestant churches, namely the Lutheran, Methodist, Presbyterian and Anglican churches represent a further 25 per cent of the population. The Roman Catholic Church, over the ten years, evidenced a growth of 58 per cent and grew from 6,2 per cent in 1960 to 8.2 per cent of the White population in 1970. Only a portion of this could be attributed to immigration, <span class="col_7845-7846" refersTo="page_0877"/>because in 1960, 6,2 per cent of the White population were Catholics and the natural increase must also be taken into account. However, it is not true that our immigration policy has contributed towards a drop in the number of Whites belonging to the D.R. Church. As a matter of fact, the D.R. Church evidenced a growth of 12,3 per cent over the ten years. In addition, the two other sister churches, viz. the Gereformeerde Kerk and the Nederduits Hervormde Kerk each evidenced a growth of 15,2 per cent and 15,7 per cent, respectively. This amounts to a total growth of 13 per cent.</p>

<p>Then I also want to say something in regard to the language. It is quite interesting to note that statistics over the past 35 years show that there has been no change in the ratio between the Afrikaans-speaking and English-speaking people. I want to draw attention briefly to the statistics from 1960 to 1970. It was during the ten years when the National Party actually accelerated its immigration policy. The ratio between people was as follows: In 1960, 59 per cent Afrikaners as against 37,8 per cent English-speaking people and in 1970, 58.6 per cent as against 37 per cent. Also as far as this aspect is concerned, it proves quite clearly that the ratio between English-speaking people and Afrikaans-speaking people showed virtually no change in spite of our immigration policy.</p>

<p>My time is almost up but there is one final thought I want to express in regard to immigration. What I am going to say now, I say in all seriousness. We accept the fact that it is imperative that we in South Africa should draw certain immigrants from other countries to come and help us to develop our economy and to develop this wonderful country of ours &#x2026; [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the basic difficulty the Nationalist Party has in a debate of this kind, and it shines through as clearly as anything when you listen to the speeches made on that side, is that they are totally opposed to immigration of any kind. Let us face it. One only has to read the policy statements by the late hon. Senator Trollip made in the Senate in 1967 on the policy motion of immigration, to see that. He made a speech specifically designed to refute all the allegations we have had here this afternoon. The allegations did not come from us, but from the Nationalist Party. I was in the Senate at that time and it was very interesting to see that throughout the speech of Senator Trollip there was a chorus of &#x201C;hear, hears&#x201D;, which did not come from Government members, but from hon. Senators on the Opposition benches. Hon. members will see this in the Senate Hansard of that time. The hon. Senator Trollip was trying to defend himself and his policy against the verkrampte members of the National Party. The allegation has been made here this afternoon that it was the United Party&#x2019;s immigration policy during the time that it was in power, to bring in largely English-speaking immigrants from the English language areas of the world, in order to plough the Afrikaner under and in order to displace the existing ratio between the two language groups in the country.

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. gentleman says that I must check it. This is one of the very allegations which the late Senator Trollip refuted in his speech in, the Senate in 1967. I hope the hon. member will listen for a moment because I am going to quote Senator Trollip on that very issue. He said the following in column 300:</p>

<block name="quote">Thirdly, fears have been expressed that the immigrants would jeopardize our national set-up and our way of life.</block>

<p>This was said by a Nationalist Minister. I quote further:</p>

<block name="quote">These fears will certainly become a reality if religious, cultural and educational leaders as well as the man in the street were to adopt not only a passive and a disinterested but also a markedly openly expressed antagonistic attitude towards all or most immigrants.</block>

<p>He was warning against the very attitude that we have seen displayed here today. He went on to say:</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_7847-7848" refersTo="page_0878"/>No self-respecting immigrant can be expected to feel attracted to a particular cultural or language group if he is told beforehand that he is not wanted by that group.</block>

<block name="quote">No action on the part of the Government except to bring immigration to a virtual standstill can remedy the position as foreseen by some critics. The various groups, collectively and individually, have it within their own power to counteract the happenings which are predicted and which may cause concern.</block>

<p>What he was referring to was speeches and articles in the Press at the time, expressing the very sentiments we have had here this afternoon from hon. Government members.</p>

<p>Order! The hon. member does not want to answer a question.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>If I had time I would have answered it.</p>

<block name="quote">Then he went on to say:</block>

<block name="quote">They have it within their power. Perhaps I should point out that of the 356 250 immigrants who entered South Africa between the years 1925 and 1960 &#x2026;</block>

<p>I hope the hon. member will listen to this, because this is the answer to the point he has just raised. I repeat what the Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; Perhaps I should point out that of the 356 250 immigrants who entered South Africa between the years 1925 and 1960, only 38 336 were Hollanders. According to the arguments advanced by some critics over 330 000 of the 1925 to 1960 intake must, therefore, have been English or potential English-speaking persons.</block>

<p>Here is the point; he goes on to say:</p>

<block name="quote">Despite this fact, statistics reflect the following language pattern, and I think this is most interesting.</block>

<p>He goes on to say that whereas in 1936 only 55,0 per cent of the people had Afrikaans as their mother tongue and 39,1 per cent had English as their mother tongue, the figures at the end of that period, including the United Party&#x2019;s period of office, were that the Afrikaans-speaking percentage had increased by nearly 3 per cent to 58 per cent and the English-speaking section had decreased by 2 per cent to 37 per cent. There is the answer to the allegations that under the United Party regime only one section was brought in deliberately to change the language ratio in this country. Quite the reverse happened. The Afrikaans-speaking section was strengthened and the English-speaking section decreased. One could go on to read the whole of the hon. Senator Trollip&#x2019;s speech on that occasion, because he set out deliberately to refute almost every argument we have heard here this afternoon.</p>

<p>I said yesterday that we should take a leaf out of the book of the United States because we have seen what immigration has done for the strength and the development of that country. I have no doubt that it was as a result of what I said yesterday that we have heard some of the sentiments expressed here this afternoon, viz. that large-scale immigration will change the character of your country. I do not believe that is so and I believe that the United States can show that to us. If you have a sound, basic, national character of your own in your country, you will absorb the immigrants. You can bring them in their tens of thousands and you will absorb them just as the basic national character of the United States has not altered despite the tens of millions of immigrants that have gone to that country They have added to the flavour of the United States&#x2019; character, but they have not altered the basic character of those people. I believe that here in South Africa we have a basic, national character which is sufficiently strong to absorb double the quantity of immigrants we are bringing in at the present time.</p>

<p>Finally, I should like to refer to the hon. member for Springs, who used both arguments: The one that we wish to open the flood-gates so far as the non-Europeans coming into the labour force was concerned, <span class="col_7849-7850" refersTo="page_0879"/>and that we wish to open the floodgates so far as bringing in immigrants is concerned. Both are false, of course. The United Party&#x2019;s immigration policy, as the late Senator Trollip said in this House in answer to Mr. Tucker, who was then a member here, was exactly the same as the policy of this Government is, so far as selection is concerned. The only change, as the hon. member for Wynberg has said, is that now they are paid to come here whereas, in the days of the United Party, they had to pay their own fares. So far as the hon. member for Springs is concerned, I would refer him to a speech by this hon. Minister in 1971, last year, in column 5450 of Hansard. I must summarize what the hon. the Minister said, because I have no time left. He said that in many respects he prefers to bring the non-European into certain categories of work rather than use the immigrant, because the non-European is someone we know whereas the immigrant is not always assimilable. Therefore do not let us have that sort of accusation from the hon. member either.</p>

<p>I come then to the hon. member who referred to an extract I had quoted of Prof. Swart&#x2019;s speech. It is interesting that in his reply he refers only to the more factual allegations or misstatements that Prof. Swart made, whilst saying that he disagrees with that speech. The trouble is that we are reaching the stage in this House that any criticism which is levied by this side of the House against what anybody in public life in South Africa says, and against what a prominent Nationalist, in particular, says, meets with the invariable reaction these days that one is criticizing him not because of what he says or does, but because he happens to be an Afrikaansspeaking South African. It is a tragedy when we reach this state of affairs. This is precisely the impression he gave so far as one&#x2019;s criticisms of Prof. Swart are concerned.</p>

<speech by="#vosloo">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased the hon. member for Wynberg is present at the moment, because I should like to say how I see the full story of immigration. In actual fact it is the story of a courtship which ends in marriage. So it is a good thing that a lady also participated in the debate. The courting which leads to this marriage is, of course, the work done by the Department of Immigration in recruiting immigrants abroad. This is also done by local industries and others. When the immigrant comes to this country and the process of assimilation starts, one can call it the engagement period. It is the engagement period of this young lady which eventually ends in marriage when that immigrant obtains citizenship by means of naturalization. Just as the girl intends changing her name, so the immigrant intends changing his fatherland. In this process of assimilation or engagement, overtures are made from both sides. This is never a one-sided affair. The mother-in-law of this bride regards this beauty with suspicion. She fears her son will be taken away from her and she fears that the bride will estrange him and that the things she taught him as a mother will be forgotten by him. She fears that the bride-to-be wants to marry her son for material gain.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>*Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>Why?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#vosloo">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>On the other hand, the bride-to-be regards her prospective in-laws with as much jealousy and suspicion. Just as any other bride, she has financial security in mind. Therefore the process of assimilation should be a two-way process. The one party cannot do all the courting. From our side we must, firstly, render all assistance to the bride-to-be and assist her to come to love her new home. That is to say, we should help her to be loyal to South Africa and to love South Africa.</p>

<p>&#x2020;As we know, approximately 43 per cent of the total number of immigrants who have arrived in South Africa over the past <span class="col_7851-7852" refersTo="page_0880"/>ten years, originated from Great Britain or from one of the other English-speaking countries. I therefore think I have the right to make an urgent appeal to my fellow English-speaking South Africans to do their share in ensuring that the thousands of brides-to-be are given a chance to love and cherish their new adopted home. I do this with respect&#x2014;and I would like the hon. member for Wynberg to listen now&#x2014;because over the last few years I have not heard on one occasion, except over the radio, our National Anthem being sung in the official translated form, namely the Call of South Africa. As an Afrikaansspeaking South African I proudly sing Die Stem, on State, cultural and even on political occasions, but not once have I heard the Call of South Africa being sung at any function where a large number of English-speaking South Africans and immigrants who are not yet naturalized, were present. I therefore make this appeal to my English-speaking colleagues to help to create a feeling of love and loyalty for our country amongst the thousands of English-speaking brides-to-be. I would therefore like to refer to a few phrases of our translated National Anthem. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At thy call we shall not falter, firm and steadfast we shall stand.</block>

<block name="quote">At thy will to live or perish, O South Africa, dear land.</block>

<p>While I am busy on the subject of wedding bells and wedding ceremonies, allow me to add these last lines&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When the wedding bells are chiming or when those we love depart,</block>

<block name="quote">Thou dost know us for thy children and dost take us to thy heart.</block>

<block name="quote">Loudly peals the answering chorus: We are thine, and we shall stand,</block>

<block name="quote">Be it life or death, to answer to thy call, beloved land.</block>

<p>*I make bold to say that unfortunately hardly any or none of my hon. English-speaking colleagues in this House has ever sung this National Anthem in their own English language. Furthermore, I want to make bold &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>*Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>We sing it in Afrikaans.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#vosloo">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>I ask them to sing it in their own language for the sake of our English-speaking immigrants. I can imagine that there are many of them who have not yet even read this translated National Anthem. I make this appeal in the hope that after years there will be no need for us again to ask our new citizens to affirm their loyalty to South Africa. Likewise, I make an appeal to everyone of us who has contact with immigrants, to go out of our way to inform them of our mores, our customs and our racial relations, and especially of the laws of our country.</p>

<p>I request the hon. the Minister, who is also in charge of the portfolio of Social Welfare and Pensions, to make it a set rule that the permanent or temporary residential permit of any immigrant who commits an offence under, for example, the Drugs Act, be withdrawn forthwith by the Department of the Interior.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I am accepting the statement by the hon. member for Zululand that America has become a very strong and mighty state because of immigration; but my plea is that South Africa be made strong through quality and loyalty, and not necessarily through quantity.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_immigration">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF IMMIGRATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, at the end of this debate I think it is necessary for us to take a look at various matters that have been raised here and then, finally, perhaps to take a general look at immigration as a whole and at what we are envisaging with our immigrants in South Africa.</p>

<p>In the first place the hon. member for Zululand yesterday afternoon began by criticizing my department and myself because there was no annual report which he could use. The fact of the matter is that, when this Vote was discussed in 1970, the hon. member for Zululand had a great deal of praise for the first report of the department, which covered the period from 1st April, 1961, to 30th June, 1968, more than seven years. After that report it was decided to draw up biennial reports, because our report consists mainly of statistics. These we get from the Department of Census and Statistics. It is not so easy to have the immigration figure available early enough to make a report available now which includes last year&#x2019;s figures. In fact, we only received them a few weeks ago. All the details one needs for such a report <span class="col_7853-7854" refersTo="page_0881"/>simply cannot be made available within three or four months after the end of the year. That is why we have decided to publish a report every two years. Accordingly I received the next report, i.e. the report of last year, when we debated the report covering the period up to 30th June, 1970. I then told the hon. member that we would be able to debate figures again in two years&#x2019; time. In other words, next year he will again get a report, which will cover the period up to 30th June, 1972. This is the practice. I hope the hon. member does not take it amiss of me.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deacon">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. D. DEACON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I just ask a question in this connection? Is the hon. the Minister prepared to make the figures available to us before the debate takes place, even if there is no report?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But of course. If any hon. member should ask me questions about the matter, or should personally telephone my department, all the statistics we have will be made available to him, but this year no inquiries were made in this connection. We did not have the figures officially until about four weeks ago, when I received the final figures for this year for the first time. We had figures up to the end of October. We receive them from time to time. I am prepared to furnish these figures, and I immediately want to tell the hon. member that I do not take it amiss of him. I think there has merely been a misunderstanding about the situation. Next year there will be a report for the period ending on 30th June, 1972. The year after that there will again be no report. There is therefore going to be a report every two years only. I just want to make this very clear to the hon. member in advance.</p>

<p>The question why we received fewer immigrants this year than in previous years has been argued in the debate. Perhaps it is necessary for me to say a few words about that, because it is true that, while we had received more than 41 000 immigrants in the previous year, the figure dropped to 35 845 last year. This is a decrease of just over 5 000. What are the actual facts? Some of the reasons have already been mentioned by hon. members on this side of the House. One of the first reasons is that most countries in Europe, especially during the first part of last year, experienced a tremendous boom in the economic field, and themselves had hundreds of thousands and even millions of foreign workers in their own countries. Consequently there was no tendency in those countries to send out emigrants, for the very reason that there was such a great shortage of manpower in their own countries. There was therefore no initiative to induce people to leave. I may just quote a few figures in this connection. According to a periodical dated February, 1972, there were 2 976 000 foreign workers in Germany in February, 1972, 2 664 000 in France, 983 000 in Switzerland, 655 000 in Belgium, 66 000 in Holland and 1 923 000 in Britain. These were the numbers of foreign workers in those countries themselves. If it is the position that there is such a shortage of manpower in those countries that they must have so many foreign workers, then surely it is logical that there is no strong pressure in that country for people to emigrate. Surely that is the logical deduction we must immediately make.</p>

<p>The immigrant figure has not dropped in South Africa alone. The figures have also dropped in other immigration countries, such as Australia and Canada. I quote from the annual report of the Canadian Department of Manpower and Immigration. This report states that in the 1970&#x2013;&#x2019;71 financial year 17 000 fewer immigrants immigrated to Canada as compared with the previous year. According to the <i>Weekly Newsletter</i> of the Australian News Information Service the number of immigrants from Britain to Australia decreased by one-third, while 17 000 former immigrants returned to Britain from Australia. The Canadians ascribe this drop to &#x201C;buoyant economic conditions in most of Western Europe&#x201D;. This is the reason advanced by them, but in our country the Government is blamed for the decrease in the figure. I admit that the figure decreased, but then I want to add immediately: Hon. members are welcome to look up my speeches since I became Minister, and they will find that I said from the beginning that our target is a figure of between 35 000 and 40 000. I have said this many times. I have also said that if it was a little more or a little less than that figure, we would not be concerned about it, because that was just more or less the target we had set. Our figure for last year of 35 845 is therefore completely within that target, but as hon. members have mentioned, a particularly large percentage of those immigrants are economically active, and although the immigrant <span class="col_7855-7856" refersTo="page_0882"/>figure itself has dropped, the percentage of those who are economically active and who are therefore a gain to the economy of the country has increased compared to the position two or three years ago. In this year there were 16 532 economically active persons in this group of approximately 35 000. That is a percentage of 47, the largest percentage we have had in any year in respect of economically active immigrants.</p>

<p>The postal strike has also been advanced as reason. That is quite right, and it is quite true. But where were the increases and where were the decreases in the various countries? In 1970 we received 21 323 immigrants from Britain, as against 17 347 in 1971, a decrease of approximately 4000 for that year. This was mainly due, initially, as I said, to the postal strike, and furthermore to the fact that in Britain, as a result of her joining the European Economic Common Market and other economic developments, there was not so much economic pressure on immigrants to leave the country. There were decreases in respect of the following countries as well: there were decreases in the number of immigrants from African countries, for understandable reasons, as well as from the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Portugal. These are the countries from which we received fewer immigrants than in the previous year. On the other hand, there was an increase in respect of the following countries: Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Australia and New Zealand. The picture is therefore clearly that the decrease and increase is not due to any attempt on our part to keep certain people out or to bring certain people in, or whatever. It is simply a matter of conditions prevailing in the various countries.</p>

<p>Then there is a further reason for this decrease. The hon. member took it amiss of the hon. the Minister of Planning in an earlier debate that he said it seemed as though the labour needs in South Africa were gradually being met. But we are dealing with facts and statistics here. The Department of Immigration undertakes recruitment for individual employers who are prepared to carry the additional advertising costs in overseas countries. Requests of this nature from employers decreased considerably in 1971, as compared with 1970. In other words, the number of employers in South Africa that normally ask us to recruit people for them abroad, decreased tremendously in the past year. In 1970 508 advertisements were placed in various European countries at the request of 97 employers, advertisements to which we had a reaction from immigrants. In 1971 these requests decreased from 97 to 53, and the number of advertisements decreased from 508 to 344. From this I must conclude that the average employer in South Africa was not as much under the pressure of a manpower shortage this year as he had been in the previous year. The figures prove very clearly that there was not such strong economic pressure, and the hon. the Minister of Planning was therefore quite right.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Zululand also referred yesterday to the speech made by Prof. Marius Swart at a gathering of Rapportryers in which he condemned immigration as a threat to the Afrikaner. I want to make it quite clear to the hon. member that I do not share Prof. Swart&#x2019;s viewpoint in all respects&#x2014;certainly not&#x2014;and I think much of this speech is actually based on false information or insufficient information.</p>

He criticizes Prof. Swart, but he does not criticize the attitude of English-speaking South Africans such as Mr. Stuart Reckling, an influential member of the Durban Chamber of Commerce and chairman of the Chamber&#x2019;s Non-European Affairs Committee, for his artcle in <i>Commercial Opinion</i>, as reported in the <i>Daily News,</i> under the heading &#x201C;Blacks, not settlers, wanted&#x201D;. I have the speech here and I would like to quote from it. This was reported in the <i>Daily News</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Better use of the South African non-White labour force, and not a policy of <span class="col_7857-7858" refersTo="page_0883"/>White immigration, would provide a solution to the country&#x2019;s economic problems, according to a prominent Durban businessman, Mr. G.

<block name="quote">Since this swelling number of immigrants competes with our own people for goods and services in short supply, this constitutes an inflationary influence. Their use of imported goods and remittances to their homelands are an extra burden on the balance of payments.

This is confirmed by the Bantu Wage and Productive Association.

Here we find that a newspaper in Natal which supports that hon. member&#x2019;s party, and which he should be reading every day, damages the Government&#x2019;s whole immigration attempt every week, but we do not get a word of criticism from him. But a speech made by a professor in Port Elizabeth to the Rapportryers is immediately criticized and I am asked to state whether I agree or disagree with the views expressed by this professor.</p>

<p>Sir, it is peculiar that the Deputy Leader of the United Party in Natal does not read the <i>Sunday Tribune</i>. It is very peculiar.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to come back to this article which was also quoted by the hon. member for Springs. I think in that article we can find the reason for this attitude of the United Party. I want to quote from this article written by Mr. Stanley Uys in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of the 27th June, 1971&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Help us Beat Nats: United Party appeals to immigrants: A dramatic change will be brought about in South Africa&#x2019;s electoral pattern if plans now being prepared by the United Party to persuade immigrants to register as South African citizens and as voters are brought to fruition. Preliminary estimates made by United Party experts indicate that since 1950 the total number of immigrants to become eligible for citizenship but who have not become South African citizens is just over 330 000, a staggeringly high figure. If these 330 000 potential voters or, as some Opposition M.P.s refer to them warmly, new South Africans were to become actual voters, a profound change would be brought about in the whole party&#x2019;s political position. The United Party is expected to launch a campaign soon amongst all immigrants who are entitled to South African citizenship, urging them to seek naturalization and, through this, to exercise their full responsibilities in the land of their adoption.</block>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Are you against that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am definitely not opposed to it. But what I do condemn in the strongest terms, is that a political party openly makes an emotional appeal such as this one to a group of people entering our country in order to strengthen and consolidate our country&#x2019;s position, an appeal not to throw in their weight with South Africa, not to take an honest standpoint on South Africa&#x2019;s policy, etc., but to help the United Party to unseat the Government. This I want to condemn in the strongest terms. The logical conclusion of this will be that when I advocate the promotion of immigration at congresses, this question will be put to me: &#x201C;Why do you want to bring immigrants here? The United Party is going to recruit them all to vote for them.&#x201D; If there is one thing which prejudices immigration, it is this cheap propaganda made by the United Party. [Interjections.] I am stating this very clearly. If these people really had immigration at heart and did not only want to make political capital out of it, if they honestly wanted to bring immigrants to South Africa in order to integrate them in the South African community and wanted to afford these people an opportunity of politically deciding for themselves where they wanted to stand, I would say this was in order, but when these people openly make an emotional appeal to immigrants to throw in their weight with one party against another, i.e. to call in outsiders as the arbiters between the two political groups in South Africa, then I am telling you now that you are prejudicing the immigration effort to an enormous extent, and that you will have to understand that time and again I have to make a very firm stand against my own people who are revolting against immigration because this is the way the Opposition is trying to abuse it. Now I want to say at once that I reject this cheap attempt made by the Opposition with the contempt it deserves, for we know <span class="col_7861-7862" refersTo="page_0885"/>our immigrants and we know that as a result of the process of naturalization, in which we are engaged and which is being dealt with by the &#x201C;Maatskappy vir Europese Immigrasie&#x201D; and the 1820 Settlers&#x2019; Organization, they reject this kind of petty politicking, and that they, as future citizens of South Africa, are viewing the matter soberly and taking up attitudes according to their own convictions and are not allowing themselves to be led by the nose by weaknesses such as these. This is very clear, but I reject the attempt made by the Opposition as a base attempt against the whole immigration policy for which we stand.</p>

<p>I want to go further. It is difficult enough to get immigrants, and the hon. members need not make this more difficult. The hon. members are talking as though immigrants are standing ready in queues and waiting for me to press the button for them to come. That is the impression which is being created here, i.e. that I merely have to press the button and then their numbers would be doubled. But are the hon. members aware of the tremendous effort that is being made abroad to prevent people from immigrating to South Africa? Are they aware of the efforts of people who want to undermine us? I am going to quote from the &#x201C;ILO en Apartheid&#x201D;, a booklet published by the International Labour Office in Geneva. I am going to read it in their own Afrikaans, for this is an Afrikaans brochure, no less. I did not make any attempt to improve the rotten Afrikaans used in it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Roep op lidmaat-state en op werkeewers in werkers se organisasies om hulle pogings te verskerp gedurende die internasionale jaar om effektiewe optrede te vorder om die wegwerking van apartheid en die gronde daarvan te verseker en vernaamlik om hulself te onthou van enige beleid wat immigrasie na Suid-Afrika gemaklik maak en aanspoor, sever dit gaan om die beleid van apartheid te bevestig.</block>

<p>This is the kind of attack. The United Nations have also joined in. Here I have the Seventh Special Report on Apartheid, United Nations&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The General Secretary appealed to the recipients of this letter to bring to the attention of the trade union movement or the government in their countries that immigration to South Africa meant a denial of livelihood to Africans, and to discourage would-be immigrants to South Africa.</block>

<p>This is the kind of struggle we have to wage abroad in an attempt to get immigrants. Here our attempts are belittled as though we are engaged in petty things. But I want to read out another quotation. This is a document of the Anti-Apartheid Movement which fell into my hands. At a meeting held in London on 5th April, the following resolution was adopted&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It was agreed that the leaflet &#x201C;What South Africa House won&#x2019;t tell you&#x2019;&#x2019; should be given the widest possible circulation. A co-ordinated picket demo at South African immigration offices throughout the country should be organized in the Autumn, if possible close to the time of the TUC congress. It was agreed that Roger Trask should approach local committees and trade councils in the appropriate areas. It was agreed that a leaflet covering emigration to Rhodesia is urgently needed. Roy Newsom pointed out that many union rule books would prevent unions suspending members who emigrated to South Africa and that we should take every union as a separate case. It was agreed to concentrate our efforts in those areas most important to the South African Government.</block>

<p>This is the struggle we have to contend with for South Africa overseas, and we are getting very little help from the Opposition in this regard. What is this pamphlet that has to be distributed; what are the facts contained in it?&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What South Africa House won&#x2019;t tell you is that if you immigrate to South Africa you will find things a lot different from all those glossy posters. You will go to a country where 81 per cent of the population are ruthlessly oppressed, denied all basic human rights and condemned to live in subjugation to the White man.</block>

<p>This is the kind of propaganda. I could quote more; there are pages of it. Another paragraph reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Maybe your firm is indeed investing in apartheid. If so, it is not in your interests, <span class="col_7863-7864" refersTo="page_0886"/>and certainly not in the interests of the Black people in South Africa.</block>

<p>And so it goes on. The hon. member should not pass it off and treat it as a joke. The fact remains that the Anti-Apartheid Movement is engaged in a campaign to prejudice immigration to South Africa as much as they possibly can. In spite of that we got 35 800 immigrants. This is an exceptional achievement under the circumstances.</p>

<p>The World Council of Churches is engaged in the same thing. It forms part of the forces against which we have to fight. I quote from an article&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The World Council of Churches has announced a full-scale campaign for the complete economic and political isolation of South Africa. It has instructed its 200 member-churches in 83 countries to work not only for a ban on all arms sales to South Africa, but also for a stop to White immigration and to tourism. The meeting was attended by 25 members and consultants from Australia, Belgium, Canada, Columbia &#x2026; the United States of America and the Soviet Union. Discouragement of White immigration to South Africa and tourism to Southern Africa, Malagasy, Malawi and Portugal &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is what is envisaged in regard to this matter. However, this is not only happening in England; it is also happening in other countries of Europe. It is also happening in the Netherlands. The position in the Netherlands is that when a person applies for immigration to South Africa and reports to one of our offices there, we have to refer him to one of the existing immigration centres in the Netherlands, and then they have to handle him: we may not handle that immigrant ourselves. That is the practice.</p>

<p>Here I have a document from one of the three, centres which are supposed to help immigrants to South Africa. It is an &#x201C;open letter from the General Emigration Centre to those considering emigration to the Republic of South Africa&#x201D;. It reads as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dear Reader.</block>

<block name="quote">South Africa as an immigration country is quite different from any other immigration country whatever. In itself that ought to be no reason for the General Emigration Centre to address itself to you in an open letter. The fact that it is different, however, has to do with quite special problems which are not found in any other immigration country and which also have a direct effect on the life of every emigrant &#x2026; Nevertheless, among the Whites there are small minorities that are intent on bringing about better and more humane relations. An emigrant who identifies himself with these minorities may have a very difficult time, but he will be able to live according to his conscience. Nevertheless, one can imagine very well for oneself that any person who is considering plans for emigrating to South Africa will, after carefully examining his own conscience, come to the conclusion that it will be better for him to stay in the Netherlands or to go to another emigration country because he or she would shrink from the tensions and the personal difficulties which being an emigrant in South Africa implies and which, from a moral point of view, it must in fact imply.</block>

<p>This is an open attempt at persuading the immigrant who applies for emigration to South Africa&#x2014;an attempt made on the last day when he fills in the forms&#x2014;to go to another country instead, or to remain in the Netherlands. This is the problem we have to contend with. In spite of these issues and these problems, we have accomplished the said feats. It is in the interests of South Africa&#x2014;economically, socially and otherwise&#x2014;that we bring immigrants to South Africa. It is essential and in the interests of our country. Nobody on this side of the House is opposed to that. In the second place, it is essential for us to select immigrants, and not to throw open the doors to all and sundry. We are not prepared to take everybody, and we are very strict in selecting them. In the third place, there are certain conditions which the Aliens Act of 1937 lays down to me as the Minister and in terms of which I have to select them. It is not being done in an arbitrary manner. There are certain statutory restrictions which were laid down by this Parliament, and in terms of which I am bound as to the manner in which they are to be selected and what aspects I am to take into consideration. I shall say more about that at a later stage. In the fourth place, it is the task of every White South African, once they are here, to try to integrate them in and assimilate them with <span class="col_7865-7866" refersTo="page_0887"/>the existing community in order to make them good South Africans as soon as possible. This is our task and the duty of each of us. I have made that appeal time and again. I have come forward with various efforts to consolidate and promote that assimilation, and I want to express the hope that our people will stop being emotional by raising a dust in regard to these matters, instead of looking at the heart of the matter as it is, namely that those people have come to strengthen our country, and that we shall see to it and ensure that numerically the immigrants entering our country will not disturb drastically the ratio of our language groups. I repeat this undertaking, in spite of the Opposition&#x2019;s criticism, that I as the responsible Minister will see to it that this will not happen.</p>

<p>In the second instance, I shall see to it that it will not disturb drastically the religious relationships in South Africa. I repeat this; I am saying this and doing this because it is my duty towards my country. I want to make it very clear that I shall proceed along these lines, because this is my task.</p>

<p>Then there were references to the question of admitting clergymen. The hon. member for Port Natal, if I remember correctly, spoke about the question of clergymen. I want to say at once that years ago we admitted clergymen as immigrants to this country just as we did any other person. Then we experienced the problem which at present we are still experiencing at times, namely that large numbers of the clergymen were not coming here to preach the Gospel at all, but in fact to indulge in politics. We had the problem that these people started doing that after we had granted them permanent residence in South Africa. In terms of the Act there are only two reasons as a result of which a person&#x2019;s permanent residential permit may be cancelled. The first reason is if that person furnished incorrect information at the time of his application for residence, and the second one is if, within three years after being admitted to this country, that person chan ed his profession without the consent of the Minister concerned. This is what the Act provides. These people&#x2014;I am referring to people with permanent residential permits&#x2014;did not commit either of these offences, i.e. they did not furnish incorrect information, nor did they change their profession, but as a result of the politicking of some of these people&#x2014;the Rev. Crowther, to mention but one example&#x2014;we were compelled to expel and deport these people from the country. This evoked a great deal of sordid publicity which was to the detriment of South Africa. It was in the interests of the country that this had to be done, and we could not do it differently. In the light of this experience the Government has decided that in future no clergyman, irrespective of the church of which he may be a member, will be able to acquire permanent residence in South Africa the moment he arrives here: This applies to clergymen of all churches, and hon. members should not tell me that I am discriminating against this or that church or this or that faith. This applies to everybody. What is the procedure now? Clergymen enter the country on a temporary permit, a permit issued by the Minister of the Interior. That permit is issued in this case for a period of a year. If during that year he engages in the occupation for which he came here, namely that of preaching the Gospel, that permit is automatically extended for another period of a year, if he asks for it. In this way, after four years of unbroken devotion on his part to what he is or ought to be engaged in, namely preaching and spreading the Gospel, we are prepared to consider his application and to agree to his becoming a permanent resident of South Africa. Then we can grant him permanent residence. If, within those four years, he indulges in politics or even enters the field of politics, as is in fact done by some of them, it is not necessary to deport him, and it is not necessary to have a court order and a whole fuss. Then we simply do not renew the temporary permit at the end of that year. Nothing is cancelled; all that happens, is that the temporary permit is not renewed again for the next year. At the end of that year his time will therefore have expired, and then he will have to leave the country.</p>

To prove that our position is very clear, I want to mention a few figures. In 1971 permanent residence was granted to 22 ordained clergymen and 64 other spiritual workers after they had successfully completed their four years in terms of the provisions of the Act. This proves that there is no discrimination against these people. This is our standpoint, and it is as clear as daylight.</p>

<p>Once the jubilation on both sides of the House has died down, I should like to say a few words about the standpoint I take in regard to atheists who want to come to South Africa as immigrants. I want to say at once to the hon. member for Wynberg, who raised this matter, that I am referring specifically and exclusively to atheists. I shall refer to other people in a moment. Irrespective of a person&#x2019;s qualifications, irrespective of the necessity for such a person&#x2019;s position in South Africa, irrespective of what that position may be, I am not prepared to admit to South Africa an atheist who openly indicates in his form that he is an atheist, and who, on further inquiry, confirms that he is one. I refuse to do so, and the reasons for my refusal are as follows &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>What about an agnostic?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am dealing with atheists now. Just wait your turn, for I am coming to all the others in a moment. This is a serious matter. I should like the hon. members to pay some attention, please. My reasons are as follows: The Republic of South Africa Constitution Act, which we all a reed to unanimously, provides the following in section 2&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The people of the Republic of South Africa acknowledge the sovereignty and guidance of Almighty God.</block>

<p>This is our Constitution. This is the basis on which our people rests. Both sides of the House and all faiths in the country rest on that foundation: section 2 of the Constitution. Therefore, irrespective of whether persons hold views of their own on the matter&#x2014;we do have the highest form of religious freedom in our country&#x2014;the people of South Africa have a religious bias as reflected in its Constitution. In the second place, the proceedings of this Parliament are opened daily with a prayer ending in these words&#x2014;I am not scoffing at it, but I am in earnest&#x2014;&#x201C;all which we ask in the name, and for the sake of Our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ&#x201D;. In spite of the religious freedom in South Africa, which is complete, these words prove anew that this Parliament, as the highest Chamber of the people in this country, bows to Christ and believes in Him and is, as a people, a religious people. This is the starting-point.</p>

<p>The Aliens Act, Act No. 1 of 1937, in terms of which I have to select immigrants, provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that the Immigrants Selection Board may not approve the issue of a permit granting an alien the right of permanent residence, unless the applicant&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; is likely to become readily assimilated with the European inhabitants of the Republic of South Africa and to become a desirable inhabitant of the country within a reasonable period after his entry &#x2026;</block>

<p>Now, it is my contention that, if this is the provision and the electorate of South Africa has a Constitution and a parliamentary system such as we have, which rests on these arguments and this basis, then I say that I am not entitled to bring an atheist into the country, because on those grounds he cannot become assimilated with the White inhabitants of South Africa. That is my starting-point.</p>

<p>I am saying this specifically with reference to the atheists, because I took the definition of an &#x201C;atheist&#x201D; as I found it in the <i>Oxford Dictionary</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An atheist is one who denies or disbelieves the existence of a God.</block>

<p>This Parliament cannot say that it believes in the guidance of Almighty God and then admit to the country immigrants who say, &#x201C;I deny and disbelieve the existence of a God.&#x201D; The Oxford Dictionary roes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_7869-7870" refersTo="page_0889"/>&#x2026; one who practically denies the existence of a God by disregard of moral obligations to Him; a Godless man.</block>

<p>This is the definition of an atheist. Then there is the explanation of Gladstone&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">By the atheist I understand the man, who not only holds off like the sceptic from the affirmative, but who drives himself or is driven to the negative assertion in regard to the whole unseen or to the existence of a God.</block>

<p>In an Afrikaans dictionary &#x201C;ateis&#x201D; is defined as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die atesme staan relreg teenoor die teisme. waarvan die grondstelling is dat daar &#x2019;n persoonlike God bestaan.</block>

<p>On the strength of the quotations I have here, I adhere to the view that whereas this country has a religious basis and whereas it professes a God&#x2014;I admit at once that there is religious freedom in South Africa &#x2014;I am not prepared to admit to this country a person who tells me in advance, before leaving his country of origin, that he is an atheist. In other words, a person who says, &#x201C;I adopt a negative approach in regard to a God; I deny the existence of a God; I allow myself to be driven &#x2026;&#x201D; according to the definition, &#x201C;&#x2026; to promoting and propagating the denial of a God&#x201D;, I am not prepared to admit to the country, for then I would be acting contrary to my country&#x2019;s Constitution and to other Acts. That is why I refuse to do so, irrespective of how capable he is and irrespective of how necessary he may be for South Africa in terms of economic standards. That is my starting-point.</p>

<p>As far as other faiths are concerned&#x2014; and here I include agnostics, humanists and faiths with numerous other names&#x2014;it is not automatically an immediate disqualification if a person adheres to such a faith.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>If a person says that he does not know, he is an excellent subject for evangelization work in South Africa and the churches will teach him soon enough what he ought to know. I do not refuse such a person. However, the atheist is refused, and I take this standpoint for the reasons I have just indicated here. Therefore, if these are the facts, the matter is handled by the Immigrants Selection Board. This information does not count against a person, but when he furnishes this information, further inquiries are made as to his faith, whether his attitude is one of complete indifference, hostility or whatever the position may be. Arising out of those facts, the Immigrants Selection Board then decides that they approve or disapprove of the person in question, depending on their own position. The only instruction I have given the Selection Board, is that no atheists should be admitted. Other than that, all other persons form the subject of discussion by the Immigrants Selection Board, and this Board takes a decision after it has obtained all the particulars. I think I have now disposed of the question of faith and of the clergymen.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to say a few words to the hon. member for Albany in regard to the speech I made in this House as well as the speech I made in Brakpan in regard to the two matters on which he has attacked me vehemently and which he has been holding against me. Let us understand each other clearly. In that specific debate I said here that in my opinion all Afrikaners were good South Africans. I want to add at once that by using the word &#x201C;all&#x201D; I did perhaps generalize too much, because a person such as Bram Fischer, for instance, is probably Afrikaans speaking and cannot be a good South African, and at that moment I may have exaggerated the statement. However, I want to add immediately&#x2014;and this I will not withdraw&#x2014; that all English-speaking persons in South Africa are not necessarily, and these were my words good South Africans. Surely it is logical that all of them are not necessarily good South Africans.</p>

The Afrikaans language and the Afrikaans culture can only be realized in South Africa; in no other country in the world can this be done. This is the only place where the Afrikaans language and culture can be realized. As against that the English language and English culture can be realized in a large number of countries of the world. Therefore the Afrikaner is morally and geographically bound to be loyal to South Africa, the only country where he can realize his Afrikaans culture and heritage. The English-speaking person is not necessarily bound to South Africa as the only place where he can realize himself. He can realize himself in Britain, America, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and in numerous other countries of the world. That was the basis of my whole argument. By a good South African I mean a person who is loyal to South Africa as a country. Now I want to say at once that the numerous good English-speaking South Africans who are in South Africa, need not for one single moment take exception to my standpoint, for in my argument there is room for all of them to be good South Africans, and they are it too. Large numbers of them are.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Zululand may talk until he is blue in the face, but in South Africa there are more English-speaking people than there are Afrikaans-speaking people who are not loyal to South Africa. There are numerous English-speaking people who are good South Africans&#x2014;there are thousands, perhaps millions. However, there are more of them who are not such good South Africans as are the Afrikaans-speaking people. The hon. member knows that as well as I do. Therefore I am not withdrawing my argument; I have just explained what I meant. I stand by it, without withdrawing one single word of it. I want to go further, and I want to deal now with the question of what I said in Brakpan. Time and again I as the Minister of Immigration have made appeals to immigrants to try to become bilingual in this country as quickly as possible. Now I know, and any practical person knows this too, that when one comes from a foreign country and does not know either of the two languages, it is an almost impossible task to learn both new languages within a reasonable time. In practice it is customary for the majority of the immigrants to try to master one of the two languages and to abandon the other in order that they may at least make themselves understood in the new country. I have no fault to find with that, except that I want the attitude of that immigrant towards the other language to be correct. His attitude towards the other language should not be negative&#x2014;it does not matter whether this is Afrikaans or English. I am not referring now to Afrikaans or English; I am referring to the second and the first language. His attitude towards the second language, no matter which of the two his second language may be, must be positive. He should at least try to speak that language. He should at least try to display the attitude that he respects that language; when people address him in that language, he should say to them, no matter how haltingly he does it, &#x201C;I do not understand it; I am trying my best, but, please, I am an immigrant; I shall speak the other language too; I am not ill-disposed towards it; I am well-disposed towards the situation.&#x201D; That is logical; that is my starting-point.</p>

<p><span class="col_7873-7874" refersTo="page_0891"/>But as regards the younger generation entering the country as immigrant children, I want to state unambiguously that I think it is essential that those children should become bilingual in South Africa and should accept and use both languages, and that in their case one language is definitely not enough. That is my starting-point and my standpoint, and I state them very strongly. If we do not succeed at present in making those children bilingual, it will be necessary for us to take stock of the matter once again in some way or other, as we are doing now, to see that these children become bilingual in South Africa. I am not talking about legislation, but about the question of our having to see to it that those children will become bilingual in our country. I think nobody can find any fault with that. I have nothing to go back on. Nor am I prepared to withdraw what I had to say about Brakpan; I meant every single word of it. The position is precisely the way I said it was, and I am satisfied with having expressed myself the way I have just done here.</p>

<p>May I just ask a question? Would the hon. the Minister just correct the impression he created through the interjection that not all English-speaking people are South African citizens? I am referring to immigrants who are still waiting to become citizens.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Surely it is logical for the hon. member to know that he ought not to accuse or to suspect me unnecessarily of base thoughts. After all, I as the Minister of Immigration is the first person who will know that there are numerous immigrants who are keen to acquire citizenship, but that we ourselves, through our legislation, are laying down certain minimum qualifications and a period of residence before they can qualify. It is logical that they cannot be South African citizens at this stage already, but they can be loyal South Africans before they are citizens. Surely this is logical; this is clear, and nobody but a person who has malicious intentions, could have read that into my words. I did not level any reproach at those people who could not yet become citizens. But the fact that numerous immigrants have been here for years and do not want to accept citizenship, is indeed viewed in a different light. They can qualify, but they are not prepared to accept it.</p>

<p>I do not know whether I have omitted something to which I have to reply. I think I have more or less covered the whole debate. Of course, the members on my side made very positive speeches. I want to grant them that immediately. A strong stand was taken here, and most questions have already been replied to satisfactorily.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that I think it is necessary for all of us in South Africa, Afrikaans and English-speaking people, Nationalist Party and United Party supporters, to understand one another on this aspect of immigration. In the first place, it is necessary for us in South Africa, as a result of the economic growth of our country, to rely on an addition of immigrants in order to maintain our economic growth, so that we may in that manner be strong and stable in order to take South Africa into the future as a strong country, as it should be. This is essential, and I am saying this to everybody. In the second place, neither of these groups should seek to use the immigrants as a group, to recruit them as a group for this side or that side in order that the one group may by those means plough under the other group; because any group which would do or try to do this, would immediately do irreparable harm to the whole attitude of the country towards immigration; because it is logical that the other group would then revolt immediately against the whole concept of immigration, i.e. if immigrants were used for that purpose. Therefore, I think that appeals and ideas for using immigrants in this manner are only doing harm to the whole matter and prejudicing South Africa as a whole.</p>

<p>I think immigration is one of the spheres in which we must approach the whole matter in a level-headed manner and with a calm mind. We must lay down our standards. I repeat this very clearly: I would rather be criticized in this House for the number of immigrants per year being smaller than I anticipated, than lower the standards I have laid down. It is my standpoint, and I adhere to it, that in this regard we shall supplement our population with the necessary people, but, above all, that we shall go out of our way&#x2014;I am making an appeal to the inhabitants of South Africa&#x2014;to assimilate immigrants as soon as possible with our own people, so that we will know that these people will also understand and share our ways, customs and problems, and our distinctive situation in South Africa. If we view the matter in <span class="col_7875-7876" refersTo="page_0892"/>that spirit, we shall benefit by immigration in the future.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>Thank you. There are a number of issues I would like to raise&#x2014;some in passing, without going into great detail. Let me deal briefly with some matters of principle and of administration upon which my colleagues will enlarge in due course.</p>

<p>First of all, with regard to differentiated courses in our schools, the Minister&#x2019;s announcement of his intention to apply this principle towards the end of last year, had a very mixed reception, as he may know, largely from the teaching profession, but from certain other people as well. Let me say at once that we on this side of the House consider the basis of the plan to be very sound, and the application of it. of course, is long overdue. But far too many of these decisions appear to be taken unilaterally&#x2014;that is, largely by the Minister himself or by some educational hierarchy in the background: I do not refer to the department&#x2014;-without a free and open discussion of the merits of these plans between those people who are most concerned and the Government department. Sir, imagine the public&#x2019;s astonishment when the Cape Director of Education has this to say on 18th January, this year. I quote from <i>Die Burger</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Onderwysman sou ook wou weet. Hy sal dit verwelkom wanneer die Minister van Opvoeding meer inligting oor die nuwe stelsel van gedifferensieerde onder-wys verskaf, soos in die vooruitsig gestel is.</block>

<p>This was Mr. Theron, the Director of Education here in the Cape&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hy het ges&#x00EA; mense vra horn dikwels waarom hy nie reageer op die kritiek wat in die koerante verskyn nie. Sy antwoord is dat hy nooit op briewe in die dagblaaie reageer nie, en voorts het die Minister belowe om eersdaags deur mid-del van &#x2019;n radio-uitsending inligting te verskaf&#x2014;inligting wat hy sal verwelkom.</block>

<p>But the Minister did it.</p>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but this is the Director of Education in the Cape. Surely this indicates a serious lack of consultation and co-operation with the committee of educational heads of the provinces, people who are most vitally concerned. Prior to this, of course, we did have two announcements, one in the <i>Government Gazette</i> of 12th November, 1971, setting out the basis of the general educational policy in terms of section 2 (1) of the 1967 National Education Act. That Act deals at some length with the new scheme for differentiation to be applied in schools; but it was not until 23rd January, of this year, that the Minister, by means of a radio talk, which Mr. Theron himself, the head of education in the Cape, had been awaiting, set out in detail for the general public&#x2014;and, may I say, for the teachers, too, for the first time&#x2014;the final details of the scheme and the policy motives behind it. This is no way to engender public confidence over a change of this magnitude. We have been asking for it for years, but the way it was handled we consider to be very bad indeed.</p>

<p>One cardinal question that must be asked is the following: Why were the teachers not consulted over this issue? Could this not have been done with the greatest of ease through the teachers&#x2019; associations or through their Federal Council, or both? After all, they are the people who are going to have to make this system work, and it amounts to a vote of no confidence in the profession to ignore them in this way. I find the failure to consult them reprehensible indeed. The hon. the Minister, if he was in the Transvaal, may not have seen two long articles which appeared in <i>Die Burger</i> on 30th and 31st December of last year in this connection. The first is entitled &#x201C;Onderwysmense is nie geraadpleeg nie&#x201D;. The writer is obviously no United Party supporter. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Wie weet nou teen hierdie tyd presies wat oor die saak? Wat tot dusver geskryf, gepraat en amptelik aangekondig is, is vae algemeenhede waaruit min <span class="col_7877-7878" refersTo="page_0893"/>mense regtig iets wys kan word. Die hele beplanning het oor jare op ho vlak&#x201D; met die uiterste geheimhouding geskied. Dat die groot publiek in die duister gehou is, is na my mening onverskoonbaar, maar dat die onderwysberoep in die duister was, en in die hoogste mate blykbaar nog is, is onvergeeflik.</block>

<p>He then goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die onderwyskorps as groep en die onderwysberoep as beroep weet byna letterlik niks van hoe die hele beplanning verloop het en nog verloop nie &#x2026; En as alles nou klaar gekoop en deur proklamasie, regulasie en reels vasgel&#x00EA; is, sal hulle per omsendbrief en dergelike verneem waar hulle in die prentjies in-pas, watter bevele hulle onder behoor-like toesig van departemente en inspekteurs van onderwys sal moet uitvoer, en hoe hulle die beplanning waarin hulle geen aandeel gehad het nie, moet implementeer en betekenis moet gee aan dit wat hul beheerders vir hulle uitgedink het.</block>

<p>In other words, he is simply saying that the teaching profession were given their orders, that they were not consulted and that they will receive circular letters and that will be that. I wonder how the hon. the Minister can possibly justify that kind of thing. This writer says quite correctly in his first article that the teachers were distressed about the situation.</p>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>In the second article, which also appeared in <i>Die Burger</i>, on 31st December of last year, the same writer, a teacher, ended up by saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A1 hierdie vrae, en so baie ander wat nog gevra kan word, asook alle moontlik onbillike kritiek of ongeregverdiede afleidinge wat die gevolg is van gebrek aan inligtinge, sou miskien uitgeskakel kon word of kon geword het as ons&#x2014; die publiek. die ouers, die onderwysberoep en almal nog wat by die opvoeding en die toekoms van ons land en sy mense belang het&#x2014;behoorlik ingelig was.</block>

<p>Well, Mr. Chairman, he was quite right there; this was not the way, I suggest, in which to handle this situation. I wonder whether the time has not arrived for the authorities to be a little more open in their discussions with teachers and with the general public on matters of this kind. Must we always be subjected, as we have been over the years, ever since this Government has been in office, to the machinations of a little hidden inner clique, a sort of Nationalist hierarchy somewhere, whom we know have secretly controlled the whole education system? They have done so for years, Sir, I do not have to tell hon. members; they know very well who some of them are. I think, for instance, of Ds. Gericke, Prof. Thom, Prof. Bingle, all the dyed-in-the-wool Christelik-nasionale Onderwys people; these are the ones behind the scenes who pull the strings, and the Minister himself appears to be a pawn in their hands, much as I like and respect him as an individual, may I say.</p>

<p>When one comes to the practical side of the application of differentiation, it is indeed ironical that the De Villiers Commission on Technical and Vocational Education, which reported in 1948, made three urgent recommendations. On page 270, paragraph 2066, they advocate the provision of three years of differentiated education for all school-children after the completion of primary school. Secondly, in paragraph 2053, they made estimates of the financial provisions necessary for secondary differentiated education for all children. Then, in paragraph 2057, in making their financial estimates, they considered that by 1956 &#x201C;sufficient time will have elapsed to test out an implement &#x2026; our recommendations&#x201D;. Sir, it is nearly a quarter of a century since that commission reported and made these recommendations. Much as we approve of the present plan, basically, and what the Government is doing, the country has suffered an irreparable loss in this field by having to wait 25 years, as a result of the Government&#x2019;s dragging its feet and fooling about over this issue.</p>

<p>The second matter I would like to raise is the question of this &#x201C;youth preparedness syllabus&#x201D;, which is now being made compulsory in all high schools. The first question that arises in anyone&#x2019;s mind when reading such a title is, of course, &#x201C;prepare for what?&#x201D;, since the course includes first aid, self-defence, fire-fighting and shooting practice for girls, amongst other things. I think it is legitimate to ask whether we are expecting a general war or not and, if so, whether the children are to he involved. <span class="col_7879-7880" refersTo="page_0894"/>It is a most extraordinary thing. The Transvaal Teachers&#x2019; Association in March objected very strongly to two things about this course.</p>

<p>Firstly, they said that the teachers&#x2019; associations had not been consulted and that the whole scheme and the syllabus had been drawn up in secrecy, as usual, and secondly they objected very strongly to the atmosphere of emergency which attaches to this school programme. In fact, as the hon. the Minuster may know, they submitted alternatives to the Transvaal Provincial Administration, suggesting how this scheme should be amended. The alternatives which they suggested were very wide alternatives, and I will deal with them in a few moments. The MEC in charge of education in the Cape, who announced that this programme would be applied here and made compulsory as from next year, had this to say, according to the <i>Cape Times</i> of 25th February; he said that it would apply to Std. VI and then went on to add that as far as possible the course would be integrated with the syllabus of existing subjects.</p>

<p>Sir, can the hon. the Minister tell me how any education department can integrate first aid, fire-fighting, shooting practice and self-defence in the ordinary syllabus of existing subjects at schools? Because if he can tell me I should like to know. The thing is utterly and absolutely ridiculous. This same Mr. Theron, who is in charge of education in the Cape, made an astonishing statement; he had got the message by this time; he had at last been given some information, and in April of this year he said to a meeting of school principals here in the Peninsula&#x2014;and I want the hon. the Minister to listen to this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Being prepared physically and trained and equipped on a military basis &#x2026;</block>

<p>&#x201C;Trained and equipped on a military basis&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and giving our young people a vocationally directed education to suit the particular needs and ability of the individual pupil and using available manpower wisely and well, these alone are no guarantee of the survival of our nation. He said South Africa was being threatened not so much by external forces but by insidious propaganda.</block>

<p>Sir, what right has this Government, in the name of education, to train and equip our children on a military basis in terms of what this man is saying? We have a conscript Army; the hon. the Minister knows that. Is that not sufficient? When it comes to insidious propaganda, to which Mr. Theron referred, from inside the country in an attempt to break down the morale of our young people&#x2014;and this exists in every country in the world&#x2014;let me tell the hon. the Minister, if he does not know it already, that this propaganda will not be defeated by teaching children how to shoot or to fight fires. That is not the way in which to do it.</p>

<p>The Transvaal Teachers&#x2019; Association had some very constructive suggestions to make; they publish their alternatives in their journal. The association said (<i>Rand Daily Mail,</i> 8th March, 1972)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is far from happy about the scheme. Many teachers would have rejected the syllabus, or even the concept of the whole study, out of hand. Looming large in their minds was the dread word &#x201C;indoctrination&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The suggestions which were made to the province were listed in the journal. They say that they suggested a change in the title from &#x201C;youth preparedness&#x201D; to the old term &#x201C;youth guidance&#x201D;.</p>

<block name="quote">Under the headeing &#x201C;Emergency Plan for Schools&#x201D; the association suggests that a paragraph should be inserted emphasizing that children should be told that no specific emergencies are envisaged. Great care must be taken to prevent mass rumours of impending disaster.</block>

<p><span class="col_7881-7882" refersTo="page_0895"/>My hon. friends over there spend half their political lives talking about impending disasters. Then the association went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The association is strongly opposed to girls having to undergo self-defence training or shooting practice, but it does strongly support the idea of teaching them home nursing. We are strongly against any militaristic aspect being introduced into the education of girls. A military type of marching or saluting by girls is not acceptable to the large section of the population. Then also the Transvaal Teachers&#x2019; Association considers that shooting practice for girls should not be included. It is not educational, it is not ethical. If we wished to limit violence, then surely we should not accept the idea of increasing the number of firearms.</block>

<p>Then later on, under the same heading&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The association feels that the Std X syllabus should not continue to be confined to the study of the evils of Communism.</block>

<p>Then they make a very pertinent comment. They say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Here we would like to draw attention to other evils. The scheme attacks Communism all the time but we would like to draw attention also to similar evils such as right wing dictatorships.</block>

<p>And they are perfectly right. Then they went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the Standard VIII syllabus the association would like to see an emphasis not only on how good relations can be built up, but also on how prejudice can hamper these good relations.</block>

<p>They are perfectly right. Those are very valid criticisms. Then the Director of Education in the Transvaal, Dr. Kotzee, says there are no party politics at all in this plan. He assured the parents and the public that the programme would have nothing to do with party politics, and then with the most astounding naivety, or impertinence, whichever you like to call it, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Throughout their high school careers pupils will be taught how to maintain good relations in a multi-national country.</block>

<p>It does not matter two hoots whether I believe it or not. He is a man who is handling the education of all our children and if they have to learn to think and assess for themselves they should be shown both sides of the picture and not only one. As we know very well, of course, all this is deliberately calcluated and when hon. members through their teachers on that side of the House talk about patriotism and love of the father-land, whenever they invoke that, it is usually invoked for a specific purpose by them, in order to indicate to the children that true patriotism in South Africa can really be equated with Nationalist Party thinking and valued. We find so often that the Government is really terrified&#x2014;and I think that is one of the most alarming aspects of our public life&#x2014;of an open society of any kind. We on this side of the House are as much opposed to over-permissiveness, to drugs, to immorality and anarchy amongst our young people as anyone else, but this is not the way to set about the prevention of phenomena of this kind or activities of this kind either. What extraordinary lack of perception, imagination and insight prevents this Government from accepting the fact that our young people are absolutely determined to think for themselves, whether their elders and betters like it or not, and I say thank God for that. And to the bunch of extreme right-wing authoritarians in the educational hierarchy behind this Government we now clearly, in view of this youth preparedness programme, have to add the names of various other people, and I am going to mention a senior policeman who took part in one of these conferences recently, whom the hon. the Minister knows. It is very significant that of all those whose pictures appeared on the front page of the <i>Sunday Times</i> on 21st May as members of the Executive Committee of the Broederbond, 75 per cent are educationists; I am very sorry the hon. member for Waterberg is not here now.</p>

<p>What status does the teaching profession have after what I told the House about the extent to which they were ignored over differentiation and ignored over the youth preparedness programme? It is quite extraordinary to me how they go on remaining <span class="col_7883-7884" refersTo="page_0896"/>as loyal and dedicated as they are: It is absolutely monstrous that they should have been left out of these two decisions, and it reinforces our contention, which we have repeated year after year in this House, that teachers should be given a professional council such as the medical profession, the architects and the other professions have and that they should be divorced from the Public Service.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I will, because membership of the Public Service virtually prohibits them from doing what they are entitled to do as professional people, and that is to come out openly and criticize educational policies, which should be as professional as a matter as any medical or architectural or any other professional policies are. Another point about teachers is that I am still not at all satisfied with the discrepancy between the salary scales of men and women teachers, particularly the starting salaries, where the discrepancy is the greatest of all.</p>

Everybody in this House knows that Sabra&#x2019;s activities in this field have become a matter of very great public concern, and if they do not know it, it is time they did.

<p>These conferences are being held with the connivance and the financial support of the National Education Department. Now let me read to the hon. the Minister, since he is quite happy about this, what Sabra set out in its own circular, which was issued in 1970 entitled, &#x201C;Die strewe en werksaamhede van die S.A.

<block name="quote">Algemene strewe: Sabra aanvaar die beginsel van afsonderlike ontwikkeling van die onderskeie bevolkingseenhede in ons land as sy basiese uitgangspunt, en strewe daarna om vreedsame naasbestaan tussen hierdie volksgemeenskappe in die praktyk te bevorder.

<p>Quite clearly their stated intention is that our children should be taught to accept Nationalist Party doctrines as gospel and irrefutable and as an inviolate form of truth in our education system. And when they grow older and they find that so many of these doctrines are false, what then? The very manner in which Sabra sets out its historical background for these conferences is to me a most appalling distortion of South Africa&#x2019;s history: and the historical background is from 1652 to the present time. Throughout the entire record of course there is no mention of Louis Botha and there is no mention of Smuts and there is no mention of any of South Africa&#x2019;s other outstanding statesmen. The only people who are mentioned are the all-powerful leaders of the Nationalist Party, all-righteous, infallible people. The whole thing is a nightmare. I have it here. May I just say that the concept of education as such, as we understand it, the academic ideal of the search for truth, the balancing of facts and conclusions in order to attain truth, are both ignored and dismissed. and here we have the other polarity, evidenced in these documents of which the hon. the Minister approves. You have permissiveness on the one hand, of which we disapprove, and you have these closed minds which the Minister is very busy creating, on the other hand. Both are essentially authoritarian in concept and both breed a tyranny of their own. These <span class="col_7885-7886" refersTo="page_0897"/>methods will do nothing to counter, or to protect future generations from, Communism in this country, because the methods are communistic themselves. That is the main point. Now there was a conference held at Calvinia this year, on 21st February, at which General Van den Bergh, head of the Buro for State Security, addressed the conference. I want to question the propriety of a senior policeman, in the first place, the head of BOSS, and a civil servant, addressing school children in this way, and under the aegis and the approval of the Department of Education. It was an outright political speech. What right has a member of the public service to express such views in public? Normally he would be penalized in terms of the Public Service Act and the hon. the Minister knows that very well.</p>

<p>But, good heavens, that is not education. [Interjections.] To me this is the most frightening document. It would not be so frightening if only the children were given the other side of the story. But they never are. At the De Aar conference that was held in 1970 the children were given a list of recommended reading, e.g. <i>Verwoerd aan die Woord</i> by A. N. Pelzer; <i>The Principle of Apartheid</i> by Sampson; <i>Het die Afrikanervolk &#x2019;n Toekoms?</i> by G. D. Scholtz (sometimes we wonder); <i>&#x2019;n Swart Suid-Afrika</i> by G. D. Scholtz; <i>Segregeer of Sterf</i> by Prof. H. J. J. M. van der Merwe; <i>The Case for South Africa</i> by Eric H. Louw; <i>Die Bantoes van Suid-Afrika</i> by Bruwer; <i>Die Jeug se Aandeel in Goeie Rasseverhoudinge</i> by Sabra and <i>Die Bybel en ons Afrikaanse Volkebeleid</i> by Prof. Spoelstra. But what chance do these children ever get to balance this picture? There is nothing by Denys Reitz, Jan Smuts, Leo Marquard or Alan Paton. Whether you agree with the latter&#x2019;s views or not he is a first class writer. There is nothing to create a sense of balance in the minds of these children.</p>

<p>I do not intend to indulge any further in an analysis of the extent to which this Government, through this department, is indoctrinating our children in the schools and colleges, and in the universities to a certain extent too, in trying to persuade them to accept a ready-made doctrinaire, &#x201C;Weltans schauung&#x201D;, based, as I believe, on premises that are no longer tenable in this day and age. The concrete evidence is there and I have already given it. Let me just say one thing very clearly to the hon. the Minister. After 25 years of separation and indoctrination of our young people in our schools and elsewhere the young are singularly unimpressed by it all. I want to tell this hon. Minister that indoctrination in the long run will simply not work.</p>

<p>I am worried because it is unethical in terms of education to do this. The fact of the matter is that in spite of a quarter of a century of the application of the so-called principle of Christelike Nasionale Onderwys our young people are actually aware that more historical wars have been fought&#x2014;and they are not going to be bluffed&#x2014;in the name of Christianity and of Nationalism over the centuries than in any other cause. I am not decrying this either, but the fact of the matter is that any historian knows that for 2 000 years the whole of Europe was racked with religious wars of a most vicious kind. These members are afraid to face their children with the facts of history, but the young are not afraid to face these facts. I make no defence here of activists on the left or the right amongst the young. Both of them seem to me to be doctrinaire. None of this is going to prevent our young people&#x2014;thank heavens &#x2014;from thinking for themselves. I will say that in spite of the prejudices and fears which are generated by members on that side of the House, which, I regret to say, are propagated indirectly through the department, and no matter how extensive their attempts are to indoctrinate South Africa&#x2019;s youth to think their way, politically, socially or morally, they are going to fail.

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Wynberg had half an hour at her disposal and she jumped around from one theme to another like the proverbial cat on a hot tin roof. However, at one spot the cat&#x2019;s tail got caught, and that was when it came to indoctrination. I shall refer back to that again in a moment. She also referred to the new system of differentiated education. I may just tell her that I, as a former educationist, like this system very much. I have studied it, and I like it. I should very heartily like to congratulate the bodies concerned and the department, which worked on this sytem.</p>

<p>From time to time the United Party harps on this alleged indoctrination. As regularly as clockwork this accusation is aimed at the Afrikaans-speaking teachers who are allegedly indoctrinating children at the Afrikaans schools. Because of a lack of vitality the old United Party slogan has begun to die away the past few years, it is true, but quite suddenly Brakpan&#x2019;s by-election caused the flames of the indoctrination obsession to be fanned again.</p>

<p>Who started it?</p>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>They were fanned by means of the accusations against the Afrikaans-speaking teachers. Those accusations came chiefly from the U.P. candidate in the Brakpan by-election. When the director of education in the Transvaal, Dr. A. L. Kotzee challenged the relevant candidate to come along with factual proof and he, the director, rightfully wanted to protect his teachers, he was accused of venturing into the political arena. I now ask whether he should have sat still and allowed the teachers to be accused in that way? With this accusation, and other similar ones, our schools and our teachers are being dragged into the political arena by the United Party. The United Party, like the hon. member this afternoon, is recklessly engaged in these denegration tactics. The United Party is so obsessed with its accusations that indoctrination is taking place in schools that accusations are made not only against the teachers, but also against parts of a syllabus and sometimes against the subjects that are being prescribed. In this case, as the hon. member did here this afternoon, the accusations are levelled at the subject itself as a whole, i.e. against Youth Preparedness. Thus during the past few months a new campaign has started up against the subject of Youth Preparedness, as it is called in English. This subject was introduced into the Transvaal schools as far back as 1st January, and of course the other provinces will also be getting it. It is now being alleged that it is leading to party-political indoctrination in high schools. Quite suddenly it is now no less than disguised propaganda for the National Party. The hon. member also alleged as much this afternoon. The accusation that the new subject will be used to indoctrinate children politically is a blatant accusation. As far back as last year, in August, 1971, this subject was already being made suspect in advance by the English-language Press. An English newspaper reported at the time that the objection to the subject was allegedly the fact that it envisaged promoting the values of apartheid and Calvinism and strengthening a &#x201C;laager mentality&#x201D;&#x2014;those are the words that were used. Others, again, claimed that it was an instruction that came directly from the Government or, otherwise, that the Minister of National Education had instructed that this subject be introduced in schools. All these accusations are false, misplaced and they give a hopelessly crooked image of the true state of affairs. Unfortunately the United Party always sees politics even in a positive educational endeavour. It is a trick of theirs to smother a very good cause at the outset, and in this case a very essential and very <span class="col_7889-7890" refersTo="page_0899"/>efficient subject, under the cloak of suspicion. It is completely wrong to say that such an instruction came from the Minister. Youth Preparedness has absolutely nothing to do with party politics.</p>

<p>I shall give this syllabus to that rowdy hon. member and also to the hon. member for Wynberg so that they can read through it. Then they must come and show me where party politics appears in this syllabus. I challenge them to show me any party politics in this proposed syllabus.</p>

<p>Youth Preparedness was born out of an absolute necessity of the present era. This subject is the result of a deeply-felt need. The idea comes from educationists, from individuals who love our people, and above all, live our youth, individuals that realize that our youth are our people&#x2019;s greatest asset, individuals that are loyal to the country and the people, individuals who realize, despite all these accusations of so-called &#x201C;indoctrination&#x201D; against them and against education, that they have a task to carry out for the youth who must take over the leadership in this country in the future.</p>

<p>Let me briefly sketch the background. In the 1970 annual report of the Committee of Educational Heads&#x2014;those hon. members also have this report at their disposal &#x2014;there are references on pages 11 and 12 to the departmental advisory committee on the action of Youth Defence and Emergency Training. It is mentioned that the recommended syllabuses of the departmental advisory committee were considered by the Committee of Educational Heads and that the Committee1 of Educational Heads decided on the components that would constitute the Youth Defence and Emergency Training programme. On page 12 the components are given in broad outline. The most important of these&#x2014;it tops the list&#x2014; is Moral Armament. It is a programme that was drawn up&#x2014;I want to repeat this&#x2014;by experts in the field of education. This House, including the hon. member for Wynberg, ought to congratulate them sincerely and to thank them for this positive step. As far back as 1970 the Administrator of the Transvaal, Mr. Van Niekerk, announced during the main session of the Provincial Council that Youth Preparedness would be introduced into the Transvaal schools. It is chiefly in the Transvaal where the English-speaking people are making such a fuss and launching attacks against this sbuject. The Administrator of the Transvaal also defends the subject with conviction. I just want to read to the House what an English-language newspaper said in connection with this matter. I am referring to the <i>Pretoria News</i> of 23rd February, 1972. The report reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">Defending the controversial youth preparedness programme &#x2026;</block>

<p>At the outset they call it &#x201C;controversial&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; in Transvaal schools which have been the subject of heated debate this session, Mr. Van Niekerk said that although permissiveness was perhaps only a passing phase, the programme would remain because it would still be necessary to maintain age-old values.&#x2019;</block>

<p>As far as we are concerned &#x201C;age-old moral values&#x201D; definitely have a great deal of value. In addition the newspaper quotes the following from the Administrator&#x2019;s speech:</p>

<block name="quote">Maintenance of a country&#x2019;s moral values is more important even than its economic standards. If the latter were thrown overboard, the whole country would be thrown out of joint. The damage would be much greater if its moral standards were discarded.</block>

<p>That in brief is also the broad object of this Youth Preparedness programme. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member asked what our objection is to Youth Preparedness, and I want to quote to him a Std. VII syllabus: &#x201C;South African in relation to the rest of the world: Religion; national monuments; and heroes.&#x201D; A few weeks ago there was argument in this <span class="col_7891-7892" refersTo="page_0900"/>House about whether Jopie Fourie was a hero or not, and now this subject is going to be introduced into class-rooms and discussed there. That is the objection. There is also talk here of the difference between &#x201C;conservative and decadent groups&#x201D;. Apparently there is only a conservative group or a decadent group. What is the United Party then? Do we form a conservative group?</p>

<p>The United Party candidate in Brakpan focused lasting attention on the indoctrination that is taking place in schools. I have here all the irrefutable documentary proof of this. What makes the whole matter even more unsavoury is that it has the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s approval. At the time of his appointment we knew that the hon. the Minister was an ex-diplomat, but we also knew that he was a former secretary of the Broederbond. It seems to me that all we have left today is the secretary of the Broederbond. The unbridled outbursts of Afrikaner hate we had in this House from the hon. Minister of Defence and the hon. the Minister of Health, were in no way isolated cases. Even when the hon. the Minister of Defence was still marching around under the cloak of verligtheid, the hon. the Minister of Education was carrying out experiments with young South Africans and young Afrikaners, under the nice name of &#x201C;extra-curricular education&#x201D; to find out how this political weapon works. If one reads these Sabra speeches one sees that at these indoctrination camps two things take place. In the first place it is the verkramptes and extreme rightists who are given opportunities to make speeches. The golden thread running through all these speeches is an anti-English attitude. Everything that is wrong in South Africa is the fault of the English. Even the singing of English sports songs &#x2026;</p>

Only the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s policy, and particularly the verkrampte elements of the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s policy, are presented as the only solution. Nothing is said of alternative policies. One would now say that these indoctrination camps take place on an extra-curricular basis, but when one goes through these documents one finds that the taxpaper has to pay for the actual youth camps. The actual indoctrination already begins within the school context. Here I have the circulars that were sent to all school principals.</p>

<p>I shall do so. These letters constitute the spadework. In these circulars everything is worked out to the finest detail. One finds, for example, that only 10 pupils from each school may attend these camp Of the 10 that may attend, the following is said: &#x201C;They must take part in the preparatory section of the programme&#x201D;. Where does the preparatory section take place? Within the school. Subjects for essays, discussions, competitions in public speaking and debates are also mentioned, and this takes place in school. These subjects resemble a syllabus and cover about three pages. One even finds the following subject there: &#x201C;The use of the Bible in policy questions of a political and ethnological nature&#x201D;. Therefore, it is even determined how texts from the Bible must be quoted to justify this Government&#x2019;s policy. Then one also finds this:</p>

<p>&#x201C;Background sketch with a view to preparation for the Bureau&#x2019;s youth programme.&#x201D; Here it must be remembered that only those that have completed the preparatory programme within the school context are chosen. Even the hon. the Minister would blush if he were to read this background sketch. Here it is stated, for example, as far as political rights are concerned, that during the Second World War &#x201C;it was put to the non-Whites that they could demand political rights in the White areas&#x201D;.</p>

<p>But what are the historical facts? Long before the Second World War the non-Whites had political <span class="col_7893-7894" refersTo="page_0901"/>rights in South Africa, they were on a common voter&#x2019;s roll and the Nationalist Party kept the Coloureds on a common voters&#x2019; roll. In this propaganda document, however, it is stated under the heading &#x201C;<i>Laissez-faire</i>&#x201D; that when the United Party was in power during the war years, the non-Whites were told for the first time that they could demand political rights in White South Africa. In addition, mention is made under this heading of communist agitators, etc. That is surely incorrect. But let us go further. There is further mention here of the Second World War and the unsurpassed influx of non-Whites that took place to the urban areas. Then it is stated, however, that when the Nationalist Party came into power influx control, etc., was introduced. But what are the historical facts? The historical fact is that the United Party introduced this in the forties. That is exactly what took place. According to the indoctrination and brain-washing recipe one may never let it be known to one&#x2019;s guineapig that the persons one opposes did, in fact, do anything good according to one&#x2019;s own estimate. This type of conduct is typical of the communist: If history does not suit one, one simply rewrites it. Is this the wonderful example that is being set to build up youth preparedness? In this propaganda document there is also a paragraph with a heading &#x201C;The Hertzog Era&#x201D;, which simply covers the period from 1910 to 1936. The 1913 delimitation of Bantu areas is stated in such a way that one would think it was Hertzog that did it, while he was not even in power at the time. Then one also reads that the traditional policy of the Afrikaner is the &#x201C;recognition of the sovereignty and of the national homelands of the respective Bantu peoples&#x201D;. That, then, is the traditional policy of the Afrikaner, and the date is given as 1924. Why is it not stated, as we heard Dr. Eiselen state recently, that even in 1950 Dr. Malan said it was a stupid concept? They simply kept absolutely quiet about that. However, let us look at what is said about the 1936 agreement: &#x201C;General Hertzog emphasized that the future of the Bantu is vested in the sovereignty over their own areas, and added strength to his argument by extending the tribal areas by 70 per cent in 1936. The acquisition of this additional land by the Bantu had to take place in such a way that the consolidation of the scattered Bantu areas would thereby be promoted.&#x201D; Where does one find that in the 1936 Act? Where is there any mention of consolidation? I want to go further and say that I, as an Afrikaans-speaking person, am tired of these insults to the Afrikaners. These are the biggest insults that can be levelled at Afrikaners, because this only happens to young Afrikaners and in Afrikaans schools. In other words, the Afrikaner is being regarded by the Nationalist Party as someone that can be made into a conditioned robot. They want to take away the individuality of the young Afrikaners, and that is why I, as an Afrikaner, want to object to that. The hon. the Minister does not have to go any further, because here I have the proof. He can read through it. There is not a word about General Smuts and General Botha, and there is not a good word said about the United Party as such. Now we also find the fact I have already pointed out, i.e. that at the real Sabra youth congresses, which parade under the guise of youth leadership congresses, one finds not only the verkrampte and extreme rightest taking part. A man like Prof. Spoelstra himself said by implication that Afrikaans and English-speaking people may not even marry, that this would in fact mean the end of the world. As he said, if one sings English songs at sports gatherings, the Great Trek has been in vain. That is what we get. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>That is the man who now speaks of indoctrination! Sir, these people are so sensitive whenever there is talk of anything that is characteristic of the country. According to a law of this country education must have a national character. But they are so far removed from anything that is national, that anything which is characteristic of this country is foreign to them and evil. They speak of indoctrination. Do you know where indoctrination takes place, Sir? At the English schools! I know of an English high school where the pupils were conditioned in such a way by the teachers, with the advent of the Republic, that when they received the small Republic flags they threw them on a heap and set them alight. That is the kind of indoctrination that takes place against the Republic. Do you know where indoctrination still takes place? At our universities through the medium of the liberal thinkers. But that is not a sin. When South Africa and the South African way of life is undermined by liberals at our universities who indoctrinate our students, it is &#x201C;free speech&#x201D;; then it is &#x201C;free thinking&#x201D;; then it is praised as being something noble. But when our children are allowed to obtain a national character in our education, it is a sin. I am very glad the Education Council gave the following definition of the concept &#x201C;national character&#x201D; in its 1971 report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Through the conscious expansion of every pupil&#x2019;s knowledge of the fatherland, embracing language and cultural heritage, history and traditions, national symbols, the diversity of the population, social and economic conditions, geographical diversity and national achievements; and &#x2026; to inculcate a spirit of patriotism, founded on loyally and responsibility towards the fatherland, its soil and its national resources.</block>

<p>Is it indoctrination if these aspects are brought home to our children? I should like to know what the hon. member for Durban Central has to say. Is that indoctrination? No, Sir, these people must not speak of indoctrination. They are the guilty parties. Then a positive system in which youth preparedness, which has become a need of absolute urgency in our time, enjoys preference, is labelled indoctrination.</p>

<p>Sir, I should very briefly like to bring to the hon. the Minister&#x2019; attention a problem which many people have recently been considerably concerned about. The problem relates to the alarming increase in the running costs of our universities. Sir, university tuition has become tremendously expensive. In spite of the fact that university fees were increased, in spite of the fact that the Government has made considerable concessions to private individuals and companies who make donations to universities, and the fact that a great deal of money flows to the universities from that source, the universities are completely unable to balance their budgets from their own funds. To tell the truth, as far as I can gather the State must cover as much as 85 per cent of university expenses this year, while the universities can only contribute something like 15 per cent from their own sources. It is definitely a matter about which there is concern because these expenses are increasing tremendously. The following figures indicate how alarmingly the State&#x2019;s contributions to university tuition have increased in the past 20 years. In 1951 it was a mere R2,8 million; in 1961, R9,2 million; in 1971, R65 million, and this year it is R68 million. We are very grateful to the State and this Government for being able to subsidize our universities to such an extent that proper provision can be made for our students, but the fact is that from time to time university authorities still have to come with their hats in their hands, as it were, to the Minister and the Cabinet to ask for more money. It seems to me, from the personal knowledge I have of this matter, that we shall soon reach the stage where the State will have to carry 95 per cent or more of university expenses, and then one must ask whether the time has not come for the universities to become State universities; for the State to assume full responsibility for university tuition. If that cannot be done&#x2014;because I know that there are people who will immediately moan and say that the universities will lose their autonomous status&#x2014;then I want to suggest that ways and means be found to make the universities self-supporting and independent of State aid. The universities will then of necessity have to increase their fees <span class="col_7897-7898" refersTo="page_0903"/>to such an extent that they can cover their expenses from those fees. This will mean that a student will perhaps have to pay R1 500 or R2 000 per year in student fees. This will in turn make the university an ivory tower that is only there for the children of the privileged wealthy people. If university fees are increased to that extent, I want to suggest that the State should lend the full university fees to the student, in terms of an agreement, and that the student should then repay that loan when he is working one day. This would mean that the student would immediately have a responsibility, because he would not be studying with the taxpayer&#x2019;s money, which he can simply waste, but with money he eventually has to repay. It would mean, in addition, that the State could cancel that loan if the student is guilty of continually neglecting his duty or is engaged in subversive activities against the State, and that the university will then be able to hold the student or his parents responsible for the amount that is still outstanding if the State withdraws its loan. Sir, in that connection I also want to mention another aspect. There are hundreds of foreign students, from the United Kingdom and elsewhere, who are studying here. I understand there are about 800 foreign students studying in South Africa. Those students cost the State anything from R800 000 to R1 million per year. Some of those students are guilty of subversive activities. Their parents live abroad. They pay tax there; they have no obligations here. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I trust the hon. member for Algoa will excuse me if I do not follow his particular theme in regard to the financing of university students, partly through their own efforts. I want to come back to a matter which is causing anxiety in the minds of many parents of school going children, and that is the question of drug abuse and the attitude of the hon. the Minister and his department to this particular problem. I would like to remind the hon. the Minister that his predecessor in 1969, when I raised the issue of drug abuse and the part that the schools and the Department of Education could play, reacted to this immediately. On the 24th April, 1969, in column 4706 of Hansard, Minister De Klerk said that he supported my suggestion that consideration should be given to this aspect. He went on to say that there was a special section on dagga and the use of drugs in our high school syllabus and he promised to give serious attention to the question of having this matter investigated. Sir, since then we have had the publication of the report of the Grobler Committee on the abuse of drugs. I would like to refer the hon. the Minister to page 105 of the report, where no fewer than six recommendations are specifically referred to the Department of National Education for attention and consideration. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister whether at this stage he can give some indication as to what steps have been taken in this particular regard. Sir, I am fully aware of the difficult problem that this presents. We must not underestimate the difficulty. I want to quote to the hon. the Minister something which appeared in the World Health Organization technical report series, published by the expert committee on drug dependence. This is what it says, under the heading &#x201C;Education&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The hope that simple information-giving educational programmes will be sufficient to prevent drug dependence is frequently expressed. However, there is no evidence to support it and there are many reasons to doubt it. Knowledge in itself is not necessarily protective if the drug is readily available. The fact that the incidence of dependence on restricted drugs is in many communities higher among members of the health profession than in the general population throws doubt upon the preventive value of knowledge about the dangers of drugs and emphasizes the importance of drug availability as a factor in the deviant use of drugs.</block>

<p>I believe the hon. the Minister will agree with me that it does make the question of education in this particular regard a difficult one.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, I want to come to the training of pharmacists, because this hon. Minister is responsible for the training of almost 90 per cent of the approximately 250 pharmacists who qualify each year. There are now fewer than 10 training institutions in the Republic dealing with the training of pharmacists. Seven of these are the responsibility of this hon. Minister while three are universities under the Ministers of Bantu Education, Coloured Education and Indian Education respectively. But this hon. Minister has under his control two universities and five colleges for Advanced Technical <span class="col_7899-7900" refersTo="page_0904"/>Education. I said they produce up to 90 per cent of the chemists and druggists. Last year the three ethnic universities among them produced 17 chemists and druggists, three Coloureds, 11 Indians and three Bantu, at a cost far in excess of the figure which was riven to me by the hon. the Minister, of a unit cost of 656 for a White student at the technical college at Port Elizabeth. The figure for Turfloop for a pharmacy student is given at R1 600 per annum. In passing I would like to point out a further anomaly, and that is that when this man is qualified under these conditions, he receives, according to the starting salary laid down for a pharmacist, R150 a month, whilst his White counterpart educated at the White institutions, receives a minimum of R350 a month. The point I want to draw to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention is the large drop-out rate which is taking place. Now this is not taking place as the result of inferior staff, because if the Minister would go into it he would appreciate that his department has suffered a brain drain to provide the teaching power for the ethnic universities. I am wondering whether it is not time for the hon. the Minister to take cognizance of the trend which is taking place with this brain drain from his department and whether he should not see that the teaching which is being provided is making the maximum effort to produce the maximum number of chemists and druggists of all races who are needed to fulfil the need for pharmacists in this country. I have no time to quote the figures in detail, but I may mention that there have been 679 enrolments of non-Whites in the first year. The drop-out has been down to 73 in the third year, leaving a total number of 40 non-White qualified chemists and druggists; ten per cent remains in the third year. The picture as far as White chemists and druggists is concerned, is completely different. We find that of 470 first-year students, 314 are still taking their course in the third year. Last year 94 non-White students took the first year enrolment course and 24 students were in the third year enrolment course. I believe this is something which the hon. the Minister can no longer ignore. I have asked him on occasions whether he has conducted a survey to investigate any possible brain drain from his own department to other departments, and he has told me &#x201C;no&#x201D;. He does not think it is necessary. I believe that the hon. the Minister should reconsider this aspect.</p>

<p>In the short time left to me I wish to deal with the question of statistics. I have wanted to try to compare the enrolment and the passes in the White universities under the Minister&#x2019;s control and the non-White universities under the control of other Ministers. When I seek statistics I find I can get up to date and revealing statistics from the other departments, but from this hon. Minister&#x2019;s department there seems to be a difficulty in getting the statistics. I must express my appreciation to the hon. the Minister because he indicated in one reply to me that he has deputed an official specifically to collate the figure for the 1970 statistics I sought in reply to a question. In a computer age, is it really necessary to find that the 1970 statistics of university enrolments and the number of graduates and diplomats who obtained degrees and diplomas is not available in 1972? I am certain that this is something which requires investigation. I want to point out that the hon. the Minister said that I could get the statistics which I sought from the annual reports. I was looking for a ten-year spread. When I referred to the annual reports, I found that after 1972-&#x2019;73 there had been a change in the manner in which the statistics had been collected. Whereas in those years it was possible for me to determine the number of degrees and the number of diplomas, the total number which had been awarded by all the White universities under the Minister&#x2019;s control, thereafter the statistics were published in such a way that it would have needed an adding machine or a computer to arrive at an accurate total. There were no subtotals, no totals and no possibility of getting a clear picture of the number of graduates for degrees per year. I want to suggest to the Minister that this is important information and that it should be available and that the various universities should be requested to render returns in such a way that they can be collated so that people who are interested in statistics are able to obtain the figures from the reports.

<p>I should like to say a few words to the hon. member for Wynberg, but she has since disappeared. I should like to say this to the hon. member. after she became so excited about the conference that was held at De Aar. I suppose that because it took place in my constituency, Dr Jooste sent me the full programme of the proceedings, complete with <span class="col_7901-7902" refersTo="page_0905"/>all the papers that were delivered there, and I saw nothing wrong or suspicious in that. The hon. member has, of course, again seized on this opportunity, as has rightly been stated here, after the Brakpan United Party candidate also began with these indoctrination stories when he realized he was not going to make the grade. The hon. member could just as well have taken the <i>Sunday Express</i> instead of those typed sheets that she read out. Indignantly she calls out &#x201C;Nationalist Party policy!&#x201D; I feel inclined to tell the hon. member that if the United Party had a policy that the world took any notice of something could possibly have been done to it. The fact that our policy is attacked to such an extent is specific proof that our enemies are afraid of it.</p>

<p>But let me come to the hon. member for Durban Central. I have thought several times, when the hon. member was speaking, of the words of a wise man I read about, a man who, when he is listening to people who get so excited&#x2014;I almost want to say who go too far&#x2014;issues the warning: &#x201C;Wisdom dies out with you.&#x201D; The hon. member is still young, and I think he will still be learning a great deal, but I want to warn the hon. member that in his youth and impetuosity he must be careful. He actually came along and presented himself here this afternoon as the protector of the Afrikaner and his cause. Preserve us from ever being under his protection. He is an Afrikaans-speaking person who has now become sick and tired of what is being done on this side by the Government; now he is our guardian. As true as faith, then I refuse to be protected, and the hon. member must not blame me. Dramatically he calls out that everything that is English must be condemned, is wrong.</p>

<p>You said that. We can also quote examples, and if you get hurt you must not cry, but I am going to restrain myself from doing so.</p>

<p>I should like to express two further ideas here, aspects which are frequently a little worrying to me, since I am someone who is interested in teaching and education. I am fully aware of what we are doing in connection with education. I am thinking, in particular, of school education. I am aware of the progress we have made through the years. One is nevertheless constantly aware that one will probably never have achieved everything one strives for. Our system and our activities will never be perfect. Seen in the context of our times I feel it is essential to emphasize again that from school-going age we should already be preparing a child along certain lines so that when he leaves school, or even goes to study further, he can adapt what he has learnt at school to his future needs. Today I do not want to try to discuss a syllabus; for that we would need a great deal of time, and it would also require intensive study. But one is not always completely convinced that the subjects pupils choose are really of such importance. I should also like to say a few words in connection with university training. It is generally known that our universities today are full to overflowing. It is generally known that it costs a tremendous amount of money on the part of the State and on the part of parents to keep students at university and to see them through until they have completed their courses and are prepared, as the adage states, to enter upon life. What bothers me tremendously and unsettles me is the fact that at our universities there are numerous students&#x2014;I almost want to say hundreds, if it does not border on thousands&#x2014;who sit there year after year, some of them hardly passing a single course in four, five, six or seven years. Those students take up the space that could be taken up by other more deserving students at the university. I want to ask the hon. the Minister that attention be given to this mater at the highest level. I personally am aware of numerous such students. Some of them are only there to play sport. I have nothing against sport, and that is not my objection either, but I feel that if there are places&#x2014;one may almost call them costly places&#x2014;that must be filled at the university, they must not be relinquished to those who are perhaps there to get a little polish. In most cases they do not even get that.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I listened attentively, to the hon. member for Wynberg, and I want to say that the hon. member tried very hard to state her view in this House.

<p>In respect of education she has not got that far yet. The dilemma the hon. member for Wynberg finds herself in, and this relates to education as well, is that she&#x2014;this is also the dilemma in which the United Party finds itself, in particular the English-speaking section of the United Party&#x2014;leans on the Afrikaans-speaking people in that party. The Afrikaans-speaking people in their party cannot give them a clear picture about what the Afrikaner really believes in and what he really thinks.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. D. K. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>It is exactly the same with education. The English-speaking members of the Opposition allow themselves to be led by Afrikaners whom I cannot but describe as confused individuals, people like Etienne Malan, Japie Basson, Willem Kleynhans, Jan Loubser, Prof. Nic Olivier and, last but not least, the hon. member for Durban Central. These Afrikaans-speaking members of the United Party are misleading the English-speaking section of that party and South Africa, and placing them on the wrong road. I am very serious when I say this. I now want to ask the hon. member for Durban Central whether he can say sincerely that as a practising teacher he never had any part in United Party organizing, because he is a man who advocates that our teachers in South Africa must be given time so that they can be nominated as party candidates in a political election. Then, if he loses the election struggle, the teacher should immediately be allowed back into education.</p>

<p>There is another question I want to ask the members of the United Party. In the hon. member for Bezuidenhout&#x2019;s idiom they must tell me on what grounds we can have mixed, integrated universities in South Africa, and on what grounds there must be separation in respect of primary and secondary education.</p>

<p>Then there is also a third question I want to ask hon. members. A few months ago about 12 000 pamphlets were distributed at certain high schools in Pretoria, Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban and Pietermaritzburg in which a blatant attack is made on established and founded norms amongst school children to bring about discordant relationships between pupils and parents and pupils and teachers.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there is no time. I have only a few minutes at my disposal.</p>

<p>I just want to ask that hon. member to go and read again what she said about what she regards as being the foundations of education. The hon. member said, <i>inter alia,</i> that she wants to tell the children: &#x201C;Search for the truth and balance the facts.&#x201D; If that side of the House were now to establish an education policy for South Africa, in this modern world in which we live and with the big problems modem man has to struggle with, do they want to tell all pupils from nursery school to matric, in the light of the information these people are distributing amongst our young people, that they must search independently? Here is what these people tell the pupils about the teachers (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They teach you to obey authority rather than to doubt and dispute things. If you are really bored in class and cannot get a good discussion going, there are always possible avenues of escape.</block>

<p><span class="col_7905-7906" refersTo="page_0907"/>One of those is mentioned as being pornographic magazines and comics. I could elaborate on this, but I now want to ask the Opposition a question. Sabra holds certain youth congresses with the utmost responsibility as far as human beings are concerned, with the greatest possible acknowledgement of what authority, order and discipline in South Africa are. Let me now say very clearly that I do not always agree with everything that people at Sabra congresses say. I do not always agree with everything that scientists say. I was also a lecturer at a university. And believe me, in my subject I did not echo any political party. I felt myself at liberty to regard matters on merit and form a scientific judgment. But I always knew that those in practical politics do not have the benefits that a scientist has. This is evident when one has a person like Prof. Kleynhans saying one thing this evening and changing his tune again next morning as it suits him. In the light of their violent attacks on Sabra, and on the youth congresses that Sabra holds, I want to ask those hon. members the following question: Give me the name of one single responsible United Party member, whether he be a committee member or leader, who has already stood up before an audience to condemn the pamphlets that were distributed amongst our young people. I want the hon. members of the Opposition to stand up and say it in this debate. If they do not succeed in doing so, the United Party will find itself exposed, as far as the teachers, the parents and the up-and-coming youth of South Africa are concerned, as people who want to harness education in South Africa for their own political advantage.</p>

<p>I should now like to make a few remarks about our universities. I think that for centuries now it has been a case of an older generation taking very careful note of the up-and-coming generation. Many times we are also inclined to see the faults in the up-and-coming generation, to realize the faults we ourselves made, and then to prevent the up-and-coming generation from making those mistakes. I had a great deal to do with young people in the course of many years. I think that the National Party, as a party, has great confidence, not only in the young people as a whole, but also in our students throughout the country. I venture to say that in those universities where the university leaders are to a large extent people who support the principles of the National Party, there is greater peace and quiet and more opportunity for finding people who can mean a great deal to our society. In that connection I should like to mention the University of Pretoria as an example. On this occasion I should like to express my heartfelt thanks to the new rector of the University of Pretoria, i.e. Prof. Eddie Hamman. I have, in particular, great confidence that as a man with a highly scientific training, and as a man who has reached the highest rung in his field, he will be able to keep this university the Voortrekker university. In welcoming the parents of first-year students on 15th February, Prof. Hamman made a speech which I think it would profit every parent and student in our country to read.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, if ever there was a good testimonial to the education system in our country and to the progress we have made during the past decade and longer, then it is the debate on education which has been conducted in this House this afternoon. For every department the debate on its Minister&#x2019;s Vote is more than any other the occasion on which matters of policy are stated. I am now asking hon. members, with all the objectivity at my disposal, what judgment was passed this afternoon by the Opposition on the educational policy of my department. A few trifles were pecked at, which we can discuss later. But about real matters of policy, about our objectives, about our organization and our deficiencies, nothing was said by hon. members on the opposite side. There is only one conclusion I can draw from this, namely that the Opposition, in spite of what it wants to profess, is also satisfied with the education set-up as we have it in our country today. What also struck me was that the hon. Opposition works with completely obsolete concepts. They have not kept pace with the tremendous development and the entirely new dispensation which have been brought about in education. I said this recently in the Senate when a motion on education was being discussed there, and I want to repeat it here. We had points of criticism here which were raised by the main speaker on the Opposition side, the hon. member for Wynberg, and I want to tell her that some of those points she raised were quite simply based on obsolete concepts. In other words, her premise was quite wrong, and consequently there was no substance to her argument. I tried last <span class="col_7907-7908" refersTo="page_0908"/>year, and the year before as well, to teach her a few things, but it seems to me she has learnt nothing.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It seems to me the Opposition members who are interested in education do not want to learn much. The hon. member for Durban Central, who should in fact be able to learn, came forward here with matters, and on a level with which I shall deal later. I do not want to drag it into this argument now. Why do I say the hon. Opposition work with obsolete concepts? The hon. member said here that the De Villiers Report had in 1948 already envisaged a period of eight years in which to implement those recommendations so that we could get a policy of differentiated education in the country. That is quite correct, and it is stated in the report.</p>

<p>However, I said last year that the problem around which everything centred until the stage at which the National Party had the courage to do what it did, was the divided control which existed on the secondary school level. This is no new discovery the National Party made. Since 1910 there have been 11 commissions on education, and each one of them found that divided control over education should be abolished. That was the essence of the problem. Now I want to ask who governed the longest and the most from 1910 until the National Party took over the government in this country for the future? Why did the United Party not take those steps and change and expand this system? Now the hon. member says that the Government &#x201C;is dragging its feet over it&#x201D;. The Opposition is working with obsolete concepts. I want to remind hon. members of the fact that it was the National Party that had the courage to carry out what these previous commissions had found was necessary, namely to transfer vocational education to the provinces. From then on we were able to start with the expansion and formulation of a comprehensive and consistent differentiation policy. Earlier this had not been possible.</p>

<p>Of course there was always a measure of differentiation in various ways and in various directions, but a comprehensive and a consistent differentiation policy was not possible because of the major struc tural failings in our educational system, namely that one had the divided control on the level of secondary education. I hope that the hon. Opposition will in future take this set-up as it exists at the moment into account. I maintain that the education system which my department controls is as good as the best one can find anywhere in the world. Our education system, as far as its objectives are concerned, as far as its organization is concerned, as far as its results are concerned, and particularly, too, as far as its scope is concerned, for all the requirements one may encounter in society, is really efficient and comprehensive. When I say &#x201C;all the requirements one can find in society&#x201D;, I am referring not only to the clever children which one finds in a community. It is easy to teach and encourage them. But I am also referring to those who are intellectually less well-endowed. I am referring to the physically and mentally handicapped. I want to say that at the moment we have a system which, when it has been properly expanded and when full differentiation has been achieved, will be as good as any system to which one could justifiably compare it.</p>

<p>The hon. member quoted here from <i>Die Burger</i> what a certain newspaper correspondent, under the pseudonym &#x201C;Onderwysman&#x201D;, wrote. I ask the hon. member: Is she convinced that &#x201C;Onderwysman&#x201D; is really a person who can speak with authority on education? If he is not, why does she quote him as her authority?</p>

<p>Why does she not have recourse again to the De Villiers Report, which is a report based on proper educational principles, and which indicated to us the guidelines? Why does she not have recourse to the statements of very well-known authorities and thinkers on education in our country, and even abroad? Instead, she quotes a letter from a man who calls himself &#x201C;Onderwysman&#x201D;. The letters which followed showed very clearly what those people thought of the opinions of &#x201C;Onderwysman&#x201D;. I said that I do not begrudge anyone the right to write to newspapers. In fact, it is something which many people are inclined to do&#x2014;if they have nothing else to do, they write letters to the newspapers. I do not begrudge them the right to do so, but I did ask, what right do we have to accept that he is not perhaps a frustrated or old teacher trying to bring about a change in the system? Those are <span class="col_7909-7910" refersTo="page_0909"/>all possibilities we have to bear in mind. But to hold him up to this Parliament as an authority on differential education is, I think, exaggerated. I think the hon. member, by doing that, made herself a little ridiculous.</p>

<p>The hon. member objected vehemently to the fact, which &#x201C;Onderwysman&#x201D; and other people also alleged, that the entire educational profession was supposedly not informed about what is being planned and what they will eventually have to deal with. The hon. member is shaking her head. Therefore she still adheres to that standpoint. Sir, is the hon. member not aware that I administer my department in terms of an Act which specifies the procedure explicitly, point for point, as to who should be consulted and when? I think the hon. member was already a Member of this Parliament when that Act was piloted through. If she is so clever now in regard to the procedure of consultation, why did she not at the time make proposals in this House to improve the system? But I do want to say to the hon. member that I agree that the procedure which is laid down from me in the Act, as it is at present, is long and cumbrous; we shall have to improve it.</p>

<p>In the light of the experience I have gained, I will in due course improve it. When the time arrives to do so, I shall make an appeal to the hon. member to present her ideas. It is no use levelling criticsm and saying that people have not been consulted, which is something that I deny. Sir, the teaching profession was consulted to the extent to which the Act prescribes that it should be consulted. I do not know whether the hon. member understands that to mean that I should hold a referendum among the teachers on every point, or something to that affect. I do not know whether she expects me to obtain the individual opinion of every teachers&#x2019; association officially. But I do want to give her the assurance that the teaching profession has been consulted in regard to this matter, as it was consulted in regard to all educational matters, to that extent to which I am directed to do by the Act.</p>

<p>I should now like to deal with a few of the more specific points raised in this debate. I have said that in regard to matters of policy, in regard to the real essence of education, little has been said in this discussion up to now which I deem to be of importance. The hon. member for Wynberg, and the hon. member for Durban Central as well, kicked up a terrific fuss about what was allegedly indoctrination. The hon. member for Durban Central, at meetings and in the periodical Press statements which he makes, elaborated on this at length. He waxed very eloquent about this. This afternoon he came forward with the same story as he recounted in the newspaper, namely that this was supposedly a calculated move of indoctrination. He referred to the Broederbond, and I do not know what else he is also afraid of. He thought that he was going to make out a convincing case here. He said that he had everything in black and white. I do not know whether hon. members who heard him thought anything of his arguments. I thought very little of them, for what he quoted here did not convince me. Sir, I want to say this to the hon. member for Durban Central, and this will be my only personal reference to him: I feel sincerely sorry for him because he, who was a teacher, in other words a man who was an idealist, has forsaken that path and now finds himself in a situation where for the sake of his seat he has to perform menial duties for those people whom we regard as an Opposition in this House.</p>

<p>Sir, I am not going to spend much time on this indoctrination charge, for there are a few matters which I still have to deal with. I want to say to the Opposition, and more specifically to the hon. members who have participated in this debate up to now, and who joined in this chorus, say that on the basis of my experience, on the basis of my every-day observations, on the basis of documents I have before me, and on the basis of my personal contact with these people, I have complete and utter confidence in the educational authorities in all the provinces and also in my department. Sir, we have a statutory body, the Committee of Educational Heads, a body which is invested with great and important powers and which has great responsibility. As I know those people, they are not people who will co-operate in any intrigue to act subversively in regard to any political party or in favour of any political party. I want to tell you this, Sir, that school principals and the teachers&#x2019; corps <span class="col_7911-7912" refersTo="page_0910"/>as a whole are reliable and loyal South Africans, people whose services we do not always estimate at their true worth. To sow suspicion against them here, and to think that the educational authorities are engaged on a plan and that a large corps of teachers are carrying out that plan and do not have the courage or the strength of their convictions to oppose it, is absolutely far-fetched; it is a motion of no confidence in our teachers&#x2019; corps, on which so much depends as far as our future and our survival in this country are concerned. Sir, I reject that kind of suspicion which is being sowed against these people.</p>

<p>Sir, that is one of the items of the youth preparedness programme to which we shall return in a moment. I first want to complete my argument. I shall not evade the question; I have noted it down. Sir, I want to say that these people, the educational authorities, the school principals and our teachers&#x2019; corps in general, are thoroughly trained people. They are responsible people; they are inspired and loyal South Africans. I am satisfied that the teaching profession in South Africa is in responsible and reliable hands. I concede &#x2014;and the hon. member will probably want to make use of this later&#x2014;that here and there there is a difference in emphasis; that certain English-language teachers associations perhaps allow the emphasis to fall differently to Afrikaans-language teacher associations; that I want to concede; it is part of our human nature. There may even be a difference between them here and there in regard to methods, but I want to state emphatically that there is no difference between them in regard to educational principles. That is why I say hon. members may rest assured that this group of educationists will do nothing in this country, nor will they participate in anything, if it cannot be defended educationally. I want to say to hon. members on the opposite side that they are making themselves ridiculous by. recounting the story they did this afternoon. The English language teachers, the U.P. teachers however many of them there may be&#x2014;and I do not begrudge any tea cher the right to be what he wishes as far as politics is concerned&#x2014;are having a good laugh at the Opposition&#x2019;s expense over this matter. Sir, the hon. member for Wynberg quoted here from the <i>Transvaal Educational News,</i> the educational journal of the Transvaal Teachers&#x2019; Association. She began to make this quotation, and I asked her to quote further. If I understood her correctly, she then said that she did not have the entire article with her. I then promised to quote further from it. Sir, I want to quote to you what is said by the <i>Transvaal Educational News,</i> the mouthpiece of an English-language teachers&#x2019; association, a major and important teachers&#x2019; association, in its editorial column, in its leading article, on this matter of youth preparedness. It was stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Looming large in their minds was the dread word &#x201C;indoctrination&#x201D;, quite overlooking the fact that most of their professional time is given over to getting children to accept ideas that are not their own. Others again felt happy to teach 90 per cent of the syllabus. Some principals of high schools went so far as to say they would take this section on moral preparedness themselves, so important and fundamental was it.</block>

<p>Sir, this is the standpoint of a responsible educational body. The hon. member now wants to make this House believe that this programme of youth preparedness is an evil thing. Why are we having this campaign? I want to say to hon. members of the Opposition that it is not an entirely new line of thought, for at all times school principals and teachers have also made their influence felt in regard to those values which in our opinion ought to be brought home to school children. It is the truth. During assemblies in the halls, the school principals gave talks on many of the subjects which you now find in this programme for youth preparedness. I say that all we have before us now is a purposeful and balanced programme of youth preparedness which concentrates the knowledge gained over the years into a properly co-ordinated effort. The row which is now being kicked up in regard to this matter had its origin in the recent by-elections. Each time a by-election is held, particularly if it is a provincial by-election, or when the Cape Provincial Council or the Transvaal Provincial Council is sitting, the same hardy annual makes its appearance. And who trundled it out? <span class="col_7913-7914" refersTo="page_0911"/>Fritz Botha in the Cape Provincial Council and Andrew Pyper, who even boasts of being an Afrikaans-speaking person in this House, and Opperman in the Transvaal. Sir, it surprises me that if one wants to gain a seat on that side of the House, one has to go to such lengths in regard to one&#x2019;s own convictions and things which are dear to one.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to dispose of this matter quickly. The key syllabus of this youth preparedness programme has been approved by the Committee of Educational Heads. In the same way key syllabae have been prepared for all the subjects. In other words, this responsible educational organization meets and deliberates on what is necessary and how much is necessary; what form it should take and how it should be presented.</p>

<p>I am still coming to that. They decided that discussions and orientation courses for school principals would first be held before this programme was put into operation at the beginning of next year. There is one matter which causes the hon. member terrible concern, and that is that girls will be taught to shoot. As far as I know the art of shooting is something which is not practised by men only. There are all kinds of target shooting, and the hon. member for Potchefstroom, who is a great target shooting enthusiast, will be able to confirm this, and I think the hon. member for Umlazi, who in his day has probably taught quite a lot of young women pistol shooting, will admit it. Ask him whether there is anything wrong with teaching a girl to shoot. In principle I have nothing against a girl being taught to shoot. If my educational heads, however, as the experts in the sphere of education, tell me that they regard it as being educationally unjustifiable that girls should be taught to shoot, I shall reconcile myself to that. But personally I see nothing wrong with it. The hon. members have now tried to build up a case against youth preparedness. I have said that I shall not go into the youth preparedness programme any further, except in so far as the matter of learning to shoot is concerned. I am surprised the hon. member did not broach the matter of karate as well.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, fire-fighting. The hon. member asked how one would be able to integrate fire-fighting into the rest of the school programme. It goes without saying that one cannot integrate all these components of this programme with the existing subjects, but in so far as it is practicable and feasible, it is being done. That is the reply to that. I say that I want to leave at that this question of youth preparedness, which is supposedly such an important part of a pre-conceived plot to indoctrinate. If the hon. member for Durban Central and the hon. Opposition on the opposite side are really so concerned about indoctrination at our schools, do they know what the most effective counter-measure is? The most effective counter-measure against indoctrination is to produce their own teachers, both men and women for their own people and their own schools. Then there will be an end to the continual objections in regard to indoctrination.</p>

<p><span class="col_7915-7916" refersTo="page_0912"/>The hon. member for Wynberg referred here to the &#x201C;Christian National type of education&#x201D;, of which she was supposed to be so tired by now. I want to ask her whether she means by that what the hon. member for Durban Central meant when he made his speeches and had his interviews with the Press. He referred to a pamphlet published years ago by FAK. That is after all what the hon. member for Durban Central meant, not so? He said it. I have the clippings here.</p>

I could quote it to the hon. members, but I do not want to waste the time of the House. The hon. member for Durban Central&#x2019;s concepts in regard to the educational set-up are so obsolete that he also states that he objects to my wanting to force this scheme upon the entire country, including Natal, and that I do not take into account the fact that Natal is governed by the United Party. It is a pity Uncle Douglas Mitchell is not here this evening.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I beg your pardon, Mr. Chairman, I mean the hon. member for South Coast.</p>

<p>I want to return briefly to the Sabra Congresses. I am sorry we have to return to this matter, for it is one which I dealt with in full last year. However, I must return to it, because the hon. Opposition has tied it in with this deliberate attempt which is supposedly being made to indoctrinate schoolchildren. I said last year, and I am speaking here from last year&#x2019;s notes, that it is one of the functions of my department, and a very important subdivision of its work, to cultivate qualities of leadership among children and young people. I do not want to discuss the school itself, now. I agree with the hon. member for Wynberg that it is the object and endeavour that we should impart knowledge to our children but that we should also give them a sense of values and an ability to distinguish between and weigh up facts. They must learn to think for themselves, and as far as that is concerned, she and I are in agreement. There are few other matters on which we agree. I have said that this is an important subdivision of my task, and I derive that task from the National Cultural Council legislation, to help organize our youth on an extramural basis. This is not being done only through the efforts of my department itself, but by giving support to many organizations. The hon. member for Wynberg smiles broadly when we say this. Last year I did not furnish the particulars, but simply referred to the annual report. I want to apologize for the fact that the annual report of my department is not yet available, but it is hoped that it will in fact be available within the next few days. I want to mention to the hon. members a few particulars of what my department has in fact done in recent years to make contact with young people and to organize the development of leadership potential in co-operation with outside bodies, and of our own accord. I want to mention to the House that we held 111 camps for general youth courses which were attended by 13 000 young men and women. The land service movement organized 33 regional camps, 46 week-end camps, 10 school camps and three national camps which were attended by 11 000 land service members. In addition 11 camps for naturalization courses for immigrants were organized. In 1948 my department had only one camp site. Today we have more than 14. This is a wonderful development which is taking place in our entire set-up. Those grounds are available to organizations outside the department. [Interjections.] Oh, please, the young people in the hon. member for Hillbrow&#x2019;s constituency pay no need to him, and he pays no heed to them either. Therefore he need not join in this discussion. These particulars I have mentioned here prove that we are engaged in the development of a wonderful set-up to reach our young people on an extramural basis. Sabra. which holds these courses every year, is one of these groups receiving financial support from us. Last year and this year again, in reply to questions put by the hon. member for Orange Grove, I explained how this support is being given, <span class="col_7917-7918" refersTo="page_0913"/>that it consists of <i>ad hoc</i> allocations which are made on the basis of the submission of audited statements for actual expenditure, and that it is allocated on the basis of organization which is done. Last year in the same debate the hon. member for Durban Central asked whether I would allocate it to certain other organizations as well. I told him that each organization was considered on its merits. I see that he has made an appeal to them to organize a similar effort on a country-wide basis. It does not seem to me as if his appeal has met with any response. I want to state again that there is no doubt in my department in regard to the standpoint which these organizations adopt. I said last year that I do not censor the lectures given there, but we do take cognisance of what is being said there. On that basis continued support or initial support is considered.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg saw fit to quote here from a circular allegedly sent out to the schools in 1970 by Sabra. Why did she not quote the 1971 circular? If she had done that, she would have seen that that circular was amended considerably because I had given instructions that certain changes had to be made to that circular. But she saw fit to quote the 1970 circular because it strengthened her argument and because it could cast suspicion on what I regard as a very deserving effort. I say that we are aware that Sabra was established to promote separate development scientifically. Does the hon. member except now that, with such a premise, Botha and Smuts and all the others who were mentioned, should also be dragged into such a programme?</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I withdraw it. But I told the hon. member last year that all schools in a specific area in which the congress is being held receive these circulars. Not all the schools can send all their children to attend, and that is why it is being limited to 10 per school. You do not want the poorest pupil in the school attending such a congress. This is, after all, a youth leaders&#x2019; congress. That is why one wants hand-picked children.

<p>Did the hon. member ask whether there was one available in English? I want to emphasize again that at these congresses there is no possibility and no proof&#x2014;and hon. members were unable to produce any proof&#x2014;of one-directional indoctrination of the policy of the National Party. The best proof of that is that the United Party members, when it suits them, do not hesitate to quote what was said at those congresses against the National Party and its policy. I think this <span class="col_7919-7920" refersTo="page_0914"/>is conclusive proof of the statement I have now made. Let us not sow suspicion unnecessarily, when this is not justified. When we consider our educational set-up, let us consider it in general. Let us, in heaven&#x2019;s name, have an end to this hackneyed allegation of indoctrination, which we have been hearing about <i>ad nauseam,</i> but in regard to which we have never yet been given any proof. We had this position again in Brakpan. The same applies to the hon. member for Durban Central, who says that he has the proof. If he can produce proof of indoctrination, he must please raise the matter with the Director. The reliable and responsible educational authorities will see to it that those accusations are investigated. If you do not have confidence in those people who are in charge, because they are Afrikaans-speaking persons in all the provinces, see to it then that your own people get to those positions, and the member will perhaps have more confidence in them.</p>

<p>I want to mention another point in this context. My hon. colleague from Potchefstroom referred to certain pamphlets of the National Youth Action. No, it was the hon. member for Rissik. The hon. member for Wynberg&#x2019;s reply to that was: &#x201C;That has nothing to do with us.&#x201D;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. I know that. But this is the reproach I levelled at the United Party in a previous motion in this House, and it is one which I want to repeat. If we omit to do what we ou ht to do, we are as much to blame as we are for those things which we are deliberately doing to the young people. Let us do what we can to protect the young people in this country. to make them strong and prepared for the difficult task which they have to perform in this country tomorrow and the day after. I feel myself at liberty to say that my side of the House has never hesitated, not only today and during this session, but over the years, to say where it stands in respect of the youth in this country, in respect of the essentially sound, conservative youth in our country. The United Party is still sitting on two stools. They have never adopted a standpoint. With this unsavoury <i>Wits Student</i> incident which we had the United Party again fobbed off its task with the pious condemnation that it was unsavoury and that it was to be deplored, and thought that with that the matter had been dealt with. I say again that if the United Party is really concerned about the youth, they must adopt an attitude in favour of the conservative element amongst our youth, which is the most important element amongst our young people. As long as the United Party fails to do that, I will continue to say that they are neglecting their duty to the young people of South Africa by coming forward with these worthless arguments, as they again did this afternoon.</p>

<p>I now want to proceed to a rapid discussion of a few points which were raised. The hon. member for Berea touched upon a few very important matters here. He referred to an undertaking which my predecessor gave in 1969 in regard to the abuse of drugs and narcotics at schools, and referred to the Grobler Report. He asked whether we had done anything in this regard. I want to tell him that my department regards this instruction to it in a very serious light, and that the matter has received the attention of the Committee of Educational Heads, which busied itself with this matter for a long time and in a penetrating way; not only in analysing the problem, but in finding actual countermeasures. As the hon. member rightly said, knowledge alone is not a solution to the problem, the availability of means is also necessary. That is why I am pleased that it would appear as if the measures which my colleague, the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions, advocated here yesterday. apparently have the support of the hon. member for Berea. We also referred this to the Committee of University Principals. who also busied themselves with this problem, for the picture in that sphere also gives cause for concern and we must ensure that whatever is humanly possible is done here. The hon. member may therefore rest assured that this very important matter is receiving the necessary attention.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the question of statistics, and I want to agree with the hon. member that our statistics are not always in the form and on the level in which and on which they ought and could be, particularly in this century in which we are living. I should like to concede this to him and say that my department itself is concerned about it. The Human Sciences Research Council is at present investigating the individual data system. and my department is co-operating closely with it. I hope that when we have <span class="col_7921-7922" refersTo="page_0915"/>organized this matter more satisfactory statistics will be at our disposal.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the loss of training staff of my department to the universities for the different non-White ethnic units, and he related this in particular to pharmaceutical training. It is true that my department and all the educational departments are continually losing staff to other departments, and also to the private sector. I am sorry that we are losing these people, but I cannot stand in a man&#x2019;s way if he is able to better himself. On the other hand I also say that it is a good thing if people who have had training as a teacher or as a professor, people with a solid background, see an opportunity of rendering service in a different sphere of life, and I would not then like to stand in their way. We are losing these people, but I do not think they are being lost to our country. Therefore, as long as my department is losing them to our own country, I do not regard it as a disquieting problem and I do not regard it as essential that I should take steps to counteract the loss of these people.</p>

<p>There were other matters as well which were raised by the hon. member for Algoa. He referred to the increasing financial burden university education imposed on the State, and asked whether another system could not be applied. I want to remind him that the Van Wyk de Vries Commission is working on this matter under wide-ranging terms of reference, and that we hope to receive the report by the end of this year. One of the specific terms of reference on which that commission has to report is in fact the financial set-up, the financing of the universities. I hope that we will find that some light has been cast on this important aspect of university eduction. Where the hon. member linked this to the idea that the authority should seek closer contact with the students, in this sense that they can, by way of bursaries, have control over the progress they are making so that they do not spend and waste their good years at university, I think that this is something we will have to think about. It is quite true that there are people at the universities&#x2014;I am afraid that there are too many of them&#x2014;who are occupying the place of other people who want to study and do research work. Therefore we shall certainly look into this idea.</p>

<p>While I am dealing with this point, I want to say that there is another aspect and it is that we have by way of concession allowed certain non-White students, for whom provision does not yet exist at their own universities, to study at the White universities. I want to say this here today &#x2014;this is not a threat&#x2014;that if this concession is abused, in other words, if certain elements want to use those students, who are studying at our White universities by way of concession, as a lever to oppose the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate universities, they must know that the easiest action for us to take against this is simply to compel these students, for whom provision does exist at the other universities &#x2014;and these comprise the largest group&#x2014; to go there. I want to be specific; it is necessary. Studying at the University of Cape Town here are a large number of Coloureds and also Indian medical students. Studying at the University of the Witwatersrand are a large number of Indians, particularly in the medical faculty.</p>

<p>The hon. member is not as stupid as he is now pretending to be. I want to tell you that if those people are to be used as a lever to disparage our policy of separate university facilities, then I think it is time they made way for other people who want to come to our universities.</p>

<p>Sir, since I still have two minutes left, I shall refer to another matter which we shall also have to look into in conjunction with the problem raised by the hon. members for Algoa and De Aar and that is the following: On 1st June, 1969, there were 2 835 students from beyond our borders studying at our 10 White universities&#x2014;excluding the University of South Africa&#x2014; students therefore in regard to whom the taxpayers of South Africa are paying approximately R1 000 each per year to keep them there. I think the time has come for us to see whether those students are really studying, or whether we are not perhaps, in some of the cases, wasting our money on those students who come from beyond our borders.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The Bill of which I am now moving the Second Reading is a short and clear Bill. Accordingly it is not necessary to say a great deal about it. In any case, Sir, while on the one hand, this Bill deals with an extremely important aspect of our life in South Africa&#x2014;I want to go so far as to say a vitally important aspect of it&#x2014;it is, not only in South Africa, but throughout the world, an aspect, however important it may be, which is not talked about a great deal. Nor is it necessary to explain to hon. members why it is a matter which is not talked about a great deal.</p>

<p>As far as the background to this Bill is concerned, we have, of course, the Potgieter Report. I wish to avail myself of this opportunity once again to convey my thanks and appreciation to Appeal Judge Potgieter, not only for the study and recommendations he made in regard to our own intelligence set-up, but also for the very thorough and penetrating study he made of comparable security systems elsewhere in the world, and for the fact that we can have the benefit of that study of his. He has given us a useful document, and I think I am speaking on behalf of all on both sides of this House in saying that in this regard the Commissioner has done very good work for us.</p>

<p>Now, for the purposes of the background to the matter as a whole, and to the Bill in particular, I just want to refer to a few aspects of this report as put by the hon. Judge. But before I come to that, it is necessary for the purposes of the record that I should just in passing refer to certain aspects of the terms of reference which the Judge had to carry out. He had to inquire into and submit recommendations and a report on, <i>inter alia,</i> the following:</p>

<p>1. Whether the State Departments concerned in security function properly and act in a co-ordinated manner so as to ensure the greatest measure of efficiency, and to what extent each State Department concerned plays a necessary and an efficient part.</p>

<p>2. Any matter which, in the opinion of the Commission, constitutes a threat to the efficient functioning of the security organizations, the harmful effects, if any, which their activities might have on the State or its citizens and the anomalies which might possibly arise as a result of the operations of any of the said organizations or the actions of persons attached to or in control of them.</p>

<p>3. Any further aspect concerning the security structure of the State.</p>

<p>4. Whether, and to what extent, present legislation, or portions thereof, concerning the Bureau for State Security should be amended in the light of the recommendations and report on the above-mentioned matters.</p>

<p>You will therefore see from this, Sir, that we did not entrust only the security set-up to the Judge. In view of many things said at that time either out of ignorance or out of malice, I did not submit only the set-up as such to the Judge. The individuals concerned in it, their personalities and the discharge of the duties attaching to their <span class="col_7925-7926" refersTo="page_0917"/>offices were also relevant, for anyone to submit evidence in regard to them. It is important that one should bear this in mind.</p>

<p>Then I should like to refer to four paragraphs from this report. The first is paragraph 159 on page 43. There the hon. Judge says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is clear from the evidence that there are many conceivable variations of such an intelligence service, but it is equally clear that there is a need for a central intelligence organization in some form or other. The question is which form would be best for the Republic. Having carefully studied the various views of the persons who gave evidence, it is my considered opinion that, if the composition of an intelligence set-up in the Republic is approached objectively, taking into consideration existing defects, shortcomings and needs, as well as the security set-ups of other comparable democratic countries, the Bureau for State Security, as constituted at present and as it functions at present, is basically the most suitable central intelligence organization for the Republic.</block>

<p>I want to make it very clear to this House that, since I am primarily responsible for this particular security set-up, it has at all times been my object and my endeavour, in view of, as I have said, the vital importance of this matter to South Africa, to give South Africa only the best, regardless of what Government is in power and regardless of what person occupies the office in which I find myself today. But, Sir, it has been my object not only to establish the best security set-up, but also to find the best available persons for that set-up. I want to say here that most of the persons concerned in that set-up, from Gen. Van den Bergh downwards, I have known for many years. I knew them in the time when South Africa was faced with the biggest internal threat it has ever been faced with in its history. In other words, I have in fact been through the mill with those persons. I was aware of their potential; I was aware of what they had done, and it is not necessary for me to say more than this, that what was done in those years by these persons I have mentioned, deserves the thanks and appreciation of everybody in South Africa, regardless of his party affiliations. Sir, I shall now proceed to read paragraph 161 to you&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It should be noted that under the Prime Minister&#x2019;s direction, the Bureau for State Security is pre-eminently an intelligence organization with no executive powers such as powers of detaining persons, powers of arrest or any other similar Police powers. Nor can the Bureau be endowed with such powers since they can be granted only by legislation and there is none.</block>

<p>Those people who indulged in so much gossiping in respect of that matter must now decide for themselves what motives inspired them when they did that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The operational prevention or combating of threats or potential threats to the internal security of the State remains exclusively the task of the South African Police and does not fall under the functions of the Bureau for State Security. The allegation that by establishing the Bureau the Prime Minister has assembled an additional Police Force around him is therefore totally unfounded.</block>

<p>Sir, I refrain from making any further comment. I now go on to refer to paragraph 215&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As the evidence revealed that there was a lack of knowledge as well as some misunderstanding of the whole security set-up of the Republic, especially of the Bureau for State Security, among officials of various departments as well as the general public, and in view of the need for legislation since the Bureau also has to undertake internal intelligence, as indicated in paragraphs 194 and 202 above, legislation is in my opinion both desirable and essential.</block>

<p>He further states in paragraph 216&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is not my intention to draft legislation which is to be passed by Parliament. That is a task for the professional legal draftsmen of the Government. What I do intend to do, however, is to attempt a broad outline, with reference to the suggestions contained in this report, of the provisions that I consider should be embodied in such legislation. In Part VIII of the report, where I make my recommendations to you, I indicate which provisions I consider should be embodied in legislation relating to the <span class="col_7927-7928" refersTo="page_0918"/>State Security Council and the Bureau for State Security.</block>

<p>Sir, I leave the Potgieter report there. As I have said, as one who has been intimately concerned with the security set-up of South Africa since 1961 and who therefore possesses 12 years&#x2019; experience of this matter, I have no hesitation in telling the House that I should like very heartily to recommend this set-up, as embodied in legislation, to this House. It is my considered opinion that in the past South Africa has been served well by its officials in the various departments&#x2014;Defence, Police and the Bureau&#x2014;which are primarily concerned with security, and it is my considered opinion that after this Bill has been passed, it will be possible for South Africa to be served even better, because we shall have a firm basis and because I believe, and have reason to believe&#x2014;and am grateful for this&#x2014;that all misunderstanding, whether it was <i>bona fide</i> or otherwise, has now been eliminated as a result of this report. Sir, every country in the world must have a security set-up. It is not necessary for me to argue about the necessity of that. Over the years, of course, there has been a complete change in this sphere. In earlier years, as hon. members will remember, the security set-up of every country was directed primarily at foreign countries and, in fact, at potential enemies, because of a conventional declaration of war and the fact that an attack could be expected. Hon. members will agree with me that in the past one could see fairly long before the time that a war was coming; one could see how matters were working up to that climax, and as a result it was easier for countries to prepare for an attack or for a war. What is more, war was always preceded by a formal declaration of war by a state. All those things have changed in recent times. One can accept, as it were, that a formal declaration of war is as outmoded today as the clothes of ten years ago are. The situation has changed gradually, and instead of a formal declaration of war as one had at a certain stage in the past, a new element has crept in over the years, i.e. the element of softening up the country one wants to attack. Naturally, that softening-up process has various facets. War is not declare immediately, but a country is first softened up in various ways, so that when actual warfare is eventually proceeded to, one can very easily subject that country and render it powerless. If one looks at the various forms which that softening-up process assumes, it becomes clear how much more is expected of one&#x2019;s security set-up today than years ago when circumstances were different. I shall just mention a few of those things in passing. In the first place, there is the revolutionary undermining of the authority structure of the state, and in this respect, of course, Western democracies have a tremendous backlog in relation to communist states. The Western democracies do not have front organizations behind iron and other curtains. But it is a well-known fact and one which has to be taken into account that communism most definitely has front organizations in all Western democracies or is doing its best to establish front organizations in those countries, in order to make it easy for itself, of course, to be able to carry out that softening process successfully.</p>

<p>In the second place, we know from experience that the enemy makes use of people who commit sabotage, of people who terrorize by committing all sorts of deeds, of people who do not hesitate to commit political murders or political hijackings of people. But apart from these things, and we have experience of this as well, there is the way in which terrorists are not only trained and armed, but also assisted and sent into countries which are eventually regarded as enemies. But physical violence is not all that is involved. Another aspect&#x2014;and of this South Africa also has experience&#x2014;which presents itself in that regard and of which careful note should be taken, is the casting of suspicion on and boycotting of a country on every possible front so as to isolate that country from possible friends which can render it assistance if it is eventually attacked, and by means of isolation to deprive it of any assistance which friendly countries might otherwise have given it. To an increasing extent this is becoming a powerful weapon in the hands of hostile states, and in South Africa&#x2019;s case it is most definitely a weapon which we are taking into account. But in the case of South Africa, considering its strategic position as far as the Cape sea route is concerned and its strategic situation in relation to Africa, as well as its natural resources, it has also become increasingly important for South Africa to take cognizance of the procurement and organization of advanced bases or bridgeheads from where the country may eventually <span class="col_7929-7930" refersTo="page_0919"/>be attacked. This also places a very large burden on the intelligence set-up. Then, of course, there is the most recent development of which we also have to take cognisance, namely the stealing of processes concerning strategic matters, such as, to mention only one in passing, nuclear power, which plays a very important role in that regard. This, as I have said, is an indication of the importance of these various set-ups.</p>

<p>As far as the Bill itself is concerned, it must be realized very clearly that we are not concerned here with a substitution of the set-ups of both the Police and Defence which are necessary for their own purposes. This has nothing to do with that at all. We are concerned here with a security set-up whose task and function it is to gather such information as is necessary for combating these phenomenon I have mentioned in passing, as well as to evaluate that information, because good evaluation of information is perhaps in many respects more necessary than the gathering of information itself, because if one reacts to wrong information, hon. members can appreciate what tremendous blunders one can make in that regard. Then, of course, there is also the coordination of that information and the care which must be exercised to ensure that everybody is co-operating properly in that regard. Furthermore, I want to make it very clear that this set-up has nothing to do with the actual combating of any threats as such. The primary functions of this set-up are to determine and evaluate threats, but the actual combating of those threats are. of course, the task of the Police on the one hand or the task of the Defence Force on the other, depending in which sphere they occur. I am grateful to know that if and when it becomes necessary for both those two branches of the Service to act in their spheres, they will be able to do so most effectively.</p>

<p>Therefore, to sum up. if we have a proper security set-up, which this legislation gives us, a set-up which has also proved itself to be reliable and of the greatest use and service to South Africa without this legislation, and if. in conjunction with that set-up, we consider the striking arms of South Africa, namely the Police on the one hand and the Defence Force on the other, I believe that we have established a good set-up for South Africa in that sphere and that, considering our small size and the means at our disposal, we have given South Africa the maximum striking power to deal with possible enemy action. Of course, the recommendation of the set-up goes to the State Security Council, which is referred to in clause 4 of this Bill, and in respect of which I do not want to say anything further. In view of the report, what I have said here, and our past experience in this regard, I have no hesitation in recommending this Bill to hon. members.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>We, on this side of the House, intend supporting this legislation, and in doing so we wish to associate ourselves with the words of thanks and congratulation that have come from the hon. the Prime Minister for Judge Potgieter and the work he did in the report he submitted and on which this legislation is based. The hon. the Prime Minister has said that this deals with an aspect of life which is vitally important but not much talked about. Because it is not much talked about, there are difficulties in controlling it and there are sometimes dangers in the type of control that has to be exercised.</p>

<p>This Bill starts by dealing with national security intelligence and departmental intelligence and the functions of the Bureau in regard to those types of intelligence. National security intelligence is information which relates to, or may be relevant to, any threat or potential threat to the security of the Republic. It is noticeable that in the report the Judge, Mr. Potgieter, poses the question as to whether the functions or the aims of the Bureau, as outlined by him and as set out in the Bill, accord with the basic principles of intelligence and with the intelligence needs of the Republic. After an exhaustive survey, he comes to the conclusion that those deeds are met and recommends that the proposals he makes should be accepted by the Government. Quite obviously, what constitutes a threat or potential threat to the security of the Republic, is and must remain a matter of opinion; it can lead to various interpretations which will of course determine the scope of the activities of the Bureau and the work which it does.</p>

<p>The Commissioner himself was very conscious of this problem and he deals with it at length in trying to determine exactly what is the security of the State. <span class="col_7931-7932" refersTo="page_0920"/>I think we have to accept that unless the Bureau is going to work entirely in public, and thus defeat the very object of its existence, we have to take a great deal by way of acceptance on good faith and trust as there is no way in which it can be controlled. It is interesting that the Commissioner himself says at one stage of his report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Furthermore I should like to point out that the concept of &#x201C;security of the State&#x201D;&#x2014;the matter entrusted to the Bureau&#x2014;simply does not lend itself to any definition so comprehensive, precise and clear as to make it possible for anyone collecting intelligence relating to the security of the State not to exceed his statutory powers in doing so.</block>

<p>In other words, Sir, when powers are granted to a bureau of this kind, there are risks, obvious risks. I believe that these are risks that have to be taken in the light of the dangers to which the State is exposed at the present time. These are risks that have to be taken by any civilized state that wants to protect itself in this way. I believe that the control as it exists at the moment, which is virtually control by the Prime Minister of the day in charge of the Bureau, must be presumed to be the best we can afford in the circumstances.</p>

<p>There is another matter which arises from this Bill which concerns the collection of covert information&#x2014;covert departmental intelligence. It is quite clear that as from the passing of this Bill the collection of covert information, covert intelligence, becomes a monopoly of the Bureau except in certain exceptional cases. That applies both inside and outside South Africa. The Bill in doing this, in a sense removes an anomaly which existed because of the powers under the Police Act which gave the Security Police certain powers concerning which it was uncertain whether the Bureau enjoyed them to the same extent. It is interesting to note also the exceptions because they seem so well founded. The exceptions will be the Defence Force in time of war, the Defence Force in carrying out counter-intelligence activity or responsibilities with the consent of the Bureau and the Police Force when investigating an offence or performing a function in regard to the security of the Republic. But such collection of covert information must always be in a lawful manner. The report of the Commissioner makes it clear that there is no recommendation that the Bureau will have power to obtain information in such a way as to violate or affect the rights of third parties, e.g. entering and searching of premises in order to obtain information or intercepting of post or telephone conversations. &#x201C;This would require an Act of Parliament&#x201D;, the Commissioner said.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister, of course, knows my views on this particular aspect. He also knows that I will not be satisfied until this aspect of our intelligence is covered by adequate legislative enactments as he has indicated it is his intention to lay before the House in due course.</p>

<p>It will be done this Session.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I hope so and I am grateful to the hon. the Prime Minister for mentioning that. There is a third aspect which interests me, namely that this legislation represents to an extent the end of a lengthy argument, referred to in the Commissioner&#x2019;s report, as to what part should be played by the Security Police on the one side and the Bureau on the other in the intelligence community and why both bodies&#x2014;the one to the exclusion of the other, as the Commissioner says&#x2014;should operate in the field of intelligence in order to maintain and promote the interests of State security.</p>

<p>In the result we have accepted the Commissioner&#x2019;s recommendations in this Bill and we have decided in fact to put all our eggs into one basket, perhaps as never before, and to adopt a blue-print for our intelligence set-up different from those accepted in some other countries of the world while acceptable again in others. We are also sacrificing the safeguard of a double check by another independent intelligence organization in our country and perhaps limiting the possibilities of a wider field of training which might be of use to us in difficult times.</p>

<p>I fully appreciate that this is an expensive business and I must confess that I am impressed by the arguments of the Commissioner as set out in paragraphs 199 and 200 of his report, namely that it is probably wiser to have one body than two bodies. The reasons he gives are the difficulty of planning and co-ordinating the collection of intelligence if there is more than one agency, the difficulty of settling <span class="col_7933-7934" refersTo="page_0921"/>differences between divisions not in one agency, the possibility that departmental priorities may differ from national priorities and the desirability of the evaluator having authority over the collector of intelligence. He also raises the possibility of sabotage, where there is not proper control by the evaluator of the collector because they are not in the same agency. While I accept the cogency of his argument and while I accept that the set-up recommended is the best we can have, I am conscious of the possibility that one body established to preserve the security of the State from the intelligence point of view, might itself, if not properly controlled, pose a threat to the security of the State. I appreciate that the danger is minimal where that body has no executive powers, as is the case with the Bureau and as is the case in the course that we have adopted. I also appreciate that the course we have adopted is perhaps necessary because of the unique threats to the security of the Republic and because of the unique necessity for adequate intelligence in the present circumstances. Nevertheless, the course we have adopted lays a very great responsibility upon the Prime Minister of the day and his Security Council, because of the fact that there is only one body through which they will work.</p>

<p>There is one last aspect to which I wish to draw attention, namely that the State Security Council, as the Prime Minister has told us, is already in existence and already active. It has no statutory recognition as yet, but the hon. gentleman told us some considerable time ago in this House, that he had already appointed such a council.</p>

</speech>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>The Prime Minister says it is the Defence Cabinet Committee. Why then the necessity for statutory recognition? The Commissioner deals with that. He thinks it is necessary to demarcate clearly the powers, the functions and the duties of a security council as opposed to the Bureau. He thinks it is necessary not only because of a lack of knowledge and understanding by the public and some civil servants, but he couples it with the necessity of legislation to give the Bureau greater powers of collecting intelligence. I think these reasons are cogent enough to justify legislation and this is one of the reasons why it has our support. Some countries, of course, get on quite well without legislation. I believe there is no legislation in England and I do not believe there is any in Holland, France or in Rhodesia. In America, Australia and New Zealand they have legislation of a kind, but not exhaustive legislation. When one looks at this legislation, one wants to be sure that what we are doing is providing the best machine and having it working most efficiently. One clause of the Bill interested me, namely clause 5 (b) where it says that it shall be the function of the council on the recommendation of the Bureau to determine intelligence priorities. This seems to indicate to me, if those words have any meaning at all, that the determination of priorities can only be undertaken after the recommendation of the Bureau or on the recommendation of the Bureau.</p>

<p>I accept that. I shall move the necessary amendment or perhaps the hon. the Prime Minister will move such an amendment. I am sure that it will then be a more satisfactory provision.</p>

<p>I want to say, lastly, that I know that the hon. the Prime Minister has emphasized that the Bureau has no executive powers and that none is envisaged for it, that all it will do is collect, handle, collate and evaluate intelligence and that the operational action following upon those recommendations or findings will be left to the statutory organs of the State whose responsibility this is. I may say that I think that this is a happy solution.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House have pleasure in supporting this Bill. What we need is the best possible intelligence setup which is possible for us to get. In supporting the Bill I want to offer on behalf of this side of the House, our best wishes for successful operations for all those connected with this aspect of our public life.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there is not much that I wish to add to what has been said by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition as far as this Bill is concerned. I intend to support this Bill. I do not think that it introduces any new principle really. <span class="col_7935-7936" refersTo="page_0922"/>We already have a Bureau. It does not set up the Bureau; the Bureau is there already. This, in fact, was done by the State President in 1969 in terms of our Constitution Act. What the Bill does do, of course, is to define the functions of the Bureau. It does not either, I might say, set up a new council, for, as the hon. the Prime Minister has said, we already have a council albeit called by a different name. But now we have a council being set up in terms of this particular Bill, that is, by legislation.</p>

<p>The functions of the Bureau, as I see it, seem to me to be narrower than the ones which were originally set out in the <i>Gazette</i> that established the Bureau. It can now only collect, evaluate, correlate and interpret and previously, it could also investigate. It seems to me, therefore, that to some extent the powers of the Bureau have been somewhat narrowed.</p>

<p>As far as the Potgieter Report is concerned, it asks that the Bureau must not concern itself with the conduct or views of individuals although it did have difficulty in defining the security of the State. The Bureau, in terms of the Bill, can collect departmental intelligence only at the request of the department. As it was before, it seemed to me that it could collect it off its own bat. It did not require to have the invitation of any department. The Bureau, of course, is committed at all times when dealing with security to collect intelligence in a covert manner. It is very difficult. I think, to confine the word &#x201C;covert&#x201D;, although, I think, it would have been rather desirable. I would have wished that in some way or other paragraph 293 of the report could have been incorporated into this Bill. That is the paragraph which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To preclude any possibility of abuse and to secure public goodwill and confidence, it should be made clear beyond all doubt that the Bureau&#x2019;s activities will at all times be restricted to matters that have an actual connection with the security of the State and that the Bureau will in no circumstances interfere with the private conduct of persons or their business activities or political views except in so far as these are of a subversive nature.</block>

<p>One can only hope that the Bureau at least will take cognizance of the views expressed by Judge Potgieter in this regard.</p>

<p>There is one thing the hon. Prime Minister omitted to mention in his historical introduction, and that is what led to the appointment of the Potgieter Commission in the first place. It was as a result of the considerable public anxiety and suspicion which came about not because of the actual creation of Boss&#x2014;that issue passed through this House without opposition in 1969 when it was created by virtue of the amendments to the Public Service Act&#x2014; but because of the fact that a few weeks later two clauses were introduced in the General Laws Amendment Bill which apparently gave much wider powers than one had anticipated to this Bureau. The two sections, sections 10 and 29, created the consternation&#x2014;one had to do with the presentation of evidence and the other with the releasing of any news or information which might be deemed to come within the orbit of State security. I think it was largely as a result of this consternation and the outcry against the seemingly very wide powers indeed of the Bureau that the Potgieter Commission was appointed. I see that we have another General Laws Amendment Bill coming up any minute to be introduced by the hon. Minister of Justice. To me it seems a pity that we did not have that Bill before us before we discussed this Bill. Again one has to rather take on trust that there will be no further clauses which will cause further consternation.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. the Leader of the Opposition for his support of this Bill. I was interested to hear his views on various matters. It is, as the Leader of the Opposition said, not easy to define precisely &#x201C;what constitutes a threat to security&#x201D;. Sometimes it will be difficult and at other times it will of course be easier. As regards the more difficult matters one can, although one cannot say this conclusively, indicate by way of broad guidelines what threatens the security of the State and what does not. One of the guidelines one can indicate in this regard is that in a democratic state, as we are, a change of government only takes place after a lawful election. Any organization or set-up calculated at taking over the government without that process, which is known to all of us, naturally constitutes a threat to the security of the state. If one keeps that in mind, one cannot go too far wrong.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition also referred to one deficiency, a deficiency which is caused by having one organization, a unitary organization, and that is that the element of having a double-check is absent in that case. It is well known that in security circles it is always said that &#x201C;an overlap is better than a gap&#x201D;. There is a great deal to be said for that overlap arising from that. But, having regard to South Africa&#x2019;s manpower position, the funds at its disposal, and the difficulties other countries have already had with double-check organizations, I want to agree with the Leader of the Opposition that, although on the one hand one feels sorry about this deficiency, it nevertheless is best, as the hon. Judge recommended, to accept the set-up as we have it here. I have already given my standpoint on clause 5 (d) by way of interjection, and we can profitably take another look at it in the Committee Stage. We can then effect an amendment, in so far as it may be necessary, to achieve the same purpose. But the present wording gives a wrong impression of what one actually wants in this regard.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton is apparently concerned that she will be the subject of interest. I want to tell the hon. member that I am not at all interested in her in this respect, nor in other respects. I may tell the hon. member in passing, that we have already announced previously that we accept the recommendations of the Potgieter Report. As regards clauses 10 and 29 we accept the recommendations of the Potgieter Report. These are contained in the Bill of which the hon. the Minister of Justice has given notice. If she wants to discuss this further, she will find a willing debating partner in my hon. colleague in this regard.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The Bill I am laying before this hon. House today is not of a contentious nature, and by and large it seeks to promote our wine exports, in so far as technical control of quality are concerned. The legislation was drafted in close consultation with the K.W.V. and the liquor trade. During the latter half of April, 1972, urgent discussions were conducted by experts of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services with the wine division of the European Community in Brussels. Officials of the K.W.V. attended the discussions as observers. Before I proceed to giving an explanation of the Bill in broad outline, I must mention that the earlier entry of the United Kingdom into the EEC has precipitated this legislation to such an extent that the Republic has to submit the necessary application documents supported by adequate legislation, prior to 15th June, 1972. For the sake of the wine farmers of our country, this consequently is a matter of urgent importance.</p>

<p>Because of the regulation and the ordering of the wine market within the EEC and the legislation drafted by the EEC in this regard, it has become essential for countries exporting wine to the EEC either to enter into an undertaking that they will submit to the reference prices fixed by the EEC for ordinary wines and liqueur wines (sherries and port) or to furnish proof of a recognized system for the controlled production and marketing of quality wines from particular areas. In the case of the <span class="col_7939-7940" refersTo="page_0924"/>first mentioned the agreement in respect of submitting to the reference price is not necessary as the fixed reference price in the EEC for liqueur-wines (sherries and port) is prohibitively high. Other countries, for example Spain and Portugal, have had their wines recognized in the EEC as protected origin wines, and consequently these countries are able to market their products at a much more favourable and much lower price.</p>

<p>Consequently it has been necessary to introduce as a matter of urgency a system of demarcation in the Republic which will be acceptable locally as well as in the EEC. Over the past 18 months such a system has been developed which may be applicable in the Republic without any serious local disruption. According to recent discussions with wine experts of the EEC the system will possibly be acceptable there as well. Clauses 7 and 8 will legalize the system.</p>

<p>During the recent discussions with the wine experts of the EEC they were kind enough to point out certain shortcomings in the principal Act which could complicate further negotiations with the EEC Commissions. The shortcomings mainly concerned defective definitions in our legislation of the South African varieties of wine being exported at present. Consequently urgent amendments to the Act have to be effected, and clauses 1 to 5 seek to effect these.</p>

<p>While the aforementioned negotiations were in progress representations were received from the wine farmers in the Western Cape for statutory protection to be given to the production and marketing of wines produced and made ready for the market by the farmers themselves on their farms and marketed as such by the farmers as estate wines. As these so-called estate wines were abused to an increasing extent in the past, the representations of the farmers enjoy strong support. The farmers&#x2019; needs have been taken into account in the demarcation system, which ought to suit them extremely well.</p>

<p>Provision is being made for making particular sections of the principal Act applicable in South-West Africa by proclamation in the <i>Government Gazette</i> in order to avoid having to effect special amendments to the Act at a later stage when it may become necessary to do so. At present the Department of Customs and Excise is experiencing problems in the application of its legislation as more vineyards are being planted and the production of wine and spirits will shortly be realized. Said department will undoubtedly need the support of the principal Act.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to address a word of thanks to all those concerned in this export product for their co-operation. We know that there will be a considerable number of problems and that we shall constantly have to make adjustments in order to bring our house in order. I should like to point out that although there was very close liaison and consultation with the interested parties at the time of drafting the legislation, there is some uncertainty as to what the regulations will contain. I want to say in anticipation that the usual consultation will again take place before the regulations are published. Since we are concerned here with a particularly involved problem, existing practices and vested interests will duly be taken into account, and what will be done, will be done for the sake of or in the interest of the industry as a whole.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, on behalf of this side of the House I should like to support the Second Reading of this Bill. It is refreshing to find in this instance that the industry has taken the initiative in giving the consumer the guarantees and safeguards regarding the origin and quality of the product, which he ought to have. What is envisaged in this legislation is just honesty of description and that is very necessary. Much has been said and written about consumerism today. Consumerism is nothing other than the unwillingness of the man in the street to be misled by the description of the manufacturer of the produce he wants to sell. At one time it was fashionable to say: &#x201C;Beware, the buyer&#x201D;, but today, with the advent of consumerism, it is more fashionable, correct and valid to say: <i>&#x201C;Caveat vendor</i>&#x201D; (Beware the seller). Legislation all too often follows far too slowly in the wake of public need and wish, and usually, when it is presented, it is opposed by every means, and for lack of a better word, and for the sake of courtesy, we have to call it, by vested interests.</p>

<p>No, Sir, I am following the line of the Deputy Minister. In view of the fact that this concerns wine, <span class="col_7941-7942" refersTo="page_0925"/>of which certain people have very little knowledge, and in view of the fact that only experts have this knowledge, you will realize, of course, that I have to be very careful to refresh my memory occasionally, in order to convey to non-consumers exactly what all this means. So, Sir, I say that the importance of this particular legislation is that for the first time we have here honesty of description. Not only do we have that, but we also have protection for the consumer. From now onwards the consumer will know that wine made from a certain grape will in fact be made from that grape, and that wine produced in a certain area will in fact be produced from grapes grown in that particular area. Above all, we are not dealing only with the protection given to the consumer. With this legislation we hope to retain the old markets we enjoyed for so many years overseas. With the description of concepts such as vintage years, areas of production and the types and quality of wines, a set pattern, to a very large extent, has been followed by the older countries, particularly in Europe. I am pleased to be able to say that both the producers and the manufacturers are agreed&#x2014;although I suppose they have had to make certain sacrifices&#x2014;that this legislation is necessary. For that reason we support this Bill and we wish the industry well.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second</block>

<p>Time.</p>

<p>The proposed amendments to the Marketing Bill as set out in the Bill arise for the most part from the request submitted to me by the National Woolgrowers&#x2019; Association of South Africa for the introduction of a new wool marketing system.</p>

<p>It is generally known that the wool market recently reached a low ebb. A variety of factors, such as high rates of interest, uncertain economic conditions in manufacturing countries and increasing production of synthetic fibre, undoubtedly contributed to this state of affairs. Although an improvement in price levels has recently been experienced, particularly after adjustments in rates of exchange, it has been evident for some time that the wool marketing system as it has been understood and applied up to now, would have to be given a thorough overhaul. Competition on the part of synthetic fibre remains a threat to the economic survival of the wool industry which makes the acceptance of effective marketing techniques even more necessary.</p>

<p>With the appointment of a committee of inquiry in 1970 by the South African Wool Commission the existing wool marketing system was closely scrutinized. This matter has since been thoroughly thrashed out at congress and managerial level by the National Woolgrowers&#x2019; Association, the S.A. Wool Board and S.A. Wool Commission, so much so&#x2014;and I am pleased to be able to say this&#x2014;that the marketing system which is now proposed in the place of the existing system has the support of virtually all producers.</p>

<p>The wool industry is at present being served by two separate statutory bodies, each with its own Act and its own specified responsibility. On the one hand we have the S.A. Wool Commission which is responsible for the marketing of raw wool. On the other hand, the S.A. Wool Board deals with matters such as research and the promotion of wool products. Although sound reasons existed at the time for establishing two control bodies, the wool industry can no longer afford the luxury of two separate statutory boards. In fact, when the advantages and disadvantages are weighed up, it is evident, apart from considerations of cost, that the amalgamation of the two boards is a positive step in every respect. The Bill therefore seeks to amalgamate the Wool Board and the Wool Commission into a single control body under the Marketing Act. This entails that both the Wool Commission and the Wool Amendment Act, 1960, and the Wool Act, 1967, be repealed and replaced by a scheme to be promulgated under the Marketing Act. The new control board will be established under the scheme and will be the successor in title to the Wool Board and the Wool Commission.</p>

<p><span class="col_7943-7944" refersTo="page_0926"/>The proposed scheme is at present in the process of being prepared but it is envisaged to make provision in it for a support price scheme similar to the one at present being administered by the Wool Commission. Provision is also being made for a one-channel pool scheme if such a step should prove to be desirable.</p>

<p>The control board then manages a pool for the sale of the wool supplied to it and divides the proceeds of the wool equally among the participating producers. The producer receives an advance on supplying his wool to the board. Certain aspects of the proposed scheme are not quite reconcilable with the present context of the Marketing Act, and it is consequently proposed that the shortcomings be rectified. For example, it is proposed to extend the provisions in regard to assistance rendered by a control board to certain undertakings and research work in regard to a controlled product and the promotion of the demand for such a product so that these functions may also be carried out in respect of sheep or wool textile goods. In addition, it is envisaged to authorize the board to withdraw wool from the pool for its own account at a price determined by the board on a basis approved by the Minister.</p>

<p>Since the supply of small quantities of wool by producers directly to the control board is not practical, it is proposed to allow the existing practice to continue according to which country shopkeepers buy and collect different types of wool which they subsequently trade in saleable quantities for their own account. However, such shopkeepers will be compelled to sell the wool they collect in this way through the control board only, and the Bill therefore contains the necessary provision in this regard.</p>

<p>To enable the new control board to obtain the services of wool marketing and textile industry experts as full-fledged members of the board, it is being proposed that provision be included in the Act for the appointment of persons as members of a control board by virtue of their special knowledge of a subject mentioned in the scheme. These members will, therefore, not represent some or other branch of the relevant industry in the board or be nominated by some or other body for appointment to the board.</p>

<p>So much then as far as wool matters are concerned. The economic establishment and multiplication of virus-free plant material required by producers for production purposes, cannot always be offered on a commercial basis. It has therefore become necessary for control boards to be given authority to undertake this service themselves and to obtain, develop and multiply such plant material and make it available to nurseries and producers.</p>

<p>It is also deemed necessary to bring the Marketing Act more up to date in certain respects and to eliminate certain deficiencies. The provisions in regard to the funds of control boards have been revised in this regard and brought into line with what is being done in practice. Furthermore, certain simplifications in the procedure in regard to the continuation of appeals are being proposed, while the proposal to authorize the Minister, in the place of the State President, to make regulations in terms of the Act is aimed at simplifying the administrative procedure.</p>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, it is a pleasure to us on this side of the House to support this Bill. In the first part of his speech the hon. the Minister mainly confined himself to amendments affecting the wool industry, and proceeded to refer to the powers which are now being given to the other control boards in this Bill. I want to say in the first place that we support the powers which are being given to the other control boards. As far as the wool industry as such is concerned and the amendments effected in the Marketing Act to comply with the request of the National Wool Growers&#x2019; Association and the organized wool growers in the country in regard to certain matters pertaining to the marketing of wool, I should just like to deal briefly with some of the aspects. I notice in clause 1 (f) that &#x201C;wool&#x201D; is not defined, and I shall be glad if the hon. the Minister will give his attention to that matter. Wool is, in fact, defined in the marketing scheme, but the marketing scheme is not the Marketing Act.</p>

<p>I want to confine myself for the most part to clause 18, which deals with the wool industry. As I have done on previous occasions at wool growers&#x2019; meetings, I want to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to the fact that wool as a primary product is quite unique in that 85 per cent of our wool is sold on overseas markets, where the price is determined on the basis of demand and supply on an entirely open market. This is quite different from the position of any of the other <span class="col_7945-7946" refersTo="page_0927"/>primary products which fall under the Marketing Act at this stage. Sir, with some of us it is quite an open question to what extent the Marketing Act and a scheme under the Marketing Act will comply with the marketing requirements of a product which differs so greatly from any other primary product and which is quite unique in that respect. One of the most important reasons which motivated the leaders of the industry to ask for a change in the marketing system is the fact that wool has to compete with synthetic fibres, as was mentioned here by the hon. the Minister. Since the consumer has, for as long as a whole year and sometimes for an even longer period, to pay a fixed price for synthetic fibres and the consumer is therefore in a position to know from time to time the exact price he has to pay for synthetic fibre, it was the intention of the wool industry to bring about this very same certainty as far as wool prices are concerned; in other words, to make it possible for the consumer, the manufacturer, or whoever it may be, to be able to buy wool at a fixed price for the whole year. Sir, I want to mention certain matters which make this matter very difficult. One of them is that this is a product which is sold on an open world market on the basis of supply and demand; and when one sells wool at a fixed price and there is a shortage of supplies one faces the problem of the allocation of wool to the consumers in the various countries who want to buy that wool. This is one of the virtually insurmountable problems in this connection. The intention was that the three wool producing countries in the Southern Hemisphere, viz., Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, should co-operate to establish a scheme for the better marketing of wool in terms of which countries which want to buy wool would know at what fixed price they can buy their wool. I want to suggest that neither Australia nor New Zealand is at this stage ready to accept a scheme of this nature and that, under those circumstances, we will simply have to continue as we have done in the past.</p>

<p>Another matter of importance, Sir, is that we had two boards under the old dispensation, viz., one board which had to do with the promotion of the product and with research and which had&#x2014;and still has&#x2014;offices in 28 or 29 countries throughout the world. Those offices appealed to those countries by virtue of the fact that they had nothing to do with marketing. They were purely research and promotional institutions established as information offices and accepted in a good spirit throughout the world. This situation would change considerably if there is only one board dealing not only with research and the promotion of wool, but also with the marketing of the product. This is an aspect which is of particular importance to us because wool is a fibre which has to endure immense competition not only on the part of synthetic fibres but also from other types of fibres. Research as well as the promotion of the product is therefore a particularly important aspect of the industry. We should like to have access to as many countries as possible in the world, without this problem of marketing and the competition which accompanies it. However, these amendments were asked for by the organized wool farmers. Sir, I trust that the hon. the Minister will give his attention to the few aspects I have mentioned here. It is a pleasure for us on this side of the House to give our support to these amendments to the Marketing Act.</p>

<speech by="#hayward">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. S. HAYWARD</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for East London City mentioned a few minor matters here which I want to respond to briefly. The hon. member referred to the new marketing system as if it were a supply scheme establishing direct sales. I want to make it quite clear here today that the present system of selling wool, both internationally and here in South Africa, will remain&#x2014;this has been stated quite clearly and plainly&#x2014;as long as it is in the interests of the producer. In other words, the present system of auctions will continue as long as it is in the interests of the producer and as long as it is the best way in which to serve the industry as such.</p>

<p>Another aspect raised by the hon. member and with which I want to deal briefly, is the fact that the Wool Board and, through the Wool Board, also the International Wool Secretariat, are only concerned with advertising and research. I do not want to predict what is going to happen in the future, but this is one of the main reasons why developments are taking place in all three of the member countries in regard to new marketing schemes. Probably the deficiency in the past was that people, both internationally and internally, were handicapped in this respect, that they have been promoting a certain product by means of advertising, that they have carried <span class="col_7947-7948" refersTo="page_0928"/>out research in regard thereto, but that they have never been in a position to offer the manufacturer the real raw product he has to have. However, I do not want to deal with this matter at any great length now, because this is something one may consider in future. I am very pleased that the Opposition supports this Bill. I think that, since we are enacting such a drastic Bill in regard to the future marketing of wool, it is necessary for us to reach agreement in regard thereto and I am, therefore, very pleased that this Bill has the support of the Opposition. On this occasion I should also like to place on record my appreciation of the value of the Marketing Act since this legislation establishes the 21st marketing scheme under that Act; in other words, that that set-up, through this new scheme, attains its majority. The measure before us recognizes the new wool marketing scheme. Since I have been closely connected with developments in this regard, you, Sir, will allow me to deal at some length with the history of this matter.</p>

<p>The marketing system of raw wool in South Africa, as well as in other wool producing countries, was subject to close scrutiny in recent times. The instability and the low prices, particularly over the last few years, were perhaps the main reason for this. A further reason was the sharp increase in the marketing cost of wool, particularly in the last number of years. On the recommendation of the National Wool Growers&#x2019; Association the Minister of Agriculture, in 1971, appointed a committee of inquiry to go into all the aspects of the marketing of wool. This committee published its report in record time, in April 1971. The main recommendation contained in this report is to the effect that the Wool Commission should be given powers to take over and market the South African clip. There are three main reasons why the commission came to this conclusion. The first and probably the most important reason is the instability in the wool prices over the past number of decades and in particular the serious recession during the past few years. I want to illustrate briefly in which way this fluctuation took place over the last number of years. If we take 1947-&#x2019;48 as basis and fix an index of 82 there, we see&#x2014;I am now going to read to you some of the figures to illustrate how this varies&#x2014; that it increased to 92 the following year. In 1948-&#x2019;50 it increased to 126. In 1950-&#x2019;51, the boom year, it increased to 272. Then, in 1951-&#x2019;52, it dropped to 132 and increased to 164 in 1952-&#x2019;53. The next year it was fairly stable but in 1954-&#x2019;55 it dropped once more alarmingly to 137; in 1955-&#x2019;56 there was a further drop to 122 and then there was a sharp increase to 160 in 1956-&#x2019;57 and once more a drop to 121 in 1957-&#x2019;58. In 1958-&#x2019;59 it dropped to 95, almost to the starting figure, and in 1959-&#x2019;60 it increased once more to 114, and so it goes on until it reaches an index figure of 98 in 1970-&#x2019;71. But if we deduct the supplementary price paid by the Wool Commission, we shall see that the real index without the supplementary price comes to 80, which is really less than what it was in 1947-&#x2019;48. I say this is probably the main reason why the committee came to this conclusion. In other words, I would say that the Wool Commission, through the arrangement to obtain the wool and to market it itself, may probably succeed in eliminating this instability in course of time. But the second and also very important reason is probably the outdated marketing system. I just want to read to you, Sir, what the finding of the Committee is in this regard. This is what it says in its survey on the marketing of wool (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In regard to the marketing of wool, very little was done in the past decade to modernize the marketing system and to keep pace with modern marketing trends. It is true that while the manufacturers of man-made fibres established themselves on the world textile market in competition with the well entrenched natural fibres and in strong competition with one another by accepting revolutionary marketing practices, the wool marketing system for the most part remained out-dated and opposed to any changes &#x2026; It is also true that the wool producer has very little say in the marketing and price of his product. Wool is sold at auctions and except for the protection afforded by the reserve price scheme of the Wool Commission, the producer could virtually exercise no influence on the price of his product. He has the right to withhold his clip for sale at the auction or to withdraw it from the auction, but it still remains a speculative and risky step.</block>

<p>The National Wool Growers go further as far as this specific aspect is concerned and ask the South African Wool Board to make <span class="col_7949-7950" refersTo="page_0929"/>a further study, through its economic divisions of the economy of the sheep and wool industry. Economists who went into this matter, put it briefly as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In contrast with the marketing of man-made fibres the production, marketing and processing of wool is a long process. The marketing process of wool has to adjust itself to the demands of the 20th century. Traditional marketing methods must be modernized and streamlined to fit in with the demands of modern times. It is, for example, inconceivable in this modern century for each wool pack to be identified at the selling point by its owner and sold separately. The manufacturers of synthetic fibre markets his fibre in a professional way from the time it is produced in the factory until it is sold over the counter of the retailer, i.e. all along the pipe-line. This includes processing, distribution sales at attractive terms, finance discount for bulk purchases, guarantees for the repetition of orders at certain prices, supply of machinery and technical advice, the supply of advertising and promotion funds. In addition to this complete service of the pipe-line the manufacturers of synthetic fibre have the advantage that their fibre pipe-line is much shorter than that of wool, and capital is tied up for shorter periods. In contrast with the marketing process of synthetic fibre very little took place during the past two decades as far as the marketing of wool is concerned. One can almost say without fear of contradiction that at the time when the manufacturers of man-made fibres were rationalizing and modernizing their marketing system, wool marketing became virtually stagnated. One can quite rightly say that while the man-made fibres are marketed according to the modern concept, wool is sold and not marketed.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to suggest that this statement is absolutely correct. As a result of various factors we have probably become stagnated in our approach. We did not bring our marketing up to date and we did not move with the times. A further reason why the committee came to this conclusion, is that our seasonal marketing and irregular supply of certain types are definitely not conducive to orderly consumption. One final and very important aspect for this finding, is because we are convinced that savings may be effected at the selling points. All five provincial congresses as well as the central congress of the National Wool Growers&#x2019; Association in September, 1971, accepted this key recommendation of the committee of inquiry. They instructed the Wool Commission and the Wool Board to give effect to this recommendation as soon as possible. Both these bodies went to work immediately to formulate a new scheme. On this occasion I should like to express my heartfelt thanks to the Marketing Council for the particular assistance they have rendered through particularly Mr. van Rensburg to provide us with a new scheme so quickly and efficiently. I will also fail in my duty if I do not express our gratitude and appreciation to the hon. the Minister of Agriculture for his assistance in regard to this new scheme. I should like to put one matter right. In some quarters it was suggested that the Minister of Agriculture brought pressure to bear to force this measure, which is before us today, on the National Wool Growers&#x2019; Association. I want to say without fear of contradiction that at no time was pressure brought to bear, that the Minister did not at any time tell us what such a scheme should look like. With his wide experience he gave us positive guidance in this matter, and I shall come back to this later. During the whole of this period two other very important aspects emerged. These were, in the first place, whether a scheme should be established under the Wool Act or whether a scheme should be established under the Marketing Act. Also in this case, after protracted discussions with the hon. the Minister, both the Wool Board and the Wool Commission was of the unanimous opinion that, in view of the circumstances, it would definitely be better to operate under the Marketing Act. I want to say immediately that our member countries in the International Wool Secretariat envy South Africa its Marketing Act because one can introduce virtually any scheme by means of this umbrella measure. The Minister recommended to us that it would definitely be much better for him as well as for the industry if we would operate under the Marketing Act particularly in view of the fact that this is a new scheme and teething troubles may arise. If any changes have to be introduced it would be much easier to introduce them under the Marketing Act than under any separate Act, since <span class="col_7951-7952" refersTo="page_0930"/>it then has to be done by means of an amendment which has to be approved by this Parliament. However, if this is done under the Marketing Act it can be done by way of regulation. Another aspect which emerged quite clearly during this time, is whether it was still essential to have a separate Wool Commission and a separate Wool Board. Also in this respect we had a unanimous recommendation from both these boards to the effect that it was time these two organizations amalgamated, as is embodied in this measure before us. In the course of his Second Reading speech the hon. the Minister said that we could definitely no longer afford the above that there is also the fact that since we maintain such close links with other countries in the international sphere and since we have an organization such as the International Wool Secretariat matters have always been made very difficult particularly for the International Wool Secretariat, because it liaises through the Wool Board. As soon as it mentions marketing it has no liaison any more because the Wool Board has no functions in this regard. It then has to be done through the Wool Commission. This is a dual purpose system which has probably worked well initially but which has definitely become superfluous and not only superfluous but it also created problems as far as liaison is concerned. On 6th December the draft scheme was submitted to the central executive of the National Wool Growers&#x2019; Association. by whom it was approved except for a few changes. Furthermore, the executive committee of the National Wool Growers&#x2019; Association was instructed to finalize the scheme, which was officially submitted to the hon. the Minister on 4th February, 1972. In order to indicate the member countries I should like to quote what happens in the other countries of the International Wool Secretariat. In the first place, in respect of Australia&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In their 30 page submission to the Federal Government on 17th March, the Australian Wool Industry Conference set out in clear and concise terms proposals for changing their entire marketing system for the nation&#x2019;s five million bale clip. Apart from the formal suggestion that the Australian Wool Board and the Wool Commission should be amalgamated, most of the proposals were concerned with the complete acquisition of the clip by a central marketing authority.</block>

<p>In other words, the same as what we are doing here. Their Wool Commission and Wool Board are amalgamating and they are making arrangements to bring about a complete take-over of their wool clip. Unfortunately they are not in the fortunate position in which South Africa finds herself. Legislation of this nature has to be approved by all their provincial parliaments before it can be submitted to the Federal Government to be approved there by means of legislation. There is a great deal of concern among the producers of Australia because of the fact that it takes such a long time to have this legislation approved. In regard to New Zealand, the following is stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The New Zealand Wool Board announced today a proposal for a wool marketing corporation to be formed as soon as possible. The corporation would acquire and market all shorn wool from July, 1973.</block>

<p>In other words, there was definite co-ordination during the whole of this period. There was close liaison between all three member countries and particularly between the two fine wool producing countries of the world. We act in concord in this regard.</p>

<p>There are various people who have expressed their concern as to what the feelings of commerce would be about these arrangements we are making now. I just want to quote to the House what happened last year at the congress of the International Wool Textile Organization&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All the passion has gone out of wool acquisition and the whole subject seems to have gone through the Paris IWTO meeting like a greased pig. Mr. Herbert Waldhausen, a man who has never been known to refuse a fight if he felt the subject was worth fighting for. seems to have summed it up in a few well-chosen words. As chairman of the Wool Committee, he said: &#x201C;If acquisition of the wool clip by statutory authority is the only way in which such necessary changes can be brought about, then acquisition must be accepted,&#x201D; whereupon the IWTO quietly accepted the idea of wool acquisition in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.</block>

<p>In other words, not only did we have the approval of our member countries in this <span class="col_7953-7954" refersTo="page_0931"/>matter, but also that of the International Wool Textile Organization, who are actually the people who have to buy our wool. As I have indicated, they are quite in favour of this measure.</p>

<p>I want to say in conclusion that one does not want to go into the detail of this scheme. Various measures of drastic nature have been taken. I believe that the wool industry of South Africa as well as perhaps the wool industry of the world will enter a new era with this measure and the measures taken in other countries. It is my personal wish, and I know also that of our hon. the Minister, that an attempt will be made through these measures to negotiate a better dispensation for the wool industry. We want to assure all the wool producers in South Africa that we have not considered these matters lightly and that decisions have not been taken lightly, but that these were done with the necessary sense of responsibility towards a major industry such as this one which has earned South Africa a great deal of foreign exchange over the years. We want to express the hope that our wool farmers will only meet with success in the international sphere with this new dispensation.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as indicated by the hon. member for East London City, we on this side of this House naturally welcome this legislation in terms of which wool will be placed under the control of a controlling body. That controlling body will have the entire clip under its control and will then sell it. The farmers have requested this. Furthermore, it is necessary that we have such a scheme, because until now wool has never been marketed. We have the best fibre in the world and we have simply been selling it on an auction system. We have had to accept the price which the purchaser was prepared to pay. In later years, of course, there was a propping-up scheme. I want to pay tribute to the hon. member for East London City for that today. Hon. members opposite will not take it amiss of me if I do so, because although we differ from one another politically, it is probably right to pay tribute to someone who has served an industry as the hon. member for East London City has served the wool industry.</p>

<p>As I have said, we have not marketed wool, but have put it up for auction and have then had to be satisfied with the price it fetched. Now, I want to say to this House that if Rex Trueform were to put up all its suits for auction tomorrow, those suits would not realize 1s. 6d. If Edgars were to put up all its shoes for auction, those shoes would not realize 1s. 6d. either. One cannot sell these product at an auction; they must be traded with. This legislation makes provision for that. It authorizes the controlling body to sell wool. The hon. member for Graaff-Reinet said they would retain the auction system as long as it was in the interests of South Africa. He is right. I know what difficulties are involved in that. As far back as 1936, when the International Wool Secretariat, with Australia, New Zealand and South Africa as members, met for the first time, their aim was to fix the price of wool. Those three countries control wool and can therefore fix the price. Wool is not a perishable product; it is an easy product to control. It can be re-sold; it can be traded with. Contracts can be concluded with manufacturers so that they may buy it directly from one. If necessary, the necessary credit facilities can be granted. I am aware of the difficulties attached to the industry. The hon. member for East London City also pointed them out. Subsequently the hon. member for Graaff-Reinet also referred to them, and he is well acquainted with the wool industry. We respect his views in that regard. This legislation is enabling legislation, and provides the authority for this to be done. I therefore hope they will work in that direction, because I believe it will be the eventual and only direction in which the wool industry can in fact be placed on the right basis. The price must be fixed, but it must not be unreasonable, and even less can it be uneconomic. If, then, there is no demand at a price which is profitable for the farmer, we must eventually stop producing wool. It is no use producing it at a price level which is not profitable for the farmer. I believe this will be the outcome of the scheme. I hope that the boards of control in charge here will work in such a direction.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. S. PANSEGROUW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege for me to be able to participate in this debate this afternoon. What has struck me is that every speaker, including the hon. the Minister, has been closely associated with this industry for many a long year. I cannot think of our past, and I imagine it is the same with every member who has participated in this <span class="col_7955-7956" refersTo="page_0932"/>debate, without thinking of the close link we have had with the Merino sheep in South Africa. The hon. member for Graaff-Reinet, referred to the tremendous price fluctuations that had occurred over the years in respect of this fibre. For the past 50 years, most of us have had close contact with all the problems with which this industry has had to contend. We have great appreciation for everyone, including the hon. member for East London City, from Mr. Orpen and his successors who have been serving this industry from as far back as 1926. In recent years we experienced difficulties in this industry which made South Africa suffer a setback. That is why we appreciate the standpoint adopted by the hon. the Prime Minister and his Government, in the person of the hon. the Minister of Agriculture. We particularly appreciate what the hon. the Prime Minister once said, i.e. that under these difficult circumstances, the Government was going to be an ally of the wool farmer in South Africa. We are very grateful because they did in fact do so. We are pleased about the improvement which has come about in this industry recently. We do not want to detain hon. members long, but we want to avail ourselves of the opportunity this afternoon to warn our fellow wool farmers that everything is not right in the industry. We want to warn people not to gain the impression that everything is fine once again as a result of the improvement in the position. We want to avail ourselves of the opportunity to bring just a few of these important facts to their attention.</p>

<p>The first is that they are thankful for the legislation which has been introduced, because we believe we shall now be able to effect these rectifications. The weaknesses in respect of the marketing system of wool, still remain. For that reason, we want to express the hope that the people who will exercise control over the industry in future, will eliminate these weaknesses.</p>

<p>The first one I want to mention is the bad service which the wool producer offers the textile industrialist today. What I mean by that, is that we should remember that the wool industry is an old one. In countries where the textile industry is established and where wool is processed, the factories have become outdated. These industrialists had to proceed to erect modern factories at great expense. The expenditure was tremendously high, and now those people are in a difficult position that they are experiencing difficulty in financing their wool purchases for processing. Finance is not readily obtainable today. It is expensive. Under the most difficult circumstances, these textile industrialists now have to do their own financing at tremendous expense.</p>

<p>The artificial fibre industry is on a completely different basis as far as this matter is concerned. Artificial fibre can be delivered on demand. If a manufacturer wants a certain tonnage of artificial fibre in a fortnight&#x2019;s time, he need only place an order. It is delivered to him at a price determined in advance for 12 months or possibly longer. The artificial fibre manufacturer has no trouble when he has to pay, because it is always available.</p>

<p>Yes, Mr. Speaker, but the point I want to make, is that the position is different as far as wool is concerned. I want to come to the point now. Wool is a seasonal product.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. S. PANSEGROUW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr.</p>

<p>Speaker, then I just want to say to you: If this point has already been made, you have understood what the position is in this regard. That is why I want to propose now that in years to come we should get a scheme under which all wool would be possessed by one single body. Not only should this body possess the wool, but it should also be able to make this wool available to industrialists at all times. This body should be able to attend to the financing of a large proportion, if not of all. This central body should carry the supplies throughout&#x2014;as the hon. member for Graaff-Reinet pointed out&#x2014;at a price of which the industrialist may be informed even up to 12 months in advance.</p>

<p>Something was said here about the auction system. Sir, I do not want to repeat it, except that I want to make only one important point. We should remember that in past years, we had competition at our auctions among countries such as England, France, Germany, Italy, Belgium and others. We should not forget that since then, the European Common Market has come into existence. At the end of this year, England will be entering that market. Then virtually all competition at our auctions would be eliminated. That is why I <span class="col_7957-7958" refersTo="page_0933"/>want to agree with the hon. member for Graaff-Reinet when he said we should retain the system as long as it was practicable.</p>

<p>Sir, I come to the last point. In anticipation I want to apologize to those hon. members sitting here who will differ with me. The first point I want to make is that it has been scientifically established that in order to establish a profitable wool complex for the marketing of wool, at least between half a million and three-quarter million bales of wool should be handled. If we could reach such a position, the handling of that wool-clip could take place in the cheapest way. A position has developed here with us which is causing concern. I come now to the first fact I want to state in this regard. In the case of a ship which transports wool, for example, from Australia to England, the tariff is R4,50 per ton per 1 000 miles. As far as South Africa is concerned, this tariff is R8,50 per ton per 1 000 miles. We want to ask why this is the position. The reason for this is that a ship sailing from England to Australia and back to England, is able to complete the journey in a shorter period than it takes a ship to sail from England to South Africa and back. Why is this so? Because, in the case of South Africa, the ship must call at Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, East London and Durban. The wool-clip of the whole of South Africa is approximately 800 000 bales at present. For that reason I want to say today that for the benefit of the wool industry we should give the utmost consideration to the possibility of exporting our wool through a single harbour in years to come.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Smithfield and the other members who have spoken on this Bill, and I must say the hon. the Minister as well, confined themselves entirely to the wool industry. Much as this Bill deals with the wool industry and as important as that industry is, I want to say a few words about the rest of the Bill. I submit that this Bill is the manifestation of the fact that at last common sense has prevailed in the Government. At last this significant point has got through to the Government and to organized agriculture generally, because I believe that this Bill is a manifestation of the fact that the agricultural industry has at last realized that they have to market their product. Up till now the agricultural industry has produced a product and has placed it on the market and has said to the people: &#x201C;There it is; take it or leave it; buy it on our terms&#x201D;. They have, however, not bothered to market their product at all. In this regard I want to claim at least a share in the parenthood of this legislation. The hon. the Deputy Minister and the Minister himself know for how long I have pleaded for just this type of power to be given to the control boards of our dairy products in this country. It is all very well for the hon. the Minister to shake his head and to laugh, but he knows for how long, particularly with regard to the Dairy Board, I have suggested that they must do exactly what is being done here. Have I not asked him to appoint to the Dairy Board a marketing consultant, an expert in marketing who would conduct the necessary research and find out what the housewife wants? Now, Sir, he is quiet; now he acknowledges the fact that I have done so.</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>I do not expect the board to be the selling agent; of course not. If he wants to be so ridiculous, then he must tell the people of South Africa and all the traders that he wants to do this, because this is not what I am asking for. It is no good the Minister being deliberately obtuse. He is being deliberately obtuse because he is not prepared to give credit where credit is due. That is the only reason why he is being like this, Sir, The whole object of this Bill is to help the marketing boards to go ahead and market their products. We need these powers, Sir, I could deal with a number of the individual powers, but I think they can best be dealt with in the Committee Stage. I do, however, want to put one pertinent question to the hon. the Minister, so that he can give us an answer now or, if he is unable to do so, he can have time to think about this matter before we come to the Committee Stage. I refer to clause 1 (c) which gives us a new definition of &#x201C;plant material&#x201D;. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Plant material&#x201D;, in relation to a product, means the seed, plant or tree from which that product is derived, or any portion of such seed, plant or tree.</block>

<p>In this connection I also wish to refer to the new section 56 (1) (f), which is added by clause 7 (c) of the Bill. In terms of this new paragraph, on such conditions as the Minister may approve, a board may acquire or develop any plant material, or multiply or improve such plant material, or finance out of its funds such development, improvement or multiplication of plant material, which is used in the production of its particular defined product. Why does the hon. the Minister restrict this only to plant material? Why has he not extended this provision to livestock? The Wool Board which we have just heard so much about, surely would have a stake in the development of sheep? The Meat Industry Control Board would also have an interest in the development of sheep, as well as cattle. The Dairy Board would have an interest in the development of cattle, and the Egg Board obviously would have an interest in the development of poultry. So why is it limited only to plant material?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Sir, my time has been limited, but I must say that we do welcome this Bill. We believe that this is a step forward; we are not only bringing the wool industry in this country under the purview of this Act but we are now also giving these powers to other control boards as well, and this is something which we accept.</p>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think the only discordant note in regard to the proposed legislation, was some of the remarks made by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg. He said &#x201C;at last common sense has prevailed&#x201D;. This was an uncalled-for remark which introduced a discordant note in regard to this legislation. This legislation is accepted and praised by the entire wool industry. The sheep farmers and the producers are in fact very grateful to the Government for the legislation because it is this very Government which, with the measures it has introduced in order to render assistance, and again with this legislation, has enabled the producers to meet the heavy demands which have been put to them in recent times. In a nutshell the fundamental idea of the legislation is in fact this: It safeguards the producer against collapse. In other words, it ensures what is necessary, and that is stability and more stability in the wool industry. Secondly, it ensures the creation of a bargaining power in favour of the producer which he hardly had in the past. In this regard we may ask ourselves what the position would have been if the Wool Commission did not have the funds which it in fact had, and if the Wool Commission did not receive the assistance from the Government which it had received in recent times. If this had been otherwise, the entire wool industry would have been completely destroyed, and there would have been total chaos. Sir, this underlines the fact that machinery should be created on a more permanent basis, in terms of which the producer may acquire bargaining powers. This is essential, because of the facts already mentioned here and which I want to repeat briefly, namely the elimination of competition by member countries of the EEC, such as France. England and others; secondly, the progressive competition which is going to exist on a long term with artificial fibres&#x2014;and this is an onslaught, Sir, which is not going to decrease, but which is in fact going to increase&#x2014;and, thirdly, the necessity of arresting the decrease (of 20 per cent) in production in the past season, as compared to the previous season, otherwise it can only be extremely harmful to our wool industry. Sir, in my opinion these requirements of stability and of <span class="col_7961-7962" refersTo="page_0935"/>bargaining power are soundly incorporated in the Bill we have before us. The new Wool Board is being given wider powers which will enable it to eliminate overlapping, and to do everything necessary, i.e. research, advertising, marketing and everything needed in this regard and, in conjunction with that, to undertake strengthening the wool industry further under the protection of the Marketing Act, under the protection of the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing, and eventually under the protection of the Minister as such. Sir, this ensures and strengthens the position of the wool producer as never before. This scheme, as it will be incorporated under the Marketing Act, will mean that purposeful assistance will be rendered, and not on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis; it will bring about the effective regimentation and disciplining of the wool producers, and a decrease in costs&#x2014; things which will all create confidence and stability. Sir, the Bill provides mainly for the creation of a control board which is an amalgamation of the two existing boards, i.e. the Wool Commission and the Wool Board. Furthermore, the functions of the control board are defined, and for the rest the Bill makes provision for the creation of marketing facilities. I do not want to anticipate the effect of this measure, but to me it seems as though the once-channel pool scheme for which the Bill makes provision will give our wool producers more stability and be of greater value to them.</p>

We should like to know what his standpoint and that of his party is. By means of research we are establishing virus-free plant material.

<p>But they are doing it. They have the same powers. We are only giving something more in the case of wool. We are giving them the opportunity of combining certain types of wool in that marketing process and of selling quantities of it, because it is essential to give them that power. Now the hon. member wants to make a big story of this situation. Does the hon. member want the Wheat Board or the Mealie Board to market their own products physically, from the mill to the bread?</p>

<p>If the hon. member for East London City agrees with the principle of the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District, I find no fault with him. But I want to ask whether the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town agrees with that principle, namely that the Wool Board should breed rams and ewes and make them available to farmers and breeders for wool production. Does the hon. member agree with that? That is what the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District asked. That is why I say the hon. member does not realize what he asks. The Marketing Act was introduced in order to disturb the normal operation of trade, manufacturing and marketing as little as possible. But situations do arise when they must be disturbed, and when one disturbs them, one should not put the board completely in charge of the situation; and when there is any need for one to disturb them as little as possible, one does so. Take the case of wool. Even there one disturbs them as little as possible, but if it is essential, one must disturb them in order to put the Wool Board in a position in which private producers do not find themselves, and that is to unite groups. But the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District should first give some thought to the matter before he comes and accuses the Minister here of all sorts of stupidities and incompetence. His own members on the opposite side do not agree with him, and his greatest supporters inside and outside South Africa, i.e. trade and industry, which supports that party to a large extent, would have his head if they knew that he adopted this standpoint.</p>

<heading>DEFENCE AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Committee Stage)</summary>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry that we should have to start a defence measure of this nature with a disagreement, but we are in a situation where the Government and this side of the House are at odds on basic and delicate ground and I immediately want to put the view of this side of the House. We have before us a clause which amends the present Act to make possible the secondment of persons subject to military service in two categories in non-Defence capacities. One group is that of professionally qualified members not required for their musterings who may be sent to do equivalent service in other Government departments. The other is that seconded to the service of the Armaments Board or Corporation or any of its subsidiaries. Here we are making provision for persons to serve outside the Defence Force itself. We know, and the hon. the Minister knows, that there are those who, because of their sincerely held religious beliefs, are opposed to serving in the military services. It seems to us such a simple thing; by removing two words in this provision, namely the words &#x201C;professionally qualified&#x201D;, it would be within the power of the department&#x2014;not mandatory or compulsory, but permissive only&#x2014;to use this provision to attach people as is done now, for instance, in the case of fire stations. National servicemen today are attached to a fire station to do a large portion of their service.</p>

<p>I therefore wish to move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 18, to omit &#x201C;professionally qualified&#x201D;.</block>

<p>This amendment makes it possible for the Defence Force to bring together these two elements, the one being people who hold fundamental beliefs and who do not wish to serve in a military force on account of such religious beliefs, and the other the opportunity of performing service for the Government, the State and the country in a capacity which does not conflict with conscience. I believe that the hon. the Minister and his department could handle this without embarrassment and that they are big enough to handle this without embarrassment. Unfortunately there appears to <span class="col_7965-7966" refersTo="page_0937"/>be a basic difference in approach. The Government appears to be blinded by one sect, that of Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses. This sect is blind in their opposition to anything whatsoever to do with defence, or even as an alternative to defence. This group is dealt with under another clause in this Bill. I want to deal not with the law-breakers, but with law-abiding young men, men who because they co-operate with the law have their beliefs brushed aside almost with contempt. I don&#x2019;t believe that proper study has been made, or that proper consultation has taken place with those who, unlike the Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses, do not refuse to accept the law but who act with hurt feelings and against their inner beliefs. I refer to the Christadelphians and the Quakers, the Society of Friends, and groups such as these who do not break the law and who want to serve, but who hold deeply-ingrained religious beliefs. Those who break the law will be dealt with by the law. I will deal with that later. I do not believe that we should say that we do not recognize inner beliefs held sincerely by people. I believe that people can hold such beliefs, hold them sincerely and not be unpatriotic. I have known others to refuse to serve their country for beliefs that were certainly not deep-grained or religious beliefs. I have no time whatsoever for those who wish to use other issues such as political considerations in an effort to avoid service. I want to make that quite clear. To those organizations which have submitted memoranda, etc., seeking exclusion on grounds other than religious beliefs, we could give no support whatsoever. One day the hon. the Minister will face his Maker and I hope he will not then have to say that in his consideration of the way a man worshipped his God he was as intolerant as he is of political opposition in the field of government. This is a matter of tolerance for deeply held beliefs of people.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I am trying to deal with the clause. I am trying to move an amendment which will meet the needs of people who hold certain beliefs. I have moved an amendment which will achieve that and I am motivating it. I am trying to show how, by doing this small thing, we could make it possible to meet fellow-South Africans who have a difficulty, a difficulty they are not prepared to turn into a conflict with the State. In other words, they accept the law. But it would meet their views and their beliefs if we were to enable them to do service to their country in a field which did not conflict with their consciences. I believe that we are a big enough country and that we have a strong enough army to be able to handle perhaps 200 or 300 people, if that, who would be affected. There are only a small number of these people. But must we ignore them because their number is small? Must we ignore them and say that because they are not causing us any trouble now we must not worry about them? If this were done there would be no cause for any man to attempt to evade his obligations to his country. There would be no excuse for him, because there would be an opportunity for him. In our view it would be an opportunity which should involve a longer and bigger contribution in time and effort than that required from the normal boy. There would be an opportunity for him to give service and yet not to offend against his own conscience. As it is we can only here attack a small group of professionally qualified people for other Government service. We can second them, as I have mentioned is done in regard to firemen, where they are seconded to a fire station. The only difference is that they are seconded as soldiers. If you are going to send 16 men to the Cape Town fire station to serve there and you have 16 men who hold religious convictions, why not send the 16 men who hold those convictions to serve their time in a fire station? There are such people who would prefer to do that sort of service. Why then take men who have no objection to normal military service and send them to do such work instead of people to whom it would mean a great deal? [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am sorry that the hon. member for Durban Point, who also served on the Select Committee on this legislation, is now persevering in this point of view. During the discussions of the Committee the hon. member had the opportunity, together with the other members of this Committee, to argue the matter which he has now pleaded, not only with members of the Committee, but also with officers of the Defence Force who were present.</p>

<p>No, he was not silent. He argued, and I want to concede that. But I am really surprised that the hon. member comes along with this proposal again this afternoon. He still does not understand what it is all about. He now wants to open the door so wide as to allow people other than the group of professionally qualified people who join the Defence Force under the national service system every year and whom the Defence Force itself cannot accommodate in a professional capacity, and who are then attached to other State institutions, to be dealt with in this way as well. He referred to people who have religious scruples, as he says, and who, as other people say, also have moral objections to doing military service. The hon. member for Durban Point knows, after all, that provision has already been made in the national service system for people who have religious and moral objections, for them to be occupied in a non-combatant capacity, for example. The hon. member knows this, after all. But now the hon. member argues and says that he is not in fact talking about the isolated group of Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses, who are a category on their own. But the hon. member should accept now, after all, that even if this door which he wants to open were to be opened &#x2026; I hope the hon. member will listen to me now. That hon. member is &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>I hope the hon. member will understand that even if such a door were to be opened to categories other than the professionally trained and qualified people, they would also have to undergo some basic training before being placed in a non-combatant capacity. I hope the hon. member understands this. If such a person does in fact have to parade in a uniform for a few weeks, and do other things as well, I cannot see that his religious or moral objections will allow him to do this as long as he can go where he wants to after a few weeks and not where the Defence Force needs him and wants to send him. I think the hon. member should get this matter clear in his own mind. He should return to the basic concept that what national service involves is that the Defence Force commands the services and life of every young man in this country for a certain period of time. If we were to open the doors and allow everyone to go where he wants to, we would have chaos, after all. The hon. member said that it would affect approximately two to three hundred people at most, not including the Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses. But we must be guided, after all, by the knowledge and experience of Defence Forces in other Western countries as well. There is no secret about what happened in some cases where attempts were made to do what the hon. member now wants to do, namely that the small number of 200 to 300 eventually increased to several thousands. The hon. member must realize that the system with which we are dealing here is based on the utilization and the consolidation of all our young men for the Defence Force under the system of national service. When doors are opened in the way in which the hon. member now wants to open them, one must expect chaos and undermining of the discipline which there must be. I believe that all groups who really have religious objections to military service are satisfactorily accommodated by the Defence Force today. Consequently I can see no reason to accept this amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bronkhorst">

<from>*Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I just want to say a few words about what was said by the hon. member for Stellenbosch. The hon. member alleged that the hon. member for Durban Point does not know what it is all about. I want to assure him that I do in fact know what it is about. He also alleged that a door was being opened here which would create difficulties for the department in regard to this matter. No door will be opened by the omission of these two words. If this clause were to be passed as it reads at the moment, it would not even open the door to the professionally qualified people, because the department would still have the right to have those professionally qualified <span class="col_7969-7970" refersTo="page_0939"/>people trained in whichever unit it deems fit. It does not leave those people a choice. If these words were to be omitted, it would not leave the national serviceman any choice either; to my mind it would only make it easier for the department to allow the people to undergo their training in the most suitable place.</p>

<p>It continues to be the aim of the Department of Defence to train every national serviceman in that arm of the Defence Force where his services can be put to the best use, in that arm where his qualifications can be put to the best use. This clause now makes it possible for the Defence Force to attach qualified people either to other departments or to the armaments organization. We give this principle our full support. We do not agree that people would have a choice if these words were to be omitted. The choice continues to rest with the department. I do not want to go into the aspect of the people who have religious objections, because there is another clause which deals with this. When we come to that we can talk about this matter. It seems to me as if the legal experts who drafted this clause are conjuring up spectres unnecessarily as far as this matter of admission is concerned. I believe in spectres, but I really cannot see any spectre in this. I can only see that it is going to be easier for the department to place the persons where it wants to. For this reason I support the amendment of the hon. member for Durban Point.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I regret that I am unable to accept the amendment of the hon. member for Durban Point. This matter was before the Select Committee and the Select Committee had every opportunity to deliberate on it. The Select Committee also had the opportunity to interview people in connection with these matters and according to its report it received certain memoranda, and all these memoranda were considered. In this connection I want to be guided by what was decided by the Committee. This is my first reply. The second reply to the hon. member is that facilities already exist for people with conscientious and religious objections. See how reasonable we are. In the first place a man can go and work in a hospital. The hon. member is so concerned about my conscience when I face my Maker. Let me tell him that he need not be concerned about me when I face my Maker. I think each of us should feel concerned about the way we will face our Maker one day. Now leave this out of the political conflict. Each of us will just have to account for this for himself. In the first place such a person can go and serve in a hospital, where he can go and help to relieve human suffering.</p>

<p>Military hospitals.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but one finds human suffering there as well. There are not only soldiers there, but soldiers&#x2019; dependants as well. He can help to relieve human suffering there as well. He can also be trained in fire-fighting. If he gives the slightest indication of wanting to be trained in fire-fighting, we shall do it for him under the system of civil defence services which already exists. There he can serve the cause of civil defence. This is in fact possible in terms of the provisions of the existing Defence Act. If a boy tells us that he has conscientious objections to doing something else and that he wants to be trained in fire-fighting, he can do so. This possibility already exists. In the third place I want to say that where we had difficulties initially with some of these organizations and denominations to which the hon. member referred, the position at the moment is that the best understanding exists between the Administration of the South African Defence Force and these particular organizations. For quite some time now we have not had a single conscientious objector from one of these organizations, except from a certain type of organization, and that is the Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses. We do not have trouble with the other people any more.</p>

<p>But of course, Sir! They sent in requests, and the Select Committee had the opportunity to consider them, after all. In his report the Select Committee says that we should keep to the stipulations of the department. There are no objectors to military service because of conscientious or religious objections. There are objectors who are Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses. Sir, I am sorry, but I am not giving in to the Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses. I have made concessions to them. We shall come to that later on. I have personally made concessions to them.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Stellenbosch rightly pointed out here to the hon. members for Durban Point and North Rand that if you were to open this door and place the burden on the department, it would not be the right thing to do to your department, after all. Why should this Parliament want to burden the department with the decision in connection with these matters? Why do we not accept the responsibility? No, Sir, we are the lawgivers. Let us take the responsibility. It is a matter of principle. Why should we now want to pass the responsibility on to a department? To what pressure are we going to subject this department? To the same pressure as that to which Defence Forces in Europe have been subjected. Where they originally provided for 10 000 vacancies in other departments of the State and with companies, these have now increased to 25 000.</p>

<p>In one particular country they are at their wit&#x2019;s end. I have told hon. members over and over again that I have not only studied this matter from documents which are available, but also discussed it with people. I am now telling hon. members: The plan which they are suggesting here is not a solution. It has been tried by other countries and it is not a solution. Why must we now create the impression that I am hard-hearted?</p>

<p>Surely, Sir, this is not so. We have introduced a system of national service; it is not only military service; it is more than military service. National service, as we are implementing it in this country today, with all the activities related to it, is much more than just military service. But apart from that, even if it were only military service, we have made it compulsory for young people to serve. Now hon. members want me to open a door by which I should strike at the root of the tree and create an opportunity for the undermining of the principle of national service. I know the hon. member for North Rand agrees with me in his heart. I think he agrees with me, for he is a military man himself, and I am talking the language of the Defence Force here. I am not talking my language; I am talking the language of the Defence Force; I am talking the language of people who are doing their service today, voluntarily or because they are forced to do so, or as professional soldiers, and who want no concessions on this point. I know what I am talking about. The hon. member knows this. He knows that he agrees with me.</p>

<p>Yes, but in a non-combatant capacity. He can do it as a clerk in the administration; he can do it as a medical orderly; he can do it as a person who is being trained to perform fire-fighting services. There are various services they can perform. We do not have trouble with these people. There is no trouble between the Defence Force and conscientious objectors. Let me say this with the greatest decisiveness today. What is more, there is the best relationship between conscientious objectors and the Defence Force, with one exception, and that is the Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses.</p>

<p>In respect of the Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses hon. members must not take it amiss of me. but they are not a sect. They are not a denomination. They are just a lot of opstreperous people. They are not only opstreperous in respect of military service; they make a nuisance of themselves in every field. I am telling you now: We must not give them half a chance in South Africa. There are countries which have prohibited them; there are countries which are seriously considering prohibiting them. There are countries which are at their wit&#x2019;s end with these people. I say they are not an ordinary denomination and they are not a sect. They are not a church association either. They are a lot of individual people, and everyone is his own minister. Everyone interprets the Bible in his own way and interprets his conscience in his own way. I have absolutely no time for these people, for I say they are the disciples of disorder. With the obligations imposed upon me by the Defence Act I can not <span class="col_7973-7974" refersTo="page_0941"/>yield here. Hon. members may accuse me of being hard-hearted, or whatever they like, but as long as I occupy this post I will not yield on this point. With the other people we have the most pleasant relations and understanding.</p>

<p>I just want to say this: I meet people from time to time who come and plead with me to take up the attitude which the hon. member over there is now taking up. I do not want to mention names now, but only this week I spoke to important people of this kind. I asked them this question: &#x201C;Are you here in my office on behalf of the Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses?&#x201D; They said: &#x201C;No.&#x201D; Then I asked: &#x201C;But on whose behalf are you coming to speak, for there are no other cases?&#x201D; They still have not answered me on that. Now I am asking the hon. member today: If he is not taking the part of the Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses&#x2014;and I know he is not&#x2014;on whose behalf is he speaking?</p>

<p>*He said they were not having difficulty with these people. But what is difficulty, Sir?

<block name="quote">If the Department of Defence has jurisdiction over all the younger male citizens of a country, there is no opportunity for those who feel urged by their deepest convictions to serve their country in what appears to them more valid ways.

<p>It is very clear that they are organizations with written membership, with leaders, which are responsible bodies. They involve just a handful of people. But it goes much further. It concerns people who are not professionally qualified, but who can nevertheless be important to the Government or the Defence Force because of their specialized knowledge. They wil also fall under this. However, this is not a point on which I want to elaborate now. I have a letter here dated 18th May. It is a letter from the Western Province Council of Churches, a wide organization. This request was made <span class="col_7975-7976" refersTo="page_0942"/>six days ago, after the proceedings of the Select Committee had been concluded.

<p>I shall not go into greater detail. They are only asking for alternative ways in which they can do their service. Then one has the Christadelphians, which is also a very serious group. I do not believe that there has ever been an instance of subversion, of communism or of anti-South Africanism of any kind among this group. My point is that there are in fact people who feel this way. I should like to ask the hon. member for Stellenbosch, who was the chairman of this Select Committee, whether he has read any of these memoranda.</p>

<p>I accept that, Sir, I am sorry if I misunderstood the hon. member, but it is clear then. The Minister must accept then that there are people who are unhappy. All we are seeking is a solution which would not harm the Defence Force or the country, but which might contribute something in respect of a handful of people, in the interests of a better society. We obviously differ about this, however, and I do not believe that we shall get much further by continuing to debate the matter.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I feel it is my duty just to set the hon. member right. I did not say in my speech that there are no people who are not satisfied. What I did say was that sufficient provision was being made, to the satisfaction of everyone who has objections, to serve in the Defence Force in a non-combatant capacity. That is what I said, and the hon. member knows that. I want to ask for the hon. member&#x2019;s co-operation. The problem, it seems to me, is that there are certain quarters outside this House which do not grasp the situation. Now the hon. member for Durban Point reads out to us their memoranda and their views, based on ignorance, instead of going to those people and explaining what the actual position is. If he were to do that there would be satisfaction and there would be no reason for debates such as the one we are now conducting here.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when I spoke a short while ago, I said that I was looking at this clause and that I was forgetting all about people who have conscientious or religious objections as far as military service is concerned. I am looking at the clause exclusively from that point of view. Now the Minister says that I want to place the onus on his department to give these people a chance to get in. Sir, I am simply talking about the people who are outside that group. I am talking about the ordinary national serviceman who has to be trained. The Minister says that by omitting those words you are throwing open the door. I cannot agree with him, because if the clause remains as it is, it does not open the door to the professionally qualified people. The professionally qualified people still cannot tell the Minister and his department that they want to go here and there. The hon. the Minister agrees with me. What will the position be if these words are omitted? I repeat that I am not dealing with these people with conscientious objections at all; I am just thinking of the national serviceman who has to do national service. I am thinking, for example, of a man who received exemption from national service for four or five years. He wanted to become an electrical engineer, or whatever, but he fails in his final examination and he then comes forward to do his national service. Surely the department can put the services of that man to very good use in its armaments organization and if these words were to be omitted, it would give the department the power to use that man&#x2019;s services there. If these words were to remain, however, the department would not be able to do this. I think this legislation would be better without these words. I am not placing the onus on the Defence Force; I just want to give the Defence Force the <span class="col_7977-7978" refersTo="page_0943"/>opportunity to put the services of national servicemen to better use.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#morrison">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. DE V. MORRISON</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for North Rand has argued here that if these words were written into the Act, it would give the Defence Force the power to attach national servicemen to the categories to which they should be attached. But, Sir, the Defence Force has that power. It is not necessary to write it into the Act. If we were to write those words into the Act, we would be acknowledging the principle that people with conscientious objections may do their national service outside a Defence Force context. Sir, to this side of the House it is a principle that national service should be performed within a military context, not necessarily in a combatant capacity, but certainly within a military context. I think it is time that we cleared up this whole matter. As far as I am concerned, and I think also as far as the majority of hon. members on this side are concerned, this question of national service outside a military context, as it is being advocated here, is a smoke-screen. To me there is no difference whatsoever between a man who performs hospital service in the military hospital at Voortrekkerhoogte and a man who performs hospital service in the H. F. Verwoerd hospital in Pretoria; there just is no difference whatsoever. But, Sir, there is a further principle which applies here. The Defence Force is not the body which wages war; it is the State which wages war. In other words, these people are hiding behind a smoke-screen by wanting to allege that war is waged by an arm of the State, by the Defence Force, and this is not so. When war is declared&#x2014;and the hon. the Prime Minister said here earlier this afternoon that we are in fact in a state of war &#x2014;it is not declared by the Defence Force; it is declared by the State of South Africa. If the argument of hon. members on that side in this connection were to be accepted, they could argue that national servicemen can also refuse to serve in any State department which has anything to do with the struggle in which we are engaged, and we refuse to acknowledge that principle because that principle has no foundation. The principle which this side of the House upholds is that it is the duty of every citizen of this country to do his share in defending this country, no matter in what capacity. When for religious reasons a man has conscientious objections to doing military service, he is placed by the Defence Force in a category where he can perform that service in a non-combatant capacity. We need not give the Defence Force that authorization in legislation; it is an administrative arrangement. We refuse to accept that a man can do national service outside a Defence Force context. The Opposition must realize that this is the basic point of view of this side of the House and that it is no use arguing about it.</p>

<p>The hon. member did say that they were satisfied. All they want to do is to get away from military discipline and military control. Sir, that is exactly what they are trying to do. They have said that the alternative service to the country should not be under military control. I am not quoting now from any document which was before the Select Committee, Sir, I am quoting from other documents that I have received. The principle has now been accepted that national service need not necessarily be under military control. That principle has been accepted because of this amendment that stands on the Order Paper today, and all that we on this side of the House are asking is that that should be extended beyond the limited number of servicemen to whom it will apply, and that is those who are professionally qualified. We are asking that that principle&#x2014;we all accept the principle that they must do some form of national service&#x2014;should be extended to those who are genuine conscientious objectors. Sir, the hon. the Minister says that he has a problem in deciding who is genuine and who is not. I accept that. He has mentioned certain people who, we all agree, cannot be accepted as genuine objectors. But I want to put it this way to the hon. the Minister. He says that we must not place the responsibility on his department to decide. But surely if a young man comes forward with a certificate from an accredited minister of an accepted religion or an accepted society&#x2014;and I refer particularly to the Quakers and to the Christadelphians, the two groups mentioned by the hon. the Minister &#x2026;</p>

<p>Clause, as amended, put and agreed to. Clause 2:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>It would be out of order for us to move the amendment we would otherwise have moved in connection with clause 2. This clause now, after alteration by the Select Committee, doubles the time of special service from two months to four months, liable by any national serviceman. When we debated this in the Select Committee, we discussed it on the basis of his being service in lieu, virtually, of an emergency; in other words, instead of declaring an emergency or declaring martial law, the Minister would have the power to call up national servicemen for an additional four months. He has had that power to call them up for two months before, but in all the five years it has been there, he has not used that power once. Now, without having used the two-month period, he wants to use four months. Now we accept that there can be circumstances in which that would be necessary. We accept that two months is a short period where long distances have to be travelled. Therefore, we do not object to that principle, but we would have liked to limit this to special circumstances in which the security of South Africa is involved. As it reads now it need be only in the interests of the South African Defence Force, and on that basis men may be called up for four months&#x2019; additional service. Now &#x201C;in the interests of the South African Defence Force&#x201D; could be simply to train men better, to have a smarter Force. It could be in the interests of the South African Defence Force to call them up to build a camp or to perform some similar task. In other words the interests of the Defence Force are not necessarily the interests of security in the broader sense of the interests of the security of the country. We would have liked to see, instead of those words as they are in the existing Act, the words &#x201C;where circumstances exist affecting the security of South Africa&#x201D;. That would not be permissible as an amendment in this Committee Stage, but I ask the hon. the Minister whether he will instead give this House an assurance that that is in fact the intention behind doubling this period of service. In other words, I want it to be made clear that it is his intention only to use these four months for that purpose and not for normal training purposes. Of course, it would satisfy everyone if he in the Other Place by way of an instruction <span class="col_7983-7984" refersTo="page_0946"/>were to clarify it in the law itself. This is a matter which can affect voluntary officers in the Citizen Force. If word gets around that they are going to be expected to do their normal period of service as laid down in the existing law spread over ten years, plus four months&#x2019; continuous training, you can have a reaction against volunteering. People will always have hanging over their heads the knowledge that they may have to do an extra four months. It would clarify the position and it would help if the hon. the Minister would give that undertaking. But it would put matters beyond all doubt if he would amend the clause to make clear what is apparently the intention of the department. I will take it no further until the hon. the Minister has indicated what his attitude is to my request for an assurance or an amendment which will put this fact beyond all question, so that those who may be considering volunteering as Citizen Force officers or N.C.O.s will know exactly where they stand.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, during the Second Reading I said very expressly&#x2014;and this is on record &#x2014;what the object is as far as this is concerned. In the second place, I must say that I myself am aware that there is some doubt among some of the commanders, particularly those who are serving on a voluntary basis, as to whether this is in the interests of the Defence Force, particularly in the case of those who make great sacrifices to carry out their services. Prior to the insertion of this provision, I personally had an investigation carried out by one of our most senior officers. I want to give the assurance that there is no question of this being used in an injudicious manner. This is proved by what has happened in the past, and I shall not do so in any case, unless it is absolutely essential. But I have explained why one does not always want to declare a state of emergency. The hon. member may accept my assurance that we shall deal with this in a judicious manner. We shall only deal with matters along these lines when it is absolutely in the interests of the country. I consulted the law advisers briefly in regard to this matter. They say that the amendment the hon. member wanted to move, but cannot move now, will really make no difference to this provision. If one wanted to call up people for four months instead of two months&#x2014;this is already a principle in the existing Act&#x2014;and perhaps wanted to train them for a week to get back into shape as a unit one could, in any case, to do so in terms of the wording of the hon. member&#x2019;s proposed motion. After all, the importance of the South African Defence Force is that it has a task to perform. And what is that task? Its task is to defend the country under given circumstances. After all, one is not going to call up the Defence Force for any other purpose. When all is said and done, I am not going to call them up for the pleasure of stationing them in Beaufort West for four months so that they may carry out exercises there. This we will not do. The reason has definitely been explained to the hon. member in the course of the debate, and I have also explained it personally. I took him into my confidence and told him under what circumstances we would like to do so. The hon. member must accept that. Nobody would be that mad, and neither do I think the Supreme Command would be so silly-&#x2014;even if they did have a foolish Minister&#x2014;as to fall for these people being called up for the pleasure of carrying out exercises in one of the small Karoo towns, while quite a different object should actually be served here. That is the only assurance I can give. The good system of order in the Defence Force would prevent one from abusing this in any other manner.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am grateful to the hon. the Minister for his assurance. I realize that the Government is not going to use this power lightly and is not likely to call up men without good cause. The thing that worried me was the point which was made by the Minister, namely the reaction amongst those units of the Force with which I have had the opportunity to speak, particularly the senior officers who were concerned about the effect on recruitment and on their own volunteers. But we must accept, and we do accept, the statement of the Minister, which he has made loudly and clearly, namely that this will not be for normal national service. If the circumstances are such that it is necessary, in the interests of our security, to call up these forces, they will be called up, but they will not be called up simply to create an additional four months of national service during their 10-year period. In other words, it will not be regarded as a mere additional period of service, but only in extreme circumstances where it is necessary. In those <span class="col_7985-7986" refersTo="page_0947"/>circumstances we accept the clause as it stands.</p>

<p>Clause put and agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 10:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we welcome the change made in this clause, which deals with the punishment of those persons who refuse to report for or to perform national service. The abandonment of the present system of continuous retrial and repunishment is a step in the right direction, and we will, of course, support this clause. It will be noted by the Committee that the Select Committee has now put beyond all question the issue of whether this is a once and for all time punishment. It is now quite clear that a person who refuses to report for service or to perform service will be sentenced to his 12 or 15 months and cannot again be tried for the same offence. What we welcome even more is the information given to us regarding the application of this clause. I would like to have seen it inserted in the clause, but I accept that there are practical difficulties. I would therefore like to ask the hon. the Minister to place on record the intention in so far as the application of the punishment under clause 10 is concerned, namely the intention to create a special camp where those who are convicted under this clause can be isolated from others on whom they are having an unfortunate and undesirable effect, and where they can be given constructive work to do such as road-building, gardening, growing vegetables, or whatever it may be. This work will make them do something instead of sitting around just kicking their heels and will be work which will cause them to exert themselves. There they will perhaps be able to make some sort of contribution towards the country instead of doing their national service. The suggestion was also made, and I would like to hear the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s views on this, that in such a camp these men would be given the opportunity to wear either civilian prison clothing or their own clothing so that they would have no excuse whatsoever to evade the physical work which would be done in that camp on the pretext of this, that or the other reason, saying that they are not going to do it because they won&#x2019;t wear an overall, etc. They can have the two things they claim, viz. the right to wear their own clothing and they can be isolated from defence and do some constructive work. That will be far better than having them sitting around in solitary detention. This is a matter which I do not want to take further in this debate if I can avoid it, but I believe that solitary detention does no good to either the morale of other people in detention or the image of the Defence Force as such. I hope the hon. the Minister can clarify that position so that this clause will make it clear to the country that here we are doing something positive and constructive to eliminate what is a festering sore at the present moment.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is my privilege to thank the hon. member for Durban Point for the positive approach he has again displayed. Earlier this afternoon I appealed to him to help us eliminate the ignorance which may exist as far as outside bodies are concerned. This the hon. member has now done. The day before yesterday the local afternoon newspaper appeared with a lengthy report under the heading: &#x201C;New appeal on conscientious objectors&#x201D;. The report reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A new call on the Government to create avenues of peaceful and constructive work for conscientious objectors to military service has been made by the South African Council of Churches supported by youth and church organizations.</block>

<p>Those very same people the hon. member quoted earlier this afternoon in this House seem to think no provision is being made for those people. For that reason I am glad the hon. member has taken such positive action to indicate to those people that the Defence Force is making provision to give this small group of extremists, viz. the Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses, an opportunity for positive and constructive work.</p>

<p>While speaking about them I cannot but refer to the attitude that prevails in this relevant group, irrespective of their attitude towards national service. I have here a letter written to a school principal by a supporter of that sect. He states in this letter&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses take a completely neutral stand with regard to nationalistic activities. They must not be made to take part in any nationalistic or militaristic activities. This would include the singing <span class="col_7987-7988" refersTo="page_0948"/>of the National Anthem, saluting the flag, Republic festivities, etc.</block>

<p>This is the attitude of this small group of extremists who are treated so accommodatingly by the Defence Force in that the Defence Force is taking these positive steps referred to by the hon. member for Durban Point.</p>

<p>While I am addressing this Committee I should also like, for the record, to straighten out another matter that is mentioned in this very same report in the <i>Argus</i> of the day before yesterday, to which I referred. The report deals with representations made by the South African Council of Churches and reads, <i>inter alia,</i> as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United Party has asked for the Bill to be changed so that conscientious objectors could not be sentenced more than once for refusing military training.</block>

<p>The hon. member rightly said that the Select Committee not only approved this unanimously, but also inserted the proviso in which it is explained that a person who has served a sentence of 12 months may not again be punished for the same contravention. I nevertheless want to put the record straight by saying that this concept in this provision was already contained in the Bill as agreed to at the Second Reading, and that this is not an idea that was suddenly discovered by the United Party.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to say how much I welcome this clause, because it is certainly an enormous improvement on the situation which has obtained until now whereby people could be sentenced over and over again for refusing to don a uniform or to render military service. I want particularly to say that I am very glad that it has been made retrospective. I do not think that this has been mentioned up to now. As I read the proviso, anyone who has already served not less than 12 months&#x2019; detention for contravention of this provision, may also not be charged again with such contravention. I think that that will come as an enormous relief to people who are genuine in their beliefs, whatever one feels about their religious &#x201C;extremes&#x201D;. I, after all, am not holding out any brief for such religious extremes. Far be it from me, though. I do believe that these people are genuine in their beliefs. [Interjections.] Well, I do happen to believe this. I also believe that their complaints were genuine, but I do not want to raise that again for fear of arousing the hon. the Minister to such an extent that he might change his mind about this clause. I know that there are people who have served sentences over and over again. I know of some who have served two, three and four sentences of six months. I am glad that this will be taken into consideration and that they cannot be charged again. There is a further question I should like to ask the Minister. If this one year is the minimum period, I am interested in those people who are at present serving a sentence of six months&#x2019; detention for refusing to render military service. I want to ask the Minister whether that will be taken into consideration as part of the 12 months&#x2019; sentence, and will they then have to serve just an additional six months if they are again to be charged? I would like to get that cleared up. For the rest, as I say, I very much welcome this clause, and I also welcome the statements which have been made by the hon. member for Durban Point and the hon. member for Stellenbosch that certain arrangements are going to be made. I am quite sure that this is necessary and that it will not only be better for the people concerned, but also for the South African Army.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, whether there are going to be any better relations between the authorities in charge of the detention barracks and this small group of Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses, will depend entirely on the Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses. I say this because there is no intention on the part of the Defence Force to prosecute or try to humiliate people unnecessarily. We have gone out of our way to make these people happy; we have even tried to make them as happy as possible under those circumstances. These people simply do not want to co-operate. They do not want to co-operate under any circumstances, and they devise plans to avoid co-operating. How people with such sacred religious convictions could be so wilful, I have yet to learn. I think they simply do not want to accept any responsibilities in life. I think they are a positive danger to any decent, civilized community. They are not only a curse to the work of the military authorities, but wherever else they come up against authority, they undermine such authority and rebel against it. How can people seek to promote their own progress <span class="col_7989-7990" refersTo="page_0949"/>and realize their own selfish interests when they are not prepared to accept the obligations of a community? For that reason I have to reject them. There is no reason why I should want to prosecute these people. Why should I want to do that? We have much more work to do in the Defence Force than to let such impossible people occupy our time. We are wasting the time of those officers, and we can employ them far more usefully. I hope hon. members will associate themselves with my standpoint and that a very strong voice will be raised in this House so that these people will understand that nobody in this Parliament holds a brief for them. It must be said for once that this Parliament has no time for these people. I hope I have the support of the hon. member for Durban Point on this point, viz. that as far as we are concerned, the Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses should know that they must expect no sympathy from this Parliament.</p>

<p>Then I am grateful for it. As far as the treatment is concerned, I may say that we shall treat them in a humane manner. The regulations have been drawn up in such a way that anyone who wishes to subject himself to authority and discipline, will be treated in an humane manner. If he does not want to carry out the regulations, he has to be dealt with. That is all. For that reason I said, even before the Select Committee were in session, that we would consider isolating them; I think we have to isolate them, but I do not think we should isolate them where they can do some gardening because they would not want to do any gardening. I think we should isolate them where they will become very bored and where they will have plenty of time to give thought to their whims. I plan to have them detained in healthy surroundings where there is fresh air and every possible facility for such detention barracks without their being tortured or treated in an unchristian manner. I must add that Christianity does not pursue a policy of spinelessness. Christianity is a faith based on principles. In this southern country of Africa we find ourselves to a large extent engaged in struggles of Christianity. This we must not forget. Sometimes the forces of hell descend upon us. For that reason we are not going to be spineless as far as these people are concerned.</p>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Hon. members will remember that in introducing the legislation for the establishment of the Armaments Development and Production Corporation, I referred specifically to the function which Armscor, together with its envisaged affiliated companies, would perform as an instrument of the Armaments Board in the process of achieving self-sufficiency and as regards South Africa&#x2019;s armament requirements. On the same occasion I also indicated that Armscor would be committed to entering mainly those spheres of production which were either too uneconomic or of a too strategic nature to be left to private industry. I emphasize this, since I think it is very important for hon. members to understand that Armscor is committed to entering mainly those spheres of production which are either too uneconomic or of a too strategic nature to be left to private industry. In other words, Armscor does not seek to concern itself with the whole sphere of the production of armament requirements. Hon. members will also remember that on 26th April of this year, while my Vote was being dealt with, I said that South Africa could justly be proud of what had been achieved in the endeavour to ensure the highest degree of efficiency for the Defence Force. Hon. members on both sides of the House were afforded the opportunity by invitation last year of seeing what had been accomplished by Armscor and its subsidiary companies in the national interest. Consequently I believe that it may justly be stated that the establishment of Armscor was undoubtedly a step in the right direction. Through the introduction of this system, South Africa has taken the lead&#x2014;a fact which is also proved by the interest shown by countries abroad in the set-up, constitution, operation and liaison of the Armaments Board and Armscor and its subsidiaries, because one has in this set-up largely retained the system which is peculiar to private enterprise, in the sense that one included business people in these directorates and yet did not resort to nationalization; in other words, a system between nationalization and private enterprise.</p>

<p>Accordingly I want to take this opportunity to extend to those businessmen and executives who are prepared to serve on the directorates of Armscor and its subsidiaries, my thanks for their special contribution to the establishment and economic operation of a series of extremely strategic installations.</p>

<p>Of course, it was up to Armscor to ensure continually that it would achieve its objects more effectively. It has therefore in this process also become desirable to effect certain amendments to its legislation so that it will be able to carry out its functions more effectively. Although there was clarity on the objects and tasks of Armscor at the time of its inception, it was nevertheless fallow land that had to be entered upon and pioneer work that had to be performed. Experience has brought with it more insight as to the way in which and the techniques through which Armscor may serve its purpose even more effectively.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The proposed amendments to the Armaments Development and Production <span class="col_7993-7994" refersTo="page_0951"/>Act, No. 57 of 1968, can be divided mainly into two categories, firstly those amendments calculated to enable Armscor to carry out its activities more effectively, and, secondly, those amendments intended to provide for a system of settlement of industrial disputes and the imposition of a total prohibition on strikes. As far as the first category is concerned, that is to say the more effective carrying out of its activities, I refer hon. members to my Second Reading debate speech of 8th May, 1968. On that occasion I informed hon. members that it was not the intention that Armscor should undertake the development and production of armaments under its own name, but that these activities should take place through subsidiary companies or through companies in which Armscor has an interest in the form of share-holding and/or financial aid. In the execution of this principle Armscor thus performs a controlling, financing and service function, while the practical manufacturing activities are undertaken by its subsidiary companies. To implement this principle more successfully in practice certain amendments which I will explain in due course are essential.</p>

<p>The second category embraces the exclusion of the provisions of the Industrial Conciliation Act regarding employees of Armscor and its subsidiary companies because it is not considered wise that activities and installations of highly strategic order should be exposed to strikes of any nature or extent whatsoever. It must be ensured at all times that the country&#x2019;s preparedness will not be prejudiced in these industries.</p>

<p>At this stage, however, I want to stress most emphatically that the employees of Armscor and its subsidiaries will not be deprived of their basic rights through this action. In this Bill their rights are thoroughly taken into account and provision is made for a system whereby disputes can effectively be solved and settled. This amendment indeed embraces the continuation of an old principle that the Industrial Conciliation Act is not applicable to officers in the services of the State. Until their take-over by the Armaments Board in 1964, two State installations known as the Defence Ordnance Workshop and the Ammunition Section of the South African Mint were under the direct control of the State and consequently the Industrial Conciliation Act did not apply to employees of these installations which have in the meantime become subsidiaries of Armscor. Without practical circumstances having changed in any manner, statutory enactments therefore entailed that the Industrial Conciliation Act became applicable to employees of Armscor and its subsidiaries.</p>

<p>May I in this connection refer to the case of the South African Railways which created a somewhat comparable statutory provision for a total prohibition on strikes as well as rules for the settlement of disputes between the Railway Administration and its employees. As far as I know, the South African Railways succeeded in creating an instrument whereby it could approach its personnel matters on a reasonable and effective basis.</p>

<p>I want to assure the House that all possible solutions were discussed with different bodies and that the proposed system for the handling and settlement of disputes ensures a practical and appropriate system whereby the interest of the country, as well as the interest of the employee, can be served.</p>

<p>*I am now going to proceed to explaining in greater detail the various clauses of this Bill. In connection with clause 1 I just want to say that this clause contains a number of new definitions which are being added to the principal Act. Now I come to clause 1 (c). In order to enable the corporation and its subsidiaries to perform their functions more effectively, it has become essential to provide that certain statutory privileges shall also be conferred upon subsidiaries, such as the indemnity against liability where damage is cause for the protection of property and the exemption from the payment of duties or fees. However, the intention is that these amendments will only have a bearing on companies in which Armscor has full control. As hon. members will see, the definition of &#x201C;subsidiary&#x201D; is very clear.</p>

<p>The insertion of the definition &#x201C;strike&#x201D;, also in clause 1 (c), is bound up with the provisions of section 8G, which is being inserted in the principal Act by clause 10 of the Bill. The insertion of the definition &#x201C;prescribe&#x201D; in clause 1 (b), is bound up with the provisions of clause 11 of the Bill. In the Bill specific powers are conferred upon the corporation in respect of employees. Through the insertion of the proposed definitions of &#x201C;employer&#x201D; and &#x201C;employee&#x201D; it is ensured that such powers will also apply in respect of employees of subsidiary <span class="col_7995-7996" refersTo="page_0952"/>companies and, in specific cases, in respect of employees of the Armaments Board.</p>

<p>The insertion of the definition of &#x201C;employees&#x2019; association&#x201D; is bound up with section 8A, which is being inserted in the principal Act by clause 10 of the Bill.</p>

<p>Now I want to say a few words about the proposed section 3 of the principal Act. In the main the general purport of the envisaged amendment to section 3 of the principal Act amounts to the following&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) the existing section 3 is being divided into two separate subsections, and the objects and powers of Armscor are dealt with separately in these subsections;</li>

<li>(b) the existing powers of Armscor are being amended and additional powers are being conferred.</li>

</ol>

<p><i><b>Proposed new subsection</b></i> 3 (1):</p>

<p>The only amendment is the addition of the words &#x201C;or pyrotechnical products&#x201D;. The supply of such products is a logical side-activity of Armscor, which, in industry, is connected with its main activities in this particular case. The reference made here, is to Swartklip Products (Pty.) Limited (previously Ronden).</p>

<p><i><b>Proposed new subsection</b></i> 3 (2):</p>

<p>In the existing section 3 one finds this sentence: &#x201C;&#x2026; to that end the corporation shall, in addition to any other powers vested in it by this Act, have power&#x2014;&#x201D;. That particular sentence is merely being formulated more effectively; actually, no principle is at stake here.</p>

<p><i><b>Proposed new subparagraphs</b></i> 3 (2) <i><b>(a),</b></i> (<i>b</i>) <i><b>and</b></i> (<i>c</i>):</p>

<p>As far as the proposed new subparagraphs 3 (2) (a), (b) and (c) are concerned, the existing subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) of section 3 are being amended by substituting the word &#x201C;to&#x201D; for the word &#x201C;by&#x201D;, with which each of them starts. I have been informed that this amendment is necessary because it was found in the past that the present wording of section 3 of the principal Act lent a restrictive meaning to the powers of Armscor and could cause certain administrative problems. I am a trusting person and must therefore accept it if the jurist says so. Although it has been the intention ever since the establishment of Armscor that Armscor and its subsidiaries should take over the land on which the former undertakings of the Armaments Board are situated, it has been decided on the recommendation of Armscor&#x2019;s law advisers that these powers should be conferred with greater clarity in subparagraph 3 (2) (c) before actual transfer can take place.</p>

<p><i><b>Proposed new subparagraph</b></i> 3 (2) <i><b>(d)</b></i>:</p>

<p>In terms of the proposed new amendment Armscor shall have the power to establish, with the approval of the Minister, in terms of subparagraph 3 (2) (d), granted in consultation with the Minister of Economic Affairs, firstly, undertakings for the performance or promotion of the activities referred to in paragraph (1), i.e. to develop, manufacture, service, repair, maintain, buy, sell, import, export, and through advertising or otherwise, to promote the sales of armaments; secondly, to take over such undertakings and, thirdly, to acquire a share in such undertakings or to have part in the establishment of such undertakings.</p>

<p><i><b>Proposed new subparagraph</b></i> 3 (2) <i><b>(e):</b></i></p>

<p>Then we have the proposed subparagraph 3 (2) (e). The object of the proposed deletion and the insertion of the reference to the activities mentioned in subparagraph (1), is to confer upon Armscor, in keeping with its wide powers, also the powers for the promotion of companies other than merely companies for the development or production of armaments. This power may only be exercised with the approval of the Minister granted in consultation with the Minister of Economic Affairs. There is a reason for this. Another undertaking may be established for the attainment of an object which, in fact, may eventually be closely bound up with these objectives.</p>

<p><i><b>Proposed new subparagraph</b></i> 3 (2) (<i>f</i>):</p>

<p>Then, as far as the proposed new sub-paragraph 3 (2) (f) is concerned, the proposed amendment merely seeks to eliminate a certain measure of overlapping that exists. Owing to the narrow meaning attached to the phrase &#x201C;subsidiary company&#x201D;, it is being proposed that in this case the Minister&#x2019;s approval should not always have to be obtained.</p>

<p><span class="col_7997-7998" refersTo="page_0953"/><i>Proposed new subparagraph</i> 3 (2) (<i>l</i>):</p>

<p>Then there is the new proposed subparagraph 3 (2) (1). This is a new subparagraph in terms of which the powers of Armscor in regard to the manufacture and supply of firearms, ammunition and pyrotechnical products are defined more closely. Previously Armscor was only authorized to develop or manufacture armaments. In terms of this subparagraph it is also being authorized to service, repair, maintain, buy, sell, import, export, and through advertising or otherwise, to promote the sales of armaments.</p>

<p>Here I want to reconfirm what I said in 1968, namely that the distribution of commercial arms and ammunition will take place through established commercial channels and not directly to members of the public. I think it is necessary for us to emphasize this again.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p><i>Proposed new subparagraphs</i> 3 (2) (<i>m</i>) <i>and (n):</i></p>

<p>In terms of subparagraph (m) Armscor is empowered to acquire patents, licences, concessions, rights of manufacture or the like and to exercise several powers in respect of them, whilst subparagraph (n) empowers Armscor to engage employees. These powers are of necessity bound up with the activities of Armscor and require no further comment.</p>

<p><i>Proposed new subparagraph</i> 3 (2) (o):</p>

<p>As Armscor has to spend large amounts of money on insurance premiums every year, the board of directors has, after an exhaustive investigation, arrived at the conclusion that a major saving could be effected if we agreed to subparagraph 3 (2) (o), if, in the first place, the State were to bear the risk in respect of losses of catastrophic dimensions which Armscor may suffer, and, in the second place, an internal insurance fund were established for covering smaller losses. The provisions of the proposed subparagraph are aimed at authorizing Armscor to establish such an internal fund. In this regard it should also be borne in mind that the activities of Armscor and its subsidiaries are of such a nature that special precautionary and firefighting measures are taken, through which the possibility of losses is limited to a large extent.</p>

<p><i>Amendment of the final paragraph of section</i> 3 (2):</p>

<p>The amendment of this final paragraph is essential in the light of the extension effected to Armscor&#x2019;s powers in subparagraph (1) of this section.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 2 (2):</p>

<p>What we have here, is not a reference to the proposed new subsection of the principal Act, but to the number of the clause in the Bill. It is also deemed necessary to make section 3 of the principal Act retrospective in order to make provision for those cases where, in the implementation of its objects, Armscor inevitably had to take over certain companies and was unavoidably confronted in some respects with an excess of its powers.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 3:</p>

<p>Fixed property which in terms of the provisions of section 5 (1) of the Armaments Act, Act No. 87 of 1964, became vested in the Armaments Board, is still registered in the name of the State at present. The Armaments Board decided not to take transfer of these properties because of the fact that the Board had not been exempted from the payment of transfer duties, stamp duties and municipal rates and taxes. For the sake of effective control, however, it is essential for Armscor to take transfer of these properties. The provisions of the proposed section 3A of the principal Act are necessary in order to prevent the properties having to be transferred first from the State to the Armaments Board and then to Armscor. This would be a cumbrous procedure. Such a take-over implies that from now on Armscor will pay normal rates and taxes to local authorities.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 4:</p>

<p>For the sake of convenience references are made here to the subsections of the proposed sections 4A and 4B of the Armaments Development and Production Act.</p>

<p><span class="col_7999-8000" refersTo="page_0954"/><i>Proposed subsection</i> 4<i>A</i> (<i>a</i>):</p>

<p>In terms of this subsection Armscor is being authorized to employ and discharge employees. The powers conferred in terms of this provision, are of necessity bound up with the activities of the corporation, and require no further special motivation.</p>

<p><i>Proposed subsections</i> 4<i>A</i> (<i>b</i>), (<i>c</i>), (<i>d</i>) <i>and</i> <i>(e):</i></p>

<p>Prior to the take-over by Armscor of the Atlas Aircraft Corporation of South Africa (Pty.) Limited, Atlas had already provided the services and facilities envisaged by these subsections. After the take-over of Atlas, Armscor could hardly terminate these activities of Atlas without such a step inevitably bringing about serious personnel losses on the one hand, and, on the other hand, rendering absolutely impossible the recruitment of overseas personnel in particular. Armscor was therefore obliged to continue these activities.</p>

<p><i>Proposed subsection</i> 4<i>A</i> (<i>f</i>):</p>

<p>In terms of the existing legislation Armscor does not have the power to establish a pension scheme for its employees. The envisaged amendment is mainly aimed at conferring these powers upon Armscor, and also at authorizing in law such schemes or funds which already existed at the take-over of subsidiary companies.</p>

<p><i>Proposed section</i> 4<i>B</i>:</p>

<p>The proposed section is mainly aimed at conferring upon Armscor the necessary power to safeguard and protect the premises of Armscor, <i>inter alia,</i> by having persons stopped and searched. Of course, this will not apply to hon. members when they visit the premises. In addition, this section also confers upon Armscor indemnity against damage caused by any measures taken for the safeguarding and protection of the premises of Armscor.</p>

<p><i>Clause 4</i> (2):</p>

<p>Section 4A of the principal Act, as inserted by clause 4 (1) of this Bill, which has just been explained, will apply retrospectively.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> <b>5:</b></p>

<p>Basically the change to this section amounts to a rearrangement of the wordorder.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 6:</p>

<p>The proposed new sections 5A and 5B of the principal Act make provision for the appointment of committees to assist the board of directors of Armscor in the performance of its task.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 7:</p>

<p>Through the proposed section 6A it is envisaged to confer upon Armscor powers for negotiating loans. These powers may only be exercised with the approval of the Minister, which he grants in consultation with the Minister of Finance. In other words, he will not be able to act on his own. The object of this section is to enable Armscor, under specific circumstances, when the necessary funds cannot be obtained from the State, to obtain such funds from other sources in order to give effect to its objects. Such circumstances have already arisen. At the Committee Stage I shall move that a further subsection be inserted in the Bill. The subsection I propose to move, provides that the Minister may in consultation with the Minister of Finance guarantee loans negotiated in terms of the proposed subsection 6A. Hon. members will appreciate that it is the normal practice that whereas guarantees are furnished and whereas the State holds all the shares in Armscor, it stands to reason that the Government will have to furnish such guarantees as may be required.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 8:</p>

<p>The object of this clause is to exempt Armscor from the payment of stamp duties, transfer duties and any other duties or fees which would normally have been payable. Because of the set-up of Armscor and in order to keep the prices of armaments within reasonable limits, this exemption from the payment of duties and fees is essential.</p>

<p>As the wording of this clause lends itself to the possible interpretation that fees such as purchase tax on commercial products are exempted by it, I undertake to remedy this matter by way of moving an amendment during the Committee Stage.</p>

<p><span class="col_8001-8002" refersTo="page_0955"/><i>Clause</i> 9:</p>

<p>The object of the proposed section 8 (1) A of the principal Act is to confer upon Armscor the power to build up a reserve fund and so to make provision, as is done in the private sector, for unforeseen economic conditions.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 10:</p>

<p>&#x2020;For the sake of convenience I will refer here to the sections of the principal Act on account of the fact that a large number of new sections will be inserted in the principal Act by clause 10 of the Bill.</p>

<p><i>Proposed section</i> 8<i>A of the principal Act:</i></p>

<p>In this section provision is made for the establishment of employees&#x2019; associations which must protect the interest of employees. Such an employees&#x2019; association must apply in writing and in a manner prescribed by regulation for recognition as an employees&#x2019; association. It is also provided that existing employees&#x2019; associations can object against an application for recognition by an employees&#x2019; association. No employees&#x2019; association of which membership is open to both Whites and non-Whites will be recognized. Where an employees&#x2019; association applies for recognition as such, Armscor may approve or refuse the application. In the event of refusal the right of appeal to the Minister is granted to such an employees&#x2019; association. The Minister can then confirm the refusal, reject it or instruct Armscor, after compliance with the conditions laid down by the Minister, to grant the application.</p>

<p><i>Proposed section</i> 8<i>B of the principal Act</i>:</p>

<p>In this section the conditions with which the constitution of an employees&#x2019; association must comply, are stipulated.</p>

<p><i>Proposed sections</i> 8<i>C,</i> 8<i>D,</i> 8<i>E and</i> 8<i>F of the principal Act:</i></p>

<p>These sections create the machinery for the settlement of disputes between employers and employees. An individual employee, or, in the case of more than one employees, and employees&#x2019; association may submit written representations to their employer in connection with any matter related to their work. The employer must notify his decision in writing to the em ployee or employees&#x2019; association, depending on the circumstances. If the individual employee or employees are dissatisfied with the decision of the employer, they may approach an advisory committee. Such an advisory committee makes no rulings but merely acts in an advisory capacity. Armscor can accept a recommendation of the advisory committee, reject it, amend it or can take another decision. Such an advisory committee consists of at least two persons designated by Armscor. Furthermore an individual employee, or in the case of more than one employee, their employees&#x2019; association, has the right to appoint an equal number of members of the management committee of their employees&#x2019; association as those designated by Armscor.</p>

<p>If the individual employee or employees are dissatisfied with the decision of Armscor, the employee may, and an employees&#x2019; association must, if requested thereto by the employees, give notice thereof to the Minister and thereafter it is deemed that a dispute regarding the matter exists between the employees and their employer. When a dispute as referred to is deemed to exist, the matter is referred to a settlement board. Such a settlement board consists of three members designated by the Minister. The chairman thereof shall be a Judge or principal magistrate or retired Judge or principal magistrate or an advocate of not less than ten years&#x2019; standing. A second member is appointed by the Minister from a panel of at least three and not more than five names submitted to him by Armscor. The third member is appointed from a panel of at least three and not more than five names which is submitted to the Minister by the individual employee or, in the case of more than one employee, by the employees&#x2019; association. The decision of the settlement board is final and bind the parties to the dispute, and there is no right of appeal against the decision of a settlement board.</p>

<p><i>Proposed section</i> 8<i>G in the principal Act:</i></p>

<p>If the Industrial Conciliation Act is not applicable to Armscor or its subsidiaries, the prohibition on strikes contained in the said Act falls away. For this reason it is accordingly necessary that provision be made in this Bill for a prohibition on strikes; such a prohibition is imposed by this section.</p>

<p><span class="col_8003-8004" refersTo="page_0956"/><i>Clause</i> 11 <i>(a):</i></p>

<p>This section is amended by the substitution of the words &#x201C;management and control&#x201D; and &#x201C;affairs&#x201D; for the words &#x201C;exercise&#x201D; and &#x201C;powers&#x201D;, respectively.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 11 <i>(b):</i></p>

<p>This clause has become necessary in view of the many matters in connection with which the State President has to issue regulations.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 12:</p>

<p>In terms of the provisions of section 12 of the principle Act the State President is empowered to exempt Armscor by means of proclamation from the Acts mentioned in such proclamation. The proposed amendment is aimed at providing the State President with the same powers as in connection with the subsidiary company of Armscor as he presently enjoys in connection with Armscor itself.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 13:</p>

<p>In this clause provision is made for the exemption of Armscor and its subsidiaries from the provisions of the Industrial Conciliation Act.</p>

<p>*I just want to say that this Bill was, as I have said, prepared after very thorough consideration. We believe that it is in the highest interests of strategic industries manufacturing strategic arms and ammunition for the Defence Force. But at the same time we have gone out of our way in an attempt to establish the machinery whereby employees may consult with their employers. If all these employees were still employees of the State today, as they originally were, they would in any case not have had the right to strike or have had more rights than they will have in terms of this legislation.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we will not oppose this measure. I put it specifically that way, viz. that we will not oppose it rather than that we will support it, because to some extent, I feel, we are taking a sledge hammer with which to bash a gnat to death. I am not referring to the capital N sort of Nat! We, of course, agree that you cannot have strikes in an armaments industry. That is out of the question. There is no difference of opinion between us on this. We will support the Government in this measure to make strikes illegal. We would have thought that it might have been possible to simply declare strikes illegal whilst still making use of the tried and tested machinery of industrial negotiation between employer and employee which we have in our industrial set-up in South Africa.</p>

<p>The Minister says that these avenues have been explored and were found unworkable. Therefore we have some eight pages of this Bill taken up by clause 10, creating a complete new structure for staff representation and administration for negotiating with employers. But what it boils down to, of course, is that this is a closed negotiating machine between employer and employee within the structure of the unit. The Minister remains the boss; he remains the final court of appeal in regard to recognition or otherwise of employees&#x2019; associations. So we are saying to the employees: We will give you an organization and you can apply for registration. If it is refused you can appeal to your boss, your boss is the person who will decide whether you will be recognized and registered or not. In other words, it is in fact limiting the scope.</p>

<p>I would like to have seen a broader form of representation, as I say, without the strike power, but incorporating registration under the Industrial Conciliation Act so that they would be recognized trade unions. I am particularly thinking in terms of the skilled occupations where there is still the tradesman&#x2019;s pride in maintaining standards and in ensuring that people who exercise a certain skill, are properly qualified to do so and do not cheapen that particular skill. That has always led to the closed-shop system, negotiation over apprenticeship, ensuring that by the time the person is recognized in his trade, he is fully qualified and can maintain all the standards. Nevertheless, despite that we recognize that there are other problems. We recognize that there are other difficulties which make arms production different from the operation of a normal factory. Therefore we shall not oppose this set-up.</p>

<p>We would, however, like to make a special appeal to the hon. the Minister. That is to ensure that those who are members of trade unions at the moment in the organization, that those who are already <span class="col_8005-8006" refersTo="page_0957"/>employed and who belong to a recognized trade union are consulted so that they will accept this change-over with the minimum of friction. It must not be something which is simply imposed on them by Parliament which tells them: &#x201C;Take it or leave it&#x201D; and &#x201C;Bob&#x2019;s your uncle&#x201D;. Trade unionism is a delicate instrument which has many ramifications. If we want to have the goodwill of the labour market of the world, we must have the goodwill of trade union organizations. So I would suggest that whatever negotiation has taken place already&#x2014;perhaps the Minister would like to tell us the extent to which there has been negotiation with the interested trade unions&#x2014;in addition every effort be made to obtain the complete acceptance and goodwill of those artisans who will be affected by the new system of negotiation.</p>

<p>Obviously, this places a further burden on the Minister. In any department and with any Minister of State one finds that it is not the Minister himself but a person who advises him, an official who is given this particular responsibility, because no single human being could give his personal attention to everything to which a Minister is required to give his attention. No single physical body could so divide itself as to be able to give attention to all the details. Therefore if one talks of the Minister, one talks of the Minister by delegation. You will find even in this Bill the delegation of power to a body or committee then redelegated to someone else and redelegated again. What I would like to ask the hon. the Minister is that in the exercise of the powers het gets, really as a kind of deputy Minister of Labour, he will not make this a delegated power when it comes to the registration of staff associations and any matter of dispute. I ask this of him because he will now be acting in the capacity in which the Minister of Labour would act were there a dispute under the Industrial Conciliation Act. However, if the hon. the Minister himself is simply going to be a rubber-stamp to the corporation, this whole thing might as well be torn up before we start, because where you have a dispute, you will find the person with the authority, the person who does the appointing and makes the decisions, will in fact be one of the disputing parties. Therefore I ask the hon. the Minister not to make this one of his delegated powers.</p>

<p>When I mention delegation, there is the question of delegation to committees and to individuals, and I am glad to see that specific provision is made that where powers are delegated, the corporation itself shall not be divested of a power so delegated. This corporation handles a lot of money and a lot of responsibility. It is very highly sensitive to rumour because of the secrecy necessarily attending this sort of production. Nothing can start a hare running faster than something which you cannot talk about because by its very nature it is secret, although you know it is spending a lot of money.</p>

<p>That combination can be very harmful. The Minister does not need to be told about it&#x2014;he probably hears the rumours every day; rumours about money being thrown down the drain here and there and commissions on this black market and that black market. It is just a hint here and a rumour there. That particularly is emphasized and highlighted when power is delegated. I refer to the proposed new section 5B which is introduced by clause 6 of this Bill. This power to delegate authority to persons or bodies of persons applies particularly to the purchasing. The Minister will remember that when we discussed the original Act, we discussed tender procedures and so on. Because of the sensitivity to which I referred, this matter is one to which I ask the hon. the Minister to pay particular attention, so that these rumours do not start. Where such delegation does take place, the greatest personal control by the Minister should be maintained. With those observations, I confirm that we will vote for the Second Reading of this measure and we will support it through the House.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to assure the hon. member for Durban Point that I do not think there is the slightest difference of opinion between the two of us as to the absolute necessity for the greatest measure of efficiency, good control, financial control, and business administration to have preference in this major undertaking of the State.</p>

<p>In the second place, I want to give the hon. member the assurance that the Minister would not have been able to carry out this task if he did not have at his disposal the services and assistance of men who are prepared&#x2014;as I mentioned in my speech&#x2014;to help us in that regard. I think we are very much indebted to those prominent businessmen who are serving on our various directorates and helping to <span class="col_8007-8008" refersTo="page_0958"/>exercise this supervision. This applies tothe chairman of Armscor, his board ofdirectors and the persons serving in the subsidiaries. They are men of character and integrity, and we must simply ensure that this will remain the position.</p>

<p>Regarding labour arrangements, the hon. member may rest assured that if I could escape from the task of handling them, I would gladly have done so. I have quite enough work, but with the assistance of these directorates I have no doubt whatever that we shall also build up proper relations in that regard. After all, the future of this undertaking depends on the good co-operation between employee and employer. We have already made a great deal of progress in our negotiations with some of them. There are several thousands, and the majority of them have not been organized. Only a small group of them have been organized. We have negotiated with them as far as we could. We shall make a request to Armscor that, in the implementation of these provisions, they should expedite the further negotiations as much as possible and cause them to proceed smoothly, so as to bring about the greatest measure of peace and satisfaction. I cannot disagree with the hon. member; I am in complete agreement with him, and I gladly give him the assurances I have given him.</p>

<heading>CONSIDERATION OF THIRD REPORTOF SELECT COMMITTEE ON BANTUAFFAIRS</heading>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the report before us provides for the release of large tracts of land in the Ciskei for acquisition by the Bantu or by the Bantu Trust in terms of the Bantu Trust and Land Act of 1936. I think I am correct in saying that this is the largest release of land since the Act was passed and it certainly is the largest in the Eastern Cape. It behoves this House therefore to give particular consideration to this resolution and I wish to state shortly our attitude towards purchases of this nature in general before I deal with this one in particular. In deciding whether or not to support the purchase of land for use by Bantu, regard must be had to the effect of such purchases on the South African economy as a whole and more particularly to the uses to which the land is to be put, such as the efficient production of food or the development of new growth points of importance to the economy as a whole.</p>

<p>Thus, in making a decision, there are a number of considerations to which regard must be had. They are in the first place the statement of intention if not a commitment inherent in the 1936 legislation.</p>

<p>Secondly there is the fact that, with the population explosion expected by the year 2000, demands on South Africa to produce adequate good supplies render it unwise to put additional land in the hands of people who will not only farm it unproductively, but as a result of overcrowding and out-of-date methods may well cause the soil to be eroded and rendered useless for a long time.</p>

<p>Thirdly, there is the fact that under United Party policy consolidation of the Bantu homelands is unnecessary.</p>

<p>Fourthly, the future well-being of the Bantu people obviously lies not in pastoral or subsistence farming but in industrial development coupled with efficient food production from the land by the use of enlightened systems of agriculture.</p>

<p>Then too, purchases should not be supported just because all the land dealt with in the 1936 Act has not yet been made available, but only where such land is necessary for industrial development or the establishment of economic farming units, once again against the background of the entire South African economy.</p>

<p>The acceptance of these principles will leave Parliament free to judge each case on its own merits in the interests of the South African economy as a whole and all the people that inhabit the country. On this basis the purchase of land for Bantu residential occupation in the neighbourhood of natural growth points would be justified. Black spots where the presence of the Bantu is unjustified for economic reasons <span class="col_8009-8010" refersTo="page_0959"/>would be eliminated, individual land ownership amongst the Bantu as opposed to communal ownership would develop and there would be large scale industrial development both inside and outside the Reserves.</p>

<p>With these principles in mind, we must decide what our attitude should be in regard to this particular resolution before us. We have just approved of two resolutions of a similar nature. Those resolutions could, however, be supported for economic reasons and because of their respective merits in terms of the principles which I have just stated. The resolution before us now, however, is politically inspired and not one for economic reasons. The proposal is to declare large tracts of land presently profitably occupied and farmed by Whites as released areas to enable the South African Bantu Trust or Bantu themselves to acquire the land for Bantu occupation. The sole motivation given to us by the hon. the Deputy Chairman of the Bantu Affairs Commission, the hon. member for Langlaagte, at a meeting of interested persons at King William&#x2019;s Town &#x2026;</p>

<p>He told the land owners in King William&#x2019;s Town that the Government is obliged to purchase a certain extent of land as provided for in the 1936 legislation. By saying that the hon. member repeated what the hon. the Prime Minister had said, viz., that the Government is obliged to buy a certain amount of land in terms of the 1936 Act. That of course is not true. The Act lays down the maximum extent of the land which may be bought in each province.</p>

<p>However, I do not contend that we should not abide by the spirit of the 1936 legislation. But I wish to point out that the land owners in the affected area are being misled into believing that the Government is committed by promises of the previous Government to buy a minimum amount of land when in fact they are limited to buying a maximum extent of land. Incidentally, Sir, the limit of the extent of the land which is to be bought in terms of the 1936 legislation was set out by a United Party Government, and it is interesting to note that at that time the Nationalist Opposition, led by Mr. Strydom, opposed it on the ground that too much land was being set aside for the Bantu.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_vuuren">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. Z. J. VAN VUUREN</person>:</from>

<p>That is not so.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>That is so. All that hon. member has to do is to read the debates which took place at that time and then he will see what happened. Sir, one must remember that the 1936 Act was passed and the commitment entered into when we were emerging from the depression, and therefore land for subsistence farming was the only prospect that we could offer to the Bantu. South Africa has changed since then and we now all agree that the economy should be diversified to make the people in the Reserves less dependent on this type of agriculture. <span class="col_8011-8012" refersTo="page_0960"/>It is possible, and indeed advisable, that the Bantu should be encouraged to accept more valuable land with industrial potential which can support thousands more than farming land can support. In this way it may be possible to achieve the objects of the 1936 commitment on a smaller area of land than contemplated as the maximum in that enactment. It may be argued, Sir, that we are in honour bound by the 1936 commitment, but Bantu leaders have already stated that they were not a party to that legislation and therefore they do not consider that they are bound by that legislation at all. The door therefore is open to this Government, and certainly to a United Party Government, to negotiate with Bantu leaders in the future to persuade them that eventually a smaller area of land may be more beneficial to them than that provided for in 1936. On the other hand, it may be necessary, in order to do justice to the Bantu, to exceed the maximum laid down in 1936. We do not want to be bound by questions of geography or acreage. We believe that our first concern should be the welfare of the people for whom we are responsible. Sir, we must not lose sight of the many morgen of land purchased since 1936 by various Governments for Bantu townships in the White areas. When the 1913 and the 1936 Acts were considered, it was never envisaged that there would be so many thousands of Bantu permanently employed and housed in the White areas. We believe that notwithstanding Government policy, these people are there permanently, and those who are permanently employed must be allowed to own their own homes in terms of our policy. I say therefore that we must bear this in mind in considering what land to set aside for Bantu occupation.</p>

<p>The resolution before us provides for the release of over 118 000 ha of land, and it is obvious that the acquisition of all this land by Bantu or by the Bantu Trust will take many years. I see that the hon. the Deputy Minister has suggested that it might be as long as 15 years. But with the drastic reduction in the amount of capital provided in this year&#x2019;s Budget for the purchase of land, and bearing in mind the demand of the Zulus, I do not thi&#x0026;lt;u&#x0026;gt;nk &#x0026;lt;/u&#x0026;gt;that even 15 years will be sufficient time for the purchase of the land envisaged here.</p>

<p>Sir, if this was the final plan for the Ciskei, it could be argued that we should support this measure in order to finalize the boundary of the Ciskei and so end the uncertainty which exists in that area. However, we have been told by the hon. member for Langlaagte and by the Minister himself that this is not the final plan for the Ciskei. This major consideration, therefore, falls away and the whole border area is in fact left in a state of uncertainty, uncertainty as to where the final boundaries are going to be and which area will be the next to be declared a released area for occupation by Bantu.</p>

<p>Sir, I do not think that anybody will seriously contend that the setting aside of this land for Bantu occupation will be for the benefit of the South African economy as a whole or for the more efficient production of food or for the development of growth points. There has been no submission by any official or Government spokesman that the proposal is for the benefit of the South African economy, and until we are satisfied on that score, one of our foremost qualifications, which I set out earlier, is not met.</p>

<p>The Eastern Agricultural Union delegates at the King William&#x2019;s Town meeting, to which I have referred earlier, said that they felt that it was their duty to see to the efficient production of food. They objected to the transfer of the land, and again there has been no suggestion by any official that the acquisition by the Bantu Trust will bring about a more efficient production of food in this area. With our past experience, we fear that the opposite may result. From submissions made by the farmer delegates at the King William&#x2019;s Town meeting, I am of the opinion that no more Bantu will be profitably accommodated on this land than the numbers at present accommodated on this land in the employment of farmers.</p>

<p>We feel that by adopting this resolution we will not be taking a step in the interests of the economy as a whole, nor of the Bantu concerned, in particular, nor will we be bringing finality to the Government&#x2019;s problem of finalizing the boundaries of this area, which is fundamental to its policies. The memorandum submitted to the Select Committee provides for use of portion of the proposed released areas as compensation for various small isolated Bantu areas totalling 59 100 ha in exchange. Sir, I say that we support the elimination of Black spots where for economic reasons they are unjustified, and I believe that the Black spots indicated on the map supplied to the <span class="col_8013-8014" refersTo="page_0961"/>Select Committee would fit into that category, but in this instance we were unable to ascertain which land would be used in exchange for these Black spots or when the exchange would take place. I know that this is a matter of urgency to many in that area, and the Government should come with a clear statement of policy as to which areas it intends exchanging, as it did in the two resolutions which this House accepted a few minutes ago. As against whatever doubtful advantages or beneficial aspects there may be in the resolution before us, we say that there are definite discernible disadvantages.</p>

<p>Firstly, the areas concerned are some of the best farming areas in South Africa and are required for efficient food production and generally in the interest of the economy of the country as a whole. Secondly, there will be a state of uncertainty in the whole area because none of the inhabitants will know for certain when their properties are to be acquired by the Trust or are to be bought for Bantu. Once the area is released, the Bantu Trust can buy anywhere in the area; and others whose land is not included in this resolution which is before us now will not know how far the boundaries are going to be extended and when their properties, too, will be set aside for acquisition by the authorities for a possible independent state, and this uncertainty will persist as long as the Government neglects or fails to lay down the boundaries of the homelands to which it intends giving independence. It is clear, Sir, from the statements by the Minister, his Deputies and officials of the department and the farmers&#x2019; associations and others who attended the meeting at King William&#x2019;s Town that there has not been adequate consultation between the Government and the farmers&#x2019; associations concerned or the other organizations or public bodies representing the landowners in that area. And it is clear too that they have not been told how much compensation they will get, how they will be compensated or when their properties will be taken over. Sir, we have the Transkei experience before us. We contend that where Government action places people in a position where in fact the Government becomes the only market for the property, it should give an assurance that they will buy the land offered to it without laying down conditions of urgency, as it was done in the Transkei. Although the position has improved there over the years, there is still dissatisfaction with this amount of compensation, but especially with the rate of the take-over of the property of those who wish to leave because of Government policy. With the reduction of funds provided in this last Budget, the take-over is going to be even slower. Circumstances may be urgent to an owner, and not urgent to the Government. Schooling, for example, may be urgent for the owner, but it may not be urgent to the Government in deciding whether to take over the property or not. The desire to take advantage of an opportunity establishing themselves elsewhere may be urgent for the owners of property, but it may not be urgent as far as the Government is concerned. Illness in a family may be urgent to the owner or occupier. The objection to living alongside of people with a different colour can be urgent to the people living in the area, but not to the Government. There is a variety of other reasons which may eventuate because of changed circumstances brought about in the area, because of the application of the Government&#x2019;s policy, altering the law relating to the acquisition of land by other race groups and political changes in the area.</p>

<p>Speaking of removals, we all know of the dissatisfaction there has been over the application of the Group Areas Act, where people affected have been aggrieved. Sometimes, of course, their grievances may have been unjust, but there is now no doubt about it that they feel that the Government has given them a raw deal and that they did not get their just due. This will apply also in this area, where some people will have to leave who do not wish to leave. Then, speaking of those who do not wish to move because of the difficulty they foresee in establishing themselves elsewhere, on the same basis, and according to the same living standards as they enjoy now, I here refer especially to the small farmers in the Braunschweig and the Frankfort area, but others will deal with that.</p>

<p>Now, what is to happen in the villages of Hamburg and Peddie? They are now excluded from the schedule although they were originally included in the memorandum set before the Select Committee. Hamburg, as a tourist resort, may go on as it is now, but what will happen to Peddie? It will starve if the neighbouring farms all round that village are sold or acquired by the Government. But it is proposed to make the fate of these villages even worse than it would have been had they been included in the scheduled released areas, be <span class="col_8015-8016" refersTo="page_0962"/>cause it is now proposed to leave them out, and there is another resolution on the Order Paper before us, in which the Government is asked to consider legislation to deal particularly with these areas, and the way they will deal with it is to pass laws, as they have done in the Transkei, zoning these villages for occupation by the Bantu, and zoning them party by part until the whole village is taken. I know all about the trouble experienced in the villages in the Transkei. Once it becomes known that these villages will gradually be rezoned piecemeal for Black occupation, they will become moribund. There will be no hope for them to sell to others besides the Bantu Trust or the Bantu, and the Bantu Trust will not be able to buy because they are not released areas. They will not be able to buy until the village is zoned piecemeal for occupation by Africans. Sir, you only have to hear the complaints in the villages of the Transkei who have experienced this type of take-over to realize what is going to happen in those two villages. I say it bodes ill for them. Hamburg is excluded from the schedules before us now, but not the other potential holiday resorts being established along that coast. I understand there are four or five of these resorts being developed at present by private enterprise. They may be more fortunate in Hamburg at the moment, in that once they are declared released areas, the Bantu Trust can buy, or the Bantu can buy, but this coastal strip, I submit, is not suitable for agricultural development although it does provide the best potential for tourist development in South Africa. I have before me certain photographs, and I am prepared to hand them to the Minister, to show the type of holiday resort that can be developed there. There is Umtana Lagoon. From the picture you can see that it is forest area all above the sea with a lovely lagoon, and it is very popular with holidaymakers. Then there is Bushbuck Park, which is also being developed as a nature reserve for animals, and you can see the cottages already built there. You can see what a beautiful area it is, with a river too. Private companies are developing this. [Interjection.] I am not going to mention the names of the companies here, but the fact is that they are being developed. Then there is the Gusha Mouth Estate and Gwalana Lagoon. What we fear is that once these areas are declared released areas and are taken over by the Bantu Trust, because I cannot see who else is going to buy them, they will stagnate and will not be developed satisfactorily as tourist resorts; we have the example of what has happened in the Transkei. I know that the farmers do not want to be isolated on that strip. They do not want to be left there alone if the rest of the area is going to go Black. They want the area to be bought by someone. I suggest that the Government should buy that area or get the Bantu Trust or some other organization to buy it, and to set it aside for development as tourist resorts and as nature reserves. Now in fairness to the developers&#x2014;it does not matter who they are; the hon. member for Cradock wants to know who the developers are. I do not know who they all are, but there are five of them as far as I know&#x2014; but in fairness to these people, once these areas have been declared released areas, the Government, should tell the owners how they can dispose of their properties and what is to become of their holiday resorts.</p>

<p>Then too we are not satisfied that proper assurances can be given to King William&#x2019;s Town, that its water resources will be properly protected. We know of that meeting at King William&#x2019;s Town where they expressed their concern.</p>

<p>I think I have given enough instances to show the concern with which we on this side view this setting aside of the whole of this area as a released area, and I say in conclusion that the Government cannot possibly take over the whole area at once. We do not know when it is going to start and we do not know what properties will be affected and the people living in that area do not know what properties are going to be affected. The Government should come with an overall plan to tell us what they intend doing, how they intend taking over the property, and in fact where they intend finalizing the boundaries, so that everybody in that area will know exactly where they stand. We are therefore opposed to this resolution.</p>

<p>Let me tell hon. members that all the arguments the hon. member for Transkei used here are also the arguments they used that day at the King William&#x2019;s Town hearing. They also proceeded from the supposition that they have only one object, to produce food. They wanted to retain all the available agricultural land for the purposes of agriculture. But that is not what it is all about; here it is a question of the realization of the provisions of the 1936 Act. It is also a question of the consolidation of the Bantu homelands. I want to say here this evening that I think this is a very historic moment for South Africa. I want to take the hon. House back 36 years into the past. At about the same time 36 years ago the 1936 Act was debated in this House. On 4th May 1936 a decision was taken in this House. In those days the National Party sat on that side. The National Party, which was in the Opposition, supported the provisions of the 1936 Act.</p>

<p>I am sorry, Mr. Speaker. When those hon. members came into power after 1939, they failed to meet these faithful obligations that Gen. Hertzog gave them, on his honour, to comply with. With the statement of these three points, Gen. Hertzog undertook to purchase all these 7&#x00BC; million morgen for the Bantu within ten years after 1936. But what was done after that? That word of honour, which the hon. members gave, was not kept by them. Therefore I want to say that today it is a gratifying moment for us to be able to say that after 36 years, after 24 years of National Party rule, we are now starting off here to draw the boundary lines of the Ciskei, after having put all the machinery in operation to set these people going towards eventual independence under their own homeland governments. As far as this homeland is concerned, we are now eventually doing the rounding off work.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. Z. J. VAN VUUREN</person>:</from>

<p>We are drawing these boundary lines. What we are engaged in now is consolidation work. That is why we told the audience and the people at King William&#x2019;s Town that we are engaged in discussions with the relevant bodies there as far as the consolidation of the Ciskei is concerned. As far as that is concerned, things are made very clear to them. The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town was there, so were the hon. members for Transkei and East London North. They heard what was said there. We stated it very clearly that what we were engaged in was related to the terms of reference we were given, as a Bantu Affairs Commission, to hold discussions in the Ciskei with those bodies in respect of the consolidation of the Ciskei and the acquisition of quota land for the Transkei in the first place and, secondly, compensation land for the shifting of those areas that are badly situated areas. That is what we are engaged in. That is why I am grateful that we can say on this historic moment this evening that we are acquiring and establishing the quota for the Cape Province. What are we now doing here with this motion? Firstly we are acquiring the quota land for the Cape. But what is the Cape Province&#x2019;s quota? Under the 1936 Act the Cape Province was to acquire 1 384 156 ha. Since 1936 1 022 358 ha have already been acquired for the Cape Province. In other words, the balance of the quota for the Cape Province is 361 798 ha. In this motion it is now being recommended that 178 330 ha be purchased. 59 000 ha of that 178 330 ha will be used as compensation land. Let the world know this. We are telling the world; we are telling the United Party; let there be no illusions about that. As far as the Cape Province is concerned, the outstanding land quota that still has to be purchased under the 1936 Act is 120 330 ha. No, pardon me, I have made a wrong calculation. 59 000 ha must be subtracted from the 178 000 ha. This is compensation land for these badly situated spots that must now be shifted. In other words, the land that is now being released, that may now be acquired, is 120 330 ha in extent. In other words, the outstanding quota land that still has to be purchased in terms of the 1936 Act in the Cape is 361 000 ha minus 120 000 ha, i.e. 241 468 ha. That is the land that is still outstanding in the Cape Province according to the provisions of the 1936 Act. That is the quantity of land that still has to be made available here. The Cape Province must simply accept the fact. That is the quota that was laid down in the 1936 Act&#x2026;</p>

<p>Yes, but I am now telling the hon. member. That is what this whole matter is all about. It is also what the King William&#x2019;s Town inquiry was all about. These areas, which are now to be released in terms of this provision, will be employed, firstly, as I have said, to make up, to a large extent, the outstanding land quota that still has to be purchased in the Cape Province. Secondly, this land will be employed for the shifting of these badly situated Bantu areas. These are areas that fall outside the Ciskei area; these are areas such as Goshen Missionary Reserve, which is 1 830 ha in extent. This will be shifted to the Whittlesea area. Then we have the Wartburg Reserve of 2 805 ha. This will be shifted to the Frankfort area. In a moment I shall tell the House why these specific poorly situated areas are being shifted to these specific areas. Then there is the Umgwali Reserve of 4 768 ha. That will be shifted to the Braunschweig area.</p>

The Newlands location is situated in the East London District and is 4 581 ha in extent. This area must be shifted, and the only area it can tie in with is the Chalumna area in the East London district. So, too, we have the Bantu areas at Humansdorp which fall altogether outside this area. Those areas must be shifted, and the only areas they can tie in with, being 7 708 ha in extent, are the Keiskamahoek areas. Likewise we have the portions of the Sikobeni, Peelton and Balazi locations that have to be shifted because they are wrongly situated. They cover an area of 2 591 ha.</p>

<p>The reply was clearly given to the hon. gentleman in the Select Committee to the effect that these released areas are going to be used for the shifting of poorly situated areas and for the removal of Black spots. All I am now doing is furnishing particulars. The hon. members must just listen. I say that the people of the Lesseyton area, in the Queenstown district, which covers 6 866 ha, must be shifted to the Ndonga area. Then we also have Black spots in the districts of East London, King William&#x2019;s Town. Peddie, Alice, Stutterheim, Cathcart, Stockenstroom and Uitenhage, which cover an area of 8 565 ha all-told. Those areas must also be tied in with these released areas. As I have said, the shifting of the poorly situated areas into released areas is taking place according to the ethnic classification and the ethnic accommodation of those people where they belong. Everything is being placed on ethnic basis. All the people who have to be shifted from the poorly situated areas must be put in areas where they can be placed within their tribal context. That, I state, is the object of this releasing process. It is being done, firstly, to fill the quotas of those areas. It is being done so that the Ciskei&#x2019;s quota can more or less balance with that of the Transkei in accordance with the population density there. In addition the poorly situated areas must be shifted, and this includes the Black spots within these areas. As I say, this accords with the 1936 Act, but it also accords with the policy of the National Party, and that is to consolidate these homelands as quickly as possible. The National Party wants to draw the boundaries of these homelands so that everyone knows exactly where the homelands&#x2019; boundaries are. We also want to settle matters in respect of the quota land, which was promised in terms of the 1936 legislation, as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>All those people involved in the matter. After we later pointed these aspects out to them nicely, those people conceded that they had not been properly informed by their superior bodies in connection with this matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke here about the White areas; but he tore a page from our book. We came along with the proposal&#x2014;at a later stage there was, accordingly, another proposal&#x2014;that these Peddie <span class="col_8025-8026" refersTo="page_0967"/>and Hamburg White areas be cut out of this report. We shall come with law amendments at a later stage to provide that the purchase of Peddie and Hamburg, which are excluded White areas, will take place at a later stage on a piecemeal basis by means of zoning. That is going to be done at a later stage. Those people were also told about that.</p>

<p>The hon. member also speaks here of the question of compensation, and makes a great story out of it. The hon. member surely knows that when a released area such as this is being considered, it is no time to be speaking about compensation. After all, he knows what the provisions of the Act are. The areas must first appear on the schedule of the 1936 Act. As soon as that happens it is a released area, and then we can start negotiations to purchase some of those areas for these various purposes, as I have just explained to him. Then the question of compensation arises.</p>

<p>Sir, I just want to say that we are grateful we have come this far with the implementation of the policy of separate development and the creation of homelands for the Bantu in South Africa. I want to tell the hon. member that what we are now doing here is nothing new in South Africa. I have already said here on previous occasions, and also on other occasions, that what we are doing here also tallies with what was said to the world as far back as 55 years ago. As the policy of the National Party it ran through everything like a golden thread. On 22nd May, 1917, this same idea, which is beginning to bear fruit here this evening, was expressed by Gen. Smuts in the Savoy Hotel in London. The hon. members know it. Just to refresh their memories again I want to quote it for them. I say that we stick to that, and we hope this United Party will take notice of that. What did Gen. Smuts say on that occasion? He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Instead of mixing up Black and White in the old haphazard way which instead of lifting up the Black, degraded the White.

<p>In other words, these lands must to a certain extent be withdrawn from production. This is a drastic step if we consider that 30 per cent of the exports of this country consists of agricultural produce, in spite of the fact that agricultural is the stepchild of this Government. It is a drastic step if we consider that at the end of the century there will be 52 million people here who will have to be fed from this land, from this soil. I am asking whether, in view of this, it is in the interests of South Africa, whether it is in the interests of Whites, Coloureds, and Blacks to withdraw these lands suddenly from production. What reasons have been advanced as to why this step has to be taken? We heard the speech made by the hon. member for Langlaagte. He said that a promise had been made by Gen. Hertzog. Firstly he said that it was necessary to take this step because there has to be consolidation. But this measure is not resulting in consolidation.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>How far is it from Glen Grey? A hundred miles! Surely this is not a consolidation into one piece. It is true that a few black spots are being eliminated. The hon. member for Langlaagte said that Wartburg&#x2014; this is an area of 2 800 morgen&#x2014;and Ungwali&#x2014;an area of 4 800 morgen&#x2014;should be exchanged for Frankfort and Braunschweig. Braunschweig and Frankfort are 18 400 morgen in extent, however, but the hon. member maintains that 4 800 morgen should be exchange land for it. Surely that is not exchange land. In any case, five years ago when Keiskammahoek was declared to be Black, the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development said that it was exchange land for Ungwali and Wartburg. He said that we should give him two years and he would eliminate all the black spots. Now the hon. members are saying, however, that they want exchange land again. The hon. members create the impression that they want to exchange black spots for white spots. The black spots which are being exchanged here are 59 000 ha in extent, but 184 000 ha of what is white land, is being taken. The remainder is therefore the quota land.</p>

<p>The hon. member then made his second point, which is that we are supposedly breaking the promise which was made in 1936. What promise was made in 1936? The most important promise made in 1936, when the Bantu voters were removed from <span class="col_8029-8030" refersTo="page_0969"/>the common voters&#x2019; roll, was that they would have three White representatives.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>What has become of them? It was, according to that side, the dead hand of the past; they then abolished the representation in 1959, as they also broke all promises to the Coloureds and to every other non-White sector of the population. But now the hon. member talks about we who are breaking promises. The hon. member quoted Gen. Hertzog. I can quote Adv. Strijdom. This is what Adv. Strijdom said in regard to that Act (Hansard, 1936, col. 2753)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">So far as the segregation principle lies at the root of it, the European population will be pleased that those 7 250 000 morgen of land is being made available for the Natives. But if it is merely intended as a bait in order to get their consent to certain steps that have been taken, then I feel convinced that it will certainly not be a sound step.</block>

<p>In other words, he did not accept it as a promise.</p>

<block name="quote">But surely, hon. members will all agree with me that this Bill is mainly required for the purpose of sending the Natives whom we do not want to have in the towns to other areas. That surely is the object of this Bill? We want to remove the thousands of Natives that we have in towns like Johannesburg, Pretoria and Cape Town today and we have to give them land where they can go to.</block>

<p>That was the basis of the legislation. It was not a <i>quid pro quo</i> for the removal of their franchise; that was not the intention. The land was given in order to get the Natives out of the cities, but the Natives are not out of the cities; they are still there.</p>

<p>Sir, at its best the 1936 legislation was a declaration of an intent to purchase. That is what it was, nothing more and nothing less, and one Government cannot commit any subsequent Government. That is how the people saw the situation in 1936. In the light of the circumstances of 1936 it was perhaps a good thing to purchase the land in the hope that they could get the Natives out of the cities, but anyone who in the light of the circumstances of 1972 thinks, in view of the population explosion, that it is in the interests of Whites, Coloureds and Blacks in South Africa that these lands should be withdrawn from production, does not know what he is talking about. The future of South Africa lies in industrial development. The future of the Natives, as industrial workers, lies in industrial development. Their future does not lie in eking out a hand-to-mouth existence on an uneconomic farming unit. Sir, this same Government wants to remove 30 000 White farmers from the rural areas because farming is not economic today.</p>

<p>Sir, the future of the Native does not lie in a starvation wage farming system; it lies in industrial development in South Africa, and if we want to do justice to Whites and non-Whites in South Africa, and if we want to provide for 52 million people in South Africa at the end of this century, then we have to develop South Africa as quickly as we possibly can. We must develop South Africa within the reserves; we must develop it in <span class="col_8031-8032" refersTo="page_0970"/>the metropolitan areas; we must develop it at every possible growth point. We shall have to develop it around Sishen; we shall have to develop it along the Orange River; we shall have to develop it in my own constituency, and in every possible way; and to be able to develop South Africa, we need Natives, and if we need Natives for that, we shall need land for that, far more than this little piece of land which is under discussion here at the moment. We shall purchase much more land than this, but we shall purchase it where it is in the interest of the economy of South Africa, where it is in the intests of Whites, Coloureds and Blacks. We shall have to provide the Natives with land around the cities; we shall have to give them freehold title; we shall have to refrain from begrudging them a family life so as to create in this way an established middle class. That is how we see South Africa, Sir, If we purchase this land now, where are we going to find land in future?

If one wants to implement such a plan as this, then one must at least consult the people whom one wants to throw off their land.

<p>Sir, let me take my own constituency. Mr. Gert Henning gave evidence there. Circulars were sent out and 126 replies were received; 84 rejected the proposal, one was prepared to sell after six years; nine were prepared to accept the proposal on certain conditions, and 22 were prepared to sell. Seventy per cent were opposed to it. From Frankfort a petition was sent to members of the Commission, a petition which was signed by 81 people who unanimously asked that the proposal be rejected. Did hon. members on that side pay any attention to this? From Braunschweig a petition signed by 62 persons was sent in. Did hon. members on that side pay any attention to that? In Stutterheim a meeting was held which was attended by 75 to 80 people, and they decided unanimously against it. Surely the hon. member for Langlaagte must have realized, after that meeting, that the people were unanimously opposed to the proposal. What kind of consultation is this, if one pays no attention to what people think? Sir, how are these people being treated further? They have not been told what they are going to receive for their lands. If a person comes to me today and tells me he wants to buy my land, the first thing I will ask him is: &#x201C;What are you prepared to pay for it?&#x201D; If he does not tell you, you cannot negotiate. In the second place, these people are being told that their land will be purchased in 15 years&#x2019; time, because the Government does not have the money at the moment. If a man wants to buy land from me and he tells me that he does not have money with which to pay for it at the moment, I shall immediately tell him he must first find the money. After all, one cannot let these people sit there for 15 years. Sir, there are farmers on that side, although I do not see them here this evening. The hon. the Deputy Minister is a farmer. He knows in what an uncertain position a farmer finds himself if he has to sit on a piece of land for 15 years without being able to make any improvements. He must sit there and pine away for 15 years and then he must start farming again from scratch somewhere else. After all, these are not all old people; there are among them young, energetic farmers who want to carry on with their farming operations. It is the aim of any farmer to do something constructive. Now they must sit there and pine away for 15 years; they must sit there waiting to hear whether or not the Government will buy in 15 years&#x2019; time, and they are unable to make any improvements. Is this what you do to people? And what about the victims of that area, the farmers from Braunschweig and Frankfort? These are small farmers, but farmers who are making a good living and who are making a contribution to South Africa&#x2019;s production. They must be thrown off their land there, and they only have small pieces of land. The money which will be paid out to them will not even be enough to buy a house in King William&#x2019;s Town. They are being deprived of their livelihood. This same 1936 Act provides that a Bantu cannot be moved unless he is given land of equal value to that of which he is being deprived. But what about these people? They must simply be thrown off their farms, and the Government does not care what becomes of them. What does this plan look like? Look at map F; see how it affects Frankfort, Braunschweig and Stutterheim, and also parts of King William&#x2019;s Town. It is a Black pincer around the whole of King William&#x2019;s Town. King William&#x2019;s Town is a small White peninsula in a Black sea; it is surrounded by a Black area which will, like an octopus, send its tentacles into MacLeantown and Kei Road, where those people have to farm, and that after that hon. the Minister, when he wanted to win an election in King William&#x2019;s Town, <span class="col_8035-8036" refersTo="page_0972"/>when he came there with that hand-picked candidate of his, said that &#x201C;King William&#x2019;s Town will not be engulfed&#x201D;. But what has he done now? That candidate went about telling the people of Frankfort: &#x201C;Miles Warren is merely spreading lies; Frankfort will not become Black&#x201D;. What happened to that promise? And then that hon. Minister talks about promises.</p>

<p>The Minister must please take a look at the map. Look at Frankfort. Surely it makes no sense [Interjections.] There is no natural boundary. The tarred road would at least have been a natural boundary, but this point thrusts across it. Sir, surely you know that the farmers adjoining that area will not be able to farm there. You know that if such an area as that is declared Black the adjoining farms also go out of production. That was why there were farmers who said: &#x201C;Then take the whole lot, for we cannot farm on adjoining land&#x201D;. And what does that area look like?

Sir, have you considered where King William&#x2019;s Town is situated? It is being cut off; its road-link with Stutterheim is being cut off by a Black area, not that I have anything against a Black area, but you have promised them independence. All the power-lines will pass through a foreign area. All the telephone poles to King William&#x2019;s Town will run through a foreign country, but it has been cut off. And have you ever given any thought to those farmers of Stutterheim, Frankfort and Braunschweig? That was the larder of the entire Eastern Province. It was the one area in South Africa where the cost of living was still reasonably cheap, but now that entire area is being withdrawn from production. Have you ever thought what that will do to the cost of living? It is a border area where you want to encourage border industries, but it is being wrenched out there. All these points were stated before that commission. Did the hon. member pay any attention to them?</p>

Must they now be thrown out because they are a minority group, because it is an English-speaking part of South Africa and because the Germans in South Africa are a minority group? Sir, in 1965 they were thrown out of Potsdam by this Government on the same pretext; they were thrown out of Nxessa, they were thrown out of Dimbasa, and they were thrown out of Keiskammahoek, five years ago, and then they were told that they would be safe in Frankfort and Braunschweig, and now they are being thrown out there as well.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town, who has just sat down, not only became dramatic, but sentimental as well. We are dealing with very serious matters here. They do not concern the future of the King William&#x2019;s Town constituency; the concern the future of South Africa. They concern not only the future of White South Africa, but also that of the Black man in the Ciskei and in South Africa.</p>

<p>Therefore the hon. member will excuse me if, to a certain extent, I do not follow him up. Since I am a member of the Bantu Affairs Commission of the Cape Province, I think that on this particular occasion, an historic one, as my hon. chairman put it, it would be proper for me just to thank my fellow-members of the commission for the sympathetic and commendable way in which they have approached this matter and are carrying it through. It has indeed been a pleasure and a privilege to work together with them in carrying through this great, difficult task to the stage we have reached now.</p>

<p>It is not an easy task for me as a farmer to speak here this evening. It is not an easy task for me as a farmer to recommend that people who have been on certain land for generations&#x2014;more than hundred years&#x2014;should leave their land. It is true that this is historic land, but I just want to say to the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town that the boundary lines there have been fixed for the past 220 years. Those boundary lines were determined by Ryk Tulbagh and his 37 burghers 220 years ago. And for most of the time during those 220 years, the major proportion of that area belonged to Bantu and not to Whites. The land we want to give them this evening, is not being taken away from anyone. <span class="col_8039-8040" refersTo="page_0974"/>The Whites moved in there, and we want to consolidate that land. To me the crux of this matter is concerned with the second point in the memorandum. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Trust intends to acquire land in the areas defined in the Schedule hereto. The extent of the land proposed for acquisition is approximately 185 380 hectares. The land involved will extend the area of the Ciskeian Legislative Assembly and, at the same time, consolidate certain portions of it. It is also the intention to provide for further consolidation by using portion of the land as compensatory land for various, small, isolated Bantu areas, totalling 59 100 hectares approximately, which should be excised because they cannot feasibly be incorporated with other Bantu areas. The excision of the Bantu areas mentioned will be given due attention when the necessary surveys and valuations have been made. The situation of the Bantu areas which it is proposed to excise is shown on the accompanying sketch map.</block>

<p>I have the map here. On this map hon. members can see how piebald the district of East London is. The district of East London, the corridor to the north, is full of Black spots. What we are going to do here, is to eliminate those black spots and consolidate them with the greater Ciskei.</p>

<p>The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town asked how we could consolidate various Black areas. That is correct; there are many Black areas, I think there are 29 or more than 30, but when we have completed the Black areas, only four will be left. Now I want to ask the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town into how many islands Greece is divided. What does it matter to Greece? Greece has the sea in between, while we are merely going to have White corridors between the Black areas in terms of the consolidation we are going to do there. The point is this: Since we are going to effect consolidation in that area, this is the penultimate border definition which is going to be made. As I have already mentioned, the first one took place 220 years ago. The first war between Whites and Bantu in South Africa took place in 1779, almost 200 years ago. Just as Gen. Smuts wrote in <i>&#x201C;Eeu van Onreg&#x201D;,</i> we may also say that 200 years of injustice has prevailed on the border in the Eastern Cape, this historic land we are consolidating at the moment. This border definition was accompanied by various other matters. Stock thefts on the border were the order of the day. Bantu came over the border and stole the Whites&#x2019; livestock. Wherever they went, the Bantu carried out livestock thefts on a large scale. Political incitement on the part of Dr. Phillips, Dr. Van der Kemp, Lord Glenelg and Captain Stockenstrom created major problems on the border. That is why we have to considate now. This is the penultimate border we have to define. We shall define the last border soon. Recently the hon. the Minister announced that this border would be defined before long.</p>

<p>I want to state clearly this evening that we Whites are not colonialists in Africa. We as Whites are of Africa and because we are of Africa and have not only had contact with the Black man in Africa over the past 220 years, but have also exercised Christian guardianship over them, Christian guardianship in the true sense of the word, no finger may be pointed at us. We did not launch machine-gun attacks on the Black man of Africa, nor did we leave poisoned food for them so as to eliminate them. We have cared for the Black man of Africa and are honest and sincere towards them. That is why I say we are of Africa. Because we are of Africa, we are perhaps better able than any other country in the world not only to meet the problems of South Africa, but also to solve them. We are trying to tackle the problems and solve them in this way.</p>

<p>These are major problems which cannot be passed over lightly. These are not matters which may be exploited in a sentimental way. The Whites of South Africa last trekked in 1838. South Africa is fully occupied, and we shall not be able to trek again, because where would we trek to? We must <span class="col_8041-8042" refersTo="page_0975"/>create a home for ourselves now, not merely a temporary one, but one for the years to come. The borders of that home must be defined in such a way that it would create satisfaction for White South Africa as well as for Black South Africa.</p>

<p>This evening I heard from two hon. speakers on the opposite side&#x2014;unfortunately they are not in the House at the moment &#x2014;that they do not want to implement the 1936 Act. They do not want to implement the 1936 Act and they say that that is the maximum land which should have been purchased. They say that because of the many Bantu already working in the White area, it will no longer be necessary to implement the provisions of the 1936 Act. This is a charge against the United Party, and they want to commit a breach of faith against the Black man in South Africa. They lay it at our door that the Black man has only 13 per cent of the land in South Africa, but now they do not even want to implement the 1936 Act. Are they consistent in their policy? Are they aware of what they want to do? With other Whites one may still try to justify one&#x2019;s case and break one&#x2019;s promise, but we may not and cannot break our promise to the Black man of South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to comment on what the hon. member for Aliwal said, except to say that it amazes me listening to the hon. member going back into the history of the Eastern Cape and championing certain leading figures in their capacities as Governors of those times and mentioning men like Lord Glenelg. Oh yes, he mentioned all these gentlemen, but let me remind him&#x2014;possibly he does not know&#x2014; that Lord Glenelg was one of the most liberal minded people to live in Great Britain at that time. He was a liberal and very much so. I do not think the hon. member knows it. Lord Glenelg was the governor of the British colonies in the Cape. He was the man who first came with the idea of the Transkei and the Ciskei. He was the man who said: The land beyond the Kei will be known as the Transkei and the land between the Great Kei and the Great Fish rivers will be known as the Ciskei and, which was to be no man&#x2019;s land. This is the liberal whom the hon. member for Aliwal quoted here tonight. For years and years we have been hearing talk about consolidation of white owned land in the Eastern Cape. Yet, even now we have had no clarity from the Government or any Government speaker on the consolidation of land in the Eastern Cape. I have listened to three hon. members on that side of the House tonight including, the hon. member for Langlaagte. Three of us on this side of the House attended that notorious meeting at King William&#x2019;s Town on the 6th January. Having listened to the hon. member for Langlaagte one would never say that it was the same person speaking, who again spoke here tonight. I will tell the House why.</p>

Let me tell this House there were no &#x201C;samesprekings&#x201D; at all that day. Every time the farmers wanted to hold &#x201C;samesprekings&#x201D; with the three hon. members serving on the commission, they were told &#x201C;No, we are not here to discuss the issue with you. We are here to take evidence.&#x201D; Is that not so?</p>

<p>I will go back and tell this to those farmers. The commission was not prepared to discuss the issue. The chairman said that they were there to take evidence. The hon. member for Langlaagte repeatedly reminded the meeting of this. I am sorry that the hon. members for Transkei and King William&#x2019;s Town are not here at the moment, as they too heard what he said. They said they were only there in their capacity as a commission investigating the consolidation of land and not to discuss the matter. In fact, only upon two occasions, after many questions were put to the three hon. gentlemen, did they venture to answer questions. In fact they answered only two questions. The King William&#x2019;s Town meeting did not last half a day, it lasted all day. I may mention that this was a meeting of somewhat hostile Eastern Cape farmers representing many Farmers Associations, all Local Governments, and all groups, English, Afrikaans and German. They were angry.</p>

<p>Oh yes. They had every reason to be hostile. The hon. member for Langlaagte said they had ample warning of the meeting and that they were well prepared. Every farmer who gave evidence (not to hold &#x201C;samesprekings&#x201D;, because they could only give evidence), made mention of the fact that he was unprepared for discussions or even to give evidence. Some farmers had to return from holiday to be at that meeting on the 6th January. Every time they put a question to the hon. member for Langlaagte about whether their farms were in fact in or outside the released area under consideration, the hon. member for Langlaagte gave no answer. He said: &#x201C;Nee, ek weet nie. Julie moet dit later met die departement bespreek.&#x201D; He would only answer two questions all day. There was a huge map displayed at the meeting but no one went away from that meeting satisfied with what they learnt from the map. No one went away knowing whether his property was in fact in the released area or not. The hon. chairman of the commission went further. I want to remind him how he misled people at that meeting. The hon. member for Langlaagte was speaking in terms of morgen on that occasion and not hectares. He mentioned, as we all know, that 7 250 000 morgen of land had to be bought under the 1936 Land and Trust Act. This he mentioned and he went further and said that the Government still had to purchase 477 000 morgen in the Cape Province. He led the meeting to believe that these figures were the minimum land that had to be purchase under the Act.</p>

<p>I am surprised that the hon. members on that side never mentioned the wishes of the Eastern Agricultural Union as expressed in a memorandum on the 6th January in King William&#x2019;s Town. The commission has never taken this into consideration at all. I believe that the Eastern Agricultural Union was very reasonable in expressing its wishes and views by saying what it desires in that <span class="col_8045-8046" refersTo="page_0977"/>area. Here are five points. The Eastern Agricultural Union mentioned. First of all it asked that all Black spots be removed. This has been put to the Government for many, many years, as hon. members and the hon. Minister know. It is the desire of agriculture in that area to remove all Black spots. In return for those Black spots, they, the farmers through their strong Union unanimously decided that they were prepared to hand over to the Government the rich farming area of Guba in the Indwe district and the whole area of Peddie down to the sea. But this committee has ignored that request; they have taken no notice of the wishes of the farmers of Guba in the Indwe district.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>Now I want to refer to another important point which I mentioned in this House the other day, and that is the planning of this particular released land and how the Government intends organizing agriculture in these areas. Sir, this land is not only amongst the best land in South Africa, it is the best land in South Africa; it is very highly productive agricultural land. I refer to Whittlesea, Braunschweig, Peddie down to the sea, in fact the whole of the border. When one goes to agricultural shows on the Witwatersrand, you see that some of the best stock comes from the Eastern Cape. The farmers in these areas are well established, they have built up their farms over generations. They spent a lot of money there, and a lot of Government money has been spent there, as well, in developing this land. Soil conservation is being done strictly according to farm planning. I asked the hon. the Minister the other day whether he had taken into consideration the question of training Bantu to take over all this land; We must remember, Sir, that when the Bantu take over this land, each Bantu farmer will not be allotted more than five to 10 morgen of land. Whereas today one farmer has hundreds and in some cases, thousands of morgen on which to make a living, the Bantu has to make a living on five to 10 morgen, and it is therefore more important that the Bantu should be well trained before they are allowed to take over this land. I ask the hon. the Minister the other day what he had done in regard to the training of Bantu to take over this land, a take-over which the Government appears to be in such a hurry to bring about, and I quote his reply from Hansard of 10th May, 1972, Col. 6954&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have quite a number of Bantu agricultural schools in South Africa at which more than 380 Bantu students have been enrolled as agricultural students at this moment. These are purely agricultural schools. Then, of course, we also have the agricultural courses offered in the system of school education. Furthermore, we have a faculty of agriculture at Fort Hare, where a number of agricultural students have been enrolled.</block>

<p>He did not mention how many&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Then I want to tell the hon. member (for East London North) that at the moment as many as 849 Bantu persons are employed as agricultural extension officers in the service of the agricultural industry in the Bantu homelands.</block>

<p>Then he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It stands to reason that these numbers must still be increased. Rome was not built in a day.</block>

<p><span class="col_8049-8050" refersTo="page_0979"/>Sir, I do not think this Government realizes or appreciates what it means to farm successfully today in South Africa. It is a highly scientific profession. If a farmer wants to make a success, and get maximum productivity from the land on which he farms, and if he is to be worthy of this precious soil, then he must be educated and trained to the full. The hon. the Minister replied to my question in a vague way and then reminded me that Rome was not built in a day. He mentioned the few hundred Bantu who have been or are being trained in agriculture&#x2014;a few hundred, Sir, when there are 14 million Bantu living within the borders of South Africa. Surely this is something which the Government should have contemplated doing years and years ago before they considered the question of consolidation. Surely it would have been reasonable to have come to this House and asked us to vote R5 million, R10 million or even R15 million to train the Bantu, so that when they take over this land they will be able to farm the land successfully. No, Sir, nothing has been done, but they expect a responsible Opposition such as we are to support a crazy suggestion of this kind. Another matter which concerns the Eastern Province is this: Those farmers who are established there and who have to leave the land have not only developed those farms but they have on those properties today highly pedigreed stock, stock bred up over many years. Sir, we who know something about stock-breading realize that you cannot buy High grade stock readily. It has to be bred up along blood strains over many, many years. Those farmers have asked me and the hon. members on that side of the House, particularly the chairman of the Select Committee, the hon. member for Langlaagte, that when they leave this land, where must they go. Where can they go? Has any provision been made for their stock?</p>

<p>They came to him in King William&#x2019;s Town on their knees and asked the Commission to buy their land. The president of the Eastern Agricultural Union gave it his support and the hon. member knows it. Now, all of a sudden, he is very sympathetic towards the Guba farmers.&#x2014;Ten to 15 years have been mentioned as the period which will elapse before people can expect to sell the released land. Any economist, any businessman realizes that if a person has to live in uncertainty for ten to 15 years, such a person cannot expect his security to remain strong. The commercial banks are not interested in people who have no security or can only offer temporary security, yes, for an interim period. I wrote to the hon. the Minister the other day&#x2014;this is just one case&#x2014;about a farmer who happens to be a widow, living in the Bolotwa area. She wanted to know when her farm would be taken over by the Government for Bantu occupation or whether the farm was indeed demarcated in a released area. I received the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s reply while we were discussing this very important matter. I quote the last two paragraphs of the letter&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is difficult to give an indication how long the actual acquisition will take and it is suggested that the owner carry on with her farming activities and planning in a normal way.</block>

<block name="quote">A copy of the description of the Bolotwa area is attached for your information. <span class="col_8051-8052" refersTo="page_0980"/>In fact, it was never attached, not for my information either. I wonder whether there was ever a copy available?</block>

<p>There is far too much doubt in everybody&#x2019;s mind as to what is happening in the Eastern Cape. As the hon. member for Transkei rightly said, this is not the end of the story. This is only an interim period. We can expect that later on more land will be bought up.</p>

<p>Exactly, and this is how insecure the Eastern Cape farmers feel. The hon. member obviously did not listen when I read the request made to the Committee by the Eastern Agricultural union, that these properties be not bought piecemeal&#x2014;it must either be all or nothing in their particular areas. The hon. member was not listening.</p>

<p>The last point I want to mention is also very important, an important matter which involves the chairman of the Select Committee again. At King William&#x2019;s Town a lady got up and asked him what security the State would be providing for them in the Kidds Beach area. We have seen, in the latest newspapers, what has happened at Kidds Beach recently. This is happening too frequently. When we hear of the hijacking of an aircraft, it is even announced in the House, but when people are assaulted in the Kidds Beach area, then there is no announcement made in this House. You have only to look at the map to see how serious the position is there. When a lady approached the hon. member for Langlaagte that day in King William&#x2019;s Town and asked what security he and the State would provide for them, his answer was: &#x201C;Refer this matter to the Police&#x201D;. He said it is not his job to provide security and protection for the people. Those were his very words.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we are dealing with a motion that is aimed at the consolidation of a Bantu homeland, the Ciskei. This measure, at present before the House, forms the basis of the whole policy of this side of the House in its relations politics, i.e. the consolidation of homelands; that of the Bantu homelands, but when the Bantu homelands are consolidated, the White man&#x2019;s homeland is also consolidated in the Repubic of South Africa because we are a multi-national country. That is why it is a profoundly serious matter as far as we are concerned, and not a joke as that hon. member apparently regards it to be. It is a profoundly serious matter as far as we are concerned, because in this lies our guarantee as far as the identity of the Whites of South Africa is concerned, the identity of the Xhosa in South Africa, and the identity of each population group in South Africa.</p>

That is how he stated it at King Williams&#x2019;s Town on 4th January. If that hon. member now wants to be honest he would agree with me that the chairman of the Bantu Affairs Commission stated the standpoint of this Government without beating about the bush and I agree with him wholeheartedly. The meeting, which we are now reporting on, was a big meeting, and a very well-attended meeting. He stated the case here this evening as he did on 4th January in the town hall at King William&#x2019;s Town. He stated the 1936 Act very clearly. He said more than that. He had the courage of his convictions to tell those present that it was not the last time that we might be coming to King William&#x2019;s Town, and that it was not the last time that we might be coming to the Eastern Cape, because this Government intends to carry out the undertaking the White man gave in 1936.</p>

<p>It makes no difference to me how long it takes. We are dealing with a task and a mandate entrusted to us, i.e. the consolidation, at this moment, of the Ciskei. That is why we went there after notice had been given to all the interested bodies to be present to debate this matter. We can give various interpretations to discussions or non-discussions. The commission went there, and there was a town hall full of people and the hon. member for East London North was there. We held discussions and heard evidence. We answered questions and gave people every opportunity to ask questions. Am I right or wrong? There were people who had very strong objections about the land that was under discussion. That is quite correct. Organized agriculture objected strongly in respect of certain land which was under discussion there. That is quite correct. That is true. However, I want to tell the House something else, and the time has now come for this to be revealed. After the chairman or secretary of organized agriculture has stood up and spoken&#x2014;I am not trying to be personal now; we have a high regard for the people who represent that organization&#x2014;we drink tea. Do hon. members know what happens then? Then the individual farmers come to us and say they hope their farms are bought up, because they cannot make a living there. They then come along to us individually and ask us to have their farms purchased. However, they do not want to embarrass their organization. That is what happens, if I now must reveal what takes place at such meetings. This evidence was led. However, my colleagues on the other side will also acknowledge that people also stood up and gave evidence in public asking that they should be bought up because, under such circumstances, they &#x2026;</p>

That hon. member created a great deal of embarrassment for his party. I watched the hon. member for Transk&#x00E9;i and the hon. member for Yeoville. How that hon. member is going to get out of this I do not know, because he created a great deal of embarrassment for his party, and we shall keep him to those Words of his.

<p>Mr. Speaker, the Opposition speakers reproach us, in season and out of season, for only wanting to give 13 per cent of South African soil to the Black man.

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Wolmaransstad told us early in his speech that this legislation was the basis of the Government&#x2019;s entire policy. He very piously told us with what &#x201C;diepgaande erns&#x201D; they regarded this entire matter. Yet, when my colleague, the hon. member for East London North, was talking, who regarded the very serious issues of &#x201C;diepgaande erns&#x201D; as being laughable? Who was splitting his sides? Who was trying to make a mockery of this House? It was that hon. Minister sitting in the front bench.</p>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! The hon. member must withdraw that allegation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oliver">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>I withdraw it, Sir, The hon. member for Wolmaransstad said that it was no easy or pleasant task to go into the Eastern Cape to talk to the people there who were due to be affected by what we have before the House this evening. He said that he agreed one hundred per cent with what the hon. member for Langlaagte had said. I want to ask him a question: He spoke to us about the good audience he had. Did his audience agree 100 per cent with what they were told? Did they?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>I listened to what that hon. member had to say. Of course they did not, and he knows it as well as I do. He also said that it would probably not be the last time that the hon. member for Langlaagte would be going to the Eastern Cape and to King William&#x2019;s Town in particular.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>Right, the hon. member said that he made the announcement there. I want to ask the hon. member for Langlaagte, that is if I can just get his attention and if he just takes his hand away from his forehead for one moment, across the floor of this House whether he is prepared to go back to King William&#x2019;s Town to meet that same audience and to tell that audience everything he told this House tonight? Is he?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>We shall hold him to that. I warn him here and now and I hope that the hon. member for Wolmaransstad also will commit him to this. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Wolmaransstad told us quite a lot, i.e. he gave us his version of what went on at this meeting. He said that the people, the delegates and the representatives who came to meet them, were allowed to give evidence, to put questions &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>No, nor were you; so just keep quiet. [Interjections.] I was not there, but I am putting questions to that hon. member now. I was not there, but perhaps we should try to establish exactly what went on. The best way of doing this is by prodding the hon. members a little bit.</p>

<speech by="#oliver">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>Hon. members see that it is common cause, and we need not argue about it, that evidence was called for and that it was in fact given by the leaders of the various groups, the farmers&#x2019; associations and the other associations who were represented there. I do not know what has happened to the hon. member for Wolmaransstad now.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>He has walked out.</p>

<speech by="#oliver">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>Has he left? Oh, I am sorry. Anyway, the hon. member for Langlaagte remains: I hope he stays with us because perhaps he can tell us what went on. The leaders of these groups <span class="col_8059-8060" refersTo="page_0984"/>apparently were called upon to give evidence. The one thing that each person who gave evidence was asked to say, was whether he and the people he represented were prepared to sell their farms. Perhaps the hon. member for Langlaagte could just nod at this stage and tell us whether this was so. Well, he is not nodding; so we will assume that it was. I am afraid I have to do this, because he has already spoken. He cannot get up and speak again. I am trying to put these questions in very simple terms, so that he can nod or shake his head. According to my information&#x2014; this I believe is common cause&#x2014;the people who were called upon to give evidence were asked whether they were prepared to sell their farms. Perhaps I could ask him again, Sir, Is this so?</p>

<speech by="#oliver">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>Its a simple thing, but he cannot say. According to my information&#x2014;the hon. member for Langlaagte is thoroughly unhelpful, obviously; I do not know what his motives could be&#x2014; the people, upon being asked whether they wanted to sell their farms, then asked whether their farms were in released areas or not. Perhaps he would tell us whether this question was put to him in turn. He shakes his head. Does he say that the question was not put to him?</p>

<speech by="#oliver">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>Now, Sir, I am surprised that that hon. member is so coy about what we are asking. After all, he was running the show. Can he not tell us simple facts like this? He did not tell us in his speech. According to what I am told, when these people in turn asked whether their farms were in the released areas or not, what did the hon. member for Langlaagte say? He said: &#x201C;I cannot tell you. You will have to go to the department to find out.&#x201D;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Transkei, who was there, said it is right; but the hon. member for Langlaagte, who was supposed to be running this inquiry, does not seem to know. Was he not listening? Did he not keep minutes? No, Sir, this is not good enough. These people are trifling with the interests of the people of the Eastern Cape. What is more, they are proving it here tonight. Now, Sir, let us go a little further. In view of the silence of that hon. member in the back bench there, who holds such a senior position, let me say this House can accept that everything that I put to him did happen.</p>

<p>Yes, Q.E.D., as the hon. schoolmaster opposite says.</p>

<p>Just to test the situation a little further, I want to ask &#x0026;lt;u&#x0026;gt;h&#x0026;lt;/u&#x0026;gt;im&#x2014;the questions seem to be purely rhetorical, because he is very silent&#x2014;whether the people who were being questioned by him, then in turn asked him, before they were asked whether they wanted to sell those farms, why they were not warned that that hon. member did not know whether their farms were in released areas. Why were they not warned of this, so that they could go to the department and find our before they were being asked to give &#x201C;Yes&#x201D; or &#x201C;No&#x201D; answers?</p>
