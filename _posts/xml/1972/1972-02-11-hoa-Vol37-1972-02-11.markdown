<p>Clause 2:</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>I do not know whether the hon. the Deputy Minister wishes to move his amendments first. They stand first on the Order Paper, but in the absence of his rising I would like to move the amendment standing in the name of the hon. member for Transkei, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In lines 19 and 20, page 7, to omit &#x201C;two rand and fifty cents&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;one rand&#x201D;.</block>

<p>In this amendment we seek to reduce the amount, which has been called a tax or a contribution in this debate, from the sum of R2,50 to R1. It is in fact a tax on the use of Bantu labour. No case has been made out for the tax to be so high as R2,50. If an amount larger than R1 is needed, the hon. the Deputy Minister has certainly not taken this House into his confidence about it, and I propose to substantiate that R1 is more than sufficient for the needs which are required under these measures. It is a thoroughly bad principle that Parliament should give powers to tax for more than is shown to be needed. This is a principle which is adhered to by the hon. the Minister of Finance and by the hon. the Minister of Transport and others. It is thoroughly unsatisfactory to give what is virtually a blank cheque to raise taxation at will to a Minister.</p>

<p>This tax is said to consolidate three out of the five imposts that arise in connection with the use of Bantu labour. It leaves of course two which are not yet consolidated for various reasons, the licence fees payable and the transport fees. Now, it is said to consolidate the following three, namely the labour bureau once-and-for-all fee of 25 cents, the registration fee of 20 cents per month and the services levy fee of 20 cents per week, or about 85 cents per month. The monthly amounts, therefore, total R1,05. The important thing that the House must bear in mind is that on the basis of these monthly amounts of R1,05, enormous surpluses have been built up. There are R26 million in the Services Levy Fund alone. There are R5 million to R6 million already as a surplus in the account of the Johannesburg Services Levy Fund. There are clearly very big sums already in surplus in the other areas. It is therefore clear that the existing amount of R1,05 is far more than is needed and, naturally, we therefore need to be persuaded that it should be increased still further.</p>

<p>This was so even when money was still needed for the provision of these basic services, but what is the position today&#x003F; It is quite clear that in many areas these basic services have been provided and there is no longer any need for funds to provide such services. Let us read the words of the hon. the Deputy Minister in this regard, because it was from his own mouth that we know that the services for which this money is mainly asked have been provided and are no longer needed. This is what he said in his reply to the Second Reading debate&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_815-816" refersTo="page_0424"/>Die Wet bepaal dat hierdie fondse aangewend kan word slegs vir basiese dienste.</block>

<p>He was speaking of the services levy&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dit is waarom die opgehoopte surplusse daar is.</block>

<p>Then he went on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Maar in baie van hierdie Bantoegebiede is daar nie meer &#x2019;n behoefte aan basiese dienste nie.</block>

<p>That is what he said.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>In many of these Bantu areas the basic services have been provided and it automatically follows that no further levy is needed to provide these services in all those areas. I say that, apart from the fact that there are surpluses which can be used. If, in fact, it is found that certain additional services are needed, for example in Johannesburg, it is crystal clear, to take but one example, that as far as Johannesburg is concerned, if no employer were subject to this services levy, there would be more than enough money in this fund for several years; the surplus is there to enable all possible future services to be provided. So, what is the position&#x003F; The position therefore is that we no longer need these amounts totalling 85 cents per month which is the overwhelming part of the R1,05 which is at present being taken. Consequently it is quite clear that 20 cents per month would cover all that in respect of which the hon. the Deputy Minister has made a case to this committee. I say, therefore, 20 cents per month is approximately all the hon. the Deputy Minister has made a case for to this committee.</p>

<p>We are prepared to raise that ceiling right to the sum of R1, which is, I consider, an extremely liberal attitude, perhaps far too generous. But to go beyond that and fix it at the sum of R2,50 is to us absolutely inexplicable and unacceptable.</p>

<p>It is true that the hon. the Deputy Minister said that there was R6 million which would have to be covered by these levies, which at present is coming from the general rates of certain local authorities. But if one works out the proportions, one realizes that this is more than covered by even a slight increase on the 20 cents which I mentioned was left over.</p>

<p>Let us take the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s figures. He says that approximately R15 million comes from the three existing imposts. Four-fifths of these imposts come from the services levy, namely 85 cents out of R1,05. In other words, he has been taking R12 million and he is still proposing to take R12 million per year for this services levy purpose alone. I have shown that the service levy now is in such surplus that it needs virtually no further money whatsoever. This R12 million is twice the amount that is being contributed by the urban local authorities from their general revenue account. Therefore, I submit that it is overwhelmingly established that the amount of R2,50 for which the country has been asked to give the hon. the Minister and Deputy Minister a blank cheque, is entirely unjustified.</p>

<p>Nobody can doubt that imposts of this kind add greatly to the cost of living, of articles produced in South Africa and to inflation. One would have thought that at a time like this we would exert and strain ourselves to keep these factors within bounds. Let me say that the hon. the Deputy Minister must not tell me that the Chamber of Industries, the Handelsinstituut and others are satisfied with the little bit of negotiation and the improvements he has produced. We welcome the slight change that has been produced, namely an agreement not to raise it above R1,50 except at the rate of 20 per cent and then on 12 months&#x2019; notice. The fact that these gentlemen may have been grateful for small mercies is no reason why the country should be saddled with a thoroughly bad measure and why a thoroughly bad taxation principle should be approved by this House. One knows that when a measure is practically on the Statute Book people in the position of those that came to speak to the Deputy Minister, would be grateful for some improvement, but this position, with great respect, is highly unsatisfactory from all the points of view I mentioned, and we cannot in any way give our support to it. We maintain that the amount we are giving is too far above what the hon. the Deputy Minister has shown he does need.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendment standing in my name, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To add the following proviso at the end of paragraph (a) of subsection (2):</block>

<block name="quote">Provided that no contribution shall be payable in respect of any domestic servant employed by a private householder, or any Bantu employed in agricultural operations.</block>

<p>I want to tell the hon. the Deputy Minister immediately that I expect his enthusiastic support for this amendment. As he will see, this amendment seeks to exempt housewives and farmers from the provisions of this Bill&#x2014;in other words, to avoid applying the tax to them.</p>

<p>During the Second Reading debate, the hon. the Deputy Minister made three references to the type of consultation that he had had before he decided to alter the present system of taxation or levy and to apply this new tax. I wonder if I may have his attention&#x003F; What he told us was that this was entirely in keeping with the original pledge given by Dr. Verwoerd. What were these references which he made&#x003F; It is really material to this clause.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, if that hon. member thinks that this is a laughing matter, I want to put him right here and now. This is a very serious matter, affecting every housewife and farmer in this country. If he wants to laugh about it, I suggest that he be jolly careful. It might blow up right in his face.</p>

<p>This hon. Deputy Minister made three references to consultation, and one common thread runs through them all. In each case he told us that this consultation was with representatives of industry. He said, for instance&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">So, byvoorbeeld, roep ek in herinnering dat ons in die afgelope ses maande vier keer samesprekings gehou het met die Gefedereerde Kamers van Nywerhede.</block>

<p>He makes two further references to this. I want to ask him what consultation he has had either with housewives or with organized agriculture. In his Second Reading speech he based his whole argument on the fact that consultations had taken place, because they were necessary before any moves could be made. In fact, he went so far as virtually to challenge us to show how he could have consulted more thoroughly. <span class="col_819-820" refersTo="page_0426"/>I wonder whether he could perhaps even now tell us just by nodding his head whether he has consulted with organized agriculture.</p>

<p>This is neither here nor there. The hon. the Deputy Minister based his entire argument on the fact that he had adequate consultation. I am now asking him what consultation he has had with agriculture or with anybody who has to do with domestic servants. I want to go further. When he spoke in the Second Reading debate, the Deputy Minister stressed his contention that it was perfectly in line with the original pledge given by Dr. Verwoerd that this tax would not be applied further than he originally sought it to apply. He stressed that it was perfectly in order to alter this after consultation. Let me just tell the hon. the Deputy Minister what assurance he gave this House only two days ago. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. Verwoerd het ook, terwyl hy voorsien het dat dit &#x2019;n tydelike maatre&#x00EB;l sou wees &#x2026;</block>

<p>Now you see how &#x201C;tydelik&#x201D; it really was. I read further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; ges&#x00EA; dat wanneer daardie bepaling verander word, dit slegs n&#x00E1; konsultasie gedoen sou word. Meneer, meer as wat ek gekonsulteer het, is nie moontlik nie.</block>

<p>Now, was it not possible for him to consult with organized agriculture&#x003F; I read further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">U kan maar vir al hierdie instansies gaan vra. Ek persoonlik, wat as verteenwoordiger van die Regering op hierdie belangrike gebied van Bantoe-aangeleenthede hier staan, s&#x00EA; die Regering se woord is waaragtig sy eer.</block>

<p>I am holding this Government and this Deputy Minister to their word and to their honour. He has not consulted, as he said he must and as he said he had, with organized agriculture, and I doubt whether he has consulted with any farmer for that matter. I have not consulted with organized agriculture, but I have spoken to quite a number of farmers. So have other hon. members on this side of the House. Farmers are horrified at the thought of this new tax being applied to them. What is more, I have also taken the trouble to talk to quite a few housewives about this and they are equally horrified. I hope we are going to get a reply from the hon. the Deputy Minister on the score of exactly what consultation has taken place and whether he proposes to stick to the undertaking of Dr. Verwoerd, as interpreted by himself two days ago. I suggest that even with the rapid changes in direction that this Government makes, two days is far too short a time for the hon. the Deputy Minister to go back on an undertaking.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is a pity that the United Party is making a political issue of this matter when the hon. the Deputy Minister in his Second Reading speech, and other members on this side, too, stated very clearly that this R2.50 simply was a ceiling which was being placed on the levy. The hon. members for Pinelands and Kensington dragged the question of tax into this by the hair and tried to gull the world into believing that this was a tax to be levied.</p>

<p>It is not a tax. It is utter nonsense to allege that. These people are politicising. No jot or tittle is being added to the tax paid at present. But what does the attitude of the hon. members for Pinelands and Kensington imply&#x003F; Tomorrow there will once again be headlines in the newspapers that tremendously high levies are being imposed on the housewife and the farmer. In my opinion it is outrageous that the United Party should proceed with its huckstering <span class="col_821-822" refersTo="page_0427"/>in this regard. To us this is once again proof of how politically bankrupt these people are when they have to try to catch a few votes by means of this matter. What is happening here, is simply that a ceiling of R2,50 is being imposed. The levy may go up to this ceiling. But if a study is made of the amendment proposed by the hon. the Deputy Minister, it will be seen that he has given the undertaking to organized &#x2026;</p>

<p>No, to the Federated Chamber of Industries. The hon. the Deputy Minister gave the undertaking that if a contribution exceeded R1,50 it would not be increased by more than 20 per cent without prior notice of at least one year had been given of the intention to increase the levy. Therefore, this will be done properly. I think hon. members are using this matter as a red herring for political purposes. If we accept this proposed amendment of the hon. the Deputy Minister there will be a large degree of unanimity as far as this matter is concerned. I assume that proper consultations were conducted in connection with this matter. But what is more, this Bill was published as far back as 24th December. For what reason is a draft Act published&#x003F; A draft Act is published to afford interested bodies and persons an opportunity of perusing the legislation and an opportunity of putting their views concerning that draft legislation to the Minister. This organized body does not see the sinister thing in this legislation which the Opposition is trying to see in it. These people realize that nothing is being added to the present levies at the present time. These people are people who can understand what they read. They understand the contents of this legislation. They realize that what is being done here is merely the imposition of a ceiling of R2,50. It is possible to move between that ceiling and the floor levy after consultation, and this will happen. For that reason I say that we cannot understand the arguments of the United Party and consequently we have to reject them because we see that what they are engaged in here, is merely politicking.</p>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it was quite interesting to have listened to the hon. member who has just sat down, because he is well aware of the original purpose of the Native services levy and the reason why it was imposed. He also knows of the tremendous objection that took place at that time, right throughout the circles of commerce and industry, with regard to the form of indirect taxation on an employer. The employer was specifically taxed in order to ensure that these services would be available when the Bantu locations and townships, as they were then called, expanded at such a tremendous rate. He knows particularly well that the city which he served at one time was virtually the focal point of the establishment of the Native services levy. The cost of bringing services to the boundaries of these townships was so enormous that the State shuddered at the thought of having to find the funds. Maybe it had its difficulties then as well. The hon. member is well aware of the fact that there was a tremendous outcry because the employer was specifically taxed as opposed to the general community. The specific undertaking given at that time was not only that the funds would not be used for any other purpose, but also that the funds would not be required, or called for, once the purpose had been achieved. This is not a Statute which was imposed for all time. It was not, for instance, the Income Tax Act, or a part of it, which must continue perenially; this Act was passed for a specific purpose and the understanding was that, when the purpose had been served, the necessity for the imposition on the employer would come to an end. Committees were established on which employers together with local authorities and officials from the State Department of Native Affairs, as it was then called, were represented, in order to deal with the allocation and use of these moneys year by year for specific projects. The project had to be approved of by these committees.</p>

<p>What is the hon. the Minister doing in this instance&#x003F; He is virtually bringing to an end the necessity for a Native services levy in terms of that particular Act because, as he says, so much has now been accumulated that there is no necessity for further levies as they do not need that money any more. &#x201C;We have now come to the conclusion that, because so much has been accumulated, our eyes have been opened to the fact that it is not further required.&#x201D; That is what he said in his speech, and has been referred to. So what does he do&#x003F; He does not bring this particular imposition to an end, but says &#x201C;Now that the pain is something to which the wearer of <span class="col_823-824" refersTo="page_0428"/>the shoe has become accustomed&#x2014;there is a very famous story by Pauline Smith on pain, which I would like the hon. the Minister to read&#x2014;he can live with it&#x201D;. They must now live with this imposition. &#x201C;I will therefore impose a form of indirect taxation; I need the money; I have my Bantu Administration Boards which must function; also, now that I can impose this tax without being limited or restricted by the Native Services Levy Act and the undertaking of a former Prime Minister&#x2014; traversed over five pages of his speech, while he assured us that he would honour that undertaking&#x2014;here is an opportunity of levying a form of indirect taxation which I can now use as I like. I can use it for administrative purposes of the board &#x2026;" And, as he later endeavours to do, &#x201C;I can use it to supplement all my ideological policies that I have been working out, in connection with which I find myself in financial difficulties&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Let us get to the stage where we accept that the hon. the Deputy Minister says that he will not increase it, but is merely asking for exactly what he has. The hon. member who has just spoken said that the public knew that that was the figure and that they had got used to it. Let me give an example of one town for which I have the figures and which ought therefore to be helpful. From Johannesburg alone one finds that at 85 cents, i.e. the Natives services levy figure, he will receive R3 900 000 per annum. With the addition from those people for whom accommodation is provided&#x2014;they are not excluded now&#x2014;this will mount by another R500 000 to R4 500 000.</p>

<p>If he adds the other amount, the 20 cents, he will receive something in the nature of R5&#x00BD; million. This is a considerable sum of money, a sum which at the height of expenditure for Native services, will still leave an average surplus of nearly R1&#x00BD; million per annum. The Minister says, and here is another amount of money he has in hand, that he is going to use the interest received from that R26 million for his administrative boards. He said: &#x201C;What a lovely nest egg I have got; what a lovely nest negg for these bodies!&#x201D; However, he still wants to ensure that he will have enormous surpluses. If he adds that amount of 50 cents as I have told him earlier, which is obviously what he is contemplating because he has now dropped his ceiling temporarily and will increase it only subject to certain notices, he will get an amount of money which will far exceed anything he has ever dreamt of getting. It will not only be used for administrative boards; it will not be used to provide that &#x201C;contented&#x201D; labour in the towns that he talks about, that &#x201C;efficient, honest and satisfactory&#x201D; labour which he hopes he will bring about by using the money for amenities, but he will start diverting the money.</p>

<p>We believe that the hon. Minister can only get what Parliament knows he requires. He cannot have moneys for which he will not have to account for in the future, because they will flow into his department to be used by him in the broad, wide sense of this particular Bill. Why then should housewives who were not included under the Bantu Services Levy Act be penalized&#x003F; Why should farmers have to be penalized&#x003F; Why should these people have to be penalized now because the Minister feels that the pain is there, that it is nothing new because it is the same pain that has been experienced in the past&#x003F; His whole vision of contributions has expanded with the provisions of this Bill. The only reason why industry and commerce is not creating any pressure of objection at the moment, is because they may go along with the hon. the Deputy Minister to some extent in the undertaking he gives for the uses of the money, namely that it will be used for the benefit of the people working in the towns&#x2014;in other words, the people working in the areas from which they draw their labour.</p>

<p>The hon. Minister should get nothing more than has been paid hitherto and if he wants more, let him come back to Parliament and tell us that he cannot administer with the money that he has at his disposal. Let him tell Parliament that it is not sufficient to administer his boards. Let him tell Parliament of all the surpluses which are undoubtedly going to accumulate, because this administrative board is taking over an inheritance which has a history of no deficits other than in respect of special additional services. Very few municipalities in this country have operated their Bantu Revenue Account with deficits. The Johannesburg Municipality which was severely criticized, last year had a very big deficit of a couple of million rand&#x2014; the ratepayers had to pay for it&#x2014;because of services which had been rendered in the form of health amenities, recreation, etc.</p>

<p>Generally, there had been no deficits at all and the Bantu Revenue Account had <span class="col_825-826" refersTo="page_0429"/>been ample to meet the requirements. The Beer Account and the liquor sales provide moneys for deficits on housing, recreation and other purposes. This particular operation of Bantu administration in the towns and cities of South Africa has a tremendous source of income and I, therefore, say that the hon. the Minister has no right to raise the levies. If he wants to maintain the <i>status quo,</i> as he pleads here, and the industrialists go along with him to some extent, let it stay where it was. To ask for more, to contemplate that he can build himself up virtually a complete new empire without Parliament in any way having say over the matter, I say is asking more than any Parliament is entitled to give to any Minister. I believe that the hon. the Deputy Minister should reconsider that situation. If he thinks that the headlines will mention the indirect taxation and that it is not warranted, I say to him this is the beginning of a new form of indirect taxation. This is only the first concept of how to handle it.</p>

<p>Sir, those two hon. gentlemen on the other side who spoke this morning, simply talked nonsense. In the Second Reading debate we pointed out that hon. members of the Opposition could not raise any real objection to this Bill. The atmosphere which they create is this: They do not want the Government to establish a decent administration; that is all. The reason behind the arguments advanced by the hon. member for Kensington, and the hon. member who has just sat down, is not that they have the interests of the housewives or the farmers at heart; it is all outward show. The hon. member for Kensington said that the housewives and the farmers had not been consulted. Now he is sheltering behind the skirts of the women. The reason behind their arguments is that they are in difficulty at the moment as far as the Reef and Johannesburg are concerned; there they are saddled with the Progressive Party, and the hon. member for Kensington, the prominent writer in the <i>Sunday Times,</i> is fencing for those Progressive supporters who advertise in his newspaper; that is all he was doing here this morning; he does not have the interests of the farmers at heart. He is fencing for those large financial organizations, those employers who do not want to accept their real responsibility in respect of Bantu workers in White areas. He is fencing for those employers who do not care for the Bantu in the White areas; that is his argument and that is what is behind his whole argument this morning.</p>

<p>Sir, in his Second Reading speech and in his reply to the debate, the hon. the Deputy Minister gave very clear replies to all these questions. If the hon. member for Kensington were to write less in the <i>Sunday Times</i> and pay more attention to the debates conducted in this House, we would not get this sort of argumentation from him.</p>

<p>Sir, I will return to the hon. member for Rissik in a moment, but I want first to refer to the second part of the amendment moved by the hon. the Deputy Minister dealing with employment for portion of a month. I would like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister whether this is intentional, because as the amendment is worded it deals with a person who is in the employ of an employer on the 1st of the month but whose employment is terminated before the end of the month. It deals with a person who enters employment after the 1st of the month and whose employment is terminated on or before the end of the month, but it does not cover the employee who is taken into employment after the 1st of the month and whose employment is not terminated. In other words, if an employee is employed on the 29th of the month, then he is not covered by this exclusion and the full amount is paid for that employee who was engaged on the 29th but not dismissed on the 30th. Is that the intention&#x003F;</p>

<p>Sir, I cannot follow the logic of it. If you are going to exclude an employee whose employment is terminated during the month and you are going to exclude an employee taken on after the beginning of the month and whose services are terminated on or before the end of the month, why not exclude a person in the very same circumstances who is taken on during the month but whose services are not terminated&#x003F; Because what it means then is that the employer is not going to engage employees halfway through the month or towards the end of the month if he can help it; he will then wait until the 1st of the month, and who suffers&#x003F; The employee, the Bantu in whom this Deputy Minister alleges he is interested. But he deliberately wraps up this amendment in so many words and so much fluff that he hopes nobody will notice this until the employer suddenly finds that he has to pay. What the employer has now got to do is to dismiss the man on the 30th of the month, because he then gets the benefit, and then engage him again on the 1st. Sir, if technically he dismisses the employee on the last day of the month and re-employs him on the first day of the next month, he does not pay the levy, or he pays a <i>pro rata</i> amount.</p>

<p>Yes, he pays a <i>pro rata</i> amount of the tax. But if he does not dismiss him and re-employ him the next day, then he has to pay the full tax for the whole month.

<p>Now I want to return to the arguments of the hon. members for Langlaagte and Rissik. The hon. member for Rissik said that the United Party was opposed to good, decent administration.</p>

<p>*No, that is not what we are opposed to. We are opposed to concealed taxation. We should like to have good, decent administration, but in that case the money required should be asked for openly in this House. It should not be concealed in the name of levies so that no-one may know what is spent and what is collected. We say that this Parliament is the boss and that this Parliament is the responsible body. Let the Minister come forward with a budget so that the people may see what the employers have to pay and how the money is spent. Why is the Minister afraid to come to this House and to say what amount he wants for administration and how he is going to spend the money&#x003F; Is he afraid of the searchlight of Parliament falling on his actions and his administration&#x003F; Now he wants to take the money from the public and he does not want the public to know how much is taken from them and how it is spent.

The housewife pays those two fees I have mentioned, i.e. the labour bureau fee and the registration fee; she does not pay the levy in terms of the Services Levy Act. The three fees I have mentioned, are now being consolidated into one fee, which is going to be paid on a monthly basis, and I repeat: The housewife is not going to pay the levy in terms of the Services Levy Act; she has never paid it, nor will she have to pay it in future. Of the three fees I have mentioned, the housewife has always paid two. The third she has never paid.

Now, I say once again: If hon. members want to play politics with this situation, I am depriving them of that privilege because I am informing every housewife in this country &#x2014;I include the housewives of Brakpan as well as those of Gezina, because they are the reason for all the talking of the hon. members&#x2014;that this legislation does not envisage their having to pay more for the present than they are paying now.

Sir, I should like to see him on horseback on a farm. He will have to take a bottle of castor oil or something along with him. Sir, as far as the farmers are concerned, I said very explicitly in this House, in reply to the Second Reading debate, that it will not be expected of <i>bona fide</i> farmers to pay any fee in respect of this Bill for the present. Under no circumstances will it now be expected of them to do so. Let the <i>bona fide</i> farmers know this.

<p>My department consulted the farmers and the agricultural unions in connection with this Bill. This Bill was circulated to them for their comments, and apart from that, it was published for general information on 24th December. What more would any farmer want to know in connection with this matter than what I have just said, i.e. that in the present circumstances he is not going to be assessed in respect of these fees&#x003F; Surely there is nothing more to say in connection with this matter. Whereas I have just said this, the United Party moved an amendment this morning asking for a fee of R1. By doing so the United Party has given crystal clear proof of their complete lack of understanding of future planning or of any responsibility towards this country as regards ensuring that the administration of Bantu affairs will at least be placed on a firm basis, because if I were to accept this amendment moved by the hon. member for Transkei, i.e. that the fee should be determined at R1, I say now that there would be areas in South Africa in which it would be necessary to operate at a loss right from the outset. In that case there would be no question of future planning and no question of any streamlining of Bantu administration or of anything of that nature.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is completely impossible for me to accept that amendment. I just want to mention this, Sir. Furthermore, you should see how poor the United Party&#x2019;s knowledge and background are regarding this matter, as was evidenced here once again this morning. At the moment something in the vicinity of R6 million, despite surpluses in the Levy Fund, is taken from the White Revenue Account and utilized for Bantu affairs on the part of some of the United Party-controlled city councils. Let the country, for once, take some cognizance of this. In Johannesburg, I think, the amount taken from the White Revenue Account is R4 million, or something of that order, which is then used for Bantu affairs.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>But this has been done openly.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>In all the other 300 or 400 places, with the exception of these few, the Bantu Revenue Account is more than sufficient for maintaining proper administration in those places. Now you have to understand what these hon. members are asking for by means of their amendment, i.e. that the amount be pegged down at R1. If one were to agree to pegging down the amount at R1, it would mean that instead of an amount as high as R6 million being taken from the White Revenue Account for Bantu affairs, as at present, in the places controlled by them, this amount would have to be increased considerably and that the House of Assembly would, in that case, have to accept this important principle that henceforth it would have to finance Bantu affairs from its White Revenue Account in all these places in which Bantu administration is essential; and on that basis we shall be able to play a nice game of politics in all those places in which it is possible to play politics with this matter. For all these reasons it is completely unacceptable to me to agree to this amendment moved by those hon. members. I already have an amendment on the Order Paper which makes it possible for proper notice to be given 12 months in advance if that amount has to be increased. Furthermore, I want to point out that each amount to be levied, will be levied by means of Government notices and, surely, the hon. members are aware of the fact that Government notices have to be tabled here and may be debated here. Therefore it is not at all true, as the hon. members over there want to insinuate, that we are trying to avoid Parliament as regards this amount of R2,50 mentioned in the Bill&#x2014;not at all&#x2014;because the procedure of determining the amount and publishing each amount determined in this respect, in a government notice, ensures the safe right of those hon. members to raise the matter here and to debate it in this House of Assembly. Therefore, the House of Assembly is retaining its full right to discuss the matter here.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the other amendment which the hon. member for Kensington has on the Order Paper is not acceptable to me either. In view of the fact that assurances have been given, as I have given them, we cannot now introduce another very important principle here, one which we would have to introduce if I were prepared to accept the amendment of the hon. member for Kensington, i.e. a principle of discrimination. Because in that case we would be <span class="col_835-836" refersTo="page_0434"/>able to say that some people were to pay in respect of their Bantu employees and other people not. We cannot introduce that principle of discrimination here. We say there is a principle of differentiation. We accept it. We had very full discussions with all interested bodies, representative bodies, on the question of the necessity to spread the burden of finding the necessary funds for administration as evenly as possible over the general public of South Africa. Surely this is a principle which is acceptable. It is an acceptable principle and it was decided&#x2014;because one wants to spread this as evenly as possible with due regard being had to the actual position of all concerned in this matter, which, surely, is fair so that one may grant exemptions where necessary and so that one may reduce the amount where necessary, etc.&#x2014;that, arising from this, we also had to accept the principle, with which these people with whom we had conducted the discussions were satisfied, that we could not accept any principle of discrimination by saying certain groups of employers would pay nothing whereas other groups would in fact pay. Surely this is unfair. Do those hon. members really want to advocate this morning that some people have to pay and others not&#x003F; Surely it is foolish. I can tell you that the representative bodies do not advocate this. What they do advocate and what has been written into this legislation is the other principle of differentiation and this, we feel, is a very fair principle. Lastly the hon. member for Durban Point advanced an argument here regarding this amendment standing on the Order Paper, i.e. the new subsection (4). I want to tell the hon. member at once that this clause was drafted in this way by the law advisers so as to try to express in words and embody in this Bill the principle we had discussed with the representative bodies, i.e. that since we now concede that an employer need not pay the full amount in general in respect of his employee if the employee absconds or does not work the full month, we should like to facilitate as far as possible the administration in, connection with this matter and retain the principle we had at the very, outset, i.e. to simplify the administration as far as possible as compared to the levy which now has to be paid in terms of the Services Levy Act. For that reason a month is deemed to have 30 days, whereas we know that some months have 31 days, merely for the sake of avoiding administrative confusion. For that reason we have now accepted here&#x2014;and in our opinion this is perfectly fair, although I want to make the hon. member a present of saying that this point may be argued &#x2014;that if a Bantu starts working for the employer on the fifth of the month and is dismissed or absconds on the 12th, the employer pays only for the period from the 5th to the 12th, in other words, for seven days. If he is employed on the 2nd of the month and he is dismissed or absconds on the 10th, he pays for eight days only, but if he does not abscond or is not dismissed in the course of the month, irrespective of the date of employment of that Bantu employee, the employer is expected to pay the full amount in respect of that employee, because, after all, he will be carrying on in employment into the following month.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The logic of this, in the first place, is to try to simplify as far as possible the confusion of administrative complications. This, in the first place, and in the second place, the following: Take for example the case of a Bantu whose employment is continuous into the next month. This should not be seen in terms of one month only, because I repeat that if he is dismissed in that month the employer pays only in respect of those days the employee was employed. But if the employment of a Bantu is continuous into the next month, irrespective of the date on which he was employed in the previous month, and he absconds in the month following his employment or is dismissed, the employer pays only in respect of those few days in the new month for which the employee was employed.

I have here a note from one of the officials, which I should like to read to you (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Federated Chamber of Industries offered to pay the full amount per month for the highest number of Bantu in employment on a certain day.</block>

<p>Surely these are the responsible bodies which deal with these matters, but now the hon. member for Durban Point wants to elevate himself, as it were, to the position of a powerful personality who knows so much about these things, whereas he showed that he does not know even the first thing about the Bantu Services Levy Act. We think this provision, as it is worded, is very fair, that it is in fact very simple and that the matter will solve itself in the next month or the month following that in view of the fact that the employer will pay only for that part of the month worked by the Bantu.</p>

<p>I think I have now replied to the most important questions which were raised, except that I want to content myself by coming back to this question of the R2,50 which was forcefully raised by the hon. member for Pinelands. He is an hon. member with whom one likes to cross swords in this House because of the courtesy with which he puts his case. I discussed this issue at length during the Second Reading debate and I do not want to cover the same field again now, but let me just say the position is that one finds oneself faced with the situation that one simply cannot determine one amount for the whole of the Republic, Something like that is impossible. One has to determine a maximum amount, because if one does not determine such an amount, the Minister has <i>carte blanche</i> to levy any amount, just what he likes&#x2014;R10 per month or even R20 per month&#x2014;and then we would have heard what would have happened if that had been the position. Therefore, one has to mention an amount and the question arises what amount one is to mention: Is one to mention R1,50; is one to mention R2,00; is one to mention R2,50&#x003F;</p>

<p>I want to say that a tradition has been built up over many long years in the Department of Bantu Administration and Development that as far as amounts of this kind are concerned the country should be spared this kind of emotional debate as we had in the past and as we shall in all probability have in future. To spare the country that and also for other reasons, which I do not want to go into now, we say we determine an amount which will hold good for a long time to come. In this way I may mention the example of the registration fee, the amount of which was determined in 1923 and remained the same up to 1972. We believe it wise to determine the amount in this way and we should like to see this tradition being maintained in the department. We have made it clear several times, and we have embodied this in the Bill, that the amount of R1,50 which is accepted from all quarters by FCI, Assocom and the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut is the level at which it is pegged down. We say it is a reasonable amount and this is in fact the amount at which they want to have it pegged down. This is what was said by the Federated Chamber of Industries when they had an interview with us the other day.</p>

We want to give the people certainty so that they may know where they stand. Surely this is fair and therefore I repeat that the hon. members must accept that we did not arrive lightly at this maximum amount of R2,50, which we hope will hold good for many: long years to come; <span class="col_839-840" refersTo="page_0436"/>we arrived at that figure after mature consideration.

<p>I was on the point of issuing a challenge to that hon. member.

<p>I shall tell you now. If we want to touch that, hon. members tell us that Dr. Verwoerd gave this or that assurance. But now I am challenging them, why do they not come forward with the suggestion to free that amount instead of keeping it as a nestegg&#x003F; I told them yesterday that we would cast this in their teeth at a later stage, because it is because of them that that amount is simply lying there. Where the services have been established, it is a terrible problem to spend those funds in terms of the existing Act.</p>

<p>Now the hon. member asks me for what purposes these new funds under this administration costs legislation are going to be used. I have already replied to that. In the first place those moneys are utilized as required for the administration in respect of the Bantu employee in a White area, as well as for all those purposes for which the Urban Areas Act makes provision. The hon. member may refer to section 19 of the Urban Areas Act. That contains a very long list, up to (m) or (n), of purposes for which this money may be utilized. It will be utilized for those purposes in the first place. Now the question is what happens if there are surpluses. In that case, we say, the Minister will henceforth have the power to utilize those surpluses in consultation with the local authority for purposes on which they may decide. That is the position.</p>

<p>We are glad to have the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s explanations, but I am sorry to say they are not satisfactory. The hon. the Deputy Minister challenges us to ask that the Services Levy Fund be freed from the obligations to be confined to services levies. This is interesting, because the hon. member for Durban Point pointed to the question of concealed taxation. At present, the amount of 85 cents per month is definitely appropriated for services levies. But now the hon. the Deputy Minister is asking this House for that 85 cents in an entirely different guise. He is now going to take that 85 cents as part of the bigger amount he is going to establish. It is not going to be for a services levy. His hands are going to be entirely untied. He is pretending, with great respect, that he is consolidating the services levy here, but in fact the services levy legislation still remains in position.</p>

<p>Yes, and this is why I pointed out that he did not need an amount above R1, because he was <span class="col_841-842" refersTo="page_0437"/>already getting big surpluses. Services were supplied and no new services were needed. He said that himself. Consequently, it should be possible to make a reduction in the amount of R1,05 appreciably below R1,05. Now the hon. the Deputy Minister did not attempt to dispute my figures. He did not answer; he made no attempt to answer my figures. All he said was that the United Party had no understanding of future planning, and it was a question of putting administration on a sound basis. The only argument he used was when he spoke about &#x201C;gebiede waar jy van die begin af teen &#x2019;n verlies moet werk&#x201D;. He implied that there were certain areas which would work at a loss unless it was above R1. He did not specify them and gave no breakdown as to why this should be so. In the light of the fact that he has built up such large surpluses with the maximum charge at R1,05, this is quite inexplicable to us.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>It all boils down to the fact that the hon. the Deputy Minister has not made out a case for taking a bigger amount of taxation than R1. The hon. the Deputy Minister says there has to be differentiation and that, for this reason, he is only prepared to accept a ceiling on the amount. The hon. the Minister of Finance also has differentiation in taxation, but he acts according to principles. He places these principles in accordance with which he differentiates, before the House. Why should it then be so difficult for the hon. the Deputy Minister to say what the amount will be for housewives, what it will be in the case of industrialists and what it will be for the different areas&#x003F; We will then be able to see the principles involved, before we vote for any taxation. The hon. the Deputy Minister is therefore not complying with what every other Minister seeking funds from this House is prepared to do. Why should there be this difference&#x003F; I suggest that it comes back to what the hon. member for Durban Point has said, namely that it is a question of &#x201C;bedekte belasting&#x201D; and of not letting the public of South Africa see what is being done with these moneys. It is a question of not letting them see what is being taken in order to administer the ideology of this Government.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>It has very much to do with the ideology of the Government in regard to the urban Bantu. The amenities for which general rates are paid in a municipality are, amongst others, water, sanitation, electricity, roads, clinics, hospitals, recreation centres, cr&#x00E8;ches, community centres, libraries, and the maintenance of these. Why can these service not be covered to a large extent, at least, by the general revenues which are paid by the country as a whole and are not taken from a certain section of the community, causing inflation&#x003F; Where housewives and farmers supply all these amenities to their workers it is clear that they should be treated specially and everything points to the fact that the amount that housewives pay should at the very most be limited to the amount they have had to pay up to now. This can be done, because I want to stress again that surpluses have built up under the present system. The hon. the Deputy Minister, however, is not prepared to give that assurance. He indicated that it was only for the present that these amounts would stay as they were.</p>

<p>Lastly, just to indicate what substantial amounts these can be, I want to give the example of one big employer, namely the Railways. The Railways have approximately 100 000 Bantu employees. If one takes the maximum amount payable in terms of this Bill this could involve the Railways in having to pay up to R30 per year for each Bantu employee. This would therefore mean an amount of R3 million. One can realize what this amount will contribute to inflation. From what the hon. the Deputy Minister said a moment ago we already know &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I can. The fact is that this power is being put in the hands of the hon. the Minister and the hon. the Deputy Minister. We already know that we will have a 50 per cent increase in the case of the industrialists and others to whom the hon. the Deputy Minister referred. Up to now their maximum has been R1,05. Included in that amount of R1,05 is an amount of 85 cents which the hon. the Deputy Minister himself says has supplied all the services needed. Now they are apparently immediately going to be assessed at R1,50. That already involves a 50 per cent increase for those people. Imagine an increase in this House on income tax of the order of 50 per cent. It would be most astonishing. This is, admittedly, not a tax of that exact nature. But it already represents a substantial increase and, therefore, substantial added cost for the producers of South Africa and, therefore, a substantial extra amount on to the prices of our products. Fifty cents per month extra amounts to R6 per year. One is perhaps not in possession of the exact figure of Bantu employed, but I will not be surprised if half a million people are covered by the categories of employer that the Deputy Minister was referring to. If it is that, this would then be a very large sum of money.</p>

<p>While it is true that this motion states that the House requests the Government to consider the advisability of establishing a State department under its own Minister charged with certain functions, I in fact want to say that constitutionally my appeal must be directed to the hon. the Prime Minister as he, in fact, appoints his Cabinet Ministers and determines matters of this side constitutionally on his own responsibility. So, as I say, I must today direct my remarks and make my appeal to the hon. the Prime Minister. Let me say at once that, in respect of this particular matter, if there is to be controversy and dispute over it, I think I will fail. I can only succeed if I get a consensus of opinion from all sides of the House, ignoring political considerations entirely and simply bringing our own unbiased and objective opinions to bear on the necessity for a step of this kind in the interests of the health and wellbeing of South Africa and its people.

<p>If so, with all due respect to the hon. the Minister, I regret that very much indeed. I am very sorry to say that, because I have the greatest respect for the hon. Minister. I have no complaint whatever, so far as the hon. the Minister is concerned, with his taking all the notes and dealing with the matter from the Government side, except that we must reach the stage where the hon. the Prime Minister is prepared to deal with the matter concerning a proposed additional member on his Cabinet. There the hon. the Minister of Planning cannot help us.</p>

<p>I have limited time, so let me proceed. The first appeal I made in this House, I made two years ago to the hon. Prime Minister to establish such a department under a Minister. The hon. the Prime Minister at that time did not agree. A year later I made another appeal, but again the hon. the Prime Minister did not agree. I understand that we now have, in South Africa, a Cabinet sub-committee and that we have a special committee under, I believe, the chairmanship of Dr. Meiring Naude which advises the Prime Minister. That is the machinery we have at the moment for dealing with the work, duties and obligations which I would like to see transferred to one Minister. As I say, I hope I am able to put this matter across in such a way that we will find sufficient common ground in this debate to take the whole of Parliament with us. I hope there are not going to be disputes over minor matters and that we are not going to lose sight of the wood for the trees. I hope that what is now becoming one of the burning questions affecting the survival here in South Africa not of the White man, but of <i>homo sapiens</i> shall be dealt with in the spirit where we can get together, support my motion and put this issue before the hon. the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>What kind of Cabinet Minister do I want&#x003F; Let us come right to the point. I want a Cabinet Minister of a very special kind with special qualifications and a special character. He must be a man who is going to be able to influence his colleagues not necessarily because he has legislative authority, but because he is a man of character stamp and standing. If the hon. the Prime Minister cannot find him within the ranks of the hon. gentlemen who are here in Parliament today, I suggest he looks outside of those ranks. The kind of man we need, is a man who is going to be a key figure in the future of South Africa. If it cannot be appreciated <i>ab initio</i> that a special kind of man is required to be head of affairs here, we have failed to grasp the picture. We are lacking in imagination.</p>

<p>The hon. Minister says: &#x201C;Why stress his character&#x003F;&#x201D; That is the point. I do not only stress their qualifications, he can get information which he will need to judge on, but I stress his character because he must be able to influence his colleagues in the Cabinet. Legislation, and rather far-reaching legislation at that, will have to be adopted. I am going to quote as little as possible from documents because I am limited by time, but I have here a quotation from Britain dealing with the special legislation they are passing there. It is an all-embracing <span class="col_847-848" refersTo="page_0440"/>anti-pollution Act because the difficulty they have been faced with is the same difficulty we have here, namely a multitude of different authorities dealing with various aspects of the pollution problem. Therefore you have to have a man who will be able to handle the legislation and who will be able to handle the various bodies and individuals who are lending themselves in the anti-pollution campaign. I believe that the right man with the right character will he able to get co-operation from a very wide circle of organizations, people, institutions, companies, corporate bodies and others who will be able and willing to assist on a basis of co-operation. Throughout the world, in other fields as well as in that of anti-pollution, we have found that there is a group of people, a residual group of people, who will not co-operate and who will not play the game. These people are going to put private interests and profit right in the forefront of what they are doing. Only the law will shift them and will have the necessary authority and necessary power to compel them, to whip them into obeying the necessary laws which have been laid down by Parliament for the protection of our environment. In reply to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s question I say that these are the reasons why I emphasize character. I do not emphasize it in regard to the moral standards, nor do I emphasize it in regard to his domestic affairs. That is not the kind of character I am referring to.</p>

<p>My hon. friend from Durban Point put the word &#x201C;personality&#x201D; into my mouth and I think that that is perhaps a better word. This man should be a man of outstanding personality, a man of such a character and of such standing that we can all look up to him and be able to support him. My motion deals with the question of a State department for the protection of the environment. This particular phrase has become current at the present time; it is used everywhere; it is used by all sorts of people and it is used for a variety of purposes. I want to put it in a different way because I think it can perhaps assist them. I want to talk about the degrading of the habitat. Here I have a book written by perhaps the topmost ecologist in the world, Mr. L. J. Leopold of America. He is certainly one of the top three in the world. He talks about the land and says: By the land he means all that is in the land, on the land, in terms of water, all that is above the land, in terms of air, and so on. By that, he says, he means the land, the earth, the world. I talk about the degrading of our habitat. Our habitat is all that which permits us to coexist with the plants, the animal life and so forth, which permits us to carry on our normal avocations and which permits us to reproduce and to carry on the race. In the ecological field we find that if the habitat gets degraded, ultimately, sooner or later, the flora, the fauna and through the fauna, even human beings are eventually affected. They can be so adversely affected that extinction of animal species takes place, and with the extinction of animal species goes the extinction of flora and eventually it leads to a cycle. As part of the animal world, we are directly associated with the extinction of animal species. Sir, as I say, I do not want to quote more than is necessary, but I do want to quote some figures. Having made the point as to the particular kind of man whom I believe the Prime Minister should get as a Minister&#x2014;he should find him outside of this House, if he is not satisfied that he can get him here; there will be plenty of hon. members on the other side who will willingly relinquish and resign from their seats so as to allow him to fight a seat and to get here into Parliament; there will be no difficulty about that and the member who relinquishes his seat will be well rewarded for his sacrifice &#x2014;let me now deal with one aspect of the matter here in South Africa. Sir, it was manna from Heaven for me when I listened to the news broadcast over the S.A.B.C. this morning.

That is nearly R1 million a month, Sir. This is only one organization here in our own country, in South Africa. This is the magnitude of the problem that we are facing. Iscor feels that it is justified in spending R10 million a year for the next 10 years in dealing virtually with red iron oxide dust that is coming from their furnaces. <span class="col_849-850" refersTo="page_0441"/>Sir, when you are dealing with money of that magnitude, surely it requires some Government organization, which is going to have someone of a special character, a special personality, at the top. Sir, let me repeat that this is just one organization in our country at the present time. Apart from that, you have the whole of the factory effluent, pollution of the air and so forth. Mr. Speaker, before we go any further, I want to say here and now that when I talk about the degrading of the habitat, I refer also to the degradation of the atmosphere. In the last two or three years we have seen difficulties in European countries where what were called thalidomide babies were born. The medical people know all about them&#x2014;children who were malformed because the mothers had taken certain drugs after conception while the child was still in the womb. The result was that these unfortunate children were born with deformed limbs, completely unfit to take any part in our lives. They were completely unfit because of malformation of a terrible, horrible character. Sir, that could be traced to one of those drugs which the analytical chemists of the time were able to isolate and pinpoint and say, &#x201C;This is the source of it&#x201D;. But do you know, Sir, that we do not know what is happening in our atmosphere as a result of dust particles that are coming from nuclear explosions&#x003F; We do not even know where these nuclear particles of dust in the atmosphere are located; we do not know their concentrations. What we do know is that if you submit animal life to the influence of certain isotopes, you can get a change in the genes and you can produce in animal life the same kind of malformation as in those thalidomide babies, and even worse. It has not been tested on human beings yet, but I repeat that we are part of the animal kingdom. It has been tested on many forms of life and, Mr. Speaker, the results of some of those experiments are terrifying and all because the parents were artificially subjected to the influence of the rays from these radioactive isotopes. Sir, those particles are radio-active and they are in the whole of our atmosphere. Here are some of the notes that I have collected over the last few years. No scientist, including those in Germany, who are making a special point of trying to ascertain this, can find the ceiling above which we are subjected now to such a concentration of those radioactive rays that this effect will be felt, so far as our biology is concerned, in the human race. They cannot tell you how dangerous it must be before it reaches that stage. What they can tell you&#x2014;as they do in report after report&#x2014;is that the danger exists. There is a direct danger of this dust being consumed. In the latest German <i>Tribune</i> they go so far as to point out that apart from that aspect, there are no less than 1 000 substances being prepared today for use by the agricultural communities of the world, 900 of them for use on crops of all kinds, and 100 for use on animals. One thousand different preparations are manufactured, each one of which contains a modicum of a poisonous substance. In the case of some of these substances, only a low concentration is sufficient to cause death.</p>

<p>The wheat millers in Germany have pleaded with their Government to take steps to ban one of the substances used completely, because it is coming into their flour through use on the wheat. There is no possible way in which they can get rid of that substance once it has been used on the wheat. The only way in which to destroy the substance is to destroy the flour as well.</p>

<p>Sir, this is reality. This is the world we are living in today. Man has progressed tremendously with his inventions and he has harnessed and is using powers to achieve those things which he believes are to his benefit, but the far-reaching effects of all this he does not know. So, Sir, we go on: We destroy this by dusting it with some or other powder, and we destroy that by spraying it with some insecticide or other. As Mr. L. J. Leopold has said, we are like a boy playing for the first time with a watch. That little boy pulls the watch to pieces. Then, when he has pulled it to pieces, he puts it all together again and finds that he has two little wheels left over. He says: &#x201C;Well, that is rather strange,&#x201D; and throws the wheels away because he sees no use for them. Then he wonders why the watch does not go. Sir, we are like that. We call ourselves <i>Homo sapiens;</i> we are grown-up men and women, but we are pulling a watch to pieces. The science of animal life we are pulling to pieces day by day. If the pieces do not all appear to be of some particular value to us at the moment, we spray them with an insecticide to get rid of them, to wipe them out. We throw the little wheels away because we cannot see any use for them, one of these days we are going to wake up and find that <span class="col_851-852" refersTo="page_0442"/>there was some use for them. But then it will be too late. We will have thrown the wheels away and we will not be able to make the watch go. What is that watch&#x003F; It is the mainspring of our own existence.</p>

<p>I want to move on, Sir, as I do not have much time left. I have dealt with one aspect of air pollution. After all, this subject is so wide and so vast that no man, even in the course of two or three hours, could hope to do more than just scratch the surface. I want to deal now with the question of oil pollution. Where is our pollution coming from today&#x003F; Our air is being polluted; our water is being polluted in the rivers, and our underground water is being polluted; the sea is being polluted; the land itself, the soil, is being polluted. All the poisons, once they have reached animal life, do not necessarily return to the soil. What happens is that they travel around in the cycle: plant; animal; plant; soil; plant; animal; plant, and so forth That intractable element will continue revolving around and around in that circulation. What the lethal concentration is, no man knows. We do not know when it will suddenly blow up. Doctors and veterinary surgeons tell us of certain vegetable poisons which are cumulative, as they put it. An animal will eat that poison day after day, week after week and month after month. It does not excrete that poison. That poison is stored in the fatty tissues and other organs of the body. Eventually comes the time when the aggregate amount of that poison has reached the ceiling, the lethal point, and the animal dies. It does not die because it was poisoned by the last few grams it may have ingested; it dies because the cumulative effect has built up until it reaches the lethal stage. That can happen to human beings and we do not know the point at which it happens. This is where science has to be directed, and directed very carefully. In that regard, may I just come back for a moment to the R100 million to be spent by Iscor during the next 10 years and say in regard to a Minister, such as I have indicated, and a department: Are we satisfied that South Africa can best afford R10 million spent on fighting pollution, on anti-pollution measures, by dealing with the effluent from the Iscor premises&#x003F; Is that the most desirable and the most effective way of dealing with pollution in South Africa&#x003F; Is that really the top priority&#x003F;</p>

<p>In my motion I have suggested that such a Cabinet Minister would have to fix priorities. He would have to define pollution, and the definition he puts down this year may well be changed and another definition arrived at next year because of the scientific developments that are taking place and the chemical reactions that are being established. These things are continually changing. We are going ahead so rapidly that the definitions might have to be changed. We have limited funds, and what is more, we have limited personnel, although some of our chemists, analytical chemists and others of that ilk, are amongst some of the finest in the world. I think we can be immensely proud of them. You have a young man like Prof. Ahrens, who came from near Greytown in Natal; he is one of the world&#x2019;s leading scientists today, to whom have been entrusted some of of the moon rocks for analysis. We produce that kind of man in South Africa. A Minister such as I have designated will have the opportunity of getting the use of these men and picking their brains and having them work for South Africa in these highly critical fields of endeavour.</p>

<p>Let me move forward then and say that once we have established our priorities, we must have a look at some of the other matters we face, including this question of oil pollution. We had this morning in the <i>Cape Times</i> a most interesting article dealing with oil pollution, and the heading was: &#x201C;South Africa cannot cope with oil disaster.&#x201D; We had the <i>Wafra</i> incident last year, and we have had the <i>World Glory</i> and other incidents. A week or so ago we had the problem of the <i>Tigris</i> at the entrance to Durban Harbour. Sir, it seems only like yesterday that I was standing here pleading with the Minister of Economic Affairs, when we had the <i>Wafra</i> incident right here on our doorstep, to do something so as to build up an organization to cope with this kind of thing. I do not want to go into the matter of the <i>Tigris</i> because I have not the time, but it went aground at the entrance to Durban Harbour when the tide was on the flood. Had the oil leaked out of the <i>Tigris</i> it would have gone straight into Durban Harbour. There was not a thing to stop it. No action was taken. The man in charge of operations was here in Cape Town, and he said that he was going to wait until he saw what happened, because she was not leaking oil yet. So he stayed here in Cape Town. There was established by the Government some two years ago a special oil anti-pollution committee, with a member of the Executive <span class="col_853-854" refersTo="page_0443"/>Committee of Natal Province as its chairman, authorized ty the Government to do various things. A most complex machine was set up, and as was pointed out in the <i>Cape Times</i> this morning, it is triggered by the port captain and then it moves into action. Sir, we in Natal at that meeting and repeatedly before that and since then have pointed out that that committee can only deal with oil pollution when it comes ashore. We have no Minister to whom we can go and whom we can ask: Please look into this. It is no good tackling oil pollution when the oil comes ashore; it is when it is on the sea that you want to deal with it, before it comes ashore. The damage is done when you have it on your beaches and all over your rocks. It can cost us millions of rands. If the <i>Tigris&#x2019;s</i> oil had entered Durban Harbour and by chance it had caught alight, what would have happened then&#x003F; Can anyone imagine the holocaust that would have taken place&#x003F; But the Committee was set up. We have representatives of all the Government departments involved&#x2014;the Army, the Navy, the Port Captain, the Police; the lot. However, when the <i>Tigris</i> went ashore the other day, nobody was triggered. The Chairman of that committee was never notified about what had happened, and the first he knew of it, was when he read about it in the paper. The pressmen asked him: &#x201C;What would you have done if this ship had started to leak oil&#x003F;&#x201D; He said: &#x201C;I have been wondering about that myself, because I have no power to do anything until the oil comes ashore.&#x201D;</p>

<p>What is the good of an organization like that&#x003F; This is tomfoolery. There is no language which I can find that is strong enough to condemn that kind of nonsense if we are going to tell South Africa that we have made arrangements to cope with these disasters when they happen. Are we not satisfied that somebody else has had such an experience as the case of the <i>Torrey Canyon</i>&#x003F; Do we want ourselves to have that experience before we learn the lesson&#x003F; Is it not adequate that we see our neighbour being destroyed and the damage which he has suffered&#x003F; Must we wait until our own house has burnt down before we take measures to see that we have firefighting appliances&#x003F;</p>

<p>This is a thing that just makes my blood run cold and I say to myself: &#x201C;What is the Government thinking about&#x003F;&#x201D; They talk to us and they say: But the United Party is complaining that there are already too many Ministers; why do you want to advise the Prime Minister to have another Minister&#x003F; I say yes, but I want a Minister with a special personality and a special character. Yes, get rid of half the Cabinet Ministers and South Africa will be all the better for it; I have not the slightest doubt whatever. That is not the issue. The issue is that this is a threat to all of us. Is this a threat to White or Black or Coloured, or the Indian, or the Bantu&#x003F; No, it is a threat to South Africa. That is what this threat is. In a matter of this kind no effort at the highest level can be too great an effort to grapple with the solution of a problem of this nature. It needs a man. It does not need men; it does not need committees. It needs a man, one man. In this world big deeds are done by men, by individuals, by persons; not by people. People do not do things. People are controlled by a person and the person tells the people what to do and they do it gladly, because they will not think for themselves what has to be done. We want a man who is going to tell South Africa, including his colleagues in the Cabinet, what has to be done. All these papers, all these reports which I have here of damage, of near catastrophe as a result of the wrecking of a big tanker on our coast, count for nothing, because what do we do afterwards&#x003F; We sit and wring our hands and say to the Minister of Economic Affairs, the man who is in charge of our Fisheries Department: &#x201C;But why did you not take any action&#x003F;&#x201D; What is the good of doing that&#x003F; It is no good having a post-mortem on the body afterwards. When the corpse is there, what is the good of finding out what killed it&#x003F; Who is going to find out what killed it&#x003F; No, this is no good!</p>

<p>We have here the paper of this morning and a wonderful article in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of last week, dealing with the same thing; there is the <i>Daily News, The Mercury</i> and all of them, but this article in today&#x2019;s <i>Cape Times</i> tells us: &#x201C;More than a million tanker tonnage passes Cape Point every day.&#x201D; More than a million tons every day! Here is one of the biggest threats of pollution and nothing is being done about it. I appeal again to the Prime Minister: Please get a man of the right type, the right personality, and make him the head of a department to deal with the protection of our habitat; stop the degrading of our habitat; protect our environment.</p>

<speech by="#pansegrouw">

<from><span class="col_855-856" refersTo="page_0444"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. S. PANSEGROUW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, at the very beginning I want to tell the hon. member for South Coast that this side of the House regards this question of pollution just as seriously and in as serious a light as does that side of the House. For that reason we can assure the hon. member that we will not make politics out of this matter. This is one of the reasons why we shall not move an amendment either. I also want to tell the hon. member for South Coast that the hon. the Minister is fully aware of the fact that this decision will eventually be taken by the Prime Minister. As a result of the hon. member for Orange Grove&#x2019;s motion last year, the hon. the Minister also put it to us clearly that this matter would be discussed and that a decision would also eventually be taken by the Prime Minister. Someone there asked: Where is the Prime Minister&#x003F; There sits the Prime Minister&#x2019;s representative, and at the end of this debate the hon. the Minister will make those announcements the Cabinet wishes to have made. I really cannot see why the hon. member for South Coast specifically wants to see someone outside the House in this important post. The hon. member has referred to the fact that he has ascertained for himself that there is a Committee of the Cabinet dealing with the problems to which he refers. We endorse the hon. member for South Coast&#x2019;s fears, but we on this side of the House want to say that we are grateful, as I should like to prove in this short time at my disposal, that we here in South Africa, and people throughout the world&#x2014;the hon. member himself referred to that&#x2014;have become aware of this tremendous problem of pollution.</p>

<p>Last year the hon. member for Orange Grove came along to the House with this motion. This motion is almost exactly the same, since in his speech the hon. member also announced that the United Party requested such a department. We should have preferred not to discuss this motion again, except for one particular reason, i.e. that it is such a serious matter that we do not mind bringing it to people&#x2019;s attention in and out of season. Last year we said that it is a strange phenomenon that man is revolting against his own technological skill and ingenuity. However impossible it may sound, this is a fact we must take note of.</p>

<p>We also take note of the fact&#x2014;and the hon. member also referred to it&#x2014;that piles and piles of documents, reports and publications appear in connection with pollution. They are already piling up. In other words, as a result of research we have already identified the problem. We fully realize the dangers of pollution. However, as far as I am concerned the biggest danger lies in the fact that we shall perhaps not be able to combat those dangers in time. That is why we already lodged a serious plea last year for the creation of a task force to make a thorough study of this whole matter in co-operation with the CSIR, the Human Sciences Research Council and the universities. Thank heavens that was carried out. In my humble opinion, what is now necessary is not so much a description of the situation as such, as a programme of action that will constantly be adapted to circumstances as they change from time to time. We want to accept throughout the standpoint that pollution and the protection of our natural resources are irrevocably linked. Against this background we want to view the problem. We note that England, and also other European countries, already have a department of environmental protection. We have not the least doubt that all along the line this Government will perform its duty in respect of this matter. I am thinking in particular of these six levels at which pollution takes place, levels we have all taken note of on various occasions, but also in connection with the speech the hon. member for Orange Grove made last year. I now want to mention those six levels, to which the hon. member for South Coast also referred, in this order&#x2014;the soil, the rivers, our oceans, our air, noise&#x2014;the new problems of this age; and lastly, radio-activity.</p>

<p>And now I am not being original in the statement I am going to make, but for the sake of interest I want to convey this to the House, particularly to prove to you that this problem is creating great concern on a world-wide scale. A week or two ago it was my privilege to have lunch with a very prominent American intellectual. We spoke about many things, and eventually also about the admission of Red China to the UN. I say I am not being original, because this interesting remark was made by this prominent American, i.e. that there are many factors that gave rise to President Nixon&#x2019;s decision to bring about Red China&#x2019;s entry to the United Nations Organization, eventually at the cost of Nationalist China. He said that one of President <span class="col_857-858" refersTo="page_0445"/>Nixon&#x2019;s decisive considerations was his essential fear of a possible conflict between Russia and Red China. In President Nixon&#x2019;s opinion it would have been easier for him to prevent such a war between Red China and Russia if he could include the latter within the framework of the United Nations Organization. According to this American, President Nixon&#x2019;s fear was contained in the knowledge that such a war would be a nuclear war from the very start. This would have led to the radioactive pollution of this entire planet of ours, with the concomitant loss of life.</p>

<p>I mention this merely for the sake of interest because it indicates to me that our people are continually giving attention to this very important matter. I represent a primarily agricultural constituency. When we as farmers think of the protection of the environment, we naturally think first of the soil from which we have to make a living. Last year the hon. member for Orange Grove made a very interesting statement here with respect to air pollution. The hon. member may correct me, but I think he said that 31 per cent of our atmosphere consists of clouds. In passing I just want to mention that in the past few days we have read from Press reports that there are certain metropolitan areas where air pollution has increased to such an extent that even if a person did not smoke he would still inhale the equivalent of the smoke of 23 cigarettes merely as a result of air pollution. The hon. member pointed out that there are schools in certain provinces where physical exercise is no longer allowed in order to prevent too much of this polluted air from being inhaled. Clever people tell us that if the cloud mass of 31 per cent is increased to 36 per cent, the temperature of this planet could decrease by 4 degrees Centigrade. Whether they were being pessimistic I do not know, but they say this could be the precursor of a new ice age.</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast also referred to the pollution of our oceans, with special reference to oil pollution. The fact of the matter, according to information now at our disposal, is that thousands of square miles of our oceans are already covered with a thin layer of oil, thinner at some places, thicker at others. Mr. Speaker, this oil pollution process that is now taking place affects the normal evaporation from the ocean as we knew it. On the one hand we have the air pollution which, according to these people, can affect the temperature of our planet, causing it to decrease. On the other hand, the pollution of the oceans is affecting the process of natural evaporation. If we bring these two aspects together, so they say, there must be an eventual effect on our rainfall. We already have an inkling that there is something wrong. We who live in close proximity to the soil are already finding that there is a disturbance in the rainfall we have known in our lifetime. If this process should continue, with problems developing in respect of our rainfall, we could not keep the condition of our forests and grasslands as we would like to keep them, no matter how good a conservation farming programme may be established.</p>

<p>For those reasons I want to try to indicate that this pollution process is so serious that we must give attention to it. I want to try to prove that henceforh attention will be given to it. We also want to record that we very gratefully note that progress is nevertheless being made, not only here, but also throughout the world. Newspaper reports indicated to us the other day that life is returning to certain parts of the mighty Thames River in London, parts that had been completely dead for years. For that reason we are therefore grateful that progress is, after all, being made. We are also grateful that this Government is doing its share in respect of this very serious problem. We would also like to believe that we shall make tremendous progress. I can give the hon. member for South Coast the assurance that under his guidance and with the machinery at his disposal the hon. the Minister of Planning will still be giving us a great deal of help in respect of this matter.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. VAN ECK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House appreciate the fact that the previous speaker, the hon. member for Smithfield, did not oppose us in connection with this motion, and that he joined the Government and that side of the House in realizing the importance and the implications of this big problem.</p>

<p>We know that pollution is no new problem. For thousands of years man has lived on the scrap-heaps of his self-polluted environment. Archaeologists are today digging in those scrap-heaps, shell-heaps and bones where prehistoric man lived.</p>

<speech by="#van_eck">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. VAN ECK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before lunch I began by saying that the pollution of the environment is not a new problem. Today archaeologists are digging in the scrap-heaps and the remains where prehistoric man lived amongst the castaway bones and skins and under the soot-stained walls of the caves of his environment. Historians tell us that the fall of the Roman Empire is attributable to the loss of the land&#x2019;s fertility through the Roman sewers. As far back as the 14th century there was legislation in Britain limiting fires and smoke while the British Parliament sat.</p>

<p>It is visible pollution which generally goes against the grain and creates antipathy in the human heart. There are the pieces of paper and plastic bags that the southeaster blows against hedges, and the tins and bottles that lie around. The old swimming holes we enjoyed so much in childhood years are today polluted by glass splinters and tins, to such an extent that one cannot venture into them barefoot. We cannot lie on the beaches because of the cigarette butts pressed into the sand, the oil stains, etc. This pollution reduces the quality and standard of our living. I do not think there is any person in South Africa, with any measure of sensitivity for the beauty of his environment, who does not object to that.</p>

<p>The less evident pollution is undoubtedly much more dangerous. There is, for example, the unprocessed sewerage water that still pours into our streams and harbours daily at various places. In our own generation, only a few years ago, we could still catch beautiful fish in Cape Town harbour, but trying to get any fish there today is out of the question. Just recently the pre-cooling installation in Cape Town harbour gave in completely, with tremendous repercussions because this happened in the middle of the fruit season. The reason for this was the pollution of seawater by various ships which simply throw everything overboard. This polluted seawater is circulated through the cooling pipes to cool that pre-cooling system. The bacteria and sewage in that seawater stick to the cooling pipes, mussels begin to develop and then one finds that at those spots electrolytic voltages develop. Eventually those cooling pipes rust to such an extent that everything collapses. The cost of repairing that pre-cooling unit amounted to something like R80 000. What the cost was in the loss of fruit exports has still to be determined.</p>

<p>Air pollution is another problem we encounter, particularly in the urban areas. The burning of South African coal, which contains a large percentage of sulphur, and motor exhaust gases are the cause of sulphurdioxide in our air. This causes corrosion in the metalwork of buildings, it erodes the paint and is also tremendously detrimental to our health. We know that by the end of the century our coal-using power sources will be consuming five times the amount of coal they do today. This also means that the smoke pollution will increase fivefold. I think this would create an absolutely impossible situation if we do not really begin doing something about it today.</p>

<p>In agriculture destruction is brought about on a large scale and over a wide area. We see how an imbalance in nature is created by injudicious and continuous over-grazing. We see how the farmers livestock, which almost exclusively eat grass, have destroyed some of South Africa&#x2019;s best grasslands, where in the past game roamed and trekked with the seasons to places where the veld was good and rain had fallen. In the catchment area of the Hendrik Verwoerd Dam alone 32 000 ha of excellent grassland have already been totally destroyed. We also see how in that area, according to the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, 1&#x00BD; million ha of good grazing has deteriorated to such an extent that in actual fact it ought to be withdrawn as grazing.</p>

<p>South Africa can definitely not afford this type of destruction. Perhaps it has become time for us to revalue and change the basic establishment of the agricultural economy so that the farmers will not be forced to violate nature in order to make a living from the veld and try to obtain quick profits. The disturbance of the balance of nature by the farming community cannot as yet be properly appreciated or determined. The number of cattle have doubled over the past 70 years. We see how the entire Highveld, which was once under grass, has to a large extent been ploughed up and now there are hectares on hectares of ploughed land. What the effect of that on the ecology is going to be, has not yet been properly determined. We also see how large areas have been given over to plantations. In 1918 <span class="col_861-862" refersTo="page_0447"/>only 250 000 ha of South Africa&#x2019;s surface area had been planted with trees. Today 2 million ha have been afforested. In 1910 there were not even 250 000 ha under irrigation. Today there are 750 000 ha under irrigation. We do not yet know exactly what the effect on the ecology will be. We know that 110 000 ha of veld and mountains in the south-western Cape have already been infested with hakea. That hakea was planted here in the 19th century to combat drift sand.</p>

<p>We also see how in recent years thousands of rands have been spent in trying to combat that hakea by means of the application of biological and mechanical measures and weedkillers. Thus far, however, they have not been able to solve that problem. 35 000 ha of grazing in Natal have been contaminated by <i>lantana camara</i> and are unsuitable for grazing. We see how the Rubus species, the American blackberry, has already made 1 300 000 ha unsuitable for grazing in South Africa. Jointed cactus pollution has contaminated about 2 million ha of land in South Africa and has spread over 94 magisterial districts. Bush encroachment is becoming a tremendous problem over large portions of South Africa.</p>

<p>It is calculated, by people like Mr. Charlie Donaldson of Vryburg, that in the Northern Cape and in the Malopo area about 1 million ha of land have been overrun by hookthorn, i.e. <i>Acacia melliferu.</i> In the Eastern Province 350 000 ha have become overgrown with Karoo thorn. 12 million ha of land have been destroyed by bush encroachment. These are the problems we are faced with as a result of the farmer&#x2019;s malpractices, chiefly due to ignorance.</p>

<p>If we turn to the water pollution of rivers by chemicals from the drains of factories, pollution by artificial fertilizers and chemical weedkillers, we find ourselves really faced by very serious problems. This has resulted in the large-scale extermination of fish at places like Douglas. The American bald eagle could simply not breed as a result of all this indirect pollution of the water. These artificial fertilizers &#x2014; DDT, etc.&#x2014;are multiplied and stored by the food chains and eventually go from the bacteria to the insect, from the insect to the fish, from the fish to the sea eagle and accumulate in the fat of the animals, totally upsetting their breeding habits.</p>

<p>Even South Africa&#x2019;s biggest schemes, such as our dams, are suspect today, and it is realized that even those lovely schemes which are regarded by us as assets to the whole of South Africa, can disrupt the delicate balance of nature. It is realized that the weight of those big dams, which collect a tremendous amount of water, eventually indent the earth&#x2019;s crust to such an extent that earthquakes develop. At large dams in the U.S.A. and Kariba, earthquakes that can be measured on seismographs regularly occur. As a result of pleas by nature conservationists in the United States we also see that they have succeeded in constructing fish ladders at some of the dams so that the salmon that annually swim upstream to lay their eggs can reach the breeding grounds. At the sources of some of these rivers they have established fishing stations where they breed these fish. In the past they collected annual harvests of fish at these stations. Now they find that as a result of the tremendously large dams, although the fish are still able to swim up the river and even up these fish ladders, there is a problem involved. The problem is that after a short while they are so exhausted that they turn over and die. On closer investigation it appears that these fish do not die of exhaustion, but as a result of the fact that the water that runs over the dam wall is so oxygenated and hydrogenated by the oxygen in the air that the fish actually die of the bends, the same condition that divers have when they rise too fast from the sea depths.</p>

<p>We see what a tremendous revolution the Nasser Dam at Aswan in Egypt caused in the ecology, the eco-system. They constructed this tremendously huge dam with the purpose of serving the irrigation areas there and found that it was perhaps a greater disadvantage than asset to Egypt, because as a result of the tremendous dam above the bank, the silt load sank down and the silt, which was spread over the land by the floodwaters in the past, is now being dammed up. Today they must spend thousands upon thousands of rands to buy fertilizers to prepare those irrigation lands artificially. Something worse has also taken place. They have found that the percentage of bilharzia contamination has increased tremendously as a result of the fact that these canals now stand full of water year in and year out, instead of only being full in the season when the river comes down. They have found that as a result of the removal of the silt load in the water, the Nile; River is eating ever deeper into <span class="col_863-864" refersTo="page_0448"/>its bed and the banks are getting ever higher. It is therefore becoming more difficult to get the water on to the lands, lands that were regularly flooded by water every year. They have even found that the Mediterranean&#x2019;s fishing catches are being detrimentally affected by this, because all the nutrients that came from the highlands in Africa, have now also disappeared. These fishing catches were amongst Egypt&#x2019;s most important sources of protein. I know that the Department of Water Affairs and their engineers are only to keen to construct dams at suitable spots. However, we wonder whether they always bear the ecological repercussions of those big dams in mind and whether they really weigh up the advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<p>There are numerous organizations that concern themselves with these matters and are really interested in them. There are various nature conservation bodies in South Africa, like the National Veld Trust. We know that the CSIR does research in this connection, and has produced excellent work in the past. Then there is the South African Nature Union and associations such as the Environmental Control Association and numerous others. We on this side of the House feel that the time has come for all these bodies&#x2019; valuable work to be co-ordinated. We also feel that the time has come for a body to be created with the purpose of doing this work. We feel that there would be nothing better than an additional ministry that can handle these matters. A tremendous amount of information, of facts and knowledge must be gathered, and there is a large amount of information available as a result of research already done in other countries. I should like to second the motion of the speaker on this side of the House, the hon. member for South Coast, who preceded me, that such a ministry be established.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. D. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Smithfield told us this morning that this is not a political debate. I should like to come back to this aspect after I have made a few remarks about what the hon. member, who has just resumed his seat, said. I should like to bring one thing to the hon. member&#x2019;s attention, i.e. that not all progress entails mere pollution. We must maintain a balance in this matter. The first part of the hon. member&#x2019;s speech simply condemned all developments as being pollutionary. It is very irresponsible to make such statements in a country like South Africa, which is in the process of development. Had the hon. member made those statements of his with greater qualification, we would probably have got a little further with this matter. Take, for example, the hon. member&#x2019;s reference to hook-thorn in the Northern Cape and in the Vryburg-Mafeking district. There was a period in that part of our country&#x2019;s history when certain kinds of bush were also regarded as a form of pollution. Today, specifically as a result of development, particularly technical development, we would like to have that type of bush there again, but it was exterminated. To merely speak of the hook-thorn today as &#x201C;pollution&#x201D;, shows me that the hon. member does not really have any idea of the function of hook-thorn in any forested area. I must dissociate myself from the hon. member for Smithfield when he says that this is not a political debate. I think the hon. member for Smithfield would also understand this. Let us analyse what the respected member for South Coast, who has been here for years, said this morning. He lodged a plea for a new ministry, a new department, etc. That is at least what he is asking for in his motion. But what does the hon. member do&#x003F; He says he is seeking a man with the necessary personality to handle this matter, knowing full-well that the hon. the Minister of Planning and his Department, the Secretary of which is also sitting in the House today&#x2014;he even acknowledged as much in his speech&#x2014;must take action against pollution. Sir, if this is not blatant politics, then my judgment is far removed from the truth. The hon. member stands up and says that we must get a minister who has the right personality; he goes further and says that we must look for that minister outside this House. I take it the hon. member would like to have said that we should get that minister from the other side of the House.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. D. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>Hon. members on that side say &#x201C;Hear, hear!&#x201D; I therefore take it that if we must look for that minister on the other side of the House, it would probably be, on the recommendation of that side of the House, the hon. member for South Coast. We now have to listen to this irresponsible utterance from the hon. member for South Coast to the effect that the hon. the Minister of Planning does not have the personality <span class="col_865-866" refersTo="page_0449"/>to handle this Ministry. We cannot let that remark of the hon. member for South Coast pass unnoticed, neither can we allow his remark about the Department do so, because the hon. member acknowledged that he was aware of the existence of such circumstances.</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast moved a motion in which he requests a ministry to handle environmental pollution. We must first ask ourselves where we find pollution, who causes it and what machinery the State has at its disposal today for combating pollution. On the question of where we find pollution, the answer was very clearly given last year in the debate about the private motion which the hon. member for Orange Grove moved here, i.e. that it is to be found in the six recognized spheres to which the hon. member for Smithfield also referred. Sir, those recognized six spheres in which we find pollution today, are connected with human activities, and the question as to who causes pollution must be given the positive answer, i.e. that man and his activities themselves are the cause of pollution. The hon. member for Smithfield referred to the question of the cloud content of our atmosphere. If this increases from 31 per cent to 36 per cent we would have a decrease of four degrees Centigrade in our temperature. Sir, it is man who causes this pollution of the air. There is another aspect of this pollution and of water-pollution that I find very important, i.e. that by calculation at present each South African throws away about 15 pounds of waste per day. This waste is involved in personal hygiene, and because this is so I think the time has come for us in South Africa to include pollution control as a full-fledged subject in the new subject we have introduced into our education system, i.e. the question of youth viability. We can then make our children aware of this problem at an early age. Sir, what is very important is that this aspect of pollution control should also be conveyed to our Coloured and Bantu populations in South Africa. Those people are also involved in the question of pollution, and that is one of the reasons why we cannot simply say that we must establish a Ministry of Pollution. Notwithstanding the fact that the hon. member for South Coast made a tremendous fuss here last year and asked whether we had reached the &#x201C;point of no return&#x201D; as far as self-rule for Bantu homelands is concerned, it is also necessary for us to know that within the Bantu homelands this question of pollution will be handled by the Bantu homelands&#x2019; own authorities, because if we handle it on our part we would not obtain the useful results we would obtain if the problem were handled by the authorities in the Bantu homelands themselves.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_walt">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. D. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>That hon. member may make his own speech. Sir, I have already mentioned that environmental pollution should be introduced as a school subject. Looking at the question of pollution, we must also know that a consensus of opinion amongst individuals themselves is the most essential element in the prevention of any pollution. I want to mention an idea that came to me. A year or two ago we had great success in the celebration of the Water Year. With the celebration of the Water Year we made our people water conscious. Today I want to propose that the hon. the Minister should give consideration to a similar item being introduced in our future programme&#x2014;perhaps the year after next&#x2014;for the celebration of an environmental protection year in South Africa in which we can then latch onto the brood consensus of opinion of the public and spur them on towards prevention of this pollution we are experiencing today. I think this would be of practical use; it would prevent each isolated group of people trying to create the impression that they oppose pollution, while in reality we do not capture the consensus of opinion of our people. I am also of the opinion that we shall not capture the consensus of opinion merely by the creation of a department to control pollution. It must be something that grips their imagination and really allows the idea to penetrate to each individual&#x2019;s personal attention that the question of pollution is of importance to us.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for South Coast also said that today there are various bodies trying to combat pollution. I want to acknowledge that he is right, but I also want to allege that the question of pollution cannot that easily be a co-ordinated action because the combating of pollution requires specialized knowledge in each specific field. In that connection I merely want to refer to two Acts we passed here in the House recently. I refer in the first place to section 3 of the Water Amendment Act of <span class="col_867-868" refersTo="page_0450"/>last year where certain steps were taken with specific reference to water-pollution. Steps were taken not only to prevent water-pollution, but penal provisions were also introduced into that Act for those contravening the law. But do you know, Sir, that last year neither the hon. member for South Coast nor the Opposition said our punishments were too light, nor did they say last year that the Act was not a fitting one. No, the hon. members were quite satisfied with that relevant Act. In the same breath I refer also to Act 67 of 1971, the Oil Pollution Act, to give it this title for the sake of brevity. The Act was dealt with here by the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs. Scientific provisions were laid down about the action to be taken specifically with respect to oil pollution at sea, etc. I now want to know from the hon. member for South Coast who is better able to judge, as far as water is concerned, whether water pollution or the wrong allocation of water is taking place or not, than specifically the Department of Water Affairs, those people who have specialized knowledge of the public waters of our country. And who is more conversant with the question of the economic implications of, for example, the pollution of the surface of our seas, than specifically the Department of Economic Affairs, which also handles, <i>inter alia,</i> fisheries and such matters&#x003F; Under the hon. the Minister of Health provisions have already been introduced in our health legislation in terms of which industrial hygiene is controlled and administered by the Minister of Health and his Department. Where could we obtain a better body to handle this than the Minister of Health and his Department&#x003F; We know that the hon. the Minister of Planning and his Department, from the nature of the Department&#x2019;s composition, is an overlapping Department, one established essentially to co-ordinate. If then the Minister of Planning and his Department handle these matters in an overlapping capacity, surely we have exactly what the hon. member for South Coast requests, except that we then do not have, according to the hon. member for South Coast, a minister with the necessary personality. The machinery we do have. The hon. member for South Coast simply does not want to see the relevant minister there. Let me assure the hon. the Minister that he need not have sleepless nights about the remarks of the hon. member for South Coast. That is how it goes if one has been sitting here for years and no longer knows what to say.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that we must accept the fact that combating the essential aspects of pollution in South Africa, does not lie in merely creating another department with a minister or whatever the case may be. The hon. member said the Department is of no importance to him; the Minister is of importance because he must have the personality. We do not find this of such great importance, but what we do find of really great importance is to capture the consensus of opinion of our people in South Africa and show them the dangers of pollution. If we begin there I believe we will be preventing pollution in South Africa, because we would then be guiding the people and their ideas towards regarding pollution as a danger equal to any other disease attacking the human body. This is much more important than the creation of any department.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN </person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think we are really indebted to the hon. member for South Coast and to the hon. member for Smithfield for their approach to this problem today, on the occasion of this our second important debate on this matter. I am sorry that I cannot say the same for the hon. member for Christiana, who has just spoken. I do not think any hon. member on the other side can accuse me of not availing myself of any opportunity to make a political speech whenever such an opportunity presents itself. But I want to assure you, Sir, that I am not going to be tempted into doing so.</p>

<p>Who started it</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN </person>:</from>

<p>Whilst I only want to reply to one of the observations made by the hon. member for Christiana, this should not be regarded in a political light. He mentioned that it was important that we should also get the Bantu, and especially the Bantu in the homelands, to look after the conservation of our natural scenery. In that respect I agree with him. But he alluded to the policy of independent Bantustans. I do not wish to go into that. I just want to point out to him that one of the problems the Government will have to attend to, is that if those territories are granted more independence and more control over their own areas, it may be dangerous to our country, especially in <span class="col_869-870" refersTo="page_0451"/>view of the fact that they control such extensive catchment areas of our own rivers. Other than that I have nothing to say about the hon. member for Christiana in this debate. I have no wish to reply to points in which he accused us of blatant politics and irresponsibility. I do not wish to address him in such terms. I shall leave him at that.</p>

<p>I think hon. members on both sides will perhaps be interested in the steps we have taken here in the United. Party in regard to this major problem, steps to which they have quite possibly begun to give thought, or have perhaps considered already. I regard it as a fairly important step that, with the approval of our Leader, we decided in the United Party caucus&#x2014;I do not want to say what happened in the caucus&#x2014;to form a special group to deal exclusively with the ecology and the pollution of the environment. I think that under the capable chairmanship of the hon. member for South Coast, and with the hon. member for Benoni as a capable secretary, that group can do good work and offer cooperation to the hon. members opposite in regard to the major problem with which we are dealing here. I think we may tell hon. Ministers that that, in particular, group is going to study every piece of legislation from the point of view of pollution, and will then try to make a contribution.</p>

<p>As the hon. member for Smithfield said, I introduced a motion in this regard last year, and I hope that our criticism at the time was constructive. In the main that criticism was based on our feeling that the Government was not doing enough in this regard, but at the time we were prepared to ask the hon. the Minister what the Government&#x2019;s plans were. Subsequent to that he indicated to us last year, firstly, that he was engaged in drafting a report to the Cabinet on this major problem, and we were satisfied with that. He rejected the suggestion of a separate Ministry of Planning, although he said that he was doing so in his personal capacity and that that was actually a matter for the hon. the Prime Minister himself, which, of course, was correct at that stage. Perhaps he can give us more information in this regard this afternoon. We read that a Cabinet committee had been appointed. I do not know whether it is under his chairmanship or under that of the hon. the Prime Minister, but a Cabinet committee was appointed. In that regard he also announced that that Cabinet committee would also deal with the question of pollution and take further decisions in that regard. I hope he will be able to tell us what progress that Cabinet committee is making, and I hope that he will not tell us that it has been decided to dissolve that committee and to transfer the work to the Auxiliary Committee of the Planning Advisory Council on Pollution, as I understand it is called. This is a committee which has been established and on which representatives of a large number of departments are serving, but to my mind it does not have enough powers to ensure that this major problem is tackled as required by modern times.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The picture, as we look at it, even as it has developed during the past year, is becoming more and more frightening. Our soil and the products of our soil are being poisoned by pesticides. There is a committee, I believe, going into the problem of pesticides in South Africa and I trust they will bring out a favourable report as the time is becoming short, particularly in view of the danger presented by organo-chlorine compounds entering our foodstuffs in the cycle which was expounded so well by the hon. member for South Coast. They prove fatal to bird life and have been proved to be injurious to human beings, and this danger is steadily growing. Under South African law today, all our fruit exports have to be monitored for their pesticide content, but the anomalous position is that our fruit which are sold in South Africa itself, and which we buy in the shops, is not being controlled to the extent that one would like to see. The Press report of last year that I read, reports that there was actually no control unless specific complaints were made to the Department of Health. I think that is an anomaly that deserves the attention of the hon. the Minister of Planning, or whoever is looking after these matters.</p>

<p>The position is becoming frightening, I said, in other countries too. The German Federal Commissioner for Nature Conservation stated a few weeks ago that in recent years one million people who had been certified as having died of heart disease, actually died of air pollution. We know the tragic instance when 4 000 people died in London when that terrible smog overtook it several years ago. It has been established in Western Germany that there are cancer-producing carbohydrates in car exhaust fumes, house fires and in industrial fire installations. The position in the great urban <span class="col_871-872" refersTo="page_0452"/>complexes of Japan is so serious at present that they have oxygen boxes in certain centres. Any member of the public walking in the street or driving in a motor car and who feels overcome by fumes, can go to these oxygen boxes, take out an oxygen mask and breathe some pure air to restore him. So bad the position has become in other countries. In our own country one of our biggest problems is the Vaal River basin.</p>

<p>*More than 30 per cent of our population and 40 per cent of our gross national product come from the Vaal Triangle. In a symposium recently held by the S.A.I.I.A. in Johannesburg, Prof. Van Buren, a professor of ecology at Pretoria&#x2014;a capable person&#x2014;calculated how the water of the Vaal River, as one moved away from its source, was becoming more and more polluted. In the upper reaches of the Vaal River, at Villiers, it contains only 150 milligram of solid matter per litre. As one goes down the river, this becomes more and more until it eventually reaches 500 milligram per litre, i.e. three times as much. At Vereeniging it is 2 000 milligram per litre. The World Health Organization has laid down that anything from 1 500 milligram upwards amounts to &#x201C;excessive pollution of your water&#x201D;. The Vaal River at Vereeniging has already exceeded this limit.</p>

<p>Why did we introduce this motion&#x003F; We feel that the matter is such a vast one that a few Ministers, however capable they may be, cannot in their own spheres give all the attention to this matter through consultation and through an advisory committee alone. There has to be a ministry or a person who can give guidance in these matters and say what has to be done. There are quite a number of departments that are dealing with this question of pollution. The Department of Water Affairs for instance, has to deal with water pollution. But nobody will deny that there are not enough inspectors in the department to investigate the matter.</p>

<p>Unfortunately.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN </person>:</from>

<p>Yes, unfortunately. I agree. In view of the present manpower shortage&#x2014;for which I do not wish to blame anybody&#x2014;this is simply the position. We do not have enough inspectors and the water is being polluted. Doubts have already been expressed as to whether this is in fact the proper department for carrying out this inspection work, or whether this should not rather be done by inspectors from a central department, say, the Ministry of Environment. The Department of Agriculture has a great deal to do with this, especially as regards fertilizers and sprays, the dangers they present and the control over them. The Department of Forestry is involved in this matter as regards the waste areas and the protection of certain natural areas. Then there are, of course, the forestry plantations. This is a department which is greatly concerned in this matter. I am speaking under correction, but I do not think the Department of Forestry is at the moment represented on his auxiliary committee. I want to suggest to him&#x2014;perhaps there are many good reasons why this has not been done&#x2014;that I think it is perhaps important that the Department of Forestry should also be represented on that committee.</p>

<p>I have already spoken about Bantu administration. The Department of Bantu Administration has a major task in seeing to it that the waters of our large rivers in the Bantu areas are protected more effectively. The difficulty is that the hon. the Minister of Planning cannot tell the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration or the hon. the Minister of Agriculture to do this or that. Similarly, the hon. the Minister of Agriculture cannot tell the hon. the Minister of Planning to do this or that. That is why we feel that there should be a special body at the top. A key ministry is Health. It is concerned with the pollution of our food, of the air and of our water. The hon. the Minister&#x2014;and I think he can speak from bitter experience&#x2014;has his difficulties when it comes to other departments. For instance, last year he had such an experience with the hon. the Minister of Transport in regard to the pollution of the air by the South African Railways. But I do not want to talk politics, Mr. Speaker. The hon. the Minister of National Education performed a very good task when recently, on the occasion of opening a symposium in Stellenbosch or Pretoria, he pointed out the importance of education in this regard. His department can make a great contribution to this matter. I feel that the hon. the Minister realizes what can be done. Once again, he cannot say what the other departments should do&#x2014;they are equal colleagues of his. Then there is the Department of Economic Affairs and of Commerce and Industries which deals with oil, a matter which was expounded so well by the hon. member for South Coast.</p>

<p><span class="col_873-874" refersTo="page_0453"/>&#x2020;Then there is the Division of Sea Fisheries which falls under that department. There is also the Division of State Guano Islands. All these departments are doing work to a greater or lesser extent. They are aware of the problem but then again there is not that co-ordination which is needed.</p>

<p>Mines have the problem of dust pollution. I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister of Mines that he may be able to use his authority in conjunction with the hon. the Minister of Planning, to do what they are now doing in Germany, i.e. putting atomic waste from the atomic power plant in old disused mines. It is a possibility; I do not know whether it is practicable. It is one field where there can be co-ordination between two departments.</p>

<p>I see my friend the hon. the Minister of Community Development is here. Again I speak under correction, but I do not believe that his department serves on this special advisory committee. He does important work in regard to town planning, work which does affect the environment as such. He has other important work which has to be done, e.g. advising on the type of buildings to be erected and, for instance, the type of coal stoves to be used. Hon. members will remember the progress that has been made in regard to smokeless fuel stoves. The hon. the Minister knows about it. Being a Minister closely associated with the development of the environment, he also should have a representative on that particular advisory committee. So I could go on.</p>

<p>It might sound strange for me to say that the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs should also be represented on that committee. You have developments such as the Cabora Bassa Dam and the Kunene River project which are international. There were also developments associated with Botswana about which the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs had discussions with Sir Seretse Khama. It all shows how important it is that Foreign Affairs should also be represented.</p>

<p>This problem is today receiving attention in other countries. Great Britain already has a Department of Environment. America has a Secretary for Environment under the President. America has one day every year&#x2014;they call it &#x201C;Earth Day&#x201D;&#x2014;in which environment and pollution is the one great problem which everybody on that day tries to face and tries to do something about. Germany has a Cabinet Committee at the moment for the environment and they are planning a federal bureau for the environment.</p>

<p>I wish to conclude. In South Africa we are also asking for a ministry for the environment, a ministry which will have power, not limitless, dictatorial power, but power, in regard to issues involving the environment, to put its foot down. I have seen some good suggestions. I have seen an excellent one from the Veld Trust, which I am not giving as official United Party policy; it is a suggestion by Mr. T. C, Robertson that there should, for instance, be a bureau of ecological standards, by which ecological standards should be laid down. Such a bureau could then act and also be representative at people outside the Government, and could advise the hon. the Minister in regard to the laying down of these ecological standards, which could then be applied by his ministry.</p>

<p>The problem is a serious one. It is growing more and more serious, and I am glad to note from speeches from both sides of the House that we are agreed on the gravity and the vital aspect of this problem. I trust that drastic and important steps will be taken to prevent the decay of the earth, and on that part of it where we live&#x2014;our country, South Africa.</p>

<p>When I approached the Executive Committee of Natal to ask them if I could proclaim Natal in terms of sections 4 and 6 of the Physical Planning Act, which deals with the changed usage of land, they said: &#x201C;No, you keep your hands off Natal.&#x201D; At a banquet in Durban last year, which was also attended by five members from Natal, I told the people present that I was prepared to do the planning job in South Africa, but that I wanted to do it in co-operation with everybody concerned.

<p>Exactly. What is action taken in regard to the changed usage of land other than steps to protect the environment&#x003F; If a farmer starts a quarry on his farm near to a township, I maintain that he is changing the usage of that ground and that he has to come to me for permission to do so. If this is not done, the whole countryside may be spoiled. Is this not protecting the environment&#x003F; But when I want to do this in Natal they tell me to keep my hands off Natal. The hon. member for South Coast says that I must tell them what to do and must take the powers to do so. He says that we need a special kind of man for the job and that I do not have the character or the personality to do it. He suggests that I must find somebody to do the job for me.</p>

<p>Now I want to say what I would have said if the hon. member had not made parts of the speech he made this morning. I want to say that I welcome the motion of the hon. member for South Coast in so far as it provides us with an opportunity to turn our attention to the most indespensable and important component of our lives, namely our environment, once again. I want to thank hon. members on both sides of the House, including the hon. member <span class="col_877-878" refersTo="page_0455"/>for South Coast, for their contributions to this discussion and I would like to felicitate them on the preparation and the contents of their speeches. Surely this is a very wide subject which covers our entire lives: the air we breathe, the water we drink and use for various purposes, the earth we have to live and work on. There is not one Government department or an authority, provincial or local, that is not concerned with this very vital matter. The whole private sector has an interest in this matter. Hon. members have very ably discussed all aspects of the environment. It was once again a pleasure listening to everybody. On the positive side they have shown how necessary it is to plan and to preserve. We must conserve our natural resources and the land on which we produce our food. We must proclaim our botanical gardens, our natural reserves and our national parks. We must be conscious of the beauty and importance of our mountains and the vegetation which covers them. We must guard jealously over our rivers and our inland water resources to keep them pure, unsoiled and unsilted, if possible. We must store their contents and use and re-use our available water supplies very judiciously. For the seas that lap our shores we must indeed be thankful, never take them for granted, but keep them as clean as possible as hon. members have said time and again during this debate. At the same time we must preserve and cultivate the marine life with which we are blessed. Let us always remember, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen of this House, how much poorer we in South Africa would have been in all respects if we had been a land-locked country. In the development of our towns, cities and regions we must prepare, and work on responsible guidelines, siting correctly our residential, industrial and other areas, our transport networks and other systems.</p>

<p>Hon. members have also fully dealt with the negative aspects of the subiect of the environment, namely pollution. I need not recapitulate what has been said. We are all agreed that we must take due notice and act both on the positive and negative aspects while there is still time. Mr. Speaker, the motion covers just that; its wording prescribes what we should do. The motion reads:</p>

<block name="quote">That this House requests the Government to consider the advisability of establishing a State Department under its own Minister charged with the protection of the environment &#x2026;</block>

<p>Let us first take a look at what is being done in other countries. In Great Britain they have a Ministry and a Department of the Environment, which is very much akin to our Department of Planning. I grant that it has a number of additional functions. Since 1970 they also have a Royal Commission which advises the Government on pollution matters, both in the national and international fields. This Royal Commission could be likened to the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Planning Advisory Council. Since last year Canada has had a Minister of the Environment who, true to Canadian constitutional law, as we all know, has all the functions and powers not already entrusted to other authorities, central or state. In Australia the various states each have a Department of the Environment. They are at present drafting the necessary legislation. In the U.S.A., as has been said here, all the states have enactments of some kind or the other aimed at combating various forms of pollution of the environment. On the federal level they have a Council for the Environment in terms of their law of 1970. This council is more or less the policy-making authority for the U.S.A.</p>

<p>For the record and because I think it is of interest, I want to briefly give the governmental set-up in some other countries. Denmark has a Minister of Traffic and Environment. In Austria the Minister for Health is also responsible for the prevention of pollution of the environment.</p>

<p>He is angry with me. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Germany has been quoted in this debate quite a number of times because such excellent work is being done there. In Germany they do not have a Ministry of the Environment. They are planning to establish a separate department in the near future. That is correct. However, all the excellent work that they have been doing, has been done under the Ministry of Science and under the Minister of Economics. In Greece the Department of the Interior is responsible for the prevention of pollution. The Argentine has legislation on pollution which falls under the Minister of <span class="col_879-880" refersTo="page_0456"/>Health. France recently established a department of the environment. In Norway they are at present considering the establishment of a separate ministry. Israel has a Minister of Health who caters for the problems of the environment. I can carry on in this way. The Netherlands has a Ministry of Public Health and Environment, while the Minister of Economic Affairs is also responsible.</p>

<p>*To mention Japan as well, they have twelve laws and various bodies dealing with the combating of pollution. For instance, they have a metropolitan council for the prevention of pollution and a bureau for environmental conservation. I mention these facts to show that there is no uniform pattern in the world, although it is a world problem, as all hon. members quite rightly said. The hon. member for Benoni has pointed out that this is a problem which has already been in existence for 2 000 years, but the fact nevertheless remains that in recent years, in view of this highly industrialized decade we have entered, and the population explosion, it has become an acute world problem. There is no uniform pattern in the world. According to its circumstances and problems, every country has created the machinery which suits it best and which in its opinion is capable of producing the best results for its country.</p>

<p>Let us take a look now at the machinery which we have already established in South Africa and which we still intend establishing or which is still in the process of being established. Having done so, we may in fact ask ourselves whether it is or will be adequate, or whether we should establish other machinery. The hon. member for Orange Grove asked me to discuss this matter further. At the end of 1970 a standing Cabinet committee on pollution was established. At the moment only four Ministers are serving on this committee, i.e. the Ministers of Health, Economic Affairs, Water Affairs and Planning.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No. At the moment the primary task of this committee is in fact only to control and check whether adequate provision is made for the conservation of the environment and for combating pollution in all its forms. At the moment the senior Minister, namely the Minister of Health, is the chairman of that Cabinet committee. With a view to these objectives this Cabinet committee enlisted the assistance of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Planning Advisory Council and the C.S.I.R. as its scientific arm. These two bodies&#x2014;or rather the committee constituted out of them by the Planning Advisory Council &#x2014;have already submitted a report, i.e. after receiving the request from the special Cabinet committee. I can only tell the House today that this is a very detailed and comprehensive report, which is a thorough piece of work. It is truly a work of high quality on the environment and pollution in South Africa.</p>

<p>I wish you would table it.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I have asked the Secretary for Planning to have the contents of the report condensed into an abridged version in order that we may find it easier to work with it in our deliberations in the Cabinet committee. Subsequent to that I shall submit the matter to the Cabinet committee again, and that body will, in turn, probably take the matter to the Cabinet. I think it is possible&#x2014;in fact, I think it is probable, although I cannot anticipate the matter&#x2014;that after that the Cabinet committee will, with extensions, remain in existence as a standing supervisory committee on pollution. Furthermore, it is possible&#x2014;and personally that is what I expect&#x2014;that my Department of Planning will be designated as the Government department charged with this great and important task, and as the umbrella and coordinating State body in regard to all environmental matters. Hon. members must bear in mind that in this matter the Minister of Planning has two very strong and important arms. His main arm is the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Planning Advisory Council, which falls under the Minister of Planning. It will then be possible for this advisory council, through a standing committee&#x2014;let us call it an auxiliary committee, for they work with the system of auxiliary committees&#x2014;to serve as the co-ordinating, advisory and investigatory arm or body bringing together all bodies for both general purposes and specific tasks and problems. The hon. member for South Coast referred to a capable person today, and he mentioned the name of Prof. Ahrens. I do not know this person, but I remembered his name. If there is a sphere in which</p>

<p><span class="col_881-882" refersTo="page_0458"/>investigation has to be carried out, the Planning Advisory Council enlists the services of people from the private sector, people from universities, people like Prof. Ahrens and all the experts it can find in order to investigate that specific problem. If it investigates pollution in the Cape Town harbour, it enlists the services of all the people involved in the matter and takes them under the wing of the auxiliary committee concerned. Then they investigate that specific problem. The hon. members mentioned various problems today. Mention was made of Iscor&#x2019;s expenditure on research, of oil pollution, of coal pollution in the air and of soil conservation. If a specific task has to be carried out in regard to soil conservation, the Department of Agriculture and other experts are drawn into the matter by this machinery.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to that. I am dealing with the machinery now. There is no single problem of the environment and no problem of pollution which this machinery cannot handle. In cases where scientific information is required, the Planning Advisory Council liaises with the C.S.I.R., for surely we cannot draw up control measures without their having furnished us with facts based on scientific findings. Having doen that, they approach me as the responsible Minister and then I take the whole matter to the supervisory Cabinet committee. Then it is up to us to go to the body in question. For instance, this may be the provincial authority. Then we can tell the provincial authority that there is a deficiency in respect of certain subjects with which we have to deal, and it is their task to put the matter right since we do not wish to encroach upon their powers. We could tell the Department of Water Affairs that as a department it is responsible for the water resources in South Africa, for its storage, for its distribution and for the conditions on which people may use that water. We do not want to take that responsibility away from them and entrust to other bodies, for if the hon. member for Mooi River, for instance, were an irrigating farmer, he would have to get his water from the Department of Water Affairs and then go to another person who would tell him how to use that water. We have built up a good system, and the Department of Water Affairs can arrange everything. If there is a shortcoming, this central authority can tell the Department of Water Affairs that things are not the way they should be. The same applies to any form of pollution. The hon. member for Orange Grove said that the Department of Water Affairs did not have enough inspectors to do its work. Where is this new department to find the inspectors to do this mighty task which the hon. member wants to entrust to it&#x003F;</p>

<p>I should like to tell the House today that I believe there is no task in respect of the environment which we cannot deal with in this way and which we cannot solve for South Africa. There is not a single problem, negative or positive, that we shall not be able to cope with. That is why I say today that the Government cannot accept the motion for the establishment of a new department&#x2014;I emphasize &#x201C;new&#x201D;&#x2014;under its own Minister. The Prime Minister may in fact&#x2014;this is my personal opinion&#x2014;call the Department of Planning the Department of the Environment in due course. It is his good &#x2026;</p>

<p>No. One must not have eyes only for the work in respect of group areas which is done in terms of section 3 of the Physical Planning Act, and which some people call the more negative work. The Department of Planning is doing wonderful, positive and constructive work on the soil of South Africa. It is giving direction to the extension and the development of this country on the physical level.</p>

<p>Then we come to the waters, the sea and the air, all of which are very important, but once we have created that machinery and if we use the Planning Advisory Council, which can involve the entire private and public sectors, we shall be in a position to do these things. This Planning Advisory Council is not a permanent group of people sitting there. The council itself has a fixed composition, but it operates through committees which are appointed for each individual problem that arises. In those committees it involves the best brain power in the private sector and in the public sector. If we work in this <span class="col_883-884" refersTo="page_0459"/>way and we enlist the C.S.I.R. to throw scientific light on the subject, then I cannot see how we can fail in the objective we are setting ourselves in this House today.</p>

<p>The Department of Water Affairs, the specialist department is the department that deals with the use of water and the discharge of water. According to my information, it does it very well, but if you cannot get satisfaction then, if this machinery is established, I consider that the proper channel would be to come to the Department of Planning which can then see to it that the necessary machinery in connection with a problem is set to work.</p>

<p>When do you expect that machinery to be established&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>As I say, I have already received the report and I have just asked them to condense the report to make the reading of it easier for everybody concerned. The matter will then go back to this Cabinet committee, which will finally report back to the Cabinet, and it will then be for the Cabinet or for the Prime Minister to decide what should be done. I am not saying today what he will do. But if this machinery is set up, this will be the way in which we will try to tackle the problem of environmental pollution in our country.</p>

<p>*We shall, of course, adjust and overhaul the machinery from time to time. Surely, one cannot establish something and then keep it static. Furthermore, I think we shall have to take legislative powers, but I also know that hon. members particularly on the opposite side are not in favour of too strong powerful legislative powers being placed in the hands of the Central Government. But I am telling the House and the country today, without the slightest doubt, that the Department of Planning, assisted by the Planning Advisory Council of the Prime Minister, is already acting as the Department of the Environment. We are more aware of the task and the calling resting on us in this respect, and it is without the slightest doubt that I can repeat what I said a moment ago i.e. that we are making splendid progress in conjunction with other State Departments, the provinces and the local authorities.</p>

<p>May I conclude by just giving the following assurances to the House: Firstly, all aspects of this big, wide, comprehensive subject of the environment are fully appreciated by the Government; we in the Department of Planning are living with them; are studying them and are continuously giving attention to the umbrella aspects of the subject, as well as its numerous details. Secondly, problems of the different forms of pollution are receiving the very best attention and are well cared for, but at the moment we are taking another look specifically at the provision made for the different aspects of pollution. Then, thirdly &#x2014;and this is very important to me&#x2014;whoever does this work, we need the co-operation and the understanding of the entire population and not only of one department, and not only as regards tins, bottles and papers. For that too, but really not only for that. We need the co-operation of the entire population for a positive attitude and steps in respect of the land, the air, the water and the sea, in respect of our environment in the fullest sense, and I may just say that if our adults do not have this, may it start with our children. But such an attitude on the part of all our people will make itself felt everywhere. It will make-itself felt in the public sector and the private sector. Yes, even among all of us; it will influence and activate us to assist and to strive to reach our grand object. What is the object of all of us To create a sound environment which will be able to provide <span class="col_885-886" refersTo="page_0460"/>in the material and spiritual needs of the population of South Africa for all times.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think we are indebted to the hon. the Minister for the serious part of his speech. I think in the first part of his speech there seems to have been a little pique, because the hon. the Minister himself had not been singled out as being the superman that we obviously need in South Africa. But I want to return to the points the hon. the Minister has made. We have established so far that there is a Cabinet Committee of the Ministers of four departments who are charged by the Prime Minister with the oversight and control of pollution in South Africa. I think it has been well said that a camel is a horse which has been designed by a committee, and we on our side feel that the powers which today appear to reside in the hands of this Cabinet Committee would be far better in the hands of one man, a Minister. Whether he is the Minister of something else is not material, but he should be a Minister with the power of his department and access to Government departments and Governments funds which will give him the ability to control the activities which are taking place and which are deleterious to the environment of South Africa. I want to say that this is not a matter of headlines. What we are facing in our country, as every other country of the world has to face, is not a matter of headline. These are not the great occasions, the sudden tremendous oil spills or the tremendous natural disasters. We are facing something which is going to be a constant, deadly, dull grind of surveillance of the whole of the economic life of South Africa and of its domestic life. If we are going to control the activities which in some cases are basic to the economic prosperity of South Africa then, as the hon. the Minister says, I do not believe that the hon. the Minister and his committee have in their hands at this stage the power to enforce decisions upon very, very powerful vested interests. The hon. the Minister mentioned the Department of Water Affairs, the department which is charged with the administration and the control of water in South Africa. One of the greatest shortcomings of the Water Act of 1956 is the fact that there is no effective enforcement agency. There is no agency to which one can go, and it happens time and again that there is pollution of our rivers which leads to massive killing of fish while there is nobody to whom one can turn and who will take it upon himself or upon his department to establish the causes of the pollution, to find out who was responsible for the pollution and to take action under the Water Act, which lays down very specific standards for water, and to bring the offender to book. I should be interested to hear from the hon. the Minister whether the Cabinet Committee have power to take action of that sort, because without power of that sort all the deliberations and all the reports and all the good intentions of the Cabinet Committee will come to nought, because you are dealing with very, very powerful economic interests. You are dealing with people to whom the purification of part of their effluent can mean millions of rand per year. I want to know what action is going to be taken by the Government to control that sort of thing. We have merely to look at the pulp and paper industry, one of the biggest polluters of water throughout the world. The American Government have issued instructions to the pulp industry that they have got to clean up their industry within a matter of years or else they are simply going to be closed down. This is characteristic of the American people. When they are faced with a problem of that nature they will go out and spend millions and millions of dollars which are requisite to enable them to meet the challenge. The same thing happened with the automotive industry. This industry has been told to stop polluting the atmosphere. They are now spending millions of dollars to find a solution.</p>

<p>I want to know who in this country is going to tell any of the industries who are polluting the atmosphere that they have got to spend millions of rands on finding solutions to the problems which pertain in our country. This is the crux of the question. Mr. Speaker, we can deliberate as long as we like. Every single member in this House has his own little pet beef about pollution. But the absolute essence of the motion of the hon. member for South Coast was that there should be a minister with all the power of the State, with access to the funds of the State and that he should have the ability within the Cabinet to require any of his own Cabinet colleagues to take action in that department to ensure that the environment is not polluted. I can appreciate that the hon. the Minister has given us what has been done until now. He said that if necessary other steps will be taken. It is the earnest request of this <span class="col_887-888" refersTo="page_0461"/>side of the House that he will view the problem as we see it. This is not a problem for a committee which can discuss certain things. This is a problem for a department under a minister who sees it as his life&#x2019;s work if necessary, and that we are not visited here with the problems that are crucifying countries overseas. This is not a matter for the headlines, the big deal or the sudden act and a person who is looking for personal publicity. If there is one thing that will kill the cause of pollution control quicker than anything else, it is the headlines, the constant blowing up of the smaller incidences and the drawing of the attention of the public to this or that. The public is notoriously fickle and their interest may be drawn for the moment and they may be prepared to meet a crisis. However, the constant expenditure of funds from tax revenue which is going to be needed if this pollution is going to be controlled, is something which the public have got to realize. And as I have said the headline will kill the reaction of the public quicker than anything else. We have got to bring it home to the public that this is the long haul and that this is going to take us many years before we can get control even with the limited amount of pollution which takes place in our country. The Lord be thanked, we are spared a great deal of that which takes place overseas. This is the long haul. It is not enough for us to try to meet sudden crises or the sudden accidents which blow up. We have to take a long look at this and have a plan. The hon. member for South Coast and we on this side of the House believe that the way to do it is to have a minister, one man with the ability to control.</p>

<p>It is significant that in Great Britain where they formed the Department of Environment, they took three ministries and amalgamated them into one. They took the Ministry of Transport which has all the diesel buses and the jet aeroplanes that pollute the atmosphere. Mr. Speaker, I am not advocating that the hon. the Minister should try and take over the portfolio of the Minister of Transport. I am sure he wouldn&#x2019;t get very far with that one. They took toe Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of Local Government and the Ministry of Housing. Those three departments were amalgamated to form one ministry.</p>

<p>No, the other people will not do the work, because of the vested interest which resides in every single department to protect and look after the interests of that particular department, and not seeing beyond the bounds of that department. This is specifically a matter of co-ordination. This Ministry must gather the powers together and have an oversight of everything which is going on in order to be able to specifically reach the boundaries of various departments and be able to take the necessary action over two, three or four departments. We already know the problems we have in our country of the overlapping of various departments. What we want is something more than a watchdog. We want a watchdog that has got a bite.</p>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>No, not barks, but bites. I should like to quote very briefly from a book which is called &#x201C;Our Precarious Habitat&#x201D;, an American publication. May I say it is one of the hundreds of thousands of books which are being written today on pollution. This is the &#x201C;in&#x201D; thing today. Everybody is on the bandwagon. But I think this is a very wise quotation: &#x201C;The cry for instant anti-pollution is as unreasonable as it is ill-conceived&#x201D;. I think we have to realize that in our industrial society pollution is an ever-present <span class="col_889-890" refersTo="page_0462"/>factor of life and it will continue to be so. It is not going to disappear overnight, and no Department of Environment is going to stop it. But what has to be done, is to establish what pollution is and what ceiling and threshold level are permitted and tolerable in our modern society. It is precisely one of the things the hon. member for South Coast asked for, namely that the Minister should be given power to define pollution. Until you have a definition of pollution, you cannot enforce pollution control. This is one of the things we are lacking in South Africa. The hon. member for Orange Grove mentioned this Bureau of Ecological Standards. This is what we need. Unless you have a standard against which to measure effluent and relative problems, you cannot enforce control of any sort at all. This is one of the problems which I do not believe the Cabinet Committee about which the hon. Minister spoke can answer. I do not think they have the answer to this one. The book goes on to say:</p>

<block name="quote">To end further pollution and control its magnitude in future, will require a great deal of knowledge which is now not available.</block>

<p>In other words, there has to be spending on research, a massive spending of millions of rands, dollars, pounds or whatever is applicable. Obviously, we in our country can afford a very limited amount. But it has to be done under the closest possible control. I understand from the hon. the Minister that there is a Scientific Advisory Council which deals with this kind of matter. But I do not know, and the Minister might at some other time tell us whether they are directing the attention of that committee to the specific problems of pollution so that research will be done into those problems. I believe these problems are looming bigger and bigger all the time. The book goes on further to say:</p>

<block name="quote">The presidential task force, and environmental health and related problems, stated: As the facts become clear the public will become shocked at the price it is paying for its affluence.</block>

<p>In other words, the industrial society in which we live, is making demands.</p>

But certainly the industrial society in which we live is posing problems of effluent control and related problems which are going to cost us a tremendous amount of money.</p>

<p>Again, I come back to the problem, who is going to finance it&#x003F; It has been established in the United States that year after year there are issues raised with the voters at referendums, for school buildings, etc., which are vitally necessary in that community, which are voted down year after year by those people, simply because they are not prepared to face the necessity of meeting additional taxation. Where you have a Ministry which has access to the Department of Finance, you also have access to the money. I do not know how the Cabinet Committee is going to function. The hon. the Minister can tell us whether each of those departments is going to hand over a part of its budget to finance the work that the committee is doing, or who is going to finance the work of the committee&#x003F;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, on various occasions in this House and in the Other Place as well we have had motions on the subject of the conservation of our environment, and I do not think there is any need for me, at this advanced stage in the debate, to emphasize the necessity and the need for such conservation of our soil and environment. I think it is generally accepted on both sides of this House and by responsible people outside that this is a matter of vital importance, for not only does it affect the survival of mankind, but also the question of whether he is able to live under happier circumstances. There is a growing awareness among people that all growth does not necessarily mean progress and that wealth does not consist only of capital and the gross domestic product produced every year, but also of the circumstances in which they live. The environment also forms a major part of his assets.</p>

<p>The contents of the motion dealt with the creation of the actual machinery which was to bring about these more attractive and more pleasant circumstances for us, and it was suggested by the introducer of this motion that we should think in terms of a ministry. He was not the only one to express this idea. It has also been expressed by other people outside this House who have addressed symposiums. We heard a moment ago, with reference to the statement made by the hon. the Minister of Planning, that there are such ministries, which undertake this important work, under various names in various parts of the world. However, what seems to me to be important in this respect, according to the hon. member for Mooi River&#x2014;and I am inclined to agree with him to a certain extent&#x2014;is what authority the responsible Minister has to take action in these cases.</p>

<p>&#x2020;What are his powers&#x003F; I would like to point out to the hon. member for Mooi River quite a number of Acts passed by this Parliament which affects the situation.</p>

<p>We have the Physical Planning and Utilization of Resources Act of 1967, which coordinates physical planning and regulates the utilization of South Africa&#x2019;s resources. We have the Mountain Catchment Act, Act No. 63 of 1970, which provides for the conservation, use, management and control of land situated in mountain catchment areas. We already have the Soil Conservation Act, Act No. 76 of 1969, providing for the combating and prevention of soil erosion, the conservation and improvement in the use of soil and vegetation, and the protection of water resources. So I can carry on. In the fourth place we have the Forest Act of 1968, and the Atmospheric Pollution Prevention Act of 1965. We have also the Water Act of 1956. The prevention and combating of pollution of the sea is taken care of by the Oil Act, Act No. 67 of 1971. Then we also have the National Parks Act, Act No. 42 of 1962, to arrange matters about the protection of wild life. But in addition to the various powers in terms of these Acts, which the Government has, we also have the various provinces with their ordinances protecting the wild life in their various areas of jurisdiction.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. ENGELBRECHT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move the motion standing in my name, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(1) (a) expresses its approval of the large financial contributions which the Government is making with regard to the maintenance and development of universities for Whites as well as non-Whites; and

<ol>

<li>(b) affirms its faith in the positive interpretation of the concepts of academic freedom and the autonomy of universities; and</li>

</ol>

</li>

<li>(2) urges the Government to continue to exercise the necessary control in order to keep our universities free from influences which are responsible for the subversion of authority and the corruption of morals.</li>

</ol>

<p><span class="col_893-894" refersTo="page_0464"/>I want to start at once with the first part of the motion, namely that this House expresses its appreciation to the Government for the large sums of money spent on university education for all races. Whereas the university in the middle ages and for many years after that was regarded as a sort of elevated ivory tower, a preserve for the privileged, which was not within reach of the ordinary man, it has become a true refuge of the people today to which those eager for knowledge and status are flocking in ever increasing numbers. Whereas universities could finance themselves to a large extent in the past, it has become impossible today for a university to be financially independent.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is a generally known fact that the State is already contributing more than 80 per cent towards the current expenditure of universities in South Africa. Apart from the fact that in recent times there have been large increases in the number of students at our universities, which have inevitably resulted in larger expansion in respect of buildings and equipment, university education has become tremendously expensive. This is due not so much to increased building costs as to the tremendously expensive scientific apparatus and other equipment they need. In order to illustrate the extraordinary increase in the State&#x2019;s contribution to university education over the past 20 years, I should like to submit certain statistics to this House. In the Estimates of Expenditure for the year 1951, an amount of &#x00A3;1 318 000 was voted for universities.</p>

<p>It is important to note that all races were included in this. Ten years later, in 1961, R11 million was voted in the Estimates of Expenditure for university education for Whites, Coloureds and Indians, as well as a further R1 600 000 in respect of Bantu universities, which, therefore, amounted to a total of R12 600 000 for that year. So, during the ten years from 1951 to 1961, there was an increase of approximately 400 per cent in the State&#x2019;s contribution. In the ensuing ten years the State&#x2019;s contribution was even more impressive, because in 1971 the following amounts were voted for university education: For White universities, R73 630 000; for the Coloured university, R1090 000; for the Indian university, R2 610 000, and for the Bantu universities, R5 830 000, a total amount of more than R83 000 000. Therefore the percentage increase from 1961 to 1971 was 560 per cent.</p>

<p>I cannot but praise the Government for the spectacular increase in its financial assistance in respect of our universities over the past two decades. It is all very well to say that other countries spend larger percentages of their national incomes on education. It is perhaps easier for more established countries, where the infrastructure has been built up over many years, to spend larger amounts of money on education. We, however, are living in a young, developing country in which extremely heavy demands are made on development capital. Ours is also a vast country. We still have to build roads and bridges; we still have to build dams and harbours; and in addition we have to spend extremely large amounts on national security. That our Government, in spite of all these demands, could succeed in granting R83 million to universities alone&#x2014;which is approximately 3 per cent of the total Budget&#x2014; is a tremendous and laudible achievement. This, of course, does not include other concessions such as the privileges of tax rebates, which amount to several million of rands more.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#engelbrecht">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. ENGELBRECHT</person>:</from>

<p>But I have said that it compares very favourably. Before dropping the subject of university financing, I should like to address a word of special thanks to the Minister and the Government on behalf of the two young White universities, which received a special establishment formula in order to assist them over their first, difficult years. This means a very great deal to these two young universities and as a member of the University Council of one of these universities, I should like to express my thanks to the Government and the Minister.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I have no option but to point out the very serious financial problems which these same two universities will experience over the next few years. As is generally known, both these universities have been housed in temporary buildings since their establishment. At present extensive building programmes are being carried out. In the course of the next three or four years each of these universities will have to borrow at least R40 million in order to finance their building programmes. The present position is that the State provides 85 per cent of the interest and amortization burden on capital loans to the <span class="col_895-896" refersTo="page_0465"/>universities and that the universities have to provide 15 per cent from their own funds. By 1975, even with these very favourable concessions, these two universities will still have to find the huge amount of approximately R600 000 from their own funds in order to discharge their interest and amortization burdens. This will definitely be absolutely impossible for these two universities, and I want to ask the hon. the Minister to give very favourable consideration to this matter and to put it very strongly to the Treasury as well.</p>

<p>I now come to the second leg of my motion, namely that this House affirms its faith in the positive interpretation of the concepts of academic freedom and the autonomy of universities. These are concepts about which a great deal has been said and written, but which have not yet, to my knowledge, been precisely defined by any legislature or court of law. Even in England, where these concepts originated and from where they came to us, their precise interpretation is still the subject of argument. Very recently a British academic, Sir Eric Ashby, wrote the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A British court of law has as yet not determined what the content of the idea of academic freedom is.</block>

<p>It is, of course, generally known that throughout the world, and in South Africa as well, universities are highly indignant when they think their autonomy or academic freedom is being interfered with. University lecturers and students all over the world, especially those who have become disciples of the gospel of &#x201C;The New Left&#x201D;, have elevated these concepts to sacred cows which may not be touched and behind which they like to shelter, often in order to practise their undermining activities. In this, of course, they are vociferously assisted by the hon. member for Houghton and others. However, there are a few people throughout the world who are concerned about these concepts being interpreted too widely. A British Member of Parliament from Norwich South, Dr. Tom Stuttaford, recently wrote the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have felt for a very long time that the university has got to enforce discipline itself, and if they will not, the police will have to do it. We cannot have a group of people above the law acting as if they are members of the Court of Louis XIV. I feel we are in danger of having an aristocracy indifferent of the law, an aristocracy determined not by birth, but by A levels.</block>

<p>This being so, I should very much like to hear what hon. members opposite have to say about these concepts. I should very much like to see this House affirming its faith in a positive interpretation of these concepts, with the accent on the word &#x201C;positive&#x201D;. The hon. member for Wynberg may possibly have very interesting ideas about these matters, especially after her recent unpleasant experience at the North Western University in Chicago. Perhaps the hon. member will be prepared to tell this House about the academic freedom existing in American universities. [Interjections.] I was talking to the hon. member for Wynberg. In my view a positive interpretation of the concept &#x201C;academic freedom&#x201D; accords with the following definition recently given by the principal of one of our South African universities (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Academic freedom is the unconditional striving after knowledge and insight which makes it possible for the scientist to search for the truth with honesty, ingenuity and dedication, without being influenced by external interest groups. In his moments of the greatest freedom in which he announces the result of his investigation, this freedom is immediately subjected to the penetrating test of his fellow-scientists who judge the result.</block>

<p>Stated in these terms, academic freedom has the characteristic that the freedom requested is in fact academic because it is linked with the integrity of the <i>bona fide</i> researcher. Except in so far as he is free in his honest search after knowledge and information, the academic therefore has no claim to greater liberties or rights than any citizen of the state. If he demands these liberties and rights especially in order to misuse them for the purpose of mobilizing feelings against his fatherland, he has to account for it just as you and I have to do so.</p>

<p>As far as the autonomy of universities is concerned, I have indicated that more than 80 per cent of university finance is derived from the State. No individual or body which is not financially independent <span class="col_897-898" refersTo="page_0466"/>can lay claim to full autonomous status. Indeed, there is in fact only one autonomous body in South Africa, and that is this Parliament. If there were a university in South Africa which was not prepared to accept money from the State, but which was prepared to finance itself, its full autonomy would probably have been respected within limits. But as long as the State provides the finance, it is surely reasonable that it should exercise a certain measure of control as well. It is the position that our Government and our Minister realize that a university is an extremely complex organism which has the best first-hand knowledge of its own problems. For that reason South African universities enjoy a very wide and large measure of autonomous status. However, any extraordinary claim which gives a magical content to the autonomy of universities and which does not thoroughly take into account the basis on which university autonomy rests and which is not prepared to accept the attendant responsibilities, is unrealistic and endangers the autonomy of universities.</p>

<p>I now come to the second part of my motion, which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House urges the Government to continue to exercise the necessary control in order to keep our universities free from influences which are responsible for the subversion of authority and the corruption of morals.</block>

<p>It is a recognized fact that throughout the world there is a youth revolution in progress today, one which is meeting with a response in our country as well and which is manifesting itself at our universities. People who have made a study of this movement throughout the world, maintain that the indications are that this youth revolution actually has very little or almost nothing to do with communism, although the disorder and chaos created by it will in fact be beneficial to communism. However, many experts describe the aims and working methods of this youth revolution as much more dangerous than communism. This youth revolution may in fact have its origin in that part of the philosophy of Karl Marx which maintains that the ideal state is one without a government and in which all people receive the necessities of life without working and in which everyone works without receiving any payment for it.</p>

<p>This Utopia would be the perfect state because nobody would have any private possessions, because there would be no money and because, as a result, there would be no crime, no war and no misery. Revolutionary youth want to attain this Utopia not by the revolt of the working classes, as propagated by Karl Marx, but by the revolt of the student youth, by overthrowing the establishment, which, as they maintain, restricts and suppresses them and allows so much misery and injustice to exist in the world. They want to break down and overthrow every form of authority so that they may be absolutely free. They distinguish themselves from the communists by saying: &#x201C;The communists want to take over the state; we want to smash the state.&#x201D; Initially this revolution manifested itself in a very aggressive form in the universities of the United States and Europe. Strikes were organized, revolts broke out, buildings were taken over, violence was used and led to bloodshed, such as at the Columbia University of New York, where three students were shot dead in a clash with the police and where the university&#x2019;s activities had to be completely suspended for almost three months.</p>

<p>The climax of these uprisings came during the revolt of the Paris students at the Sorbonne in France, when the r&#x00E9;gime of General de Gaulle was almost overthrown. People who were present there maintain that were it not for the fact that at the last moments the communists also became afraid of this youth revolt and its violence, and if the communists had not at the last moment intervened in order to put down this revolt, General de Gaulle&#x2019;s Government would in fact have collapsed at the time, with possibly incalculable consequences for the Western world. Yet the author F. Lohenbill, writing about those events, said that the French students had in fact not revolted against General de Gaulle or the French Government, but against every form of power and authority.</p>

<p>On their part it was a cry for freedom on every level, an irresistible urge to cast off the Bonds and petty tyranny of rigid institutions. Their aim was &#x201C;the tearing down of all structures and the creation of self-administering communities&#x201D;. According to a report which appeared in the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> on 11th January, 1971, there are already more than 3 000 of these &#x201C;self-administering communities&#x201D; in the U.S.A. today which consist of groups of young people who simply live together, do not work, disregard all national and moral <span class="col_899-900" refersTo="page_0467"/>laws and simply allow themselves to be led by instinct alone. Since the unsuccessful student revolts of 1968 and 1969, the leaders of this youth revolution have changed their tactics. In future they would no longer concentrate on violence; on the contrary, they would launch a peaceful campaign among the student youth in order to gain converts for a radical new way of life, a new cultural revolution of &#x201C;the building of Woodstock nations&#x201D;. In future their slogan would be: &#x201C;A New Way of Life&#x201D;, because if sufficient people accepted this new way of life, the structures of authority could collapse by themselves and the political power of the establishment would disappear by itself. Thus, for example, a certain Prof. Reich wrote as a propagandist for this new way of life:</p>

<block name="quote">The way each individual actually lives is political in the most decisive sense of that word. When enough people have decided to live differently, the political results will follow naturally and easily and the old political forms will simply be swept away in the flood.</block>

<p>The leaders of the youth revolution have now accepted as their slogan: &#x201C;A New Way of Life&#x201D;. But it is a way of life which differs completely and utterly from the generally accepted way of life of Western civilization. The new way of life or new culture which is to be used as an instrument for breaking down the existing political system in the best way, would have the following characteristics: Sincere honesty and a desire for freedom, love and justice are used as inducements to attract the idealistic young person to this movement. Long and usually untidy hair is their uniform to show everyone what their political attitude is. The use of undisciplined, obscene language teeming with four-letter words is encouraged in order to shock the establishment. Rock music and pop festivals are organized. The use of L.S.D., dagga and other drugs is encouraged, because, Allen Ginsberg says:</p>

<block name="quote">This is one of the means whereby we can widen the area of our consciousness.</block>

<p>Furthermore, a refusal to control sexual urges, whether normal or abnormal, is very general and an urgent desire and ideal to break down all structures of authority are used as a motive for this movement. Further characteristics of this movement are that they prefer to live together in communes, as I have said. According to the magazine <i>Time</i> of 16th April, 1970, they have specific eating habits as well:</p>

<block name="quote">With most religious zeal they are becoming vegetarians. Diet is very central to the revolution.</block>

<p>From what I have said it is very clear that the youth of the Western world are being used as an instrument to bring about a new ideological trend in Western thought. The main object seems to be the undermining of the existing order and cultural values. In order to bring this about, every cultural and religious institution is presented as being antiquated, ridiculous and objectionable. It is very well-known that the propagandists of this revolution concentrate especially on the religion of their victims. In one document, for example, the doctrine of the Creation is dealt with and compared with Nazism. The Creator himself is represented as a much more abominable dictator than Hitler himself. Then the question is put to the young person: &#x201C;Do you want to serve such an abominable dictator&#x003F;&#x201D; As soon as the young person has cut himself loose from his anchors of religion and his church, as soon as he has rejected as ridiculous the moral code of the society in which he grew up, and when he has thrown overboard every form of cultural possession and pride in his people and his fatherland as being antiquated, he is the easiest victim for the new way of life which is supported by any new or strange ideology.</p>

<p>We in South Africa may think that these phenomena are far removed from us and do not affect us, but there are enough indications that propagandists for this movement are to be found in our country as well. I quote from an article written by Andr&#x00E9; Brink which appeared in <i>Fair Lady</i> on 11th November last year:</p>

<block name="quote">I have been amazed to discover just how closely the South African younger generation are in touch, just how deeply they are involved in the youth revolution, just how committed they feel to the necessity and inevitability of radical change. In innumerable South African teenage rooms the banned record &#x201C;Hair&#x201D; is played, played and replayed jubilantly, not because the music is great, but because the blatant anti-establishment message of the musical is coming through <span class="col_901-902" refersTo="page_0468"/>loudly and clearly. I have come across many from a cross-section of our universities who are calmly and commitedly prepared for violence in order to achieve the ends of the revolution.</block>

<p>This man was in Paris at the time of the youth revolution and is a lecturer at one of our universities. He probably knows what he is talking about. A pamphlet which was distributed on various campuses in South Africa not long ago, made the following appeal to the students:</p>

<block name="quote">Do not sit back with the rest and hypothesize about cultural revolutions. Get up and start one now. Things are happening in the States, in Europe and just about everywhere except here.</block>

<p>I could continue mentioning examples to show that the youth revolution has already made its appearance here in South Africa as well, but so as not to run the risk of impinging on the sphere of the Select Committee which the hon. the Prime Minister has announced, I shall suffice with this. From what I have already said, however, it should be clear to us that it would be fatal for us merely to take note of this without doing something more about it. In my motion I request that the Government should continue to exercise the necessary control over our universities. I want to emphasize that here I do not mean only the students, but also the lecturers who often hide behind the ramparts of academic freedom and lead our student youth on the wrong track in their honest search for knowledge. Some of these people are doing very evil work. There are not many of them, but it is a fact that there are some of them at our universities, that they are doing evil work amongst our students and that they should be very carefully watched.</p>

<p>In view of our extremely delicate position in South Africa and with a view to ensuring the continued existence of White civilization, we request the Government to keep a watchful eye on our universities, where our future leaders must be trained. We are grateful to know that we have a Minister who has done so in the past and will continue to do so in the future, but the task is of such magnitude that more than Government action and more than Government control are essential. If we want to save the youth from the undermining, the intoxication and the demoralization of this new youth revolution, we will have to do more. We will have to exploit the positive aspects of the youth revolution, namely its belief in peace, love and justice, in order to present gripping, dynamic schemes and projects to them which they may work out themselves and in which they may realize themselves to the benefit of our fatherland. We in South Africa are privileged in that we, in contrast to many other countries in Europe, are able to leave great, imaginative projects to our youth, projects which can be developed for the welfare of our father-land and all peoples on our continent. For this we shall need planned action on the part of the State, the church, the university, cultural leaders, parents, the press and the radio. A well co-ordinated youth action is needed to activate our youth so that they may canalize their energy and creative powers into projects which will be in the interests of the country and the people. An improvement in parent-child relationships, purposeful attempts to discover youth leaders at school already and to guide them towards positive thinking, perhaps the establishment of a department of youth affairs which can act as a co-ordinating factor&#x2014;all these are matters which should receive top priority if we want to avoid suddenly reaching the point one day where our youth refuses to perpetuate our Western cultural values.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is very significant that the hon. member for Algoa&#x2019;s whole discussion on the second half of his motion dealt almost exclusively with violence on campuses overseas. In fact, not once, during the course of his speech, did he suggest that similar violence had taken place here. He dealt also, almost exclusively, with student movements overseas and he said that there were signs that South African students and youth were linked with what he described as the youth revolution overseas. I am glad that he was cautious enough during the course of his speech to refer to the Select Committee, because he could have prejudiced the activities of that Committee if he had said very much more than that.</p>

If he looks at it, he will see that it contains an inherent contradiction because section (1) (b) affirms the Government&#x2019;s faith, or this House&#x2019;s faith, &#x201C;in the positive interpretation of the concepts of academic freedom and the autonomy of universities&#x201D; and in section (2), in the same breath he goes on to say that because of all sorts of subversive things that are happening, the Government must breach that academic freedom and that autonomy. So, in fact the resolution contains an inherent contradiction anyway and I think it is very badly drafted.</p>

<p>It is not a question of being clever; it is a question of intelligent English and drafting. Sir, neither autonomy nor academic freedom&#x2014;the academic freedom in which the hon. member professes to have such faith&#x2014;can possibly be reconciled&#x2014;under any circumstances&#x2014; with Government interference, as he says in the motion, &#x201C;in order to keep our universities free from influences which are responsible for the subversion of authority and the corruption of morals&#x201D;. Sir, with what kind of morality is the hon. member concerned in this motion&#x003F; He was very vague about it all. Is he concerned with personal morality, with political morality, with academic morality&#x003F; He did not say in all this fine talk about morals. What the last half of the hon. member&#x2019;s motion amounts to is an overwhelming vote of no-confidence in the general body of South African students at all our universities. It does not talk about special universities; it talks about &#x201C;our universities&#x201D;, and it is surely significant that he refers to Government control, not over certain universities, but over &#x201C;our universities&#x201D;. That, of course, means, by implication, all our universities, Afrikaans-and English-speaking.</p>

<p>In effect he was attempting to refer indirectly to certain universities; he would have been wiser possibly to have said so. But, Mr. Speaker, his motion, of course, is also a vote of no-confidence in the ability of the councils of our universities to control the activities, the influences and the behaviour of the students on their own campuses, and I think that this is a shocking reflection upon the integrity of academics, of the university principals themselves and of a large number of eminent South African citizens who serve on these councils, many of whom are Government-appointed nominees, as he knows. Sir, in view of the strictures that he saw fit to make, I wish on behalf of this side of the House to move the following amendment to the hon. member&#x2019;s motion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(1) reaffirms its confidence (a) in the patriotism, moral standards and integrity of the vast majority of South African students, White and non-White, and (b) in the Councils of all our Universities and their ability to maintain order and support authority in administering their Universities; and</li>

<li>(2) is of the opinion that it is not desirable to comment on the affairs of universities which is the subject of investigation by a commission of inquiry, which has not yet submitted its report.&#x201D;.</li>

</ol>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what makes the hon. member for Algoa think or imply, as he quite clearly did in his speech, that the principals of some of our universities are neither concerned nor competent to maintain law and order and proper discipline on their campuses&#x003F; If that is not what he means, then the motion has no meaning as it stands.</p>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>What evidence has he for suggesting that there has been a subversion of authority, to use his words, on any campuses&#x003F; And if there has been, can he give any proof whatever that the principals concerned failed to take appropriate action&#x003F; I challenge him to produce that evidence. Let me quote to him, for instance, what the principal of the University of Cape Town had to say to his students at the graduation ceremony here in Cape Town in June of last year. I quote from Sir Richard Luyt&#x2019;s speech, in which he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_905-906" refersTo="page_0470"/>In thinking of our offending and offended students, I would stress the obligation of each to his academic duty and would then underline his right to pursue his non-academic interests as he may wish, along with full acceptance that there is a price to pay if he transgresses against the law, the University rules or his academic duty. If he transgresses, he must pay. If he does not, there should not be so much clamour for action by the State or the University against him.</block>

<p>Sir, what could be clearer than that from the Principal of the University of Cape Town, I would like to know&#x003F; Sir Richard Luyt was specifically warning individual students on that occasion&#x2014;individual students, I repeat&#x2014;of the consequences of breaking the law of the land. But, Sir, there was no internal trouble on that campus at the time, and there has been none since. The Principal of the University of Natal, Dr. Stock, in an address to first-year students on February 26th, 1971, as reported in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> on the 27th, made the following comment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the University was to retain its rights to freedom, it had to ensure that its facilities were not used by anyone for subversive activities of any kind, or for the furtherance of any individual&#x2019;s political aims.</block>

<block name="quote">Restraint, therefore, placed upon members of the staff or student body for acting in any way contrary to Government regulations can in no sense be regarded as a denial of academic freedom.</block>

<block name="quote">You must not think that I am an opponent of all the things which make up academic freedom.</block>

<p>The report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Prof. Stock told students that they could protest against things which were wrong with their city, university, country, or the world, but he asked them not to protest just for the sake of protesting.</block>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;And, above all, remember that others are as much entitled to their opinions as you are yourself,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Therefore do not interfere with their activities physically.&#x201D;</block>

<p>I would like to make it quite clear that the Government has all the powers it wants to indict individuals&#x2014;the hon. member knows it very well &#x2014;who break the law, whether they are on a university campus or anywhere else without exercising all this control that he talks about in his motion. The request of the hon. member for Algoa in this motion for direct Government interference on the campuses&#x2014;because he talks about &#x201C;Government control&#x201D;&#x2014;gives the lie in effect to his affirmation of belief in the autonomy of universities and academic freedom, because Government control over these things would create a very dangerous precedent indeed, and this side of the House would very much regret to see anything like that happening. Sir, let us get it quite clear: No one has burned down any buildings here; no one has been physically assaulted; there has been no violence, so the things over which the hon. member and his Government want to have control are not things like that, but they want to have control over the exchange of ideas, in spite of all his pious protestations, ideas which in certain fields are anathema to him and to hon. members on that side of the House. Sir, some of those ideas may be unacceptable to me as well, and may I say that a great many of those ideas are unacceptable to many of the students themselves.</p>

<p>But the real truth is that Government Members of Parliament do not want real autonomy and academic freedom for the universities. This subsection (1) (b) of the hon. member&#x2019;s motion is a lot of humbug and he knows it, and that is why his Government passed the Extension of University Education Act in 1959. They gave it a fancy name, &#x201C;Extension of University Education Bill&#x201D;, and they took away rights and freedoms and some of the basic autonomy of the universities. I would like to remind the hon. member of the amendment moved by this side of the House in the debate on the Second Reading of that Bill in 1959. Dr. Louis Steenkamp, the then hon. member for Hillbrow, moved&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this&#x201D; House declines to pass the second reading of the Extension of University Education Bill because, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) the limitation of the admission of non-White students to existing universities is making unjustified, serious and undesirable inroads into the autonomy and traditional right right of self-determination of such universities;</li>

<li>(b) the proposed institutions for higher education for non-White persons will not have the standing of universities, nor will they enjoy the academic freedom traditionally associated with a university; and</li>

<li>(c) the Government has not consulted the Statutory Committee of University Principals on the principles of the Bill.</li>

</ol>

<p>And in the course of his speech the hon. member for Hillbrow went on to say this, and it was quite prophetic&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Out attitude is based on the conviction that State interference with the freedom of a university to admit or exclude students entails great danger and should only be used as an extreme measure by the State. In other words, the autonomy of our existing universities may not be lightly interfered with. It is too dangerous, not only as regards the open universities &#x2026;</block>

<p>And of course he was referring there to the English-language universities&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; but is perhaps even more dangerous as regards our so-called closed universities.</block>

<p>That is exactly where we stand today, as the hon. member expressed it in 1959, 22 years ago. We take exactly that standpoint today. For Government members to suggest that they take the same view in terms of this pious resolution of the hon. member for Algoa, is so much rubbish, as this debate in 1959 proved. Sir, hon. members know very well that in matters of this kind in their hearts they are really paternalistic, if one is being charitable, and authoritarian if one is not being charitable.</p>

<p>What hon. members on that side of the House really want is that all South African students should think as they do. There is nothing in this field to choose between radicals on the left and radicals on the right. Both of them are a confounded nuisance and both of them are equally dangerous And I know all about it, as the hon. member for Algoa rightly said, because of my experiences in America. The radicals on the left are anxious to refuse you a hearing for one set of reasons. But I suggest that the radicals on the right in this country are moving this type of motion for exactly the same purpose here in South Africa and that is why we disapprove of the motion as it stands. These same people, the radicals to the right or to the left, everywhere demand the right to think exactly as they choose. The second demand, of course, is that they have the right to condemn anybody who disagrees with them. You have to think as they do&#x2014;or else. There is always the big &#x201C;or else&#x201D; attached to it. And of course the threat implied here became quite apparent to us in this House yesterday afternoon when the hon. the Prime Minister moved his motion for an investigation into certain organizations in this country, amongst them the National Union of South African Students. The hon. the Prime Minister made out no <i>prima facie</i> case. I am not going to discuss it because the matter has been referred to a Select Committee, but this is the hidden threat in regard to these matters. The hon. member for Orange Grove in the debate in 1959 had some very relevant things to say about academic freedom. In the 1959 debate the hon. member for Orange Grove was talking about university autonomy when he said (Hansard, Vol. 100, col. 3227):</p>

<block name="quote">We mean that the ruling bodies of the universities, in our country, the university councils, shall be free to decide, within the limit of the facilities available to them, how to organize and how to administer their universities so as best to serve the interests of human knowledge and to advance the good of the students as well as the community they seek to serve&#x2026;. University autonomy also means that the ruling body must be free, i.e. the council must be free, to admit, subject to the absolute minimum amount of restrictions, whomever they think fit into the portals of a university&#x2026;. However, restrictions which are based on the grounds of political beliefs, of freely held convictions and of religious persuasions are to be condemned out of hand.</block>

<p>That was what was said by the hon. member for Orange Grove in 1959. He also said that university autonomy further means that there must be freedom in the appointment of members of the academic staff and the university must not be subject to restrictions imposed from outside which are based on sex or race or belief or religion or anything else. He then went on to talk about academic freedom and he said (col 3229)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Furthermore academic freedom means that, subject to the ordinary rules of discipline and attending of classes, the student must be free to seek knowledge in his chosen subjects where and how he wishes, and &#x2026; that the student must be free to state his views, and &#x2026; to discuss them in an academic spirit, without hindrance, with his fellow students, even if those fellow students be of another race or of another colour.</block>

<p>When we discussed the Education Vote here last year, the hon. member for Boksburg, who I am sorry is not here today, asked the hon. the Minister whether the time had not come to review the autonomy of the universities where leftist activities occur, so that the Government could have a greater say in the appointment of lecturers and the type of students admitted. Well, what price autonomy, Sir, under those circumstances&#x003F; How meaningful is this section in this motion here today&#x003F; Does the hon. member for Boksburg find himself in agreement today with the motion of the hon. member for Algoa and his pious reaffirmation in section (1) (b) of this motion&#x003F; And may I ask the hon. member for Algoa exactly what he means by the use of <span class="col_911-912" refersTo="page_0473"/>the words &#x201C;positive interpretation of the concepts of academic freedom and the autonomy of the universities&#x201D;&#x003F; The very terms of the motion make it clear that what he really approves of is only a partial interpretation of academic freedom. In effect, that is what he is saying; an interpretation in terms of his own subjective judgment. [Interjections.] I have just mentioned that this matter has been referred to a commission. I mentioned it; the hon. member did not, and it is his Government&#x2019;s commission. And let me inform the House that the hon. the Prime Minister himself, who is Chancellor of the University of Stellenbosch, has on more than one occasion been invited to address the students at an English-language university. I know that as a fact. Now why did he not do it&#x003F; Why has he persistently refused&#x003F; Why does he snarl, and his colleagues with him, at students for inviting the former United States Attorney-General, Mr. Ramsay Clark, to address them&#x003F; And then he himself refuses to counter any influence which Mr. Clark&#x2019;s thinking may have had upon the students by addressing them himself. Just think what a missionary he could have been. Sir. Did he not have the courage to go&#x003F; Is that what it was&#x003F; I do not think that is the real reason. Let us give him the benefit of the doubt, in any event, since he is not here today. [Interjections.] I think the real answer is that the hon. the Prime Minister, just like the hon. member for Algoa and other hon. members too, and many of his henchmen on the Government benches, make statements about these universities in a political context and nothing else, and when the hon. members opposite find themselves politically bankrupt as they are today, this motion of course is exactly what they want. In other words: &#x201C;Do not deal with the basic problems of the country; have a bash at the students instead.&#x201D; I am very glad to say that the hon. the Minister of Education has a far more balanced approach to these matters, if only they were left to him.</p>

<p>The fact is that this motion today is highly presumptuous, since every single item listed in it is covered by the terms of reference of the Van Wyk de Vries commission of inquiry into the affairs of the universities, which was appointed by the hon. the Minister in September, 1968, and, as he told me this morning in reply to a question, is still sitting. When hon. members opposite asked last year for their Minister to penalize certain universities at which the students had organized protests against Government policy, the Minister very calmly and with great effectiveness put them and the hon. Senator Horwood, who spoke on the same lines in the Other Place, smartly in their places. The hon. the Minister in his speech referred them to the commission which was sitting and said that whatever comments they had could not possibly be dealt with, neither was he prepared to take any action. The hon. the Minister went on to say that students at the age of 18 had the vote and were perfectly entitled to political activity, provided of course it did not go beyond the ordinary bounds of constitutional action. The Minister&#x2019;s reply could not have been calmer or more effective. Then the hon. member for Algoa expresses his approval of the large financial contributions made by the Government to the universities, and he gave us a lot of figures today. May I say to the hon. member that financing of the universities is another aspect of the commission&#x2019;s terms of reference and for that reason I do not intend to go into it at any length today except to say that we disagree fundamentally with his vote of thanks to the hon. the Minister. The enrolment position at our major universities today is most unsatisfactory and the universities have not sufficient funds to expand as they would like. The truth is that we are spending less than the figures supplied by the hon. member on education today, including the universities, in terms of the country&#x2019;s gross national product, than we were spending ten years ago. The Government&#x2019;s lack of foresight in this regard is deplorable. Before I leave the subject of the commission I consider it necessary to state here and now that Prof. Owen Horwood&#x2019;s position as an impartial member of that commission must be severely criticized. The facts are that Prof. Horwood and Prof. Bozzoli sit on that commission as representatives and principals of two of the English language universities, namely Witwatersrand and Natal. Prof. Horwood resigned from his post as principal of the Natal University soon after his appointment. He is now serving as a senator on the Government benches where he has been for some time. In that position he committed himself publicly and passionately last year to a particular line of thinking, an indictment, in <span class="col_913-914" refersTo="page_0474"/>fact, of student activities on the English university campuses, a matter which is still under the attention of the commission of inquiry. This in fact is specifically covered by item 7 of the terms of reference which says that they must consider student relations in general and in particular the role students and student bodies could play in co-operation with academic authorities, maintaining a healthy spirit and a code of conduct on the campuses of modern universities. The hon. Senator at the time even suggested financial penalties. As I have said, the hon. the Minister blew him out over that.</p>

<p>But I would like to remind this House that all these matters are still <i>sub judice,</i> even the matters raised by the hon. member for Algoa.</p>

I should like to tell the hon. the Minister very seriously that this matter is causing a great deal of public anxiety and with reason, as a result of Senator Horwood&#x2019;s activity. Surely, in the interests of the country and in the interests of all the universities, the important thing is to engender confidence in the objectivity of the commission&#x2019;s approach.

<p>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, let me say that the kind of unrest we have experienced on certain of our campuses in recent years, which has not taken the form of violence, was unheard of before the passing of the 1959 Extension of University Education Act. If our universities had been free to develop as they were doing prior to that date under a United Party administration, with the choice of enrolment and the choice of the appointment of staff left entirely in the hands of the universities, I suggest that the measure of understanding between students of all colours in a free association on the university campuses would have been profitable to the country as a whole. Friendships would have developed on a normal basis. Arguments and differences of opinion would have been aired in an atmosphere of academic tolerance. Political emotions need never have become so overheated as they have become today. It is the Government&#x2019;s own policies, once again, that are leading to confrontation situations at all levels, not least amongst the student bodies themselves, where Black and Coloured will only talk to Whites today on a basis of suspicion and distrust. And what a terrible pity that is. The Government itself has caused the tragic breakdown in communications in this field. Their own policies of gross discrimination against people of colour in so many of the practical aspects of living, have been the direct cause of student involvement and concern with injustices of this sort. Because there are no longer any, or at least very few, legitimate channels of communication open between us, particularly at university level and between people of colour, students of all kinds are incensed at the nature of the restrictions imposed upon them. Many of them have expressed their anger and their frustration. I suggest that the Government itself has provided a breeding ground for agitators in this field.</p>

<p>We warned the Government in 1959&#x2014; and I quoted from the debates&#x2014;that this would be the case. And, indeed, if you examine the records of student unrest in this country, via Nusas or any other body, you will find that its main target was, and continues to be, the principle behind the 1959 Act, which we on this side of the House fought so bitterly at that time. On these grounds and for the other reasons which I have stated, I table the amendment in my name. The less Government interference we have in the universities the better. The very nature of the discussion here <span class="col_915-916" refersTo="page_0475"/>today proves us to have been entirely correct in the view that we held in 1959 and that which we hold at the present time.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is quite remarkable that the amendment of the hon. member contains nothing at all about section 1 (a) of the motion of the hon. member for Algoa. In the course of her speech the hon. member for Wynberg claimed that this motion is a reflection upon the competence and integrity of rectors of universities and university councils, on which state appointed persons also serve. This is an altogether incorrect interpretation of the hon. member for Algoa&#x2019;s motion. I do not think the hon. member understands the motion very well. In the course of my speech I shall in any case come back to this, particularly to aspects in connection with the autonomy of the universities, which the hon. member elaborated upon quite extensively. The hon. member for Algoa referred in particular to spending on the White universities. I should like to elaborate a little on State spending on non-White universities.</p>

<p>In the past, the Government has very regularly received harsh criticism in this House from hon. members of the Opposition, the hon. member for Houghton, and the Press, which supports these hon. members, for supposedly not making sufficient money available for non-White education. When one speaks about this matter it is, by the way, very interesting to note that the rural supporters of this Opposition, particularly in the Transvaal, regularly criticize the Government very sharply for what is being done for the non-Whites and in particular for the Bantu, particularly in respect of education.</p>

<p>Who says so&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO </person>:</from>

<p>That is the case. I know. Here sits the hon. member for Waterberg, who contested a by-election not so very long ago. He can confirm every word I say here. As is known, the Extension of University Education Act was passed here in 1959. The hon. member for Wynberg also referred to that. It is also known, and the hon. member repeated it here, that on that occasion the Opposition did everything in their power and used every means to oppose that Bill, to prevent it from being passed. It is also known that the Opposition has never really accepted these separate university colleges that later became universities, that they are still searching for shortcomings with a political magnifying glass and each year furnishing negative criticism. It is not my intention to go into that in further detail.</p>

<p>I should just like to state the case positively, and I briefly want to refer to the contributions being made by the Government for, as the motion puts it, &#x201C;the maintenance and development of universities for &#x2026; non-Whites&#x201D;. I then also want to point to the growth of those relevant universities. Unfortunately I now have to trouble the House with a few statistics in this connection. Because the Bantu universities have the most students and require the major portion of the State expenditure, I refer to them first. There are the three Bantu universities: the University of Fort Hare, the University of Zululand and the University of the North. n 1966 the number of students totalled 1 161. In 1971 the total was 2 379, an increase of 105 per cent in five years. During that time, in the same number of years, from the financial year 1966-&#x2019;67 to the financial year 1971-&#x2019;72 the current expenditure and the capital spending increased from R2 845 000 to R5 780 000&#x2014;again more than a doubling of the 1966 amount. This is proof that the increase in student numbers and the spending were exactly commensurate. The Coloured university of the Western Cape came into being as a university college in 1960. On 1st January, 1970, it obtained university status. In 1960 the number of students totalled 164, in 1966, 590 and in 1971, 975. Similarly, the number of students at those universities virtually doubled over the past five years. The spending on the university of the Western Cape, i.e. on land, buildings and equipment, amounted to a total of R2 395 000. I am not mentioning the spending as it occurred annually, but where that is concerned, it also more or less doubled over the past five years. Fom the inception of the University of the Western Cape, 789 students have obtained diplomas and degrees at the University. I now come to the third non-White university, the Indian University, In 1961 there were 114 students, in 1966, 1 129 and in 1971, 1 707. The expenditure of this University is also great, but the number of students also increased in proportion to the expenditure. At present construction is still progressing on the University of Durban Westville. R9 million has already been spent on this project, and an additional few million rands will still be spent. This <span class="col_917-918" refersTo="page_0476"/>university, like all the others, is a marked success. The students at this Indian University have opportunities they never had before. They see the value of separate development and separate universities. Indian students and leaders agree with this.</p>

<p>This expenditure in respect of universities for non-Whites proves that the National Government ensures that non-Whites are trained at the highest level and obtain the necessary facilities there. The National Party also established Bantu universities specifically orientated to the Bantu&#x2019;s needs. This also applies to the universities for Coloureds and Indians. I want to emphasize again that the State makes an abundant and judicious contribution. It does not contribute more than can be absorbed by these institutions. The State contributes only in proportion to the growth of these universities and institutions, i.e. according to their needs. Notwithstanding the predictions of United Party doom prophets in 1959 and also subsequently, to the effect that the non-White colleges and universities would not succeed, these quoted statistics repudiate their expectations and negative view of things.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO </person>:</from>

<p>Because it concerns expenditure by this Government in connection with those universities. The National Party believes in offering each national group&#x2014;hence the expenditure&#x2014; full development opportunities, but in its national context and always linked to its national heritage. That is why the State is prepared to make these large contributions.</p>

<p>I should now like to come to the second part of the motion, i.e. that the House affirms its faith in the positive interpretation of academic freedom and the autonomy of universities. The National Party and I personally disagree with the United Party&#x2019;s view of autonomy and academic freedom. I should like to point out that the motion speaks of a &#x201C;positive interpretation&#x201D;. The Opposition normally furnishes the plea that there should be no interference in the activities of the universities, that the State should have nothing to do with branches of the universities&#x2019; activities, that the universities themselves should determine the conditions of admission and rejection of students and that in all respects universities should maintain their independence.</p>

<p>In addition the Opposition thinks that the so-called fundamental powers of university councils should not be affected and that the universities should be independent in all respects, otherwise there is no freedom of thought and autonomy collapses. However, these are the same universities that sharply criticize the State if it does not regularly increase its subsidy contributions, and the United Party takes up the cudgels for them. The National Party also believes in university autonomy and in the fact that unnecessary and injudicious restrictions should not be placed on that. But the National Party is realistic in its view and maintains a positive interpretation. I now want the hon. members of the Opposition to listen carefully. University autonomy in the modern State is not the primary right of the university; autonomy is derived from the State. If there were no State, no university would have existed. The right of autonomy, of freedom, is allocated statutorily to the universities by the State.</p>

<p>The universities receive their autonomy or freedom within State limits. State control has always existed at South African universities. I now want to ask that hon. member and hon. members opposite whether the United Party has ever thought that the provision of the conscience clause is, in fact, interference by the State in the so-called autonomy of the universities&#x003F; I believe that the United Party members all support the provisions of the conscience clause. The United Party apparently thinks that university autonomy should be unassailable. This can be dangerous. Are hon. members aware that the student revolt at the Sorbonne University and other European universities a few years ago was initially aimed solely at an outmoded university system, obsolete syllabuses, outmoded tuition and examinations methods. These defects have long been present, but the university authorities there did nothing about that. The State did not intervene because the principle of university autonomy had almost reached the status of unassailability. And what happened&#x003F; We know ourselves.</p>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from><span class="col_919-920" refersTo="page_0477"/>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>It has not happened here.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>But I am now pointing to what did happen and now this could also happen here if the State has no right to intervene. Academic freedom can only reach the highest rung in the security offered to it by the State. Where security, order, discipline and peace do not prevail, where chaos and tension prevail, there can be no academic freedom. The State grants certain rights and privileges to the universities and protects and promotes intellectual progress. The university is actually a public trust that must be protected by the State. A scholar, Robert M. McIver, puts it in these terms, on page 248 of his book, <i>Academic Freedom in our Time</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Moreover, the university, whether it be Sate-controlled or private endowment, can still be thought of as a public trust. Even the private university receives important rights and privileges from the State and the continuance of these favours depends on the will of the people.</block>

<p>Where does the United Party now come by the right to say that the State must keep its hands off the universities altogether&#x003F; When so-called academic freedom becomes random and arbitrary, when it is morally destructive or undermines the State, it is the duty of the State to intervene and if necessary interfere in that so-called freedom. I should like to quote further from what another great scholar, Russell Kirk, has to say on page 27 of his book, <i>Academic Freedom.</i> He states&#x2014;and now hon. members must listen carefully&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Academic freedom, like any other prescriptive right, has its boundaries and its corresponding duties. When liberty declines into licence, then it must be restrained and if it is not restrained by those who enjoy that particular liberty, then it will be checked by other persons.</block>

<p>Who are the &#x201C;other persons&#x201D;&#x003F; It could also be the State in this case.</p>

</speech>

<p>No, the university councils.</p>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>It could also be the State. The university obtains its freedom from the State and receives it within State limits. McIver, whom I have already quoted states it as follows on page 270 of the above-mentioned book&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Its freedom &#x2026;</block>

<p>This applies to the university&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; is not freedom from all authority.</block>

<p>It is freedom sustained through and through by authority.</p>

<p>Because my time is almost up, I want to conclude by saying that security, order and good administration are constitutionally the functions primarily belonging to the State, and the State can also demand this from its universities. Where a university becomes a centre for protest, unrest, demonstrations, violence and subversion of State authority as such, I believe that the State has the right &#x2026; no, more than this, I believe that it is the moral duty of the State to intervene.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I very much regret having to follow the hon. member because he forces me to say something here today which I do not like to say. It concerns a word I do not like to use, but which comes straight from the mouth of the hon. the Prime Minister, namely the word &#x201C;gossip-mongering&#x201D;. I would have preferred not to use this word in the House. At the beginning of the hon. member&#x2019;s speech he related the stories which, according to him, the United Party people were circulating in the Transvaal. I challenge the hon. member to examine the debates on Bantu education in this House and to read what was said by the United Party members on this side of the House. If he were to do that, he would find that we criticized them on Bantu Education, for example in regard to free books which have to be provided, etc. Then the hon. member comes along here and talks as if this were the official attitude of the United Party! It does not become him as an old member of this House to be guilty of blatant gossip-mongering.</p>

<p>I withdraw it. The hon. member also spoke of academic freedom. I want to remind him that, according to this motion, we are to discuss the positive aspects of academic freedom and of the autonomy of universities. Up to now I have really heard only hidden threats against academic freedom from the other side of the House. That is the only way in which one can interpret the previous speech.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, I believe that it would be a completely fruitless exercise for us to debate the merits or demerits of this motion unless we at least tried to put matters in their true perspective. I state without hesitation that, in introducing the motion in its present form, the hon. member for Algoa committed a grave injustice against moderate student opinion in South Africa and against the responsible councils of the universities in South Africa. I say this because, no matter how one reads this motion, one cannot help but gain the impression that it is presented with a typical authoritarian attitude. As such, I must say that, in dealing with the problem of student control, which is a delicate problem, I believe that this is an irresponsible attitude to adopt. I also believe that this, in fact, embarrasses moderate student opinion in South Africa &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; and it embarrasses the responsible councils of the universities. If one adopts an authoritarian attitude in dealing with this problem, one plays into the hands of the very people one is trying to destroy, i.e. the extremists. I especially want to say this to the hon. member for Rissik, because I know he is a person who will think about these problems seriously. I want to say to him that the moment one adopts an authoritarian attitude, one starts losing control; it is, in fact, an admission of defeat.</p>

<p>Let us look at the first leg of this motion. Quite frankly, it is also covered by the terms of reference of the Van Wyk de Vries Commission, i.e. &#x201C;the educational, academic, financing and development aspects of universities&#x201D;. Nevertheless, let us discuss it. I want to say that it is perhaps not the fault of the hon. member for Algoa that he had to draft this resolution in this particular form. Perhaps he merely acted on instructions, because this 1972 Session is obviously going to be the &#x201C;dankie-s&#x00EA; &#x201D; session. That is why we have had all this on the &#x201C;large&#x201D; financial contributions. Firstly, I want to pose the question: &#x201C;How large are these contributions in fact&#x003F;&#x201D;</p>

<p>How large are the contributions&#x003F; We have heard of R56 million in grants for the White universities. I must say that this sounds impressive to the uninformed, but the person who knows South Africa and is aware of its vast potential, who is aware, for instance, that the Government raised an amount in the region of R2 600 million on the Revenue Account last year and that this Government spent over R3 000 million in the current financial year, can see matters in their true perspective. Then, for example, R56 million is no longer an impressive amount.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>R56 million is a mere fraction of R3 000 million. I am the first to admit that there has been an improvement, but I want to state that it is still totally inadequate for the needs of a country such as South Africa. One of the hon. members there asked: &#x201C;What about 1948&#x003F;&#x201D; I will also indulge in this &#x201C;back to 1948&#x201D; urge. I want to compare costs from the point of view of students and I want to pose this question to hon. members on the opposite side: Do they honestly believe it is less expensive today to send a student to one of the universities&#x003F; I did some research on this question. I discovered that in 1948, for instance, it was possible to enrol at the University of Cape Town and <span class="col_923-924" refersTo="page_0479"/>pay only &#x00A3;58, i.e. R116, in tuition fees in order to take a B.Sc. degree. What is the situation today&#x003F; For a B.Sc. degree, tuition fees alone amount to R456. This means that in 1948 one could enjoy this educational privilege at a quarter of the price of today. If one wants to prove that &#x00A3;58 equals R456, one in fact admits that the rand of today is worth only 25 cents, a quarter of its value in 1948. In terms of the idiom of 1948, it is in fact worth only half-a-crown. Therefore I believe that, to put matters in their true perspective, hon. members on the other side must not quote so many millions in this House, but must quote 86 million half-crowns. We will then be able to understand the situation. But what is the effect of this&#x003F; According to the <i>American News Digest</i> of 5th January, 1972, the enrolment of students at United States universities has multiplied six times in a generation. What is a generation&#x003F; It is 20 to 25 years. Let us look at the situation in South Africa. In 1948 we had 17 509 full-time students at South African universities. What was the situation in 1970&#x003F; In 1970, 22 years later, a generation later, according to the report of the Department of National Education, the full-time students who attended residential universities numbered 51 019. This represents an increase of 200 per cent. But in America it is possible to have an increase of 600 per cent. What I am saying is that, no matter how we come with all these large contributions, we must accept the fact that the position can be better and that there are countries in the world where, in fact, the position is better.</p>

<p>I want to move off that point and say how glad I am that I can support and second the responsible motion of the hon. member for Wynberg.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>Not a motion, but an amendment. The hon. member&#x2019;s amendment reflects a most responsible approach to this particular problem, the problem of possible student revolt in South Africa and the control of students. I believe that the motion of the hon. member for Algoa is in fact dangerous. It is dangerous because it is completely negative. I want to say why it is negative. It is negative because it relies in the final analysis on maintaining control purely by taking punitive measures. I also believe that it is dangerous because it is laughable in many respects. There is nothing wrong with the words of the motion if you read through them. If we read through, for example, the second leg of this motion, we see &#x2018; that this House affirms its faith in the positive interpretation of the concept of academic freedom and the autonomy of universities&#x201D;. There is nothing wrong with those words, but what is wrong and what is in fact laughable is that it should come from an hon. member on the opposite side of the House. This is where the moderate student is embarrassed. The moderate student and also the responsible councils of the universities are embarrassed because they all know the history of academic freedom and of the autonomy of the universities in South Africa. You will also find that the extremists know their history. They know who the people are who have made inroads into academic freedom in South Africa and who have placed limitations on the autonomy of the universities. Now, all of a sudden, the hon. member for Algoa puts the moderate students in the invidious position of having to try to justify this particular motion of his. I want to say that against extremists they will have no chance, and therefore the extremists are in fact making headway in this country. Do not blame the extremists; sometimes I think the time has come that the Government should look upon itself and on the hon. members opposite and say that they are guilty of adopting wrong attitudes towards this problem. I do not wish to go any further into this matter of the autonomy of the universities, except to state the factual position in South Africa. Then I want to say that at the University of Fort Hare, for instance, the council is so autonomous that in this particular year, 1972, they as a Xhosa institution cannot even allow a Zulu to enter and enrol at that university without obtaining the approval of the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development.</p>

<p>When we come to the third leg of this motion, I must say that I am rather disturbed by the attitude of the hon. members opposite. It has already been mentioned by the hon. member for Wynberg that this is really covered by the Van Wyk de Vries Commission. There must have been lack of consultation between hon. members opposite because I cannot see how they can come with this motion. If you read the third leg, you see that the hon. member for <span class="col_925-926" refersTo="page_0480"/>Algoa is creating the impression that we are in fact in control of matters in South Africa. Those of us who were present during the last week and who listened to what the Prime Minister had to say, must admit that it looks as if he is convinced or believes that we are in danger of losing that control. I am concerned about the whole problem of student relationships, but I also want to say that this situation is not a new phenomenon. As was said quite rightly earlier on, this is not just limited to South Africa. I am afraid that the way things are developing here, there is a chance, and a real chance, that we might lose control of the situation. Let us then consider the so-called effective steps which the hon. member for Algoa has in mind and which will allow the Government to continue to exercise this control. What are these effective steps&#x003F; There are four of them. The first one is purely to revert to punitive measures when you are in trouble. We had it last year during the education debate, when for instance they came with the threat of cutting the subsidies of these universities. You have had headlines in newspapers such as: &#x201C;Owen Horwood hints at withdrawal of subsidies&#x201D;. I believe this is one way to lose the support of the moderate students, because this is a completely discriminatory action. This discriminates against the guilty and the innocent. I want to say that you had people going to universities and wasting their time in the 1940s and the 1950s, and not only in the 1970s. They themselves pay the price ultimately, because unless they qualify for something and leave that university as a qualified person with a degree or the like, they pay the price. I believe that the contrary of that is also true. This, I believe, is not only confined to the so-called politically active students at universities; the contrary seems to be true where some of these students who take an active part in politics are also excellent&#x2014;I repeat, excellent&#x2014; scholars.</p>

<p>We have yet another method which I believe is being used by the Government at the moment in order to maintain control. I want to warn them beforehand that this is of limited value only. This is the type of infiltration of organizations which is commonly known as the &#x201C;blonde spy approach&#x201D;. This type of thing has only a limited value and will in fact not be sufficient when we are faced with a showdown with the students. Thirdly, we also have in South Africa a very active Publications Board, which apparently must protect the morals of the students. This Publications Board has been very active from 1963 to 1970, for during that time it has banned some 5 785 publications. I know that a lot of those publications have been pornographic or the like, but I do say that the chances are that some good works are being banned from this country, works which the dedicated and the serious students require for study.</p>

<p>Lastly, I also believe that the Government itself is radical in its approach. As long as you have a radical Government, you can expect any reaction to this to be radical as well. This is where the moderate student once again is caught in between, because there are many things in South Africa which he just cannot morally justify. He is in the front line of defence and as long as certain of these aspects of Government policy do not change, I think we must accept that we are in fact losing control over the situation.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the hon. member, in support of the hon. member for Wynberg, suggested that we on this side of the House did not confer as far as this motion is concerned. He suggested that we on this side were not taking cognisance of the commission which is at present investigating certain aspects of education. Sir, when we look at the terms of reference we find that item 7, which was actually also referred to by the hon. member for Wynberg, reads as follows. They are authorized to investigate &#x201C;studente-verhoudinge in die algemeen en in besonder die rol wat studente en studenteliggame kan speel in medewerking met die akademiese owerhede&#x201D;. But what does the motion say&#x003F; The motion, freely translated, urges the Government to maintain control. There is a vast difference. The university authorities are not asked to step in and to exercise their autonomy properly. What is more. Sir, the hon. member for Algoa suggested that the necessary steps should be taken to ward off certain elements and certain undermining influences. The motion does not suggest that those influences do exist at our universities.</p>

<p>Secondly, my hon. friend&#x2019;s entire argument was along the lines that the experience in Europe and America has been such that we should take timeous action to prevent similar influences entering our universities, and in support of that he quoted certain incidents in Europe and America. But the hon. member for Wynberg goes much further. My hon. friend the member for Algoa did not suggest that either a minority or a majority of students are subjected to these influences. He did not suggest that, but what does the hon. member for Wynberg do&#x003F; She suggests in her amendment&#x2014;she can tell me whether I am wrong&#x2014;that the minority of students have no patriotism, no moral standards and no integrity.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>I now return to the motion by my hon. friend, which I support wholeheartedly and gladly. The first part of his motion is very positive. The first part of his motion refers to certain financial support which the Government gives in favour and on behalf of our universities. Not only do our universities enjoy the benefit of that support which my hon. friend mentioned in his arguments, but if we take a look at the Universities Act, we also find that provision is made for other forms of financial support which may be obtained. Local authorities are specifically authorized to donate money or other movable property. Moreover, in passing the Act concerned, this side of the House, in co-operation with that side of the House, also granted powers of expropriation which may be exercised in consultation and in co-operation with the Minister of Agriculture. But, Sir, we went further. In terms of the National Study Loans Act we provided a source which stands at almost R700 000 at this stage and which enabled that Fund to contribute R129 000 towards bursaries in 1970.</p>

<p>In this connection I just want to make the observation that one daily comes across cases where bodies which award bursaries to students on the basis of achievement or merit, withdraw those bursaries when a bursary loan is granted. I think we may profitably appeal to bodies which grant that free bursary which is awarded on the basis of achievement. Then there is the important concession we made in the Income Tax Act of 1970 in terms of which companies may donate up to 5 per cent of their taxable income and individuals may donate up to R500 or 2 per cent of their taxable income to universities, and in terms of which these donations are then exempted from tax. Sir, we must also take cognizance of the fact that the Government, through various State departments, was able to provide 750 bursaries last year for students who started their studies in 1972. These bursaries are so popular that, according to the Secretary to the Public Service Commission, 2 800 applications were received for them up to the beginning of this year.</p>

<p>As far as the second part of the motion is concerned, i.e. that we urge the Government to continue to exercise the necessary control, it means that we are asking the Government to see to it that those influences do not reach our universities and thus become able to deprive us of our most important asset for the future, i.e. our leaders for the next 5 or 10 years and more. We are asking the Government not necessarily to act in terms of university autonomy or academic freedom, but generally to protect this greatest asset that we possess.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bloemfontein West has now attempted to take the hon. member for Durban Central to task for having allegedly omitted certain figures, but the hon. member for Durban Central was very specific when he quoted the figures from an official publication, the annual report of the Department of Education, on page 37. He quoted the figures in English and I am going to do so again&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The number of students enrolled at the 10 residential universities during 1970 was 51 090, and at the University of South Africa, 21 600.</block>

<p>[Interjection.] That is 72 000 altogether, in round figures. Here is the annual report of the Department of Education for 1948, and there it states that the number of fulltime students enrolled at the time was 17 500, and the number of part-time students, if you want to include them in the calculation, was 2 440, in other words the number of students is now three times greater. Thus, the argument of the hon. member for Durban Central stands. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Algoa must not become too hasty now. I am coming to him.</p>

<p>I found the motion introduced by the hon. member for Algoa very interesting. I shall in the course of my speech come to quite a number of the points he made, and to which I should like to reply. But why I do in fact find the motion introduced by the hon. member very interesting is because it comes from that side of the <span class="col_931-932" refersTo="page_0483"/>House, because he speaks here with approval of the concepts of &#x201C;academic freedom&#x201D; and the &#x201C;autonomy of the universities&#x201D;. These are concepts one would expect the Government, judging from its previous actions, to reject with contempt. [Interjections.] I shall tell the hon. member for Koedoespoort what academic freedom is and what it seeks to achieve. I do not think there is any complete and final definition of this concept, as there is also no definition for many aspects of the humanities. The hon. member for Algoa correctly remarked in his speech that there has never been a precise definition. But academic freedom is not separate freedom; it is not a special, distinctive, <i>sui generis</i> freedom, but is part of the normal freedom of speech and freedom of thought.</p>

<p>No, no freedom is absolute. Absolute freedom is licence. But where we differ with hon. members on that side is where the line should be drawn between the legitimate sphere in which the State may exercise control and the legitimate sphere in which the individual may follow his own dictates. Nor do I want to attempt to give a definition of any kind, but I do want to indicate what any person would normally, from the nature of the case, understand the term academic freedom to mean. To mean anything, it must certainly be the freedom to examine without restrictions all sources relating to any subject or subject category, to analyse all ideas, to communicate freely on the academic level with other students and to state fearlessly and openly any conclusions arrived at as a result of this study.</p>

Only from diversification and candid discussion and examination and fearless conclusion can the truth be distilled and crystallised in an ever purer from, and that is after all the true goal of academic freedom.</p>

<p>We are now talking about <i>bona fide</i> students and <i>bona fide</i> universities doing serious research work. I am not talking about anything else. [Interjection.] Now the hon. member wants to praise the Government for what it has done in conserving this great freedom, this important liberty. To tell the truth he asks the Government to carry on in the same way it has been doing. Now, what has the Government done in the past for which we should praise it in respect of academic freedom&#x003F; For what can we possibly praise the Government&#x003F; I have examined the record of the Government in this regard and I must say it is an extremely pitiful one. Should we now praise the Government and the hon. members opposite for a censorship which makes very serious works of a high standard, and source works inaccessible to students so that they cannot be studied at all; should we praise the Government which bars academic communication, one of the elements which the hon. member agreed on, by means of closed universities, and makes it impossible in some cases because a student cannot attend the university at which he wants to study&#x003F; [Interjections.] The hon. member agreed with me a moment ago, but now he is arguing with me. The matter in regard to which we were in agreement is one of the elementary elements of academic freedom, but I say it was banned by this Government, and now he does not agree with me any more. [Interjections.] This is becoming more and more interesting. In actual fact they have restricted freedom to such an extent that only a minimum amount of that freedom still exists today. I would almost say that in the mouth of this hon. member academic freedom is libellous. I have just said that free inquiry and study forms an absolute part of academic freedom. But now I ask hon. members, how must fine art be studied and promoted with censorship so strict that South Africa is almost culturally isolated&#x003F;</p>

The question in the minds of these people is: &#x201C;Why should the citizen be prohibited from doing a certain thing&#x003F;&#x201D; The positive interpretation of freedom is given by men like Jean Jacques Rousseau, Karl Marx, Oswald Spengler and others and forms the basis of the authoritarian system throughout the world. The positive interpretation of freedom &#x2026;</p>

<p>Yes, that is what is said here. The positive interpretation of freedom is freedom to do what the law states. Rousseau said that a person is free to do everything which is good, but he is not free to do what is bad. What is good, is determined by the will of the people. The will of the people finds expression in the law and that is why I am free only to act in accordance with the law; in other words he is free to do what the law says. That is the positive interpretation of freedom.</p>

<p>The hon. member then referred to the autonomy of the universities. I think that this topic has <span class="col_939-940" refersTo="page_0487"/>been discussed quite adequately by the hon. members who spoke before me. But I think the Government gets much the worst of it there. We see the greatest antithesis to the autonomy of universities in the legislation dealing with the University of Fort Hare, and similar measure introduced by the Government. It is simply not autonomy of the universities in any sense of the word. That is why I reject this pretentious motion by the hon. member for Algoa completely, and I recommend to every hon. member that he examine his conscience and consequently support the amendment moved by the hon. member for Wynberg.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_national_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>I listened with great interest to the discussion of the motion. I am grateful that we were able to discuss this matter today. Right at the outset, before I perhaps forget to do so, I should like to express my gratitude to all for their participation in the discussion. There was, particularly during the speeches made by the last two speakers on the Opposition side, more of an attempt to derive amusement from certain matters than to make a positive contribution to this debate, but I do not want to allow myself to be led astray by that.</p>

<p>I want to return to certain matters to which the hon. member for Durban Central referred and with which his young colleague from Florida tried to help him without really succeeding, i.e. that juggling with figures, amounts of money and enrolments. I do not blame the hon. member for Florida for apparently not knowing that the State pays grants and subsidies in respect of non-residential universities as well. He does not know that, but we shall just have to forgive him.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#stephens">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. M. STEPHENS</person>:</from>

<p>But I did not discuss that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, he did most certainly discuss it. He tried to help his friend by correcting his statements. What he said, is precisely what I now want to deal with in my comments.</p>

<p>The State pays subsidies in respect of non-residential universities as well. If one therefore omits the enrolment at non-residential universities, one also omits a large portion of the State subsidy. That is the actual point I want to make, but I do not know whether the hon. member will quite understand it.</p>

<p>The hon. member also discussed the inaccessibility of books for study purposes, books which have been banned by the Publications Board. But surely the hon. member does not know what he is talking about. If he had taken the trouble to find out&#x2014;I do not know how often he visits a library; perhaps he does not know what the inside of a library looks like&#x2014;he would have known that if a book is required for study purposes, that book, even if it is not freely available to the general public, is in fact available for study purposes. I do not want to waste my time with matters of this kind.</p>

<p>I want to say right at the outset of my speech that I have very great sympathy with the youth of today, and more specifically the youth of South Africa. It is a fact that our young people have to learn to find their feet and to make a place for themselves in society under difficult circumstances. I have great admiration for the vast majority of our young people, because the circumstances in which we are living are not easy for them. As I go about and see the many things the young people in this country are achieving, the responsibility they carry and the responsibility with which they complete most of these tasks entrusted to them, I have admiration for the vast majority of our young people in this country. I want to say that I have confidence in them. I am not concerned about the future when I see what the tendencies, the trends among the vast majority of our young people today are, and the sense of responsibility they display.</p>

<p>We see this in the House of Assembly as well. [Laughter.] It is a characteristic of young people that they have a dream in their hearts, and I am glad about that. That is as it should be. It would be a tragic day for us if our young people no longer had a dream in their hearts, if they no longer thought that they could improve society, that they could solve the problems of the day in a different and better way than their elders are able to do. I have said that I understand all this, and welcome it. Everyone, every young person, in the same way as every adult, has the right to criticize whatever he likes and feels compelled to criticize. He also has the right to protest. When the hon. member for Wynberg states that it is the aim of this Government to guide all our young people into thinking like the National Party I say it is undoubtedly an unworthy statement for the hon. member to make. The great aim of all educationists is in fact to get our people to think, to try to make them independent, to get them to do some real studying.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am talking about what I say now, and I say that this is the standpoint of this Government. I will not allow myself to be led astray by what my colleagues said, according to the interjections the hon. member makes. The aims of the educationists in this country is to stimulate people to think for themselves, and it does not worry me that our young people, even our schoolchildren, are thinking for themselves and voicing criticism.</p>

<p>They also have the right to protest, for&#x2014; let us be very certain about this&#x2014;that is what our future depends on. Out of the loyal opposition of today comes the leaders of tomorrow, and we must make no mistake about that. Whether we like some of them or not, is not relevant at the moment, but we must take this important fact into account.</p>

<p>But now I want to say that today all students, with a few exceptions, are entitled to vote. It is their right and privilege, as citizens of the Republic of South Africa, to cast their votes, and they can hold political meetings. They all fall within an electoral division, and they may criticize the Government as vehemently as they wish. That is their privilege in a democracy, the value of which we all appreciate in this country. But the students already find themselves in a very privileged position. Hon. members must at least know that it costs the taxpayer approximately R1 000 per annum to keep one student at university, apart from what his parents still have to spend on him. If the students in their privileged position, then think that by virtue of the fact that they are students they can lay claim to a different kind of right and privilege than that of all the other young people outside the universities, they are entertaining a false premise.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg, who attacked my colleague from Algoa here on what he said, had a great deal to say about the contents of his motion. But I am still waiting to hear her say something which would strengthen that silent majority as well, to hear her say something against this small minority engaged in demolition work on the order and discipline on the campus and also in a broader context. Let us mention examples. We heard about the difficulties at the University of Rhodes last year. There was a commission of inquiry under the chairmanship of a Judge. We know how the students reacted to that, that they assailed the Judge in his office and status, and that they rejected those findings. I am still waiting for a member on the opposite side to express his dissatisfaction at what happened there and to say that the students who acted thus, acted in <span class="col_943-944" refersTo="page_0489"/>error and that the majority of the students at that university should learn a lesson from the conduct of this small minority of inciters who behaved themselves in that disgraceful way. I am still waiting for someone on the Opposition side to say that the rector and the council of that university took the right action, and to say something which would strengthen their hand against this evil which we will have to oppose if we want to build up a healthy public opinion in this country. The hon. member for Wynberg returned from a visit to America a while back. She complained about the reception accorded her at certain of the universities there. She complained about the behaviour and the conduct of certain of the students, and stated that not all the students were involved and that it was not a formal resolution of the students to act thus. However, these elements in the student communities took action against her. She said at the time: &#x201C;Their behaviour is a form of intellectual prostitution.&#x201D; That is what the hon. member said, according to newspaper reports, and I accept that it is correct.</p>

<speech by="#taylor">

<p>The hon. member says that she condemns the faculty members&#x2019; failure to control this situation. However, when my hon. friend, the member for Algoa, said that the universities should exercise control over their students, the hon. member said that it was a blot on the name of our rectors and university councils, and she then introduced her own motion. I am going to take this even further. I want to suggest that the hon. member and other hon. members on that side go and speak to our rectors. Seven of our rectors were overseas a short while back and were in general contact with university people abroad. Ask them what they experienced. In certain cases it was precisely the same experience the hon. member for Wynberg had had in America. But does one hear anyone on that side of the House saying: &#x201C;Look, we must put an end to this kind of behaviour&#x003F;&#x201D;</p>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>Leave it to the universities.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to read something to the hon. member. She says we should leave it to the universities, and that is also the standpoint of this side of the House, i.e. that the universities should set their own house in order. That is why I gave that reply I gave at party congresses. They were replies for which the hon. member had appreciation. The difference between my side of the House and her side of the House is that this side of the House is prepared to come out in favour of the conservative element at all our South African universities. We are prepared to say to those rectors, councillors, students and parents of those students that we support them in their point of view. We do not tell them that they should simply carry on regardless and that we are in the meantime adopting a standpoint against a small minority. With reference to the hon. member&#x2019;s remark, I want to quote to her the words of Mr. Roger Freeman, a special adviser to President Nixon. As the hon. member will concede, he is a very emminent person. In a lecture he gave in 1970, he referred to this very matter, i.e. that a small nucleus of students at certain universities were undermining authority and discipline and gaining influence in all the bodies of the universities, and that as a result of that influence one subsequently found all those disturbances on the campuses. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">How many of the faculty and students who participated have been expelled&#x003F; Blackmail and violence have often been rewarded by college administrators with concessions and surrender. Most of the time little effort was exerted to apprehend offenders and, if identified, they were usually granted amnesty. Small wonder that the reign of terror continues on campuses. Nor will it end, until either the presidents and trustees of <span class="col_945-946" refersTo="page_0490"/>colleges and universities live up to their responsibilities or somebody else does the job for them.</block>

<p>I have not quoted this paragraph in order to lay any blame on any university rector or any council here in South Africa. I am quoting this with reference to what the hon. member for Wynberg said, and I want to emphasize that if we are in earnest about ensuring that a healthy spirit prevails at our universities it is time we spoke with one accord on these matters and strenghtened the hands of those rectors and of those university councils, as well as that of the parents of those children, who want to adopt a conservative attitude towards these subversive elements one finds at universities. I hope the hon. member will support me in this.</p>

<p>In the few minutes remaining to me, I should like to come to the motion. I think, and with this I want to conclude, that particulars which we can mention in regard to amounts of money, student numbers, relationships, are such that the whole of South Africa ought to be grateful for what we are doing for university training. I do not want to say any more about this. We can argue about the matter; apparently the hon. member did not concede this, and that is why she moved that the motion be deleted. I want to add that in my opinion the amount which any Government spends on education and on the universities is never adequate. There is never an end to the difficulties. With the explosion of knowledge and the renascence which has taken place one can give as much money as one likes, and it will never be adequate. However, I want to say with gratitude that education, and more specifically university education, is accorded top priority by the Government. When the Budget is submitted to hon. members this year, they will see that what I have now said is the truth. Education enjoys top priority and this Government will continue to maintain that priority and even try to raise that priority if it is in any way possible to do so.</p>

<p>We also discussed autonomy and academic freedom. It was said that no one has ever found a water-tight definition for it. We heard that said in this House as well. However, I want to say that I am able, after having listened to this debate and having taken note of who the people outside the Chamber are who write and talk a great deal about these two concepts, to say that the whole complaint of the United Party, i.e. that the academic freedom in South Africa and the autonomy of universities is being encroached upon, hinges on one thing only. In their definition of autonomy and academic freedom the opposition to separate universities plays a decisive role. The hon. member is shaking her head.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Oh man, talk about something else, a topic you know something about. The hon. member for Wynberg herself referred to the 1959 legislation when separate universities were established. Each one of the other speakers on that side of the House also referred to that. But of course not one of them called it by its name. The peg on which they hang their criticism is that academic freedom and the autonomy of a university means that a student should have the right to choose the university which he wishes to attend. But what they mean by that, is that Coloured and Indian and Bantu students should be able to choose to attend the universities of the Whites. That is what it is all about. [Interjections.] It is no use hon. members opposite differing with me on this matter. If we take into account what the taxpayer makes available for universities, then I say that he has every right to be concerned. Hon. members took note of the fact that at four of the five National Party congresses this matter was included in the agenda. The hon. member for Wynberg also referred to that. I can show hon. members letters not only from Afrikaans&#x002D;speaking parents, but also from English-speaking parents in which great concern is expressed at the spirit which is prevailing among certain elements at certain universities. Now I want to say that that same <span class="col_947-948" refersTo="page_0491"/>spirit which we are concerned about and that same demand for control has not only arisen here in South Africa where, in the opinion of hon. members on the opposite side, autonomy of the universities does not exist and where academic freedom is being violated, but also at universities where, in their view, it does in fact exist. Where will one find universities in regard to which, in the opinion of those hon. members, this applies more than the American universities for example&#x003F; What did President Nixon say on 19th March, 1969&#x003F; In his Message on Higher Education he said:</p>

<block name="quote">As we get more education for the dollar, we will ask Congress for more dollars for education.</block>

<p>Even in a rich country like America an account must be given of what is being spent on the universities. I want to tell hon. members that we have every reason to be concerned. We read the other day a statement by a Cape Town university professor pointing out that 40 per cent of our first-year students fail. I said a moment ago that it costs the taxpayer almost R1 000 to keep one student at university for a year. Do you not think the taxpayer has every right to be concerned, and that my friend the hon. member for Algoa was quite justified in introducing this motion and requesting the Government to keep a weather eye open on what is happening there&#x003F;</p>

<p>I have now stated the Government&#x2019;s standpoint. The Government&#x2019;s standpoint is that the universities are to keep their own house in order.</p>

<heading>PART APPROPRIATION BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>As honourable members know it is customary to request the House for an advance in order to meet essential Government expenditure during the first months of the coming financial year, that is until such time as the Appropriation Act is passed.</p>

<p>The amount required totals R982 000 000, of which R730 000 000 is chargeable to the Revenue Account, R220 000 000 to the Loan Account, R14 000 000 to the Bantu Education Account and R18 00 000 to the South-West Africa Account.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the amounts included for the Revenue and Loan Accounts considerably exceed the provision in last year&#x2019;s Part Appropriation Act. There are, however, good reasons for these increases. The amount required to meet interest commitments during May, 1972, is, for instance, approximately R20 million higher than the amount actually paid out for the same purpose during May, 1971. This is due to the fact that interest on a new stock issue falls due on the 15th May, 1972. It is further expected that the Provincial, Postal and Railway Administrations will take up considerably more money in the early part of the financial year.</p>

<p>I feel it my duty therefore, to warn hon. members to take note of the fact that departmental expenditure does not follow the same pattern every year and that they should not take this increase as a guide to estimate the total requirements for 1972-73.</p>

<p>As hon. members know the money voted can only be spent on approved services.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it has already been announced that I intend to deliver my Budget Speech on 29th March, and on that occasion I shall, as usual, give the House a comprehensive picture of our economic situation. I shall, therefore, not anticipate that speech this afternoon, but I think it will be appropriate nevertheless to deal here with some of the most important economic developments of the recent past. Some of them were discussed at some length in the no-confidence debate, but I believe that a further discussion, in the somewhat calmer atmosphere of the Part Appropriation, may be useful.</p>

<p>I have never contended that there are no unsatisfactory developments in the South African economy, but I have said, and I stand by this view, that these weaknesses are not so serious as is often alleged and are, in fact, relatively mild by international standards. The three least satisfactory aspects in recent months have been the continued inflationary pressure, the weaknesses in the balance of payments, and the slower growth of the economy, and I shall deal briefly with these in turn.</p>

<p>It is not necessary for me to repeat the figures of the rise in consumer prices in other countries, which show conclusively that, in comparison with many first-rank countries, South Africa has done well in restraining the increase in its cost of living. There has apparently been some misunderstanding of the figure of 4 per cent which I mentioned in a previous debate. What I said was that if the effect of the increases in indirect taxes and State-administered prices is excluded, then the increase in the retail price index in the year 1971, as compared with 1970, was about 4 per cent. As the Reserve Bank stated in its Annual Economic Report, &#x201C;a rise in the consumer price index as a result of the direct actions of the Government to curb inflation should not be interpreted as an indication of a general rise in the price level or of the degree of inflation, but should be identified separately&#x201D;. Referring to the increase in indirect taxes and Government-administered prices during the second quarter of 1971, the Governor of the Bank explained in his Annual Address that &#x201C;these intermittent upward adjustments &#x2026; do not relate only to the period in which such prices and rates are adjusted, but to the whole period over which they were kept constant while other prices and costs were moving upwards. Thus, if the estimated effects of sales duties and other indirect taxes as well as of increases in Government-administered prices and rates are eliminated from the consumer price index, the rate of increase of all other prices did not accelerate between 1969-70 and 1970-&#x2019;71 and was approximately 4 per cent <span class="col_951-952" refersTo="page_0493"/>in both years&#x201D;. Recent calculations by the Bank show that the increase between the calendar years 1970 and 1971 remained at approximately 4 per cent.</p>

<p>There has also been misunderstanding of a newspaper report of what I said would happen to prices after March this year. What I actually said was that, because of the accelerated increase in the consumer price index in the second quarter of 1971 due to increases in indirect taxes and State-administered prices, a comparison of the price indices for, say, January, 1971 and January, 1972, was likely to show a steeper rise than a comparison between, say, May, 1971, and May, 1972; in other words, the rate of increase, on a twelve-monthly basis, was likely to slow down after next March.</p>

<p>I come back to the general question of inflation. There is no doubt that the authorities had considerable success in 1971 in cooling down the over-heated economy and reducing the inflationary pressure. As the Reserve Bank put it in its December bulletin, &#x201C;there were clear indications that the official monetary and fiscal policy of reducing excessive demand was slowly but surely achieving its objective. A slow-down in the rate of increase in the aggregate domestic demand for goods and services was accompanied by a discontinuation of the strong upsurge in imports. The pressure on labour and other factors of production was also reduced.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The Government is not, however, complacent at its achievements in the fight against inflation. Apart from the effect of devaluation on prices, to which I shall refer later, the inflationary pressure has been reduced but not eliminated&#x2014;no more than it has been eliminated in any other country. One of the factors in the continuation of inflationary pressure, as the Reserve Bank has stated and as I have never denied, is the increase in public sector spending&#x2014; an increase which could not be financed entirely from non-inflationary sources. The Government could indeed have avoided the use of bank credit by raising interest rates on Government securities substantially, but this would have had serious social effects throughout the community. The Government is therefore giving serious attention to the question of public sector expenditure and is determined to reduce the rate of increase in such expenditure.</p>

<p>I turn now to the balance of payments. My colleagues and I have frequently referred to the causes of the deterioration in our balance of payments since 1968, and I shall not cover all the same ground again. Certainly one of the factors has been the rapid increase in imports associated with the increase in consumption expenditure. Even more important, however, has been the relative stagnation of our export trade, due largely to factors outside our control. Thus the index of the physical volume of our exports was actually lower in 1969 and 1970 than it was in 1968, due largely to unfavourable climate factors, whereas the physical volume of imports increased over the period 1968-&#x2019;70 by 28 per cent. From the last quarter of 1970 a further adverse factor set in, namely a substantial fall in export prices associated with declining demand for several of our important export products, notably wool, diamonds, platinum, copper and several other minerals. Since import prices continued to rise during this period, we were faced with a dramatic fall in our terms of trade by no less than 17 per cent between September, 1970, and September, 1971.</p>

<p>Through resolute action to curb monetary demand and through some revival in exports during 1971, our current balance of payments showed some improvement during the first three quarters of last year. Then a further blow fell. The suspension of the formal convertibility of the dollar into gold last August precipitated a period of international currency uncertainty which, as has often been explained, led to a substantial decline in the inflow of foreign capital into South Africa and also to an appreciable loss of foreign exchange through leads and lags in the payments for our imports and exports respectively.</p>

<p>Since there was at that time no means of knowing when the international currency uncertainty would be removed, the Government decided last November to intensify import controls.</p>

<p>Some four weeks later came the announcement of the United States Administration&#x2019;s intention to devalue the dollar and of the general realignment of a number of major currencies. For reasons which I have stated but which I shall again explain, the Government then decided to devalue the rand. Since it will clearly take some time for the full effect of devaluation to show itself in the balance of payments, however, it was also decided to maintain import controls for the time being.</p>

<p>I may mention that the intensified import restrictions were applied in full conformity <span class="col_953-954" refersTo="page_0494"/>with our obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which makes express provision for a situation such as that with which the Republic has been confronted. In further compliance with our obligations, the Government has been in consultation with the Contracting Parties to the GATT.</p>

<p>There still seems to be much misunderstanding of the meaning of devaluation. It is not an act of national insolvency, as has been suggested; we still continue to meet our international obligations, which are normally expressed in foreign currencies, as we have always done. Nor does it mean that the internal purchasing power of the rand is automatically reduced. Devaluation simply means a reduction in the value of the rand in terms of gold and foreign currencies; it is an adjustment which has to be made by nearly every country from time to time.</p>

<p>The Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund recognize that such adjustments may be necessary, but they lay down that devaluation is only permissible in certain situations. These are nowhere rigidly defined, but broadly speaking it can be said that devaluation is permissible in a situation where normal fiscal and monetary measures could only rectify the balance of payments deficit at the risk of causing an economic recession. This is exactly the situation which obtained in the Republic. As I have mentioned, we succeeded in 1971 in cooling down the economy and reducing the inflationary pressure, but, largely because of the depressed state of the foreign markets for some of our principal export products and the deterioration in our terms of trade, this did not lead to a sufficient improvement in our balance of payments. More severe monetary and fiscal measures to restrain the demand for imports would have exposed us to the risk of an economic recession, and in these circumstances devaluation is the accepted and classic measure to apply. I may mention that the International Monetary Fund had no hesitation in approving our devaluation.</p>

<p>Why was the rand devalued by 12,28 per cent i.e. by more than the dollar&#x003F; Not because the rand was one of the weakest currencies in the world, as is sometimes alleged, but because the Government judged that a somewhat larger devaluation than the dollar would be in the best interests of South Africa. It will, in the first place, give adequate protection to our secondary industries&#x2014;and here we must remember that the pound sterling and the French franc were devalued by 14,3 per cent and 11,1 per cent in 1967 and 1969 respectively, thus giving Britain and France a competitive advantage in our market. Secondly a greater stimulus to our export industries, some of which have been experiencing difficult times in foreign markets, seems justified, and in this connection we must bear in mind the possible consequences for some export industries of Britain&#x2019;s accession to the European Economic Community. Allied to this is the desirability of giving an added stimulus to the gold mining industry, which for nearly twenty years after 1949 had to accept practically a fixed price for its product in terms of local currency&#x2014;something with which few, if any, other major industries in the world have had to contend. Lastly, it is desirable to scotch any impression that the devaluation of the rand is insufficient or is only an interim step&#x2014;an impression which, as the House will have observed, has gained some ground in the case of the United States dollar. If a currency has to be devalued, then it is desirable that the devaluation should be large enough to ensure that it is regarded as final.</p>

<p>Devaluation naturally tends to raise the price of imported goods in terms of rands. This is an inevitable and in some respects even a desirable tendency, since it increases the ability of local industry to compete with imported articles. In our case the price-raising effect is likely to be limited, at least for the immediate future, by the presence of large pre-devaluation stocks within the country, and also by the action of some foreign exporters in cutting prices in order to retain their markets. On the other hand, there will, unfortunately, always be some merchants who will seek to take advantage of the situation by raising prices to a quite unjustifiable extent, but the Government has already given evidence of its determination to act against such practices.</p>

<p>The stimulus given by devaluation to the export industries and to those industries which thereby gain some added protection against foreign competition, should give a welcome fillip to our whole economy. The greatest danger is that the advantage gained through devaluation will be dissipated in rising costs. It is therefore vital that we should maintain our measures against inflation while at the same time permitting <span class="col_955-956" refersTo="page_0495"/>healthy growth. It is above all important that we should not, through excessive increases in wages, salaries and other cost items, raise our cost structure to such an extent that the stimulus of devaluation is lost. I believe that organized labour in South Africa, which has always acted with great responsibility, will, in its own interest and in the national interest, exercise restraint and moderation in this respect.</p>

<p>What has been the effect of devaluation thus far on the South African balance of payments&#x003F; Obviously the full effects will take some time to show themselves, but it is significant that, in the seven weeks since devaluation up to 4th February, the gold and foreign exchange reserves of the Reserve Bank rose by R49 million or an average of R7 million per week. This excludes the effect of the revaluation of the Bank&#x2019;s gold and foreign exchange and also excludes the new allocation of Special Drawing Rights at the beginning of January. This gain of R7 million per week may be compared with a loss of R85 million in the seven weeks before devaluation&#x2014;an average fall of R12 million per week. In other words, there has been an improvement of some R19 million per week on the average over the period.</p>

<p>Turning for a moment to the international scene, I should like to refer briefly to the price of gold. Honourable members will know that the price on the free market has risen appreciably in recent weeks. It should be remembered, of course, that the price is usually expressed in terms of dollars, and that the increase in terms of the revalued currencies is not nearly so great. To some extent the recent increase must be ascribed to speculation and to the continuing uncertainty regarding the dollar to which I have already referred. While the higher free market gold price is welcome to South Africa, my own feeling is that it would be in the long-term interest of the world and of South Africa if we were now to have a period of greater calm and stability in international finance. This does not affect my belief that the ultimate solution for the world&#x2019;s currency problems lies in the restoration of dollar convertibility into gold, and that this can only be attained through a substantial rise in the official dollar price of gold. I believe strongly that this would be the best solution for the world and for America itself, but I shall not pursue this subject further here this afternoon.</p>

<p>The third unsatisfactory aspect of our economy to which I referred was the slower growth rate, and to a considerable extent my remarks on devaluation cover this aspect too. The slowing down in our rate of growth is due in the first instance to the general cooling down of our economy, and to that extent it provides a necessary breathing space for consolidation before we enter a new expansionary phase. Other contributory factors include the recession experienced in certain export industries and the apparent decline in productivity. In its annual report the Reserve Bank noted that, during the twelve-monthly period to June, 1971, employment in the non-agricultural sectors of the economy increased by approximately 5 per cent whereas the contributions of these sectors to the real gross domestic product rose by only about 4 per cent, which indicates a decline in production per worker.</p>

<p>Whatever the causes, there is no doubt that the stimulus provided by devaluation furnishes a golden opportunity for the resumption of rapid growth. It is for private enterprise to seize this chance, for South Africa is a private enterprise economy. The ability of our industry and commerce to adapt itself to the new circumstances, to recognize and to grasp the opportunity&#x2014;in our rugby parlance, to &#x201C;take the gap&#x201D;&#x2014; will be tested to the full. We shall need, as I have already mentioned, moderation and restraint on the part of organized labour, but we shall also need enterprise and marketing ability on the part of management, and organizing ability to promote greater productivity.</p>

<p>Certainly, the Government must also play its part. One of the matters which will require consideration is the appropriate monetary and credit policies which will permit healthy growth without exposing us to the risk of undue inflationary pressure. The authorities have recognized that the present credit ceiling on the monetary banks has unsatisfactory aspects, notably in its tendency to stimulate the so-called grey market. But for various reasons it has hitherto not been possible to change the basis of this anti-inflationary measure. The matter is, however, now receiving close attention, as also are several other matters relating to economic growth.</p>

<p>Devaluation presents us with a challenge. We need a combined national effort, a positive programme to meet this challenge and to reap the maximum benefit from devaluation. <span class="col_957-958" refersTo="page_0496"/>With co-operation between the Government and the private sector, I believe that a period of renewed expansion in our economy is within our grasp.</p>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>From the documents which have already been tabled, hon. members will note that provision is being made for additional expenditure to the amount of R12 024 000 which must be defrayed from revenue funds during the financial year 1971-&#x2019;72.</p>

<p>The revenue for the present financial year will be dealt with when the Main Estimates are submitted on 8th March, therefore I shall not say anything about that now.</p>

<p>The additional appropriation under Railways&#x2014;Head No. 14, Interest on Capital, Net Revenue Account&#x2014;amounts to R3 919 000. This increase is due mainly to the increase in interest rates on loan fund withdrawals and the conversion of stocks. In addition, loan funds were drawn from the Treasury earlier than originally anticipated.</p>

<p>In respect of Head No. 15&#x2014;Interest on Superannuation and other Funds&#x2014;an additional amount of R7 290 000 is required, mainly as a result of a decision taken last year to increase the previous guaranteed rate of interest of 4&#x00BD; per cent on the balances of the Pension Funds to the average rate of interest earned from year to year on the Administration&#x2019;s permanent investments with the Public Debt Commissioners.</p>

<p>Under Head no. 17&#x2014;Miscellaneous Expenditure&#x2014;additional provision is being made to the amount of R815 000, mainly as a result of losses suffered on the realization of investments.</p>

<p>Additional expenditure on capital and betterment works amounts to R19 909 700, but as a result of savings on existing provisions an amount of R15 840 200 can be financed from that source, while R4 million is required from the Betterment Fund. The balance of R69 500 is available as a result of the recovery of working capital <span class="col_959-960" refersTo="page_0497"/>provided for the construction and electrification of private sidings. No additional loan funds will therefore be required.</p>

<p>Under Head No. 1&#x2014;Construction of Railways&#x2014;an additional cash provision of R8 700 000 is required, mainly because the construction of the new railway line from Vryheid to a point on the line being constructed between Empangeni and Richard&#x2019;s Bay has progressed more quickly than anticipated when the Railway Budget was introduced last year.</p>

<p>The additional provision under Head No. 2&#x2014;New Works on Open Lines&#x2014;amounts to R6 320 500. This includes, <i>inter alia,</i> cash provision for a number of urgent works which have in the meantime been financed from Unforeseen Works Vote and for which specific provision now has to be made, while an additional cash provision to the amount of R728 800 is required in respect of provisional costs in connection with the proposed railway line for the exportation of coal through Richard&#x2019;s Bay. In order to keep pace with the good progress being made with certain work, it is necessary to increase the cash provision for several items. Thus, for example, it will be necessary to increase the provision for the partial doubling of the railway line and the installation of centralized traffic control between Klerksdorp and Fourteen Streams by almost R900 000.</p>

<p>The earlier delivery of cartage service vehicles necessitates an amount of R1,4 million being voted.</p>

<p>In regard to Head No. 3&#x2014;Rolling Stock &#x2014;the additional provision of R2 469 000 is required mainly as a result of the earlier delivery of main-line wagons and tank wagons for the conveyance of treacle.</p>

<p>During the year the South African Airways took over the handling equipment at the airports and the cash provision of R463 000 being requested under Head No. 6&#x2014;Airways&#x2014;is intended mainly for this.</p>

<p>Under Head No. 7&#x2014;-Pipelines&#x2014;provision is being made for an additional amount of R350 000, R300 000 of which is required for the construction of a pipeline for the conveyance of aviation fuel from Sasolbure to Jan Smuts Airport; R50 000 is required for improved fire-fighting measures.</p>

<p>A further amount of R1,5 million is required under Head No. 8&#x2014;Working Capital&#x2014;in order to complete transactions entered into in terms of the Administration&#x2019;s house ownership scheme.</p>

<p>By way of summary, the position is that an additional appropriation of R12 024 000 for expenditure to be defrayed from revenue funds and R19 909 700 in respect of capital and betterment works is required.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the measure before us is not one which lends itself to a detailed debate, being limited under the rules to the specific items which are dealt with in the two additional estimates.</p>

<p>The main increase is of course the same increase as that from which South Africa as a whole is suffering, namely higher interest rates. However, we welcome the expenditure on higher interest rates for the Superannuation and other funds. This is a matter which we have always felt strongly about. This is the railwayman&#x2019;s money which is being used, and we have always felt that he should get the maximum possible interest on it, the same sort of interest which he would obtain if that money was freely invested in the public finance field. However, I do not want to deal with it in detail. I would have thought however that the hon. the Minister would perhaps use the opportunity to expand on the effect which the greater flexibility in the use of budgeted funds has had during the current year. As he knows, last year the Select Committee dealt with various measures to make it possible to achieve greater flexibility in the spending of money and savings. The hon. the Minister has not referred to that specifically. Perhaps he would care to do so and indicate to what extent the measures taken, the flexibility given to the Administration, has achieved the purpose for which it was designed. There are other matters which we will raise in the subsequent stages of the Bill. Therefore I will not take them further at this stage.</p>

<p>The hon. member knows that there is a very large amount of capital invested in stocks carrying a low rate of interest, of 4&#x00BD; per cent or 4&#x00BC; per cent. Today interests on stocks are, of course, considerably higher. It has been the practice for some years to sell some of the stocks carrying a low rate of interest, at a loss obviously. The money is being reinvested in stocks carrying a higher rate of interest. Over a period of three years the loss suffered because of the selling of stocks is usually recouped. In this particular case certain stocks with an interest rate of 4&#x00BD; per cent or 4&#x00BC; per cent were sold. Some of the money was invested in stocks carrying a higher rate of interest and some of the money was utilized for capital expenditure. That is the reason for the total loss of R795 600 which occurs under this head.</p>

The following evening the horse was injured during shunting operations at Bloemfontein to such an extent that it died. This was entirely due to the negligence of the shunters. They flyshunted the truck with the horse without putting on the handbrake. The truck collided with another truck and the horse was injured to such an extent that it died.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not think the speeding-up of the work will make any difference. However, as the hon. member knows escalation clauses are included in all such big contracts. In other words, as labour costs and the cost of materials increase, the total amount eventually becomes so much more. As circumstances are today, the ultimate cost of constructing this railway line will probably be considerably more than has been provided for here. This is what I expect will probably happen. The sooner the work is completed, therefore, the better it will be for the Administration and the contractors.</p>

The hon. member probably knows that when the gradient is reduced and curves are flattened trains can move so much faster over that section of line.</p>

<p>The modifications under items Nos. 122 and 123 are necessary for the safety and efficiency of Boeing 707 aircraft. Owing to the tight flight schedule, these aircraft have not always been readily available for modifications and the work was consequently not completed by March, 1971. Item 123 is to provide for escape slide illumination on the Boeing 707 aircraft.

<p>No. The problem is that the pipeline will have to be extended to the other refineries, and these are all in Durban. It will be a considerable expense to build a pipeline from Jan Smuts to Durban. The one at Sasolburg, close to Jan Smuts Airport, is the only refinery we have in the Transvaal. We cannot use the ordinary pipeline for aviation fuel, because the aviation fuel might be contaminated by the other products flowing through that pipeline, and to have contaminated aviation fuel supplied to aircraft, would be a very dangerous procedure. Because it is a short distance from Natref to Jan Smuts, this pipeline will be for the sole use of Natref conveying their aviation fuel to Jan Smuts.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister confirms that that is the position. I want to ask him then what the comparative cost is in regard to the supply of aviation fuel. In the past there have been tenders. Different companies have tendered and it has been possible for the Administration to take the lowest tender. Natref have now obtained a monopoly. On what basis is there to be any check on prices and competition which previously were governed by private enterprise and the competitive availability of other fuel&#x003F; In the past other companies have had the contracts. The contracts have been allocated on a tender basis and various suppliers have obtained these contracts. They must have got the aviation fuel there in the past. The hon. the Minister says that they cannot use the pipelines, but I understood that aviation fuel could be pumped through the pipelines. I should like to have some further information from the hon. the Minister in regard to these two aspects, viz. how aviation fuel was supplied in the past if it could not be pumped through the pipeline, and what the competitive situation is going to be now, in other words what control there will be over what the Administration pays for this, the most valuable monopoly in the whole of aviation in South Africa. This is after all the vast bulk of aviation fuel which is supplied.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Until the pipeline is built, aviation fuel will be transported by <span class="col_967-968" refersTo="page_0501"/>tank-wagon. Once the pipeline has been built, it will be transported by pipeline. You cannot possibly ask for tenders when there is no pipeline from Durban to Jan Smuts. It is considerably more expensive to transport aviation fuel by tank-wagons than by pipeline. One of the arguments of the Opposition is that the transportation of oil products by pipeline is so much cheaper than transportation by rail that I ought to reduce the charges. It is to the advantage of the Administration, the Railways and the Airways to have the aviation fuel transported by pipeline from Natref refinery at Sasolburg instead of by tank-wagon from Durban, from the other refineries. In regard to the cost, I can assure the hon. member that the Administration will not allow itself to be exploited by any companies. If a company starts exploiting the Administration by charging unduly high prices for aviation fuel, we shall be prepared to extend the pipeline to other refineries, to enable the other oil companies to compete. A very close watch will be kept on the prices charged because the Administration of course knows what the price of aviation fuel is. When tenders are called for there is a very slight difference in the prices quoted by the different oil companies, because most of them are fixed prices.</p>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I understand that one pipeline from Durban to Johannesburg, or to Kroonstad, wherever the link is, actually does pump refined products such as petrol, and I understand that it does in fact convey aviation fuel. I understand that that is the position at the present moment&#x003F;</p>

<p>In other words, the oil companies objected. They say that the aviation fuel will be contaminated. The Minute continues&#x2014;</p>

<p>I can therefore tell the hon. member that no aviation fuel is being pumped through the pipeline at the present time. It is being sent by tank-wagon and not through the pipeline. Petroleum products such as petrol and oil are pumped through the pipeline, but not aviation fuel. Aviation fuel is being transported by tank-wagon.

<summary>(Committee Stage resumed)</summary>

<p>Clause 2 (contd.):</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is always a bit difficult to recommence a Committee Stage argument on a clause after having had a break of two or three days, so I am sure, Sir, you will bear with me, as the first speaker on this side, if I recapitulate a little bit of the arguments advanced when we last discussed this matter on Friday. I am sure that not only the hon. the Deputy Minister but other members will appreciate it if I bring this argument to the point that we had reached when the debate was adjourned on Friday.</p>

<p>Sir, at that stage various questions had been put to the hon. the Deputy Minister and he had given a reply which, I regret to say, was not wholly satisfactory to us <span class="col_969-970" refersTo="page_0502"/>on this side of the House. I want to raise with him again those particular aspects with which we were not satisfied. My hon. friend, the member for Durban Point, had asked the hon. the Deputy Minister about the provision which he had made in the amendment proposed by him to clause 2, namely to add a further subclause (4) and had asked him why provision was being made only for a reduction in the amount of the levy to be paid by an employer if an employee left his employ before the end of the month. The hon. the Deputy Minister said that this had been requested by commerce and industry for ease of administration. Mr. Chairman, I am sorry I cannot accept that argument at all. I also wonder why the hon. the Deputy Minister has proposed such a cumbersome amendment as this proposed new subclause (4). Surely it would have been a simple matter to say that if a Bantu was not employed for the full month, the contribution would be on a <i>pro rata</i> basis, as he has provided for here in the Bill; that the contribution to be paid by the employer would be on the basis of the ratio that the number of days worked bears to 30.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Durban Point has asked the hon. the Deputy Minister to move such an amendment. I hope he has had time to think about this over the weekend, and I sincerely hope that he is going to tell this Committee just now that he accepts the principle, because surely this is the logical thing to do, firstly; it is the fairest thing to do, secondly, and, thirdly, from the point of view of ease of administration, not only for his department but also for the employers concerned, the easiest and the simplest thing to say is that if the Bantu is employed for X days, the ratio which X bears to 30 will be the amount of the levy or of this tax which is now being introduced by the hon. the Deputy Minister. The amendment moved by the hon. member for Kensington was to add a proviso that the provisions of this Bill will not apply to housewives and farmers. The hon. the Deputy Minister has indicated that he cannot accept this amendment, but he has said that the Act will not apply to housewives and to farmers at this stage. Now, if this is what the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s intention is, why is he asking for this power now and why will he not accept the amendment moved by the hon. member for Kensington&#x003F;</p>

<p>But&#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Before the hon. the Deputy Minister says anything further, let me just remind him of what is contained in the Bantu Services Levy Act, where, in terms of section 2, the Act applies only to an urban area or to &#x201C;every other urban area and every other area or portion of an area under the jurisdiction of a body contemplated by paragraph (vi) of section 85 of the South Africa Act&#x201D;, which is an urban or a peri-urban area. There are no farmers in any of those areas. So at this stage it does not apply to farmers and therefore this becomes a new tax on farmers. The Deputy Minister says he does not intend to tax farmers, but he will not accept an amendment to the Bill to the effect that he may not tax those farmers, if he does wish to do so. It is all very well for the hon. the Deputy Minister to say that he gives us his word that he does not want to tax them at this stage. Sir, I submit that when he does want to tax them he should then come to this House and take power to tax them, but he must not ask for it now and say that he might use it in the future. He says he is not going to use it, but he might want to use it in the future, so he is taking the power now. That is not the way that we should be asked to legislate in this House.</p>

<p>Exactly the same argument applies to the question of housewives. If I may refresh the memory of the hon. the Deputy Minister I must point out that section 3 (2) of the Bantu Services Levy Act reads: &#x201C;No contribution shall be payable in respect of any domestic servant employed by a private householder &#x2026;&#x201D; Now the Deputy Minister says it is not his intention to tax that housewife &#x201C;at this stage&#x201D;. I do not know whether that is just talk for Brakpan or for the other various by-elections that are taking place, or whether it is his intention to apply this tax only after those byelections have taken place. But we on this side of the House feel that if it is not his intention to tax these people now, they should be specifically excluded, and when this Deputy Minister feels that the time has come when he must tax them&#x2014;if that time arises&#x2014;he can come back to this House and ask for an amendment and make out a case why he should tax them and why he needs the money.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister in his reply <span class="col_971-972" refersTo="page_0503"/>to the amendment of the hon. member for Pinelands, setting a ceiling of R1 on the tax which he can place on employers, said that if he accepted R1 there would be many places in the Republic which would operate at a loss. What does he mean by &#x201C;operate at a loss&#x201D;&#x003F; I fail to see how he can say that they will &#x201C;operate at a loss&#x201D;, because there is no question of expenditure here. There is no question of expenditure which is fixed and which has to be paid out. This is a levy which was applied originally to employers of Bantu to provide amenities for those people, amenities commensurate with the amounts which would be collected by way of levies. Now the Deputy Minister talks about operating at a loss. How can they operate at a loss&#x003F; We have heard of these tremendous surpluses which have been built up, and I must repeat again, built up through the actions of this hon. Deputy Minister&#x2019;s department, who have not allowed the local authorities concerned to spend the money on amenities.</p>

<p>To the surpluses in the Bantu Services Levy Fund. As I say, there are these surpluses which have been built up, but they have been built up because of the actions of the department. I cannot see what the hon. the Deputy Minister means when he talks about operating at a loss. They cannot operate at a loss, unless of course the argument which we raised in this House last year against the Bantu Administration Act, whereby the Bantu Administration Boards were established, is correct. We said then that these Boards would cost more money, but it was of course denied by the hon. the Deputy Minister. I wonder if the hon. the Deputy Minister can tell us what he means by this &#x201C;running at a loss&#x201D;&#x003F;</p>

<p>I now come to the hon. member for Langlaagte. I am glad to see that he is here with us. What he said was, firstly, that this is not a tax&#x2014;this statement we reject completely&#x2014;and then he said that not a jot or tittle is going to be added to the cost of the employer.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to follow on what the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District has said in regard to domestic servants. I do hope that the hon. the Deputy Minister will give some thought to the problem which arises in densely populated, areas such as my constituency. With a large number of flat dwellers, there is an attempt to eliminate the need for domestic servants-in-residence; in other words, use is made of casual labourers or chars. An extraordinary situation arises in this regard if such a casual worker or &#x201C;los arbeider&#x201D; must be registered in terms of the present provisions of the law. I have before me one of the documents issued by the Bantu Affairs Department to such a char and I want to read to the hon. the Deputy Minister what is on this document. It says that the bearer is permitted to work as a casual labourer in the prescribed area of the Cape Peninsula. Certain particulars must be furnished, such as the names and addresses of the persons by whom she is employed and the dates upon which she worked. There is a schedule which the char must complete. Then there is an &#x201C;N.B.&#x201D; which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Geen Bantoevrou wat wettiglik in die voorgeskrewe gebied is, mag sonder registrasie in sodanige voorgeskrewe gebied werk nie.</block>

<p>Then comes the point which I want to emphasize&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Werk op drie of meer dae per week word as voltydse diens beskou en gewone registrasie moet daarvoor verkry word.</block>

<p>What is the position if eight good housewives, who support the Nationalist Party and believe in the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s policy of reducing Bantu labour, decide that they will share a char between them&#x003F; They each have the char for two hours per day for three days per week. The char works eight hours per day for six days a week. As the law now stands, the hon. the Minister will have to go to eight housewives to pay the levy in respect of the same char, the same Bantu employee, because she will be in the permanent employ of each of those housewives. The hon. the Deputy Minister shakes his head. I do not expect him at this moment to be able to answer the question.</p>

<p>Here is the document before me and I myself took it up with the department and <span class="col_973-974" refersTo="page_0504"/>I asked them whether they were not keen that housewives should use non-resident domestic servants in places like Sea Point and Green Point which are densely populated. The hon. the Deputy Minister shakes his head. I hope he will explain where I am wrong, because here is an official document. If each one of those persons employs a char and has her in her home on three days a week, be it for two hours per day each, it constitutes full-time employment. There will thus be eight employers of one employee. This is a matter which causes me to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister to think again on the amendment which was moved by the hon. member for Kensington, to exclude domestic servants entirely from this levy. This levy places an additional burden on housewives, it causes additional paper work for housewives, and heaven knows housewives have a tough enough time at the present time with cost-of-living and other problems without having this additional burden.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when the debate was adjourned last week, the hon. the Deputy Minister was unable to tell us the purpose for which the additional money which he required is to be used. When it was suggested to him that it was a form of indirect taxation, he and those who supported him, took the line that it actually replaced a levy which had been in existence for some time and that it was nothing new. He did continue to reiterate during the course of his address to the House on this subject, that he needed funds for administrative purposes. I wonder for what administrative purposes he wishes to use the money. When he painted a picture of the various amenities which he thought should be provided to assist labour conditions, he did paint us a picture of amenities which obviously required the expenditure of funds. However, he did not clearly indicate that the money which he intended to raise by virtue of what he calls the levy, and which we maintain is a form of indirect taxation, was to be used for purely administrative purposes or for any other purposes. If you have a look at the Bantu Revenue Account, which is going to be taken over by these boards, you will find an expenditure of approximately R10&#x00BD; million for Johannesburg and that it will receive approximately R10&#x00BD; million. Money is used for all sorts of purposes. It is used to pay salaries, for example for the administration. To take again Johannesburg as an example, you will find that approximately R3&#x00BD; million is paid out for salaries. It then expends another R3&#x00BD; million on various administrative matters such as advertising, bursraies, conferences, insurance, investigations, legal expenses, medical services, nursery schools, etc. Then it spends a further amount of money on maintaining the townships in which the Bantu find themselves, townships falling under the administration of this particular body. It also deals with the maintenance of buildings and then it receives a considerable amount of money to meet all these expenses, from the Bantu labour bureau fees, from Bantu registration fees, transport levies, cemetery fees, fines, licence fees, lodger permits, nursery school services, produce markets, rents, sundry revenue, etc. At the same time it also receives money from the beer profits whereby it can alleviate certain losses with regard to housing and also to provide certain recreation. Furthermore it receives certain moneys from some other account which I cannot pinpoint right now. However, it does receive certain contributions towards the various services. Hon. members can well imagine that this is a revenue account which envisages considerable expenditure of money which maintains enormous trading departments, such as beer sales. The other money they get in, which I could not pinpoint just now, was from the sales of liquor, the sales of general liquor other than the Bantu Beer which is sold through its breweries. It has enormous turnovers. It is a very big undertaking and it meets all the expenditure through the income which is received from various sources. Normally the rentals would pay for the maintenance of houses and the provision thereof, for the redemption and interest thereof, while shortages would be made up through the various trading departments with which the Bantu Revenue Account deals. When we look at the Bantu Administration Boards, we would probably envisage a little more expenditure because we know that as soon as the Government decides to create something fresh or when it decides to take something away from the normal administration of a town or city or out of the hands of private enterprise or when it forms a co-operative or decides to establish <span class="col_975-976" refersTo="page_0505"/>another board of some nature, it requires additional expenses for a new cocoon which has just been brought into being, and from which eventually something has to burst forth to see the light of day. So I envisage that there will be a certain amount of additional expenditure. Why the sum of the additional expenditure has to be R5&#x00BD; million in the case of one municipality, which is most probably emblematical of other municipalities, we do not know. Surely that cannot all be required for administrative purposes. If it can be, if it will be, then surely the hon. the Deputy Minister must explain why he needs such a large sum of money for administrative purposes. If he requires it for other purposes in the townships, if he requires it to assist those small little entities that fall under the administration of the board, let him give us an example, because I cannot conceive, no matter how broad the activities of any particular Bantu administration board will be, that it will require the R23 million which the hon. the Deputy Minister envisages to obtain at the rate of R1,05 cents. He has already almost conceded that the figure will be R1,50 because he has now placed a fresh ceiling, the removal of which will require notice to the public. Therefore, at R1,50 he will obtain about R30 million. What is this money required for&#x003F; The least this House is entitled to know is how he intends to dispose of that money. If it is merely for administration, let us know what new empire is being created in the country that requires a further R30 million from the pocket of the public. If, on the other hand, he is going to do something constructive and valuable, the House is surely entitled to know what the future entails in the work which the boards will carry out. The hon. member for Langlaagte, who should himself have given us a better explanation than he did, contented himself merely by saying: &#x201C;A replaces B, therefore A is virtually equal to B and no one is affected at all.&#x201D; I maintain that there is very much more in this matter than can merely be dismissed in this lighthearted manner in which the chairman of a very important committee of this House has done it. I call upon the hon. the Deputy Minister, who does endeavour to show some sense of co-operation in these important and vital matters, to enlighten the House as to how he intends to spend the money. At least let there be some cold comfort on the side of the taxpayer burdened as he is already to a greater extent than he should be, that his money may be put to a useful and valuable purpose and not to create another empire in the country which will add on to the numerous other boards and directors-general and deputy generals that are being appointed here, there and everywhere in order to multiply continuously the servants of the State and continuously draw this manpower out of the meagre manpower force that we have available in South Africa to try to build up the growth in this country for which the Minister of Finance pleads so very sincerely and abjectly at times. If the hon. the Deputy Minister can give us this story, he can bring this debate to a very much quicker end.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when the debate was adjourned last week, two matters were before the hon. the Deputy Minister, matters on which we have not received satisfactory replies.</p>

<p>The first of these was the question of work for part of a month. Two categories of such employees are reduced to a proportionate tax or levy depending on how long they have worked, but the third category is not. The category of person who was in employment and dismissed during a month now has applied to him only a proportionate amount of the levy, or tax as we call it, according to the period he worked. A person employed after the first of the month and dismissed on or before the end of the month, equally, is levied only by the proportionate amount, but the person employed during the month who is not dismissed must pay the full amount for a full month, even if he worked for only one day. This is an unacceptable discrimination, and the only reply of the hon. the Minister was that it is for administrative convenience.</p>

<from><span class="col_977-978" refersTo="page_0506"/>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Of course. Then he pays only for those few days that he did work.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>That is right, but he has already paid for the whole of the month in which he was engaged. So if he is engaged on the 29th of the month and he is dismissed on the 5th of the following month, he has worked for one week but he has paid for the whole of the month in which he was employed plus for five days of the month in which he was dismissed. Consequently he has paid for 1&#x00BC; months for one week&#x2019;s work. In other words, he is penalized five times the ratio of work done simply because he is employed before the last day of the month. I have said that this will mitigate against the employment of a man if a week&#x2014;in a factory where the staff is weekly paid&#x2014; starts, for instance, on the 28th or 29th of the month. The factory is going to be inconvenienced because they do not want to pay one month&#x2019;s levy, which can be from R1,50 to R2,50 eventually, for two days&#x2019; work. Consequently, the factory waits until the first of the month to employ the person, the person loses two days&#x2019; pay, and the factory loses two days&#x2019; production, unless they are prepared to pay a full month&#x2019;s levy for the two days&#x2019; work. If the levy amounts to R1,50, as the hon. the Minister says, the Government is taking a 75 per cent levy per day on the man who works for two days, or a levy of R1,50 per day of work if the person is taken on on the last day of the month. In other words, the Government is taking R1,50 which may well be more than the man himself earns for his labour.</p>

<p>To put this on record, I wish to move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 20, page 7, to omit &#x201C;part of a month in&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;one thirtieth thereof for every day on&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The effect of this is that the full levy will not be payable for a part-month. This is a much simpler provision than that of the hon. the Minister. This amendment says in seven or eight words all that the hon. the Minister said in a long paragraph of some 15 lines, which in any case is very difficult to read and understand and which, I suggest, was intended to be difficult to read and understand, in the hope that no one would notice it. Therefore I move that amendment.</p>

<p>I wish to move a further amendment, as indicated last week, namely to give effect to the assurance of the hon. the Minister that a housewife would not be required to pay more than the 20 cents she is paying now. The hon. the Minister said, &#x201C;The housewife can trust us.&#x201D; I am sorry, but one does not live on trust. I do not trust any &#x201C;hope&#x201D;, which was the word that was used by the hon. the Deputy Minister: he &#x201C;hopes&#x201D; that he will not have to do this; he &#x201C;hopes&#x201D; there will not have to be an increase. There is only one hope I have&#x2014; I hope it will not be long before we do not have this sort of legislation and before we have another Government which will not impose these burdens. As long as we have a Government which keeps imposing more and more burdens on the people we will wherever possible protect the housewife who is already bent by the burden of meeting the cost of living. I want to accept the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s assurance. Therefore I move my other amendment namely&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To add the following proviso at the end of paragraph (a) of subsection (2):</block>

<block name="quote">Provided that any contribution in respect of domestic servants shall not exceed twenty-five cents on registration and twenty cents per month thereafter.</block>

<p>That is what the Minister said. He said that housewives would not have to pay more than 20 cents. If he meant it, he must accept this amendment; if he does not accept this amendment, he did not mean it. It stands in Hansard, and I checked on it. He said that housewives would not be expected to pay more than the 20 cents which they are paying now.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the United Party is repeatedly making a political issue of this matter. We said this the other day, and I want to repeat it. The hon. the Deputy Minister said very clearly on a previous occasion that these fees, i.e. the registration fees, the labour bureau fees and the levies would now be consolidated into one contribution, and the hon. member for Durban Point is trying skilfully to make politics out of this matter. He does so with only one thought in mind, i.e. the elections that are in the offing. By those means he is trying to obtain votes for the United Party from the housewives. He did so, in the first place, with a view to the by-election at Brakpan on the 23rd, and in the second place with a view to the municipal election on the Witwatersrand, where the United Party is fighting on a political basis.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. Z. J. VAN VUUREN</person>:</from>

<p>He said that he could not do this forever; but for the present, at least, this levy will not be any higher. I just want hon. members to read the Hansard section dated 18th June, 1952; then they would see that today they are again dishing up the same old story they dished up at the time. When Dr. Verwoerd was Minister at the time he said very clearly that hon. members were only stirring up politics in connection with this matter. It is not realistic. It is not according to the provisions of this Act.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the hon. member for Jeppes. I regret that he is not present at the moment. The hon. member is endowed with the gift of a vocabulary that runs away with him and he uses a lot of words and phrases that have no content whatsoever. He spoke of all that <span class="col_981-982" refersTo="page_0508"/>Johannesburg must contribute to supplement this levy with additional contributions. However, I want to remind him that as a result of additional services and various projects the City Council undertakes in those areas, additional tax must be collected from the White taxpayer of Johannesburg to supplement that Bantu revenue account loss. I want the taxpayers, who have to conduct a municipal election in Johannesburg and on the Witwatersrand on 1st March, to take note that Johannesburg, under the United Party policy, is the only city council in South Africa in which the White taxpayer must pay out of his own pocket for Bantu administration in locations. This is the result of the rotten United Party which is at the helm there. We have experience of that, and the hon. member for Jeppes knows it as well as I do. We have flung it in his teeth on many occasions.</p>

<p>Adjoining Johannesburg lie the resettlement board areas. I challenge the hon. member for Jeppes to come here and show me where we do not furnish resettlement board areas similar services to those Johannesburg furnishes in its areas. We do so without asking one iota more of the White Johannesburg taxpayer. We do so from the revenue we obtain as a result of the levy. With that we administer those areas and still have an annual surplus on that account. But I need not only mention the Resettlement Board. I also want to mention other municipalities, for example that of Benoni. That municipality&#x2019;s Bantu revenue account comes to a very favourable close every year with a surplus. The position is the same for Springs and Boksburg and all those areas.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Langlaagte has now told us of the municipal, Witwatersrand and other elections, such as the Brakpan election, and spoken very little about the clause under discussion. It seems to me he is nervous and afraid. He sees the spectre of Benoni in the elections that are going to take place.</p>

<p>This clause contains, as it were, two principles. Provision is being made for the determination of two amounts, one for the White employers of R2,50 per month and one for the Bantu worker of R1. The hon. the Deputy Minister has now moved an amendment in which he states that he will not increase an amount of R1,50 by more than 20 per cent unless he gives at least one year&#x2019;s notice of that in the <i>Gazette.</i> Sir, that will not help at all, because he could increase that amount of R1,50 by 19,9 per cent without giving notice of it in the <i>Gazette.</i> If one regards that in the light of what the hon. member for Langlaagte said the other day, i.e. that &#x201C;it is only a ceiling towards which we can move&#x201D;, one realizes that moves of 19,9 per cent per annum could be made without notification in the <i>Gazette.</i> We consequently see a danger there.</p>

<p>Sir, here once again we have an ambiguous word-game by that side of the House. This ambiguous word-game always comes to the fore when they speak about race relations in South Africa. I have here the &#x201C;Handwoordeboek van die Afrikaanse Taal&#x201D;. We are accused of playing politics if we call these amounts or levies or whatever a tax. But, Sir, the hon. member for Langlaagte himself used these words. He said it is not a tax; it is a levy. He and the hon. the Deputy Minister also used the word &#x201C;fooi&#x201D;. What does the Afrikaans dictionary say about that&#x003F; Let us look first of all at the word &#x201C;heffing&#x201D;. According to the Afrikaans dictionary a &#x201C;heffing&#x201D; is &#x201C;die handeling van belasting, boete, ens.&#x201D;. That is what a &#x201C;heffing&#x201D; is according to the dictionary. What is stated in connection with the word &#x201C;fooi&#x201D;&#x003F; According to hon. members opposite a &#x201C;fooi&#x201D; is paid by the housewife. This is what the dictionary states in this connection: &#x201C; &#x2019;n Fooi is &#x2019;n geskenkie <span class="col_983-984" refersTo="page_0509"/>in geld aan &#x2019;n bediende of ondergeskikte vir bewese ebenste of gedane moeite.&#x201D; Then it states further: &#x201C; &#x2019;n Mens kan tog nie aan &#x2019;n mediese dokter of &#x2019;n prokureur &#x2019;n fooi betaal nie.&#x201D; That is what the Afrikaans dictionary states. Now we come to the word &#x201C;belasting&#x201D;. The dictionary states: &#x201C; &#x2019;n Belasting is die verpligte betaling aan die Staat of ander Regeringsliggame om noodsaaklike idenste te verskaf.&#x201D; What then is this amount other than a tax&#x003F; It is a compulsory payment to the State for the purpose of supplying essential services. The entire debate is concerned with essential services. The Minister says he needs the money to furnish those services. Why does that side of the House not accept the fact that it is a tax&#x003F; They must not use words such as &#x201C;heffing&#x201D; and &#x201C;fooi&#x201D;; they must accept the fact that it is a tax, and let the people of South Africa know as much. Let them know it even before this election which the hon. member for Langlaagte is so afraid of.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I merely wish to reply to the hon. member for Langlaagte, who suggests that the whole of this discussion has been prompted by municipal elections which are to take place within a few weeks&#x2019; time. Unfortunately the hon. member for Benoni, no, Langlaagte, lives in his own little world of municipal smalltime affairs. He talks about the Native Resettlement Board, but he does not tell us the whole history of the acquisition of land in Martindale and Sophiatown and of the tremendous assets of which the board has disposed and of the funds which have gone into its coffers; he does not tell you, Sir, that these funds have enabled them to run the so-called &#x201C;model&#x201D; township established by the Government. He does not tell you of the most important pioneering work done by the Johannesburg City Council in low-cost Bantu housing&#x2014;pioneering work which received acclaim in Mauritius, which was rebuilt after the cyclone by Archibald, the housing engineer of Johannesburg, who rebuilt 5&#x00BD; million houses, and who went up north in order to build houses in Tanzania (Tanganyika, as it was then known); he does not tell you, Sir, what the City of Johannesburg has done in the field of Native housing. He has the impertinence to come and compare the work done by the Johannesburg City Council with work done in his little small-time world. The hon. member referred to the deficit in the housing account of the Johannesburg City Council. I knew that he would come along with these unpleasant and unfair criticisms, because he has done it before. He tried to bolster up his hollow arguments with nebulous things, with unpleasant, unfair criticism. Let me tell the hon. member that the Estimates for the year 1971-&#x2019;72 disclose a possible deficit of R1&#x00BC; million, which the ratepayers of Johannesburg are only too delighted to pay, because their objective is to provide important amenities in the field of health and recreation, which are important to the whole of the community, irrespective of colour. After all, health knows no barriers; disease knows no barriers, and the Council has to do what is necessary in the interests of the community. Previously, Sir, the deficits were low. In 1968 there was no deficit at all. Deficits only arose in the years 1968-&#x2019;69, 1969-&#x2019;70 and 1970-&#x2019;71, the years which marked the decline of the Nationalist Party. In those years the deficits went sky high. Sir, I do not think that the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s attention should be diverted from the important issue that we have placed before him. What does he intend to do with R23 million&#x003F; That is all we want to know because it is quite clear from what his own colleagues have told us, that all the municipalities throughout the country are able to meet their budget. The very organized bodies which the board is going to take over, the very bodies for which the board is going to substitute its powers, are not running at a deficit at all. In other words, they do not need extra money. Does he need R23 million to make up the deficit in the Johannesburg account, where there are nearly 800 000 people to administer&#x003F; If that is the reason, let him tell us. If on the other hand the R23 million is required for the public servants who are going to be engaged for the board, for the new personnel, then he must tell us. That is the issue; that is the simple issue. It does not matter whether there are municipal elections. We are not concerned with that; we are concerned with the interest of the taxpayers. The taxpayers are entitled to know why the money is being called for. But to come and tell us that it is a substitution for a levy is a lot of nonsense. This is a new tax and if the hon. the Deputy Minister wants it with the consent of the House he has to enlighten the House on what the money is to be used for, why he needs such a large sum of money, what he intends doing with it, what purpose is the board going to serve, what <span class="col_985-986" refersTo="page_0510"/>new avenues will it open, what new fields will it open in order to assist what he says was his objective.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>We really had a display by the Opposition here this afternoon over a purely administrative matter, but one which is of real importance to the country. The Opposition tried to make the greatest measure of political gain one could possibly try to make from this measure. I do not think it is fair, and this in the Committee Stage of a measure! I just want to give one example. If we on this side also want to make political gain from this measure, here the hon. member for Durban Point rises to his feet and pokes fun in a manner we have seen and heard so many times from him here, to try to catch the votes of the housewives outside. How many times have we heard him discussing toilet-paper and toothpaste and commodities of that kind here, simply to try to catch the vote of the women outside. [Interjections.] He has also talked about hair-rollers and lavender. I cannot even remember all the things he has talked about here. Soap was another of the commodities he was always talking about. Now he comes here again this afternoon and wants to accuse this side of the House, as it were, of not looking after the interests of the housewife in regard to her Bantu domestic servant, and moves that amendment of his. Now I should just like to give members on that side an unequivocal reply, so that the housewives outside can also hear it. The reply is this: The United Party-controlled city councils, while we on this side are looking after the housewife and her interests, have a deficit on the Bantu Revenue Account, in the case of Johannesburg of more than R4 million, which is taken from the White Revenue Account, from the housewife&#x2019;s pocket, to supplement the Bantu Revenue Account and in that way to deal with Bantu administration matters in Johannesburg. Surely that is not fair and for that reason I want to tell the hon. member at the very outset that although I, personally, and although the Government, and although we on this side of the House are extremely sympathetic towards the problems of the housewife, and also towards the problems of the domestic servant in the employ of the housewife, I have already said that the housewife will not pay any more, in so far as one can foresee in terms of this Bill, than what is being paid at present. I say to that hon. member now that I am not prepared to try to catch the housewives vote in a cheap way, and for that reason I find that that amendment of that hon. member, after having given it thorough consideration, is not acceptable to this side of the House.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Because the housewives can take our word for it. [Interjections.] It is because the housewives can take our word for it that in respect of this Bill and in respect of their domestic servants they will not, for the present, pay more than they are paying now. That is fair and that is just. For me to write it into this Bill would only mean that I would be a party to the cheap politicking of that side of the House, and our housewives will not allow themselves to be caught so easily. As we know them, they have too much gumption for that. That is all I want to say in this connection. But I am now compelled to furnish hon. members with a rather detailed reply on another very important aspect which was raised here this afternoon and in the debate so far, because this matter has also been turned into a tremendous political issue, and we cannot keep the country in the dark about what the facts in regard to this question are. You will remember how that side of the Committee repeatedly alleged that there was an accumulated surplus of approximately R26 million&#x2014;I can now inform them that when they are available the latest figures will be considerably more than R26 million&#x2014;in respect of the service levy fees. They are creating the impression that there is a vast, accumulated surplus of, let us then say, R26 million and that this callous Government, in spite of that accumulated surplus, is determining a maximum amount or a ceiling of R2,50 in this Bill in respect of Bantu employees in the employ of White employers.</p>

<p>What are the facts in regard to this matter&#x003F; I should like to refute in very simple language this statement which is either being made through great ignorance or simply in order to mislead the public. I shall do so under two headings, i.e. (1) how did these surpluses in the Bantu Levy Account, amounting to R26 million or more originate, and (2) the so-called covert acquisition and utilization of funds. I hope that the hon. member for Jeppes in particular, who <span class="col_987-988" refersTo="page_0511"/>asked many questions about this to which I now want to reply, will listen. First we must have a thorough understanding of what this so-called service levy is all about, and what it is being utilized for. The 1952 Act stipulates this very clearly. As hon. members opposite ought to know the utilization of these funds is extremely limited. They cannot be used for all kinds of services. They may be used to finance auxiliary services, or to build a road from the boundary of the White area to the boundary of the Bantu urban residential area, or to bring water from the boundary of the White town to the boundary of the Bantu urban area. They may also be utilized for the conveyance of electricity from one boundary to another and for the sewerage system from one boundary to another. That is why we have, in the course of these debates, spoken in general terms of &#x201C;basic services&#x201D;. Because the hon. gentlemen do not know any longer what basic services are &#x2026;</p>

<p>I say that that is why they are succeeding in misleading the country in the way they have been doing during the past few days in regard to this Bill. Within the Bantu urban residential area, for example, a bus road as well as storm-water pipes may be provided. What I have now mentioned is what may be done. These are therefore only basic services. Hon. members can go and consult the Act, and they will see that it is stipulated in this way there.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But what may not be done is, for example that you may not provide a library from those accumulated surpluses and one may not improve the water-supply system within Bantu urban residential area. You may not make electrical amenities available by means of those funds. You may not establish recreational facilities with that money. You may not improve the water-supply system of the Bantu urban residential areas, and you may not use those accumulated surpluses for maintenance. If the feeder roads or the bus road to the Bantu urban residential area falls into a state of disrepair, you may not finance the necessary repairs out of those funds. You may not build a clinic from those funds. You may not establish health facilities or make purchases in that regard by means of those funds. Nor may you finance Bantu education out of those funds. You may not finance housing out of those funds. In other words the purposes for which those accumulated funds may be applied are extremely limited. One therefore has these large accumulated surpluses, as in the case of Johannesburg where it amounts to R6 million, and in other places where the surpluses amount to a few million rand, in the Bantu urban residential areas where these basic services have already been made properly available. The total in the form of accumulated surpluses already amounts to more than R30 million. However, these accumulated surpluses may not be used for the purposes I have just mentioned.</p>

<p>Various attempts were made to free those accumulated funds and in that way alleviate the pressure on the general taxpayer, in other words, the pressure on the housewife mentioned by, <i>inter alia,</i> the hon. member for Durban Point. Strangely enough, it is in fact, as I have said, the large urban areas under United Party control which are always sitting with deficits in their Bantu Revenue Accounts and have to draw money from the White account in order to finance Bantu administration. And we on this side say it is not fair. Even in the case of Johannesburg they have to do this to an amount of millions of rands per year. The amount there is R4 million per annum. These housewives could give some thought to how much their husbands have to pay to the United Party city council of Johannesburg to balance the Bantu Revenue Account in Johannesburg, while there is no need for that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>For the financial year ending June, 1971, it was R1&#x00BE; million.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Our information was that it was R4 million for the previous financial year. [Interjections.] Let it be R1&#x00BE; million now, or whatever amount you like, the fact remains that it was at least R4 million the previous year. That was the official figure, and the hon. member cannot deny that. The point I want to make is that instead of helping the Government to free these accumulated surpluses, they are opposing this step and they make up the deficit from the White Revenue Account and from the pockets of the White taxpayers. So they have watched these funds accumulating in the false hope that it would become a source of embarrassment to the Government. I want to tell them that it did not become a source of embarrassment to this Government, but that is becoming a source of embarrassment to the Opposition. It will become more and more of a source of embarrassment to them. They went and invested this accumulated surplus in a development fund and I would rather not say anything about what happens to the interest on that money. That they can ascertain for themselves, but I want to ask whether it is fair of them to invest this money, which was collected in the interests of the Bantu, in such a way that even the interest may be used for other purposes&#x003F; I say it is not fair. I want to indicate how this surplus originated. My Department decided a long time ago that this service levy fund could be abolished. From what side did we then get the sharpest and the most vehement reaction&#x003F; Last week I challenged the hon. member for Jeppes to tell us why these funds should not be freed. This was followed by a reaction on the part of commerce and industry, and even on the part of local authorities. It was alleged that if the levy in area A were abolished, their neighbours in areas B and C, adjoining area A, would be penalized because area A would then be paying higher wages and would attract the best labour. Hon. members know those arguments. In addition those in area A could afford to sell goods cheaper and therefore be in a more competitive position. It was even alleged that industries would prefer to go to area A because it would be more profitable for them. The representations were so strong that my Department abandoned the repeal of the provisions in individual areas because it was impossible. Consideration was then given to freeing the funds so that those funds, which are so-called surpluses in area A, could be utilized in area B and C so that the Act could be repealed sooner. Time and again, however, and hon. members know this, that Opposition reproached us and referred to the promise given by Dr. Verwoerd. Time and again they opposed this and conjured up spectres of how this Government would be able to utilize the money left, right and centre in the homelands, if those funds were freed. That is why I say that the people responsible for these accumulated funds, which are now in the region of approximately R30 million, are those sitting on the opposite side of the House. We have repeatedly advocated the freeing of those funds, but time and again they reproached us with the promise Dr. Verwoerd had given in this respect, and they did not therefore want to co-operate to free those funds. The fact of the matter is, and there is no doubt about this, that Dr. Verwoerd gave his word in that connection.</p>

<p>I can prove this to them from Hansard. But why are they so stubborn&#x003F; Is it in the interests of South Africa that those vast accumulated funds should lie there, and that they should continue to oppose those funds being freed&#x003F; Mr. Chairman, now you must excuse me: The infinite ambiguity of the Opposition has seldom been better exposed than it has been in regard to this matter, which they keep on opposing. Believe it or not, they come along in this debate and try to make the country believe that in spite of the fact that the Government has so much money in those accumulated funds, it still taxes the White employers to a maximum amount of R2,50. That, I say, is surely infinite ambiguity; it is absolute unfairness of the highest degree. It never occurred to the Opposition, or they refused to admit it, that there were still many services in the Bantu urban areas which had to be provided, and which would in future have to be provided. It is they who time and again reproach the Government so piously in regard to better facilities and conditions in the Bantu urban residential areas. Here we again have and example of their ambiguity. They level the reproach at the Government that there are not enough good amenities in the Bantu urban residential areas. But then they sit there in <span class="col_991-992" refersTo="page_0513"/>their sanctified piety and level accusations at us on this side of the House, while they are the people who cling to those accumulated surpluses of R30 million and more and refuse to free these to be utilized for effecting improvements in the Bantu urban residential areas. Did hon. members see how one speaker after another&#x2014;and this afternoon again the hon. member for Jeppes&#x2014; rose to their feet here during the past few days to ask us how these administration funds which are now going to be collected, are going to be spent&#x003F; Why&#x003F; It was done to create the impression on the general public that this Government is sitting with a vast sum of money and then wants to take more of the public&#x2019;s money without indicating what it wants to use the money for. Now I want to tell hon. members quite simply and directly that the funds which are going to be collected in terms of this legislation now before the House, will very definitely not be added to the service levy funds. Hon. members must have no illusions about this. It will be a flexible fund which we will be able to utilize for various purposes, for example for a bursary for a Bantu scholar, for a library, for establishing a mobile labour bureau or for financing an aid centre. That is why I do not want to commit myself to giving any undertaking as to what this money will be utilized for. Hon. members must have no illusions whatsoever about this. I have no intention whatsoever of committing myself by giving one undertaking in regard to what these funds are going to be utilized for, except to say that it will be ensured to that no unnecessary surpluses are accumulated in the Bantu Revenue Account and that these funds will be utilized primarily for any purposes which will be in the interests of the sound administration of Bantu affairs in the White areas. Now hon. members opposite know what these funds will be used for.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall come to that in a moment.</p>

<p> I just want to say one thing further about the levy fund. Hon. members on that side must have no illusions about this. We are now closing the old levy fund of 1952 with this Bill. After two decades that levy fund has served its purpose. In addition it is obsolete now, and is no longer suited to with the needs of the times. We have the courage of our convictions to create a new instrument now which will enable us to meet the needs of our times and our circumstances and also in this way to bring about progress and development in respect of Bantu administration in White areas as well.</p>

<p> A few questions were put to me, to which I should like to reply.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Green Point raised the question of charwomen. The fact of the matter is that those European employers can form a club; if there are eight, seven, or whatever the case may be, employers employing one charwoman, they can for registration purposes select any one White employer who then pays the necessary fees in respect of that specific charwoman.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>May I take that as official Government policy&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The point which the hon. member made was wrong.</p>

<p>That is why I shook my head. It is not necessary for all eight of the White women employing one charwoman to pay these fees. That is the point. I even object to the impression being created outside this House that, if there are eight White women employing one Bantu charwoman, all eight must pay the fees in respect of that one charwoman, because the point is that they need not all pay that fee. Only one of them need pay that fee.</p>

<p>*I do not want to charge the hon. member with anything, but I leave it to hon. members themselves to judge the fairness or unfairness of that matter. That is in any case my reply to his question.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I think I have replied to the hon. member for Jeppes as to how these funds will be utilized.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member asked again how I am going to use R20 million. I explained to him in my reply during the Second Reading that, if the three levies which are now in operation are combined without any increase whatsoever in respect of the amount now being paid by employers, the amount accruing from the combined levy will be roughly R15 million. I have already said so. He can look at my Hansard. I also said that at the moment there is a R6 million shortfall on the various Bantu Revenue Accounts taken by the United Party city councils from the Consolidated Revenue Account. If you add this amount to the R15 million you get R21 million plus. This will be the case if there is no increase in payment in respect of any employer anywhere in the country. If there is no change in what they pay, this is what the revenue will be after the consolidation of these three fees. The United Party councils do not do it themselves, but we will step in and do it in order to save housewives from paying those extra taxes.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to finish my argument first. We are therefore going to do everything in our power to see that in no instance will there be a shortfall in the Bantu Revenue Account. This will mean an amount of approximately <span class="col_995-996" refersTo="page_0515"/>R22 million even if there is no increase at all. Why does that hon. member then try to create the impression that this Government is now going to take taxes from the European taxpayers&#x2019; pockets in respect of their Bantu employees, which they will then use for purposes which he is trying to besmirch&#x003F; That is not fair.</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. the Deputy Minister a question&#x003F; What are you going to do with that R15 million&#x003F; You have told us about the R6 million deficit which you will try to recover, but what about the R15 million&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But this is ridiculous. At the moment R15 million is being collected in the form of the three separate fees, i.e. the Bantu labour bureau fees, registration fees and the service levy fees. If no employer is expected to pay one cent more than he is paying at the moment, an amount of R15 million will be collected. This R15 million is being used for general administration purposes in various places throughout the Republic of South Africa. Or does the hon. member think that that money is being wasted&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#miller">

<p>You said yourself that you only needed R6 million; that there is a shortfall of only R6 million.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It seems to me that there is only one type of person who can deal with the Opposition, and that is an ex-schoolteacher. Unfortunately I suffer from the disability that I am not able to give lessons all that well. But I shall try to explain again. There is only one difference between the United Party and a gate. The difference is that one can open a gate, but not the minds of the United Party. I shall now try to open the mind of the hon. member. At present the revenue from these three separate fees is R15 million. This money is being utilized for general administration purposes in White areas. It is being spent, <i>inter alia,</i> on labour bureaux, aid centres, clinics and libraries.</p>

<p>At present, however, there are a few urban municipal areas such as Johannesburg for example which have a deficit of approximately R6 million. This R6 million had to be obtained by means of this revenue, but for other reasons, with which I do not want to accuse them now, it did not happen. They are taking that money from the pockets of the White housewives.</p>

<p>We say it is wrong. In our opinion that R6 million should also be taken from the Bantu, Revenue Account. That would just have covered the administration costs in Bantu areas. Does the hon. member understand it now&#x003F; For the present, that will be the amount, i.e. approximately R22 million, up to a maximum of R23 million. We are doing this because we would not like to encourage inflation, and because we do not want the employers to have to pay more for their employees. That is my reply to the question of the hon. member.</p>

<p>Lastly I just want to say a few words about the amendment moved by the hon. member for Durban Point. He moved the deletion of the words &#x201C;part of a month in&#x201D; in line 20, clause 2 (2) (a) and to substitute the words &#x201C;one-thirtieth thereof for every day on&#x201D;. To prove that I am really trying to be very fair now, I can tell him that under the circumstances I accept the amendment. Because it is not such a terribly important matter from our point of view, I have suggested that we would like to try to facilitate the administration. I am therefore quite prepared to accept the amendment moved by the hon. member for Durban Point.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Subsection (2) (a) will therefore read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the case of an employer, the amount of R2,50 for every month or one-thirtieth thereof for every day for which the Bantu employee in respect of whom it is payable, is employed by such employer in that area or in the part of it in question, as the case may be.</block>

<p>Since his amendment is now acceptable to me, the amendment standing in my name in respect of clause (2) (4), falls away. I hope that is clear.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, on Friday, and again this afternoon, we have had what could best be described as a torrent of noisy words and irresponsible arguments from that hon. Deputy Minister. If ever we have seen a shabby example of somebody on that side of the House trying to play politics over something that is of grave importance, to the housewife particularly and also to the farmer, we have seen it this afternoon. I think he should be thoroughly ashamed of himself. It is the sort of performance that we are more used to getting from the hon. the Minister, not from him. Mr. Chairman, I do not know whether that hon. Deputy Minister was trying to baffle us with his verbosity, but he did tell us towards the end of his speech this afternoon that Dr. Verwoerd had indeed given a solemn undertaking that the original Bantu services levy would not be interfered with. He said Dr. Verwoerd gave his word on this, but he then made out a case that it was in the interests of South Africa that Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s word should now be broken. I suggest that the very manner in which this Deputy Minister is setting out to break Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s word shows that he is being more than irresponsible, and I trust he knows what I mean. In passing, he made a few quite remarkable claims. He suggested, for instance, that the Government, the Nationalist Party, is very unhappy about the way in which the United Party is governing Johannesburg &#x2026;</p>

If the hon. member for Randburg had fainted, he would have fallen right at the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s feet. He says that the housewife and the farmer will not pay more in terms of this legislation for the present (&#x201C;vir die huidige&#x201D;).

<p>That could well be so. Incidentally, Sir, I want to make mention of just one thing to the hon. the Deputy Minister, who regarded it as a joke on Friday that my amendment deals with farmers. He wanted to know what my interest was in farming. I want to tell him here and now that I will raise as many agricultural matters as I want to in this House, because agriculture is of vital interest to the townsman, and I am sorry to tell him further in reply to his point, that it is because hon. gentlemen on that side who represent farming areas and who laugh very loudly, as the Minister of Sport did, when we raise agricultural matters never take any interest in agriculture that we on this side all have to do it.</p>

<p>In the whole of this debate the hon. the Deputy Minister particularly has tended to try to draw red herrings over the basic argument, which in fact, I submit, revolves around my amendment, which is to exclude housewives and farmers from the application of this new tax. He has come along with a lot of nonsense; he says he wants differentiation; he does not want discrimination. He did not try to describe what he meant by differentiation or discrimination. As far as I can see, there is no difference in the application of a tax like this. He was again playing with words.</p>

<p>Sir, I am sorry, I do not accept that argument at all. If the hon. the Deputy Minister wants to get up and speak, let him do so. Sir, what he has not done is to explain to us why he is not prepared to accept my amendment. After all, this is purely in terms of an undertaking which that hon. Deputy Minister gave to this Committee last week; he said that he was entitled to alter or to vary or to go back on Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s undertaking, provided there had been consultation; and he came to us with the argument that he had had consultation. But the only consultation that he has had has been with industry, on his own admission; he agrees that he has had no consultation with organized agriculture, and he has had no consultation with housewives. It is all very well, Sir, for the hon. member for Langlaagte to come along and say, as he did in the debate on Friday morning, that mere publication in the <i>Government Gazette</i> was sufficient consultation with organized agriculture. I wonder if that hon. Deputy Minister would care to come with me to the South African Agricultural Union and ask them if that amounts to consultation.</p>

<p>Let me come back to this question of his refusal to exempt housewives and farmers. He tells us that for the present there will be no change in the actual amount of the tax paid; in other words, from his point of view there is no valid reason why the position should be altered in respect of the housewife and the farmer. Sir, I want some of the farmers here to listen carefully to this. At the moment there is no reason in his mind, why this tax should not be applied to housewives and farmers in a way that would make their position more burdensome than it is at present. I would suggest that the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s argument in this respect only reinforces <span class="col_1001-1002" refersTo="page_0518"/>the reason for my amendment. There is no reason, in his mind, why he should want to increase the tax on housewives and farmers. Well, I want to say to him: Why not leave it as it is&#x003F; Let them carry on paying whatever they are paying in terms of the Bantu Services Levy Act. Housewives, as we know, are exempted from the provisions of that Act in any case. Why not leave the position exactly as it is&#x003F;</p>

<p>Sir, there are other points that we feel must be answered. The Deputy Minister says that this is purely an administrative measure. I ask him: &#x201C;administrative&#x201D; to do what&#x003F; What he wants us to do in effect is to give him virtual <i>carte blanche</i> to move up taxes on the employment of Bantu labour up to a maximum of R2,50 at will, just in terms of his decision. In principle, of course, this is absolutely wrong. He has no right to try to by-pass this Parliament when it comes to imposing taxes of this nature.</p>

I am afraid that these hon. members are not even listening to our arguments. That hon. gentleman does not want to be bound to the application of this tax to housewives. I think that is a fair assumption to make. He wants to be able to impose it whenever he wants, whenever he likes. He wants to be able to push it up, perhaps by degrees and perhaps quite severely. But the other thing he does not want to be bound to, is any undertaking as to how it is to be spent. Here again I think we should join issue with him. We know that in terms of this Bill a Bantu Administration Board is able to divert moneys from urban areas where it is raised from employers. We know that in terms of this Bill it is able to donate these moneys to homeland authorities. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#van_der_walt">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. D. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to say a few words about the hon. member for Kensington&#x2019;s discourse on agriculture in the light of this respective Bill. The hon. member tried to sketch here how the farmers would see this Bill. I think it necessary for us just to explain today, in this House, how organized agriculture works in respect of such matters. I do not want to try to make politics out of this matter. Let me assure the hon. member of that. The South African Agricultural Union has its standing committees, and as acts are published, or anything else is published, they are referred for notification to those standing committees which then go into the matter, and if representations must be made, whatever the department to which this must be done, they are made by those committees. To come now and say that the hon. the Deputy Minister held no consultations whatever with organized agriculture, merely shows that the hon. member for Kensington does not know what this means. If organized agriculture had had any problem with regard to the Bill as published on 22nd December, I can assure you, Sir, that organized agriculture would have contacted the Minister. I can assure the hon. member that I know what I am speaking about. We ourselves have served on those committees&#x2014;and we know exactly how things work, not like the hon. member for Kensington who worked on the <i>Sunday Times</i> and does not know how these aspects of organized agriculture work. I want to tell that hon. member today that there are two special committees in organized agriculture that work with Acts of this nature. These are the general council of the South African agricultural Union, and the general council of each provincial agricultural union. Each provincial agricultural union, just like the S.A. Agricultural Union, has its Bantu affairs committees which also deal, <i>inter alia,</i> with matters such as Bantu labour. I can assure the hon. member that as far as the farmers are concerned, the chairman of at least the Transvaal Bantu Affairs Committee, which has most certainly had this Act under review, is not a member of the National Party. I can also assure the hon. member that the chairman of the general council, not only of the Transvaal Agricultural Union, but also of the S.A. Agricultural Union, where this Act will receive specific attention, are not members of the National Party either. If the hon. member for Kensington now simply says that the hon. the Deputy Minister did not hold consultations, I want to tell him that he should preferably have a discussion with the hon. member for Newton Park so that the latter can give him some idea of how organized agriculture works. Then the hon. member would perhaps understand more <span class="col_1003-1004" refersTo="page_0519"/>about it. What it briefly amounts to is that this relevant provision as it stands very definitely came to the attention of organized agriculture. To try to say now that the farmer is specifically mentioned here as an employer, and to ask why the hon. the Deputy Minister does not want to accept the hon. member for Kensington&#x2019;s amendment that they specifically be excluded, is nonsense. Our people in the rural areas, our farmers in these areas, who make use of seasonal labour and recruit Bantu labourers in the homelands, are already paying this money. One is already paying R1 for each Bantu man or woman one recruits in the homelands to do one&#x2019;s harvesting.</p>

<p>I do not want to speak to you now. I am speaking to the hon. member for Kensington. The point I want to bring home to those hon. members is that the farmers are already paying certain fees. They are paying R1 for the recruitment of those Bantu in the Bantu homelands. We are already paying this.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. D. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>Wait a minute, if the hon. member would give me a chance I would continue. Here it is merely being stated that a farmer is also an employer, just like the housewife is. It is registered in the Act that those people are also employers. For the hon. member for Albany&#x2019;s information I say that according to the Afrikaans dictionary, &#x201C;heffing&#x201D; and &#x201C;belasting&#x201D; probably cover more or less the same concept, but the hon. member for Albany and all learned friends sitting there always have to look at the preamble to an Act in order to ascertain what a certain word determines in its context. The Bantu Services Levy Act is in no way repealed by this Bill. In other words, the provisions of that Act continue to function as they do at present. [Interjections.] Of course that is so. If the hon. member would consult the Act he would see that this is so. All that is happening is a consolidation, an administrative arrangement that these three amounts be included.</p>

<p>Hon. members are now trying to make out a case that we are engaged in in direct taxation. Hon. members know very well why they are using this argument. At the same time I want to tell the hon. member for Kensington, the interim shadow Minister of Agriculture &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#van_der_walt">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. D. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; that in this Bill, where we have these matters as set out, we shall also have to think of the fact that in the future employers could be large farming companies, that other aspects of possible importance to us could crop up on the road ahead. It is therefore important for us to know even at this stage what is classified under &#x201C;farming&#x201D;. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District ought to know&#x2014;after all, he made a tremendous fuss last year when the Egg Act came up for discussion.</p>

<p>The hon. member must also note that notwithstanding these dictionary quotations of the hon. member for Albany, there are many Acts and many bodies in our country which are statutory bodies today, functioning by way of levies. We have levies in all spheres. There are, for example, levies on slaughtering facilities in the case of those municipalities that do impose such a levy. Likewise there are also the levies of the Mealie Board, if I may again touch upon the subject of agriculture. Every statutory body has its levies that are imposed with a view to the administration of relevant matters.</p>

<p>Thinking in terms of the Bantu labour that must be made available, hon. members surely know that labour, like any other element, is one of the essentials of the overall development pattern; it is one of the elements on which the development pattern rests. There is surely nothing strange in the method the hon. the Minister is applying here in handling that administration just like the administration of any other matters where a statutory board functions by way of a levy. After all, we have that system by which levies are imposed, so that certain administrative functions can take place. There is surely no new principle contained in this entire matter. The hon. gentlemen have never in those cases said that it was taxation.</p>

<p>Let me delve further into this argument that it is a tax. If hon. gentlemen then say that these levies we are now requesting are a tax, the hon. member for Jeppes <span class="col_1005-1006" refersTo="page_0520"/>must tell us what that money is that the Johannesburg Municipality takes from the White taxpayer.

It is not at issue this afternoon whether they are members of the Nationalist Party or not; what is at issue is whether they have seen the Bill and whether they have indicated their approval of its provisions.

I am sure that not 50 per cent of the fanners know the implications of this Bill as far as they themselves are concerned. It is no good the hon. the Deputy Minister saying that they have always paid this tax; the only tax they have paid up to now is 20 cents Registration Fee per month. What is the hon. the Deputy Minister doing in this clause&#x003F; He is taking three taxes. Firstly there is the 25 cent initial registration fee which has to be paid to the labour bureau when you take a Bantu into your employ. Then there is a fee of 20 cents which is paid by certain people in certain areas and is also regarded as a labour bureau registration fee. In addition to that, another tax of 20 cents per week, as is being paid at the moment, is paid by certain employers. The Minister now wants to combine the three taxes into one. He wants to make everybody pay all three taxes and not just the one they have been paying before.</p>

However, that is not what is written in this clause. What is written in this clause is that those people who have paid only 20 cents per month can now be charged a maximum of R2,50. I accept that it is not going to be R2,50 immediately, but the Minister is creating an additional levy on those people. All the farmers have paid up to now is 20 cents per month.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in my belief, if the hon. the Deputy Minister had been franker with us from the start, this debate would have been much shorter. But I believe all the cards have not been put on the table. We had to drag them out one by one on to the table. I find this very unsatisfactory. The true position here is that this was presented as a consolidation measure of three imposts. I am not going to go into them, save to say that it is commonly agreed that the services levy, as the hon. the Deputy Minister said in his last speech, is now being closed. But the fact is that an equivalent amount is being retained and people will be taxed by an equivalent amount. This, therefore, represents a new amount of tax which the Government is taking from the people for the more general services. That was never made absolutely plain at the start. As I understood it now, the hon. the Deputy Minister concedes that he is virtually going back on Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s undertaking, which was that once the services had been provided, there would be no need to enlarge them; (a lot of the demand for services was of a temporary nature), and that this levy would be taken off. It has now been dragged out that the actual sum of the tax is being retained and perpetuated.</p>

<p>The other smokescreen that the hon. the Deputy Minister and the hon. member for Langlaagte had been throwing up around this matter is of another kind. They made an attack on the city council of Johannesburg, and other what they call United Party councils, for spending a total amount of R6 million on amenities for the Bantu. They attempted to make political capital out of this and criticized these municipalities. They are now being completely won The Government is turning a complete somersault. The Government, having condemned these United Party city councils for providing these better amenities, now comes to this House to get a larger amount of tax from employers in order to supply the very amenities for which they previously criticized the United Party municipalities for providing. In other words, Mr. Chairman, they have completely gone back on their hard, rigorous supplying of amenities. They are now being completely won over to the United Party attitude that fair amenities should be supplied for these people. [Interjections.] This is what has happened. We welcome it again&#x2014;that the Government has been brought round to see the sense of keeping all the citizens of your towns in a contented state. Where before we had it from hon. members opposite that the Johannesburg Municipality and these other municipalities were providing too many amenities, this measure and the speeches made on it are a clear concession by the Government that Johannesburg and the other United Party municipalities had been 100 per cent right, and in future the Government now want to <span class="col_1009-1010" refersTo="page_0522"/>take sufficient money from employers in order to be able to provide just those very amenities which are at present being provided from the Bantu Revenue Account of the municipalities mentioned.</p>

<p>If that hon. member, who has just sat down, expects me to show humility to the United Party on an issue such as this, I am afraid he will have to wait for a very long time. The hon. member, who is one of the leading speakers for the Opposition, has just advanced the argument that, had we put our cards on the table, this debate would have been shorter and so on and so forth. Then he made the point&#x2014;an astounding point to my way of thinking&#x2014;that it was never made clear to them that the Services levy account would come to an end once these fees were consolidated into one fee. Now, at the end of a long debate on this clause, the ignorance displayed by that hon. member, almost a front-bench member of the United Party, baffles me completely.</p>

<p>The hon. member said that it was not made clear from the start that the Levy account would come to an end, as I stated, when I replied earlier on. I say that the ignorance of the hon. member is absolutely astounding.

<p>See how this hon. member is trying to save his friend! I want to read to hon. members on that side and specifically for the attention of the hon. member for Pinelands, clause 5 of this Bill. The hon. member for Transkei, who is laughing, knows very well what a <i>faux pas</i> the hon. leading member for the Opposition has just made. Clause 5 of the Bill, which is so clear that a child I could understand it, states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1011-1012" refersTo="page_0523"/>If a contribution is in terms of this Act payable in respect of a Bantu employee &#x2026;, the employer of such Bantu employee &#x2026; shall, notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, be exempt from any liability for the payment, &#x2026; in the case of the employer, in respect of such Bantu employee, of (a) any contribution, in terms of section 3 of the Bantu Services Levy Act, 1952 (Act. No. 64 of 1952), to the Bantu services levy fund &#x2026;</block>

<p>*Surely it is crystal clear that it is written black on white in clause 5 of this Bill that the moment an employer pays such a consolidated fee, his payment in respect of the services levy account is terminated immediately. There were therefore no cards to put on the table in this respect. It is written in the Bill, but only the hon. member did not know it because apparently he has not read the Bill at all. Let me tell hon. members opposite again, because apparently they do not know it yet&#x2014;except the hon. member for Transkei, who has studied the Bill&#x2014;that the moment the single consolidated fee which will be published by the Minister by way of a <i>Government Gazette</i> notice, is paid, the services levy fee falls away.</p>

<p>The hon. member must therefore not come with the argument that we did not put our cards on the table, because we, from the beginning, did not only put our cards on the table, but we put it in the Bill.</p>

<p>We conducted a long debate especially on clause 2 which is actually the crucial clause of this Bill. I think it is necessary for us to understand each other very well in connection with this crucial clause, and that we know where we are going. I just want to say a few words in connection with clause 2. I hope it will now be the end of the discussion on this clause, but if hon. members opposite want to continue discussing it, they are welcome. Three single fees that are payable at the moment are now being consolidated into one amount. In this Bill a maximum amount is mentioned and for this there are good reasons. For the present, however, it is not envisaged that any employer will need to pay that large amount. The Department will do everything in its power to see to it that employers will as far as possible not pay more than they have to pay at present by way of the three singly amounts. It is even possible that in some cases they may pay less. By doing so my department is maintaining its fine tradition, that is, not to come to this House every day to debate amounts in connection with Bantu fees. This debate once again underlined that we are justified in not doing so. It is in, the interests of the country not to do so. In 1923 their predecessors also determined an amount which was good enough for longer than I have lived. Today we are trying to do the same, and no employer, that is, farmer, industrialist or housewife, need in the least be afraid of, or run away from, this Bill. We will look after their interests. The maximum amount determined in this Bill is a ceiling amount which will be good for many years. It is for that very reason that we will see to it that employers will not pay the maximum amount, but that they will pay the absolute minimum in terms of the needs which may exist in a given area. We will do everything in our power to see that this measure is implemented in this way, and that as a result of this measure inflation will not be stimulated at all.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, before replying to the hon. the Deputy Minister in regard to certain points he has just made&#x2014;and I hope the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration will listen&#x2014;I would like to refer to his statement that he did not want to thank the United Party and that it would be a long time before he did so. I think I should set him an example. I want to thank the hon. the Deputy Minister for accepting my amendment. He has started on the right road and he has seen a bit of light. I want to suggest to him that he should go a bit further, so that we can thank him again. That will be a record. If we can thank him twice on one clause he will have set an all-time record. I suggest that he follows the good example he has set with the amendment that he has already accepted, and accepts the other amendments as well. The hon. the Deputy Minister said that his only reason for not accepting our amendment in regard to farmers and housewives, or the one particularly in regard to domestic servants was that he did not want to discriminate <span class="col_1013-1014" refersTo="page_0524"/>and that he could not discriminate in this Bill.</p>

In other words, in one sentence he says &#x201C;I am not going to discriminate, they must all be the same&#x201D; and in the very next sentence he says &#x201C;But I am going to discriminate against the other employers in favour of the housewife.&#x201D;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>All we are asking him to do now is to differentiate by putting one ceiling on general employers and another ceiling on domestic servant employers. It is then a differentiation and not a discrimination. He has one ceiling for general employers. He wants R2,50. We want R1. Now we ask him then not to discriminate, but to differentiate. I do not know what the difference is&#x2014;I am sure that a dictionary might find a difference&#x2014; but let us accept the word &#x201C;differentiation&#x201D;. All we ask is that he should differentiate so that, for a domestic servant, a registration fee of 25 cents and a monthly fee of 20 cents will be pegged. He has already said that was what he was going to do. Therefore he is prepared to accept the principle. Why then will he not accept the amendment&#x003F; We cannot legislate on promises, hopes and expectations. We legislate by drawing up a Bill which becomes an Act; that is then what must happen. The hon. the Deputy Minister has accepted this principle. He has accepted the figures. He has accepted everything we have said. He has said he agrees with me 100 per cent. All we ask is that he now puts it into the Bill, so that he or his successor is bound.</p>

<p>This leads me to the point, the crux of the issue on which the hon. the Deputy Minister hangs his whole case against our amendments. He says he does not want to have to come to Parliament when he needs to change the levy. But this is a completely alien concept. Does he suggest then that the Minister of Finance should pass a law providing that he can tax South Africa as he likes so that he does not need to come back to Parliament&#x003F; Must he be given the power to introduce a budget, provided it does not exceed, say, R5 000 million, so that he does not have to come to Parliament every year with a budget&#x003F; That is the principle the hon. the Deputy Minister wants to introduce, a principle of a ceiling which leaves him free below that ceiling to do what he likes. In practice he will be completely free to do it. What chance do we have then to argue the matter&#x003F; In practice there is no chance of arguing it, although in theory he is accountable. In theory these changes will be gazetted. In theory we will be able to raise these matters in the House. The hon. the Deputy Minister knows perfectly well that once this measure is through, his discretion becomes absolute. We are simply saying: &#x201C;Let us put this ceiling at what is needed, not in the far distant future, not N.B. (&#x2018;na Brakpan&#x2019;), but at what is needed now, and peg it there.&#x201D; If the hon. the Deputy Minister wants to come back and ask for more, he can come and tell us why more is necessary. He can then put his case and Parliament, being reasonable, will give him an extra amount. He has given us an assurance now in regard to domestic servants, but what I want to ask him pertinently is whether that assurance applies to farmers as well&#x003F; He is opposed to our amendment which says &#x201C;no tax, no levy on domestic servants or farmers&#x201D;. I hope the farming representatives in this House will listen. I am asking whether he will give an assurance to the farming community that no farmer will be asked to pay more than he is paying now, in the same way as he has given an assurance regarding the domestic servants. If so, I can see no reason why he should not accept our amendments, one pegging the amount in respect of domestic servants and <span class="col_1015-1016" refersTo="page_0525"/>the other excluding the farmer. Sir, we are not impressed by all these words that we have heard from the hon. member for Langlaagte or by the mock anger of the hon. the Deputy Minister himself.</p>

<p>*This pontifical attitude of theirs&#x2014;&#x201C;Trust me; the people trust me; the housewife should trust me&#x201D;&#x2014;is of no avail whatsoever. We have here in front of us a Bill consisting of specific clauses, and here we are being asked to make it possible to impose a tax, one which is subject to a maximum, but one which the Minister may apply at his discretion below that ceiling.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Sir, I do not want to drag out this debate, but I want to say that this is not playing politics. This is a simple, direct issue. We have responsibility. The Government says: &#x201C;This is what we want.&#x201D; We on this side want to write that into the law. Hon. members on that side are not prepared to back us. They are not interested in the welfare of ordinary people. They are becoming rubber-stamps for the Executive, and the Executive says: &#x201C;Give me this power; I will use it as I like and people must simply trust me.&#x201D; We are not rubber-stamps for that Cabinet, for that Minister, or for any Executive. We are Members of Parliament and we deal with a measure as it is worded. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I really rise in defence of the hon. member for Pinelands, who has had three turns and cannot defend himself. The hon. the Deputy Minister was most unfair, and I think he made a deliberate attack on the hon. member for Pinelands when he said that it was clear that the hon. member had not read the Bill because he had said that the levy was in fact being retained, whereas in fact the Bill makes provision for the levy to fall away once this new tax is imposed. The hon. member for Pinelands said that Dr. Verwoerd had made the promise that this levy would be abolished when it was no longer required, and he said that the Deputy Minister was maintaining this levy in a disguised form. That is what he said, and that is in fact what the hon. the Deputy Minister is doing; he cannot deny it. That levy is going to remain. It is not going to be called a &#x201C;levy&#x201D; any more, but the levy is going to remain, and the Deputy Minister cannot deny it. It is going to remain in another guise, and I think it is most unfair on the part of the hon. the Deputy Minister to try to score a small point at the expense of the hon. member for Pinelands.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, I want to refer to his attitude to the question of charwomen which was raised by the hon. member for Green Point. The hon. the Deputy Minister suggested that housewives could form clubs and that the levy would then be paid only once for a charwoman. But, Sir, how can the housewives know who is paying the levy for the charwoman&#x003F; The charwoman works for several housewives and she has to be registered. A notice sent out by the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s department says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No Bantu female who has permission to be in a prescribed area shall work in such area without registration.</block>

<p>She has to be registered therefore&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Employment on three or more days per week is deemed to be full-time service and normal registration must be effected.</block>

<p>If, therefore, a char works for two hours on three days for one person, she has to be registered because she is working for three days. Supposing she works for three different women for two hours a day for three days in the week and she then does <span class="col_1017-1018" refersTo="page_0526"/>that for the next three days for three other women, it means that each of those six women would have to pay this levy.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. the Deputy Minister did not reply to that point; he misunderstood or tried to confuse the whole position. I ask him to tell us how housewives are going to know which one has to pay for the charwoman. He has not answered that question. I would like to remind the hon. the Deputy Minister, who has attacked the United Party, that it is because of the criticism that we have raised in this debate and in the Second Reading debate that this Bill has become more acceptable. The hon. the Deputy Minister himself has accepted certain suggestions. True, he gave credit to the Chamber of Industries for two of the amendments, but it is because of our attitude to this Bill that the Deputy Minister has altered the provision with regard to the number of days of employment in respect of which the levy must, be paid. He has also altered the provision with regard to the R2,50 and the way in which it is going to be applied, and I submit that it is because of our attitude on his side of the House that he has now given the housewives and the farmers this assurance. But I want to associate myself with the hon. member for Durban Point and ask him how he can say to us that it is immoral for him to discriminate in legislation and for that reason he cannot discriminate in favour of the housewives by legislation.</p>

<p>Sir, if it is immoral to do it by legislation, then it is just as immoral to do it by way of a promise, and our objection is that although it may be the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s intention to carry out that promise with regard to the housewives and the farmers, we do not know what his successor is going to do, or who his successor might be. I ask the hon. the Deputy Minister in fairness now to accept my explanation with regard to the speech made by the hon. member for Pinelands, and I ask him also to reply to the hon. member for Green Point.</p>

<p>As regards the hon. member for Pinelands, I am quite prepared to accept the position as it has just been stated by the hon. member for Transkei, although I still think that the hon. member did make the mistake which I pointed out here. That is how I understood him, and at a later stage I shall have another look at his Hansard.</p>

<p>As regards the hon. member for Green Point, the position is as I have explained it to the hon. member. If a Bantu woman &#x2014;a so-called charwoman or casual labourer as defined in the Act, is registered in terms of section 22 of the Labour Regulations, the position is that her employer need not pay one cent. I want to put this very clearly here. If she is registered as a casual labourer, in other words as a charwoman, in terms of section 22 of the Labour Regulations, her employer or employers do not pay one cent, but the charwoman, as the position is at present, pays 20 cents.</p>

<p>Now the hon. member for Green Point agrees one hundred per cent. But the other position to which I referred some minutes ago, applies as well, i.e. that if such a charwoman wants to go and work for five or eight different persons she may be registered in their names; in that case she is not registered in terms of section 22; in that case she is registered in the names of those five or eight White women for whom she works. I just want to point out, in order to remove any misunderstanding, that this sort of situation is regulated by means of regulation. These regulations differ from area to area. I have been told that it is not the practice here in the Cape Peninsula for five or eight women to club together and for only one of them to pay, as it is not possible for them to do so. I have been told, however, that the position in the Pretoria-Johannesburg area is such that the regulations do make it possible for five or eight White women to club together. It is not expected of each of those five or eight women to pay in respect of their Bantu employee; only one need pay. This is my answer, and now the hon. member may put his question.</p>

If that is so, then I take it each of the five employers will have to register as an employer of a full-time employee.

<p>Clause, as amended, accordingly agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 3:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>This clause lays down to whom the contributions shall be paid. One of the objections this side of the House has had all along to many of the charges levied by this Government and particularly those which are levied on employers in respect of Bantu employees, has been that the funds which are collected as a result of these levies, are not utilized solely for the benefit of the Bantu in the areas where they are collected. We find that there are going to be three different authorities which will collect the funds or the contributions which we have just voted in terms of clause 2. The first of these is a Bantu Affairs Administration Board. In terms of the Bantu Administration Act which was passed last year, this board will administer the funds it collects, including the funds which it is going to collect in terms of this Bill when it becomes an Act. This board has the power in terms of section 13 (7) of that Act, to channel a portion of these funds to the homelands. Is that not correct&#x003F; The hon. the Deputy Minister looks awfully surprised. In terms <span class="col_1025-1026" refersTo="page_0530"/>of the Act, the Bantu Affairs Administration Board may channel to the homelands certain funds approved by the hon. the Minister. I wonder if the hon. the Deputy Minister will give us an assurance that that amount of money, which is collected in lieu of the Bantu services levy, which is now going to be done away with, will be retained for use in the urban areas, i.e. in those areas where it is collected&#x003F;</p>

<p>The second body which will collect these contributions is the urban local authority which must, of course, place these to the credit of the Bantu Revenue Account and, specifically, to the special fund in that account, namely the Bantu Services Levy Fund. I know that I will not be allowed to deal with other subsequent clauses which we will discuss later in this Committee stage, but those funds, if other provisions made in this Bill are approved, may also be taken away and used in the homelands for purposes other than those for which that fund was specifically designed in 1952 when it was passed in this House.</p>

<p>The third body is the Bantu Affairs Commissioner. The farmers who are now going to be taxed probably more than they have been taxed in the past, will have to pay their contributions to the Bantu Affairs Commissioner in whose area of jurisdiction such Bantu employees are employed. What is going to happen to that money&#x003F; That money is going into a special fund which is going to be created and over which the Secretary of Bantu Administration and the Minister will have sole control. Once again we are establishing a new fund. Before the hon. the Deputy Minister tells me like he did tell the hon. member for Pinelands that I did not read the Bill, I want to tell him that I have read clause 4 and particularly subsection (3) which deals with this fund. It reads as follows: &#x201C;Contributions received by a Bantu Affairs Commissioner shall be transferred to the Secretary and may be utilized by the Secretary for any service, expenditure or grant in respect of which the Minister certifies in writing that it is in the interests of Bantu&#x201D;. As I said during the Second Reading, this money can be taken to buy a Jumbo Jet if the hon. the Minister thinks that it is in the interests of Bantu. Would it, however, truly be in the interests of Bantu&#x003F; What we want from the hon. the Deputy Minister is an undertaking that the money which is going to be paid into this Fund and which forms part of this contribution as he now calls it, and which is to replace the Bantu Services Levy Fund, will be retained for the purposes for which the fund was created.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I first want to deal with the third possibility mentioned by the hon. member, namely contributions received by a Bantu Affairs Commissioner. As soon as a Bantu Administration Board has been established, the possibility of contributions being received by a Bantu Affairs Commissioner disappears. Thus this third possibility is only a temporary measure. As long as contributions are paid to the Bantu Affairs Commissioner and are then paid over to the Secretary to the Department of Bantu Administration and Development, the position will be that the Secretary to the Department of Bantu Administration and Development will utilize that money in the interests of the Administration in the area of the Bantu Affairs Commissioner. That is the first point. Secondly, section 13 (7) of the Bantu Affairs Administration Act, 1971, provides very explicitly that the funds in the Bantu Levy Fund may be utilized in terms of the provisions of the Act concerned, i.e. in terms of the provisions of the Bantu Services Levy Act, 1952. Is that clear&#x003F; I gave this assurance last year and can give it again today. In fact, I did so in my Second Reading speech.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I want to say a few words in regard to the money which is paid over to the Bantu Administration Board. The position in respect of this is very clear. In the first place, the administration funds will be utilized by the Bantu Administration Boards in the interests of the Bantu and Bantu Administration needs in those Bantu administration areas where the money is raised. This is the purpose for which these administration fees are being levied. This money provides for the needs of a specific administration area.</p>

<p>Lastly, if there are surpluses, i.e. when the needs of the local administration area have been provided for&#x2014;this is a point we shall debate again when the hon. member for Jeppes moves his amendment on clause 9&#x2014;these funds may be utilized as determined by the Minister in consultation with the interested parties. In other words, a position which has existed for 12 or 18 months or longer already, is merely being legalized now. Many local authorities ask of their own accord that those surplus funds should be utilized in the interests of <span class="col_1027-1028" refersTo="page_0531"/>Bantu working in their areas and whose families are settled in the homelands. This, then, will be the position, and I hope the hon. member is satisfied with my explanation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the way in which the hon. the Deputy Minister has replied to my queries. There are two points that arise. He says that the provision in paragraph (c), namely that the Bantu Affairs Commissioner will collect the money and pay it into a revenue fund, is merely temporary until such time as the Bantu Administration Board is established. That is fine and I accept it, but the hon. the Deputy Minister implied that it is going to apply to the whole country. Is that correct&#x003F; Is it his intention to establish Bantu Administration Boards which will cover every magisterial district in the country and every Bantu Affairs Commissioner&#x2019;s district&#x003F; I did not understand that it was the intention at the time when we discussed this Bill.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Is it the intention of the Government to establish Bantu Administration Boards which will cover the whole of the country, namely all the districts which are controlled at the moment by Bantu Affairs Commissioners or by magistrates&#x003F; The hon. the Deputy Minister is nodding his head. I do not know if he means &#x201C;yes, it is&#x201D; or &#x201C;yes, I understand the question&#x201D;. Perhaps he will tell us; because this was not the impression which was given at the time when we debated this other Bill last year.</p>

<p>Now I want to deal with the second question that arises from his speech. I must say I was very glad to get this assurance from the hon. the Deputy Minister. I did not think we were going to get it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am not running away; you have not listened. Let us have it very clear. With regard to the Bantu Services Levy Fund by the Bantu Services Levy Act of 1952, the surpluses in that fund will be utilized in terms of the relevant Act of 1952. It has appeared in Hansard ever so often. I stated it last year during that particular debate. Now that hon. member is putting words into my mouth which I am not willing to accept at all, very important words which I have never said. We are dealing here with a completely different set-up now, namely three different levies, the labour bureau fee, the registration fee and the Bantu services levy, which are now going to be combined into one. I have said that the utilization of those moneys will, in the first place, be in the interests of Bantu affairs in the administrative area of the relevant Administration Board. Is that clear&#x003F; If there are surpluses from these different fees, which are now being combined into one, then Clause 9 is very clear on that aspect: those surpluses can then be used anywhere for any purpose with the approval of the Minister, in collaboration with the specific administration board or the specific local council, as the case may be. Is that clear to hon. members&#x003F; Sir, there must be no misunderstanding on this very important issue, and if that hon. member <span class="col_1029-1030" refersTo="page_0532"/>does not understand the position now that I have explained it once again, then he must please get up so that any misunderstanding can be cleared up here and now.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The position there is that we have a committee under the chairmanship of the hon. member for Langlaagte, which is going through the country at the moment and trying, in co-operation with all the relevant representative bodies in the given areas, to establish administrative boards. How many administrative boards there are going to be, will depend on the reaction that this committee gets in the various centres. That is the attitude that we adopted during the debates here last year and that is still my attitude today. It is not possible to say at this stage whether you are going to have administrative areas and administrative boards covering the entire South Africa. It will depend on the co-operation of the different local authorities in the country whether that will be the position or not. I cannot therefore give any assurance on the question as to whether the entire South Africa will be covered by such administrative areas and administrative boards. I do not know at this stage what part of South Africa will be covered. All I can say is that the Van Vuuren Committee has been on this job for quite a while and that they have had nothing but wholehearted support and excellent co-operation in all parts of the country that they have visited hitherto, and we hope that that will be the position right to the very end.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I am glad that we are getting clarity on this matter, but at the same time I do believe that something is being hidden here. Let us just deal first with the question of Bantu boards, which is the one of lesser importance. It would appear that what could happen is that a fund, to be administered by the Secretary for Bantu Administration, could be built up out of the fees, not exceeding R2,50, to be paid by the farmers for their farm employees.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>I have already said in the Second Reading debate that it will be a small amount.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, this is what can happen; as Clause 2, which has been accepted, reads now, it is a possibility that a fund can come into being, a fund to be adminiistered by the Secretary for Bantu Administration, into which the farmers will pay for their farm labour a fee which may rise to R2,50 per employee. That is the position; I have stated it quite correctly.</p>

<p>Now let us come back to the question of the Bantu Administration Boards. I must concede that subsection 7 of Clause 13 clearly provides that the money which is contributed to the Bantu Services Levy Fund, which is going to be administered by the Bantu Administration Boards, must be administered in terms of the Bantu Services Levy Act as long as it is a Bantu services levy, but we are now being asked to pass a Bill in terms of which the Deputy Minister will now substitute for that levy another levy, another tax, and he is not going to use it for those purposes, in spite of the statement which he made in this House last year when we raised this very question here on 10th March, 1971. Let me quote the words of the hon. the Deputy Minister (Hansard, Column 2425)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The position in respect of Bantu services levy funds remains absolutely unchanged as far as this Bill is concerned. For this reason I have placed an amendment on the Order Paper for tomorrow in order that it may be clear that this matter will be dealt with in terms of Clause 11 (1) (e) in which the Acts are tabulated. That means that in respect of the Bantu services levy fund, action in terms of this Bill will be taken in accordance with the provisions of the Bantu Services Levy Act; in other words, the <i>status quo</i> in respect of the utilization of the levy funds in being left absolutely unchanged by this Bill.</block>

I am not only giving the assurance, but I have also laid down in this amendment that this should only happen in terms of the Bantu Services Levy Act. I really hope that no further discussion takes place.</block>

<p>Now, what did he lay down&#x003F; That the funds which were collected in terms of the Bantu Services Levy Act shall be used for those purposes which are laid down in that Act. Now in terms of this Bill he is subverting that Act because he is substituting another tax for it, but he is not going to use the money which he collects from that tax for the purposes of that Act. That is what he is doing, and this is the whole point of what I have been saying, that he is subverting the intention of that Act, and all his assurances of last year are worth nothing. All the assurances that he gave, that the money which would be collected from the employers in respect of Bantu services would be used for the purposes of that Act, now mean nothing whatsoever.</p>

<p>In my opinion the hon. member is now really being a little obstreperous. Firstly I just want to reply to the question of the fees that have to be paid over to the Bantu Affairs Commissioner in the rural areas, and in respect of which this Bill provides that this should be transferred to the Secretary for Bantu Administration and Development. If he looks at my Second Reading speech he will see that I stated there that it is a small amount involved and that this is a temporary set-up. Why does the hon. member now want to wrench the whole matter out of context by implying that what is happening here is now something of tremendous consequence&#x003F;</p>

<p>This is an extremely trifling matter. If in the rural areas, where this Bantu Affairs Commissioner is involved, there were a way of not having to pay this to him, so that it will then not be paid to the Secretary for Bantu Administration and Development, we would have liked to adopt it. But since there is no way, until such time as there is an administration board, and because this does not fall under the local authority, we do not have a choice. And now I say again that it is an extremely trifling matter and the hon. member&#x2019;s interpretation is an altogether wrong one.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it is altogether wrong, because I have said so many times in the House this afternoon, and also last week, that <i>bona fide</i> farmers will not be expected to pay this levy, let alone R2,50, at least for the present. [Interjection.] Therefore, on that point the hon. member is altogether wrong, as is his interpretation, and I hope he now understands this.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member comes along with a second point. He refers to an amendment passed in this House last year about the Bantu services levy, when the hon. member also had doubts about how that Bantu services levy would be used and spent by these administration boards. An amendment was then passed that is embodied in that clause 13 (7), i.e. that the Bantu services levies as well as any surpluses in the fund will be applied in terms of the Bantu Services Levy Act of 1952. This afternoon I gave the hon. member for Jeppes a detailed reply about that. To put it briefly, that Act provides that it will only be employed for basic services. It is a whole complicated set-up because there are places such as Pretoria, for example, where service levies are utilized in the Bantu homeland, and those hon. members are always afraid that we shall use levies in the Bantu homelands, and they are always objecting to this. One has the same position in Durban and East London, where service levies are used in the homeland because basic services are involved, because it is in the interests of the employers&#x2019; employees in that specific area and because in those three areas the Bantu employees of those employers live in the Bantu homeland. Does the hon. member <span class="col_1033-1034" refersTo="page_0534"/>understand it now&#x003F; That is, therefore, the position, and in section 13 (7) it was provided last year that those levies would be used without change in terms of the Bantu Services Levy Act, 1952. We now have this Bill combining these three fees, one of which is the service levy, and in clause 5 the Bill expressly provides that when this new fee is introduced the 1952 Act&#x2019;s service levy lapses. Then those fees are to be used as this Bill provides. Where a complete change comes in, I do not know, and as far as I am concerned the hon. member is also completely wrong on that point, because he wants to sow a lot of doubt about this matter, and that is absolutely unnecessary. Indeed, I have said that this new fee also includes the service levy. The levy will cease to exist the moment this new fee is introduced by way of regulation and notice in the <i>Gazette,</i> and then the position will be such that the funds from the new fee will, in the first place, be applied for Bantu administration in the Bantu administration area, and if there is no Bantu administration board yet, then in the area of the local authority, but in the interests of Bantu administration in that area, according to the area&#x2019;s needs. What could be clearer than that&#x003F;</p>

<p>Why is the hon. member then so full of dark motives, charging me with things which I regard as absolutely unnecessary and incorrect&#x003F; Let us once and for all get it clear that there are two aspects here: The fees necessary for this are needed, in the first place, for Bantu administration in those areas; in other words, in White areas, and in the second place we say that if there are surpluses the Minister should have the power to use these as he thinks fit, but in co-operation with the authority involved, whether a local authority or an administration board. That is the position that has obtained for two years and it is not necessary to hunt for any dark motives there. I honestly take it slightly amiss the hon. member sees such dark motives at work in this matter. Surely it cannot be clearer than this.</p>

<p>In lines 29 and 30, to omit &#x201C;other urban local authority has in the opinion of the Minister rendered any services in respect of Bantu&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;services in respect of Bantu employed in its area have in the opinion of the Minister been rendered by any other urban local authority&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I just want to say that the reason why I proposed this amendment is that the representatives of bodies of employers asked me, after we had made that addition by way of clause 4 (2), to insert this amendment. This was quite acceptable to us, and I therefore move the relevant amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause provides that where this tax is levied, the contributions in terms of the services levy and the others fall away. In terms of the existing law provision is made for those employers who house their own Bantu employees to be exempted from paying the services levy tax. I think that is the position, but the hon. the Deputy Minister can correct me if I am wrong. I should like to know from him whether he will still give those employers who fall in that category protection, probably under clause 2, where provision is made for exemptions. He did refer to the Minister of Transport, but I should like to know whether he will give that assurance to all other employers who are receiving that concession now, that they will be treated in the same way when the tax is applied.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, generally speaking the position is as the hon. member for Transkei has just put it. Generally speaking those employers who house their employees will be exempted. However, I do not want to give quite such a <i>carte blanche</i> assurance on this, because it is possible that in time in a given area there may be such other administrative needs that a small contribution from even those employers will be expected. Generally speaking the position is that they will be exempted, but I do not want to give a <i>carte blanche</i> assurance because it has happened <span class="col_1035-1036" refersTo="page_0535"/>in the past, in cases where such an assurance was given, that after a lapse of ten years a man was held to an assurance he had given. I can say, however, that generally speaking there will be this exemption where they house their own employees. I hope this will satisfy the hon. member.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I can quite understand that the hon. the Minister does not want to give a blanket assurance now. I would like to ask him, however, to give this House another assurance. He must give us the assurance that private employers will be treated in the same way as the Government. For example, if he gives the hon. the Minister of Transport the exemption, he must give us the assurance that he will give the same exemption to private employers. In other words, I would like an assurance that the private employers will not be at a disadvantage with the Government.</p>

<p>The only reason why I did not want to give the blanket assurance was that there could be other aspects which could have an effect on this, aspects such as services which do not have anything to do with housing itself. That is why I do not want to give that assurance and I think it would be wrong to give such an assurance despite the fact that the position will be generally speaking that they will be exempted, as I have airead said. With regard to the other question of the hon. member, namely, that I must give the assurance that all employers would be treated in the same way as the Railways, for example, I would say that it would be the case generally speaking.</p>

There are so many different categories of employers and so many different possibilities which have to be taken into account that I just cannot give that assurance. On the other hand, generally speaking, I can give the hon. member the assurance that the employers will be dealt with in the same way, as far as it is humanly possible, as the Rallways.</p>

<p>Clause put and agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 9:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendment standing in my name, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit paragraph (b).</block>

<p>With the deletion of those words section 19 (2) (c) of the Urban Areas Act would read:</p>

<block name="quote">Any service, expenditure or grant which may be certified in writing by the Minister to be for the benefit or the welfare of the Bantu residents within the area of the urban local authority.</block>

<p>With regard to the Native services levy, I would like to point out, and the hon. Minister can correct me if I am wrong, that a special committee existed for the allocation of the funds and the approval of the projects. It was a committee consisting of employers, the hon. Minister&#x2019;s department and the municipalities. In view of the fact that the tax is being imposed on the employer we believe he should at least have some say with regard to the expenditure of these funds. That is why we have been busy pressing the hon. Deputy Minister all day to give us some indication of the manner in which the money will be used. We are doing that because one must not ignore seme of the remarks the hon. the Minister has made in his Second Reading speech. He did try to give an aura of benevolence to the whole project and we were very pleased to hear that, namely because of the many facilities that exist. I would also like to point out to the hon. the Deputy Minister that at the moment most municipalities do provide a considerable number of the amenities that he deals with. This money comes out of the Bantu Revenue Fund and there are very few municipalities, as he says, who are in the red&#x2014;and that has only been of recent days&#x2014;continuing to maintain some of those amenities which have been commenced. Now, with the funds that will be available and at the disposal of the Bantu Revenue Fund, it obviously would be of great interest to those who are the contributors to the fund, <span class="col_1037-1038" refersTo="page_0536"/>the people on whom the entire burden falls to have some say in the matter. The hon. Minister knows the history of the Bantu Services Levy Fund and he knows that the employers were particularly concerned that the finance was expended in the urban areas where their labour came from and where the labour had to have the necessary amenities to make it reasonably stable.</p>

<p>In terms of the Bill the Minister has the power to be able to call upon a municipality to provide money from that fund to pay for the services which another municipality, another urban area, may render by virtue of the fact that an employee may work in one urban area and live or reside or receive certain services in another urban area. One can understand the reasonableness of that request. However, this blanket authority, where money can be spent on certification in writing by the Minister that it is in the interests of Bantu, irrespective of whether or not it relates to the area of an urban Bantu local authority, could envisage, as he says, donations to the homelands or other areas further afield. In giving those donations it would mean that any rights which the employer had of playing some part in directing the purpose and destiny of that money, are completely taken away. I am sure that although he has maintained that he is seeking to maintain happy relations between employers and his Department, the employers will be most unhappy if large sums of money are, as he says, &#x201C;donated&#x201D;, because it will then be in the power of a board of which none of us know the colour at the moment. None of us know what the politics of such a board will be. It may well be politically orientated by virtue of the combination of authorities from which it will draw its representation. The employer will be entirely baulked of the inherent right which he should have, because he represents a specific section of the community who is called upon to pay for the amenities of the employee whom he takes into employment.</p>

<p>This could quite naturally and quite logically lead to calling upon the employer to provide all the facilities if he wants labour. That would be a very severe imposition on the employer. The hon. the Deputy Minister is prepared to go to some lengths in regard to the principle of restriction. We want to limit him even further, but we go along with the principle of the restriction, namely, not to increase the burden of the employer. To complete the picture, the employer should continue to play the same part as he has hitherto, because the principle was that as he provided the funds, he should have the right to express his approval or otherwise of the destiny of the funds. This clause is far too wide; I do not think it is fair of the hon. the Deputy Minister to call for it, because it puts virtually all the discretion in the hands of a board and himself. We do not know how the funds will be moved.</p>

<p>This is one of the main objections; this is why one of the persistent thoughts that has been prevalent throughout the whole discussion has been in connection with the detailed purpose for which the money will be used by the Minister. There is no question that this money will far exceed administrative requirements. I foretell that, and the Minister knows it. I do not think there can be the slightest doubt about that fact. It will far exceed it; there will be quite large surpluses. While surpluses should be used for the benefit of the people for whom the money is provided, those who pay should also know for what purpose it will be used. If it came from the entire community, if it came from the Consolidated Revenue Account of the country, then obviously it would be in the hands of the Minister. He holds that position and it is difficult to interfere with what the Minister is doing except to express one&#x2019;s disapproval in Parliament. However, here it is not a case of money coming from the Consolidated Revenue Account; here it is a case of money coming from a specific source. A specific section of the community is singled out to bear this burden. Therefore I say that if they have to bear it they must at least have the opportunity of calling part of the tune. At least, that is the accepted practice in all democracies. I think the hon. the Deputy Minister should observe and honour that outlook. He should honour that principle which was established at the time of the Native Services Levy Act.</p>

<p>*Hon. members must be quite clear in their minds about this position so that we can proceed to deal with a very important matter in this House. I want to make a very serious statement here, and I hope the hon. member will listen to it. We in this country must realize that we have reached the stage where, from the viewpoint of the Bantu, those Bantu who live and work in the White area, it is quite rightly argued that it should, with justification, be possible for certain moneys his employer pays on his behalf to be utilized in the interests of his family in the homelands.

Really, how hon. members opposite can survive and keep on arguing in an unreal vacuum such as this, is beyond me. I say this in all seriousness. I am not trying to make political capital out of the matter. I just want to quote the following example to point out the peculiar way in which hon. members opposite argue. Hon. members opposite are the people who are always raising a hue and cry about Bantu education, and so on. For example, if there were quite a brilliant Bantu student somewhere in the White areas, who could study at any of the Bantu universities in the Bantu homelands he would, in spite of the vast accumulated surplus in the Bantu Levy Fund, not be able to get one single cent from that surplus by way of bursary to go to the Bantu homelands.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>For housing. One of the most important ways in which this housing position can be solved from the point of view of the Bantu employer and from the point of view of the White employer is that the economically non-active Bantu, who have houses in Soweto or in any other township and while there are endless waiting lists, should be provided with alternative housing in the homelands by local authorities at those places where the kin of those Bantu are living. If they receive the necessary housing there by means of the levies providing such services and by means of the other moneys providing in those needs, more houses will become available for economically active Bantu in urban residential areas. Let us take the Johannesburg City Council for example. If this City Council succeeds in providing such housing at Ga Rankuwa for the economically nonactive Bantu in the Johannesburg area, housing will again, to that extent, become available for the economically active Bantu in the Johannesburg municipal area. Surely it is in the interests of those White employers that the Johannesburg City Council should assist in erecting houses at Ga Rankuwa, Olifantshoek, or anywhere else in the homelands, where it affects its employers. Surely it is also in the interests of the Bantu that this should be done.</p>

They allowed this money to accumulate unnecessarily. These employers had to pay into this fund. The amount has shot up to R30 million and they do not know what to do with the money. The Deputy Minister must not blame us for that. The fact is that, as far as the employers are concerned, they had no control. They will go on paying taxes and another surplus may result; the Deputy Minister is going to watch surpluses growing because he wants that money to be donated for use outside of the urban areas. He wants surpluses to grow so that he can use them in the reserves. That is our objection.</p>

<p>It is all very well saying that the employers will be represented on the boards. How is the employer going to be represented on the boards&#x003F; The Minister chooses the representatives of the employers.</p>

<p>Clause 9 (contd.):</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Last night when the House adjourned, I was dealing with the question of surpluses which will be built up in the revenue accounts of the different boards and pointed out that the hon. the Minister would want these surpluses to be built up so that he could make use of them. Sir, the hon. the Deputy Minister has accused us of the United Party of having prevented him from using the surpluses which have been built up in the Services Levy Account, and I pointed out that it was not the United Party which prevented him from using those surpluses. It was the law as prepared by Dr. Verwoerd and the promises made by Dr. Verwoerd. I pointed out to this Deputy Minister that he and his department are responsible for the building up of those surpluses. Had they carried out Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s policy and his promises, there would have been no surpluses, because he had promised that as soon as the levy was no longer necessary for the services which he envisaged the levy would be scrapped; it would be abolished. Sir, why did these surpluses build up&#x003F; They were built up for the very reason mentioned here by the hon. the Minister when he told us about the long waiting list for housing. Now why is there a waiting list in practically every urban Bantu area for housing, as he himself has said&#x003F; It is because this Government has neglected its duty. It did not see to it that there were houses. We know very well that the Johannesburg municipality wants to build more houses. The Minister cannot deny that and the Minister will have to agree in this House that it is his department and he who stopped the municipality from building those houses. There is a shortage, and if the houses had been built as the expansion took place, as was demanded by the situation in those urban areas, there would have been a use for the surpluses in the Levies Fund and the levies could then have been put to use. Now these surpluses, we contend, will build up again. Although the Services Levy is now done away with as a services levy, the new levies or tax which will be imposed by this Bill under consideration will permit of the building of surpluses again, and the Minister can engineer that because the urban authorities, the administration boards or the municipalities, whoever controls the collection of these funds, can only spend the money if the expenditure is approved by the Minister. He can in effect stop any urban area or any authority from spending the money which is collected and in that way he can build up surpluses and he can stipulate conditions for expenditure from the fund. He can attach strings to his permission to spend money in urban areas. He can say: &#x201C;I give you permission to use the money, provided that you do so and so.&#x201D; He can, in fact, insist that they make money available for him by way of donations for use in areas outside the urban areas.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister said that the Bantu all want him to spend the money collected in the urban areas in the Reserves. The Bantu in the Reserves would certainly want that, but that is not the attitude of the Bantu in urban areas. What does Dr. Nkomo say in this interview published in <i>Rapport</i>&#x003F; This is what he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Noudat eiendomsreg verlore is, is daar geen ontwikkeling in hierdie opsig nie. Daarby word die plaaslike besture nie aangemoedig om burgerlike geriewe uit te bou nie, soos stadsentrums en sport-geriewe. Selfs die strate en ander openbare plekke word nie meer verbeter nie. Die Regering moedig ook die plaaslike besture aan om hul winste uit biersale, wat bedoel is om aan plaaslike maatskaplike geriewe bestee te word, in die tuislande aan te wend.</block>

<p>That is the whole attitude of this Government, and it was stated openly by the previous Deputy Minister, Mr. Coetzee. He said it was the policy to make the urban areas less attractive and the border areas more attractive. I want to ask the hon. the Minister why he is changing the wording which is used in the existing law, as it stands now. Section 19 (2) (c) of the Urban Areas Act reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any service, expenditure or grant which may be certified in writing by the Minister to be for the benefit or the welfare of the Bantu residents within the area of the urban local authority.</block>

<p>The Minister changed it from &#x201C;to be for the benefit or the welfare&#x201D; to &#x201C;as being in the interests of the Bantu&#x201D;. I submit that there is a difference in meaning between <span class="col_1049-1050" refersTo="page_0542"/>the words &#x201C;welfare&#x201D; and &#x201C;interests&#x201D;. &#x201C;Welfare&#x201D; can mean housing and other amenities, but &#x201C;interests&#x201D; can mean anything; it can mean the political advancement, or to subsidize, for instance, a homeland Government. That would be in the interests of the Bantu, but it would not necessarily mean the welfare of the Bantu. It is only at the discretion of this Minister how the money can be used. If the Johannesburg municipality made a voluntary donation to be spent in the Transkei for some project, the Minister could say that he is not going to spend it on that. He can say that, although it is their money and although they are offering it voluntarily. He can say how the money is to be spent and he will decide in whose interest it will be spent. Let us take a case of a student in the urban areas who wanted to go to the university but who was unable to get a bursary from the local authorities because they could not use this money. I must say I am shocked to hear this afternoon, in reply to a question by an hon. member on this side of the House to the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, that there are no provisions at the moment for apprenticeships to be served in a Reserve. Where are these people being trained&#x003F; They are not allowed to be trained in the urban areas.</p>

<p>Yes, they are in the process of doing it, but apprentices are not allowed to be trained in the urban areas. It is against the Government&#x2019;s policy to allow them to be trained in the urban areas. Therefore these local authorities cannot make provision for their training out of the funds they have at their disposal or out of the surpluses they have at their disposal. They cannot make provision for training. Over all these years this Government has done nothing to provide training for them in the Reserves. They said that they must go to their homes, but nothing has been done for them in the Reserves. Now, after all these years, they are in the process of doing something, but only after having stopped them from being trained, in Johannesburg for instance.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>You may put a question in a moment; just allow me to complete my argument. Very recently the Chief Minister of the Transkei, Kaiser Matanzima, made a request in respect of the Bill now before this House, namely that some of this money which will be collected should be paid to the Transkei for assistance and development there. [Interjections.] But of course. Surely hon. members know too that the money collected in terms of the Bantu Services Levy Act is one of the three involved here now. Apart from the political motive behind the matter, I completely fail to understand why not one of the hon. members opposite is prepared to accept my challenge so that we may dispose of this matter of the accumulated surpluses in the levy funds once and for all. If hon. members opposite do not agree, they may rightly be accused of being the cause &#x2026;</p>

<p>If hon. members opposite would only give an indication that they would be agreeable to those funds being released for utilization in the general interests of the Bantu, we would know what to do about the matter.</p>

<p>We have often indicated that we are of the opinion that that money should be released so that it need not be utilized only in terms of the provisions of the Bantu Services Levy Act but may be utilized in the interests of the Bantu in general. But the moment we talk about this, that side of the House accuses us of wanting to use that money for developing the homelands. Because hon. members opposite have that &#x201C;kink&#x201D; in their minds, they do not want those funds to be released. It is because they do not trust us. I can understand that hon. members opposite can argue like that in a political sense.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister, if he needs money for specific development in the homelands, why does he not request that money from the Treasury&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, money is needed for many purposes in the homelands. Large sums of money are requested from the Treasury. Yesterday evening or this morning hon. members could again read in the newspapers that Dr. Adendorff had mentioned an amount of R254 million for homelands development. But there are other circumstances which apply as well and of which I have tried to convince hon. members. The Johannesburg City Council has realized this now. I am referring to the question of housing. The hon. member for Transkei now wants to make the charge against us that certain conditions were laid down in respect of the granting of housing by the Johannesburg City Council. I deny this categorically. The hon. member does not understand the position. What is the position&#x003F; The position is that as a result of the fact that there are many Bantu employees in Johannesburg and Soweto whose families are living in the homelands, and as a result of the fact that there is a very long waiting list for housing in Soweto, people who have to deal with the administration in practice appreciate the simple fact which hon. members opposite apparently cannot appreciate, namely that if the necessary provision is made in the Bantu homelands from the Bantu Services Levy Fund and in every possible way for these people who are economically and non-economically active in Johannesburg, it follows automatically that houses become available in Soweto which may be allocated to <span class="col_1053-1054" refersTo="page_0544"/>people who can in fact be economically active in Soweto. Surely it is in the interests of those White employers in Johannesburg and in the interests of the families of the Bantu who want to be settled in the homelands, that there should be housing available in the homelands for that purpose. The Bantu realize this and so do the people who deal with these matters in practice. I therefore cannot understand why those hon. members persist in this attitude in spite of the fact that I have now challenged them three times to say whether they are prepared to allow the money which is collected by way of the service levy to be released for use in the interests of the Bantu in general. Why is there a surplus&#x003F; The reason for that is very simple. The Bantu Services Levy Act provides how these funds may be applied. Consequently the funds may not be applied for any purpose other than those provided for in the Act. What does the Act provide&#x003F; The Act provides that the funds may be utilized for basic services, namely for water, electricity and sewerage connections, etc.</p>

[Interjections.] This is what hon. members say. Now they are saying, &#x201C;Hear, hear!&#x201D;.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Why does the hon. member want to substitute another restriction for the existing restriction, which is already giving us so much trouble&#x003F; It is good and highly necessary that we thrash out this matter. Surely it is better to <span class="col_1055-1056" refersTo="page_0545"/>say that it should be utilized in the interests of the Bantu, for all their purposes.</p>

<p>In this regard I should like to point out another very important advantage to hon. members. In discussions with the representative organizations which came to see us about this, I said that if we could, for example, release the money in Johannesburg or the more than R30 million in accumulated surpluses, surely we would be able to take that money into account in determining the fees to be paid in terms of this Bill by the White employer in respect of his Bantu employees. This is why I accused the hon. member for Durban Point yesterday of pleading for the housewives while they are the people who are making the housewives pay through their necks. That is my point. Those hon. members want to take money from the White Revenue Account in order to use it on the Bantu Revenue Account. We say that is completely wrong. I maintain that if one could release this surplus of R6 million in the levy fund of the Johannesburg local authority and utilize it for Bantu housing in Johannesburg, or for Bantu education, or even for bursaries, as I said yesterday, surely the White employers in Johannesburg would have to pay less in terms of this amount which is to be determined. Surely this is very simple. I again want to level the accusation that hon. members opposite are primarily responsible for this surplus. I want to challenge them to reply to this accusation. I want to read to them Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s precise words in 1954 in regard to this Bantu Services Levy Act. I quote from the Hansard of 11th June, 1952, Vol. 80, col. 7766&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The idea is to link it up with the service contract system. The funds thus collected from the employers will thus be used only within the area where they have their own undertakings, namely the undertakings for which they need labour. It will not be necessary for employers in Cape Town to pay for the housing of Natives near Johannesburg.</block>

<p>This is the requirement we have always fulfilled. I read further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When Cape Town has been properly provided with the services for the stands wherever the Natives working there and expected to work there can be established, then Cape Town will have fulfilled her task. According to the Bill it is even possible and it will also happen that the levy for such an area will then be withdrawn.</block>

<p>This is precisely what we are doing now. We are therefore implementing the words of Dr. Verwoerd. I just want to remind hon. members that many questions have been asked in this House about this issue. Much serious thought has already been given to the possible repeal of this Bantu Services Levy Act as well as to the surpluses which arise in certain areas. But why could and has this Act not been repealed&#x003F; If the levy fund were not abolished completely, but only in one area, say in area A, one would have the position that the people of area B would object strenuously because the people in area B were in fact paying a levy, while it was not the case in area A. Surely that would be unfair. All the industrialists would then go to area A because no levy was payable there. To have abolished the levy in certain areas would therefore have caused tremendous problems. The abolition of this fund should therefore be universal, and this is precisely what is being done in terms of this measure. However, as far as the accumulated surpluses are concerned we have the problem which I explained a moment ago. The hon. member for Transkei spoke about the question of housing in Johannesburg and specifically in Soweto. I just want to say to the hon. member that since I became Deputy Minister, I do not know of one single motivated request from the Johannesburg City Council in respect of housing for their Bantu which was refused by me.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>But not one was approved either.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>If hon. members opposite agree that no requests were refused, they would realize what irresponsible statements have been made here about this question. The hon. member for Transkei now says that no one request has been approved either, but I want to inform him that in the past month approval has been granted for the construction of approximately 3 000 houses in Soweto. There are still one or two requests from the Johannesburg City Council outstanding. We have been in touch with them all along and they understand the situation very well. The reason why these requests were not and could not be approved previously, was that such a request had to go <span class="col_1057-1058" refersTo="page_0546"/>through various stages. For example, the loans involved are considered by the Department of Community Development as well as by the Housing Commission. Consequently it is a lengthy process before the necessary approval is given. But as far as my department and I were concerned, there was no delay in respect of the matter. The allegation made by the hon. member is therefore completely devoid of all accuracy.</p>

<p>Lastly, the hon. member asked why the words &#x201C;for the welfare&#x201D; are being changed to &#x201C;in the interests of Bantu&#x201D;. This change is being made simply because &#x201C;in the interests of Bantu&#x201D; is a wider concept and we are therefore of the opinion that it would be better from the viewpoint of the Bantu to use these words. One of the problems we have to deal with in practice in regard to funds voted for Bantu is that if the statutory provisions are not wide enough and contain the phrase &#x201C;the welfare of the Bantu&#x201D;, it is argued that certain things are not actually in the interests of the welfare of the Bantu. The legal people have advised us that if you changed it to &#x201C;in the interests of the Bantu&#x201D; you would overcome that problem and would not have the difficulty of being handicapped in respect of the expenditure of the funds. This is the only reason for this amendment being included in the Bill. I shall therefore content myself with saying that I hope this discussion about the levy fund and the surpluses in respect thereof will have the favourable result that those hon. gentlemen will help to release the accumulated surpluses. In this way we shall then be able to spend them as they also think they may be spent, according to the discussion we have had here in the past few days.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I fully agree with the hon. the Deputy Minister when he says it is very important that we discuss this matter fully this afternoon. I must say, listening to him over the last 15 minutes has certainly given me information that I did not have before. For instance, the hon. the Deputy Minister tells us that the R6 million odd surplus that has been in the hands of the Johannesburg Municipality and which he is now so eager to get released, is there for one reason only, namely that &#x201C;Soweto has got everything it needs by way of basic services&#x201D;.</p>

He is full of challenges; now I challenge him to tell us when he asked us to give our consent to the use of this money. Must we get up in this House and take the lead because he is afraid to go back on the word of Dr. Verwoerd&#x003F; That is what he is asking us to do. He does not want to break Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s word; he wants us to do so. He wants us to be responsible. He is in fact saying: &#x201C;Please break Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s word for me; I am too weak to do it.&#x201D; This is the same as their attitude in regard to section 10. They wanted to get rid of those permanent rights, so Mr. Froneman went out and told the Rapportryers that they would like to remove them, but that there would be an outcry from the United Party if they did so. Why could they not take that step&#x003F; Because it was Dr. Verwoerd who gave the urban Bantu those rights and they could not go baok on them. In this regard I say: Let the Deputy Minister come to us with a reasoned case and tell us what he wants this money for. Let him go to the employers and say: &#x201C;Look here, I want to use this money, the surplus which has been built up because of my failure to act. If you agree to let me use this surplus, I shall use it in the areas for which you paid that money. I shall use it for the benefit of the Africans whom you employ.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Let him see what their reaction would be. He has never put this to the people who paid this tax. He has never put it to the people who got this assurance from Dr. Verwoerd. Sir, I cannot understand the hon. the Deputy Minister. He says that he could not carry out Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s promise to abolish the levy once it had served its purpose in any particular area because that would have meant discriminating against employers in other areas. What does he propose to do in this Bill&#x003F; In this very Bill he proposes to discriminate; he is taking the right to discriminate.</p>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I do not want to add a great deal more to what has been said by my hon. friend who has just sat down, but I would like to remind the hon. the Deputy Minister how this Bantu services levy arose at all. He must remember, if he knows the history of this particular matter, that it was as a result of considerable discussions that took place between his predecessor in office, Dr. Verwoerd, who was then Minister of Native Affairs, and the Chambers of Commerce and Industry and the local authorities, because it was essential to raise funds for these services and because housing loans could not, in terms of the laws governing housing loans, be used for those linked services. A great issue was made of the fact that if <span class="col_1063-1064" refersTo="page_0549"/>funds were provided to install these linked services, the provision of housing could then be expedited. That was how the whole thing started, because at that particular time there was a tremendous shortage of houses, for various reasons which I do not propose to go into now. Dr. Verwoerd, the late Prime Minister, at that time gave this assurance to the industrialists and to the commercial people of the City of Johannesburg, where this whole issue was raised and resolved and a Bill was then placed before Parliament. But Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s assurance was not given to us. We spoke on behalf of the country; we spoke on behalf of those people who had been singled out for the payment of this levy for a specific purpose, and Dr. Verwoerd then gave this assurance to them. He said that the money would only be used for that purpose and that the law empowering the collection of those funds would only remain in force as long as these funds were required.</p>

<p>Sir, let me go on to the next point. I have yet to hear the hon. the Deputy Minister appeal for the co-operation of this side of the House when he wants a particular law passed by this House. I have yet to hear him ask this side of the House for co-operation to assist him to pass a law when he knows that such co-operation could be most valuable.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, maybe that is so. I do not quite follow the significance of the remark, but I understand it is a very important place. At any rate, I am sure that the hon. the Deputy Minister and his party must be very pleased that Mayfair is so significant. But I want to go a little further now.</p>

<p>If the hon. the Deputy Minister wants to issue challenges I would like him to answer two questions. More houses will be built in Soweto, as an example, or in any other municipality. Take the Cape, for instance. You may require additional link services or you may require the increase of the capacity of some of these link services. You certainly cannot permit the fund to be completely dissipated until you have completed all the buildings in the townships. Further, does not the hon. the Deputy Minister know that his Department has had discussions with local authorities in areas where land is beginning to be short, in regard to building duplex buildings and considering the question of density building&#x003F; All that is part and parcel of the development of these huge complexes lying outside the various cities and towns of our country. This will require additional funds from the Levy Fund but I certainly do not think it will require this large amount which is lying idle at the moment. But furthermore, what steps have the hon. the Deputy Minister or his Department taken, or any other official source over which he has some authority, to discuss this whole issue with the industrialists and the commercial people of this country&#x003F; When has he taken any steps to get together local authorities and these various interested parties to find out what their interests and co-operation would be in the matter&#x003F; Because that is the way the thing originally started and they were consulted. We lived at that time in a state of Government where they had not reached the stage which the Government has reached now, where it willy-nilly pushes everything aside in order to achieve its objectives. And that is exactly what the Deputy Minister is doing now. He is trying to draw a red herring by issuing a challenge to people to whom he has no right to issue a challenge. He must issue a challenge to the people who pay and if they are prepared, then I say the Deputy Minister can come to us with a proposition. Then it is a different story. Tell the House exactly what you have been able to achieve with the taxpayer of the country, the man who has been singled out to look after this specific aspect. The Deputy Minister may well be met, of course, by the reply: What about the amenities in our own areas&#x003F; He correctly raised earlier in his speeches yesterday the question of electricity as an amenity. If he examined his own Hansard he will find that he talked about electricity as an amenity. I would like to tell him that in the fifties, I think it was in 1955 or 1956, we were able to persuade the Jonannesburg City Council to set aside nearly R5 million or R6 million from its capital funds to provide reticulation right throughout the township of Soweto. It required very much more than that, but because of the restriction on the use of capital funds, the money was spent at a very slow rate on the one important amenity which could prevent crime and save lives and which could give a new picture to a town, where people need not be afraid of the dark at night and need not be afraid of this tremendous wave of <span class="col_1065-1066" refersTo="page_0550"/>crime. That one amenity which can change the entire picture, as it has of civilized people throughout the world, that is something to which the Deputy Minister could direct his attention and if he would have spoken to the employers who pay, and if he had asked them to permit him to do that in the area for which they pay, they would have been only too delighted to do so. I challenge the hon. the Deputy Minister to get the co-operation of the employers to spend the money as the Act now stands for the welfare of the Bantu in the urban areas where they are working; I give him the assurance that the R6 million or R7 million which is lying in the coffers of the Native Services Levy Fund in Johannesburg will be spent within a year on the tremendous amount of amenities and services which are required. But do not throw challenges for the sake of publicity; do not throw out challenges for the sake of bravado, and do not throw out challenges for the sake of Brakpan or Mayfair, which you have already lost. Throw out a challenge to the employers, the people who have been singled out to pay this tax, and if you do that, you can come back to us and throw out a challenge to us.</p>

<p>Why did he not mention somebody else&#x003F; It is fine to hide behind Chief Kaizer Matanzima whom we all recognize as a pawn of the Government and who has one interest only and that is to further his own ends in the Transkei. We accept this. Of course Chief Kaizer Matanzima wants this money spent in the Transkei. He does not want it spent in the urban areas. Let the hon. the Deputy Minister tell us that the Bantu leaders in the urban areas have said that the money must be spent in the Transkei or in the rural areas. Let the hon. the Deputy Minister come with proof of that. He should produce that evidence to this Committee; not that it was Chief Kaizer Matanzima who wanted to use it in the rural areas.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister will play with words&#x2014;we have known him now for a few years&#x2014;and he is doing it here again this afternoon. Every time we ask him about this challenge, he uses the term &#x201C;in die algemeen&#x201D;&#x2014;in general. He said that he could use it for the Banu in general. He knows full well our opposition to that. He asked whether we did not trust him; of course we do not trust him. We do not trust him or this Nationalist Party when we come to this sort of thing, because they will not use the money in the urban areas.</p>

The only thing which happened voluntarily today was the crossing by Mr. Van Blerk. That is the only voluntary thing that happened; not what happened with the Johannesburg city council.

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, what about the dragging of the feet&#x003F; It is no good this hon. Deputy Minister hiding behind these things. It is quite obvious, quite apparent what his intention is here. He and the Government have decided they are going back on Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s undertaking. We are prepared to accept this, provided that money is spent in the urban areas. Let us still stick to the spirit of what Dr. Verwoerd said when he introduced this legislation. It was pointed out by my hon. friend from Transkei that we never introduced the legislation; we never stipulated those conditions. Those conditions in respect of the spending of this money were stipulated by the Nationalist Government. If that hon. Deputy Minister or his predecessors or even the Minister himself had really wanted to spend this money on the provision of amenities or housing or anything else for the Bantu, they could have come with such an amendment and this side of the House would have given it its blessing. Once again I believe that the hon. the Deputy Minister and the Minister have hidden behind an interpretation of the Act as it stands today. This provision which we are amending now could quite easily have been used for the provision of these very amenities which are required in the urban areas. Today the urgency for this becomes even more important than it ever has been.</p>

<p>Since we have had this change of policy, this sudden &#x201C;verligtheid&#x201D; of the hon. the Minister, brought about, I guess, by the hon. the Deputy Minister, where he is now going to allow the temporary permanent, or permanently temporary&#x2014;I do not know which way it is&#x2014;Bantu employees to bring their wives into the urban areas, provided there is housing available, why does he not take this surplus and provide that housing, and let us have a peaceful, stable and settled labour force in this country&#x003F; Let us do something to cool off the heat which is being engendered in these urban Bantu townships because of the dissatisfaction which is being created by the shortage of these various amenities which we are pleading for. Where he has now admitted that he has the money to do it and where he has taken the power in terms of this amendment, which he is going to force through &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to put the record straight in regard to one aspect. This afternoon the hon. the Deputy Minister tried to gloss over his and his Government&#x2019;s neglect in regard to Bantu housing in the urban areas. I think it is time this was exposed. There is a tremendous housing shortage for urban Bantu in Johannesburg, Durban, Cape Town and many other cities.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>There are thousands upon thousands who are waiting.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, thousands upon thousands, and this not only proves to be very inconvenient to those Bantu who have to board with other families, but also has a tremendous effect on the so-called swamping of the White residential areas by Black people. I shall <span class="col_1069-1070" refersTo="page_0552"/>leave it at that. The fact of the matter is that the Minister has tried here to dodge his responsibilities by saying that he has never rejected a housing scheme. The true facts are that in approving applications for housing for urban Natives, the Government dawdled and delayed for such a long time that these people did not come forward with new plans because they knew it would be of no use to do so, even though it was absolutely essential. They knew there was no point in submitting new plans until such time as they could obtain approval for those plans for which they had already applied. These are the facts of the matter. There was a time when the Nationalist Party did well in regard to Bantu housing. That was long ago in Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s time, but in recent years, when the policy was to keep the Bantu out of the urban areas, that policy was reversed, and they delayed in having houses built. Consequently thousands of Bantu were forced to board in houses that were alreday overcrowded. Other policies were followed, and that is what resulted in our reaching the present stage, namely the stage where there is a tremendous housing shortage for the Bantu in the urban areas. In the no-confidence debate I myself quoted figures showing that in Durban and Johannesburg alone there were a hundred thousand family units, individuals constituting families, who still did not have houses in urban areas. The real reason for this is the Government&#x2019;s policy of trying to prevent these people from gaining a foothold in the urban areas. We are pleased that an improvement is apparently setting in now. We are pleased to hear that the Minister has approved three thousand houses. We are pleased about all the other aspects, but do let us be honest and let us accept responsibility for the consequences of our policies. Therefore we plead that the record be put straight in this respect.</p>

<p>At the moment I cannot furnish the dates in this respect from memory, but these schemes <span class="col_1071-1072" refersTo="page_0553"/>were submitted at the beginning of last year, after the Johannesburg United Party members had come to see me here in Cape Town. At the time the matter was raised and also settled, as I told hon. members. The point I just want to emphasize again, is that up to now no scheme has been refused by me. I told the city councillors&#x2014; and this is the policy&#x2014;that I would judge the housing schemes submitted on their merits. In that way each of them is in fact judged on merit.</p>

<p>That may be so. I do not know about that. All that I am saying is that since I became Deputy Minister no scheme has been refused by me. That is the point. However, we can go into this matter and then we can come back to it during the Third Reading if the hon. member wants me to do so. That can be done with the greatest of pleasure.</p>

<p>I want to reply to the points raised by the hon. member for Houghton. I must say that it is quite astounding to find so much ignorance about this levy fund and the Levy Act. I will read the relevant section to the hon. member. Section 19 (3)<i>bis</i> of Act No. 25 of 1945, the Bantu (Urban Areas) Consolidation Act, reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Bantu services levy fund shall be chargeable only with:</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) the cost of administration of the Bantu Services Levy Act, 1952; &#x2026; &#x2026;</li>

<li>(b) any expenditure incurred by the urban local authority in connection with the provision of water, sanitation, lighting or road services outside a location, Bantu village or Bantu hostel under the control of that urban local authority, or outside any area approved by the Minister for future use for location, Bantu village or Bantu hostel purposes, provided such services are in the opinion of the Minister essential for the proper development of a location, Bantu village or Bantu hostel or of such other area.</li>

</ol>

<p>That is why we commonly talk in terms of &#x201C;link services&#x201D;. I hope the hon. member, as well as the other hon. members who did not understand it, now understands that those funds and those moneys accumulating in these funds can therefore only be utilized for these basic link services, unless the Act is changed. That is the position.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Jeppes asked me a question concerning more houses for Soweto. I have already said that each housing scheme receives attention on its own merits. The hon. member put a second question to me, and I want to reply to it. His question was: &#x201C;What steps has the Government taken to discuss the whole matter in regard to Bantu levy moneys, etc., with the representative bodies&#x003F;&#x201D; I assume he referred to the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut, the Federal Chamber of Industries (F.C.I.), Assocom, the local authorities, etc.</p>

I can tell hon. members that, in preparation for both this Bill and the Bantu Affairs Administration Act that was before this House last year, we had several and prolonged talks with all of these bodies. The question of the Levy Funds Bill and the levy funds themselves also cropped up in the course of these discussions.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Some were in favour of it, but others were not. It was as a result of that attitude, such as that of the Opposition on the other side, that they suspected the Government of intending to utilize those moneys for developing the homelands, in spite of the fact that we had repeatedly said, and proved it by our <span class="col_1073-1074" refersTo="page_0554"/>actions, that, in the first place, those moneys were being utilized in the interests of the Bantu in the specific vicinity in which those moneys had been collected. It is only when money was offered on a voluntary basis, by way of donations, for those people&#x2019;s families in the homelands, that it was also utilized in the homelands in the past.</p>

<p>I hope that the discussion of this question has brought a great deal of clarity in regard to these matters, and that we shall be taking a forward step with this, to my mind, extremely important matter.</p>

<p>Clause 2:</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, during the Second Reading debate I raised the question of the different treatment which is accorded in this Bill to Bantu beer and Bantu beer powder and I pointed out that this was also dealt with in other clauses of the Bill. The hon. the Deputy Minister then said that he had not noticed the difference in the treatment and that he would go into the matter, and that he would deal with it during the committee stage. I do not want to dwell on the subject any more and I assume that I can now look to the hon. the Deputy Minister to give us an explanation in regard to this matter.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as I promised in my <span class="col_1075-1076" refersTo="page_0555"/>Second Reading speech, I would now like to give the necessary information to the hon. member for South Coast. I want to refer firstly to the definition of Bantu beer in the Bantu Beer Act (Act 63 of 1962), in paragraph (iii) of section 1, which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Bantu beer&#x201D; means&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) the drink generally known as kaffir beer and commonly brewed by Bantu from kaffir corn or millet or other grain; and</li>

<li>(b) any other fermented liquor which the State President may from time to time by proclamation in the <i>Gazette</i> declare to be Bantu beer.</li>

</ol>

<p>I also want to quote section 7 of this Act, which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister may, at the request of a local authority, by notice in the <i>Gazette</i> withdraw the exclusive right which such local authority has under section six to manufacture, sell and deliver Bantu beer within its urban area or in any portion thereof, as from a date and in respect of the whole or any portion of such area specified in such notice.</block>

<p>*The position, as hon. members will see, is that apart from this definition of Bantu beer, there now is Bantu beer powder as well, which, when water has been added to it, is included in this definition of Bantu beer.</p>

<p>&#x2020;In other words, when water is added to Bantu beer powder, in terms of the definition of &#x201C;Bantu beer&#x201D; in the Bantu Beer Act, it is considered to be Bantu beer. But Bantu beer powder by itself is not considered to be Bantu beer. That is the reason why, in clause 2 of the Bill before the Committee, the distinction is drawn between &#x201C;Bantu beer&#x201D; and &#x201C;Bantu beer powder&#x201D;. In terms of clause 2 of the Bill&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any general dealer outside an urban area, who has been authorized by the Minister in writing under this section to do so, may, with due regard to the provisions of this section, sell and supply packaged Bantu beer and Bantu beer powder, provided such packaged Bantu beer&#x2026;</block>

<p>Now hon. members will see in the rest of the sentence that there is no reference to Bantu beer powder, but only to Bantu beer, for the reason I mentioned when referring to the definition of Bantu beer. I continue&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; is acquired from a local authority, the Bantu Investment Corporation or the Xhosa Development Corporation.</block>

<p>In other words, this clause of the Bill now authorizes the Minister to give a licence to a general dealer to sell Bantu beer powder, which is not Bantu beer. One can use that Bantu beer powder, by way of speaking, for instance, to feed chickens. Then it does not fall within the ambit of this Act. But the moment water is added to that Bantu beer powder, it is Bantu beer. Then, in terms of this clause of the Bill, that Bantu beer is prohibited, under certain conditions, on certain premises, etc. That is the reason why this distinction is made between Bantu beer powder and Bantu beer. I will repeat it finally. The distinction therefore boils down to the fact that Bantu beer powder is not considered to be Bantu beer, unless water is added to it. Then the relevant definition of Bantu beer in terms of the Bantu Beer Act comes into operation.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the new subsection (1A) states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any general dealer outside an urban area, who has been authorized by the Minister in writing under this section to do so, may, &#x2026; sell and supply packaged Bantu beer and Bantu beer powder &#x2026;</block>

<p>Sir, this refers to a general dealer outside an urban area, but not to any other person who is not a general dealer. The next point I want to make is this: Would that Bantu beer powder not have to be manufactured by the local authority, the Bantu Investment Corporation or the Xhosa Development Corporation&#x003F; If a person is a general dealer and he buys Bantu beer, this new subsection states that he must obtain the packaged Bantu beer from &#x201C;a local authority, the Bantu Investment Corporation or the Xhosa Development Corporation&#x201D;. It does not state that a general dealer, who has been authorized by the Minister, must also obtain his Bantu beer powder from those same sources. My question, then, is: Can a general dealer acquire Bantu beer powder, having obtained the approval of the Minister, from sources other than those three sources&#x003F; It seems to me, on reading this new subsection that those three sources must be used as far as Bantu beer is concerned, but not as far as Bantu beer powder is concerned. This is where the differentiation in the treatment takes place.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the position is that if the Minister authorizes a dealer to sell Bantu beer powder in the rural areas, he may, of course, sell Bantu beer powder. However, he may not do so without that authority. Let me just inform this Committee of the origin of this provision. The <i>ad hoc</i> Bantu Beer Committee received representations from organized trade to allow, <i>inter alia,</i> Bantu beer powder to be made available in the rural areas as well. This is the position and this is where this provision comes from. They pointed out that yeast and malt could be sold freely in the rural areas and then they asked for provision to be made in the case of Bantu beer powder as well so that it could be sold in the rural areas. It should be remembered that in the urban areas Bantu beer powder can be sold only by licensed persons duly authorized thereto. Those in general trade then said, &#x201C;We want Bantu beer powder to be sold in the rural areas as well&#x201D;. That is the reason for the provision contained in this clause; with the authority of the Minister it will be possible, if this Bill is passed as it stands, for a dealer to sell Bantu beer powder in the rural areas. We have found it possible to give effect to this request of organized trade for another reason, and that reason is that we have felt for quite some time, and we have also received representations in this connection from other quarters, that Bantu beer ought to be made available more freely in the rural areas, and one method of making it available is to grant permission to rural dealers to sell Bantu beer powder. This is the position.</p>

<p>Sir, a few minutes ago I read out to the hon. member the definition of &#x201C;Bantu beer&#x201D; contained in the Bantu Beer Act. Perhaps I should have read out to him the note at the foot of that page as well; in that case I think this matter would have been easier to understand. This note reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">By Government Notice No. R.159 in the <i>Government Gazette</i> of 28th June, 1963, as amended &#x2026; the State President declared Bantu beer to be any liquor which is similar in appearance and taste to the drink generally known as kaffir beer and which is made, whether with or without the addition of yeast or other fermenting agency, from any powder or substance generally referred to as Bantu beer.</block>

<p>I asked the hon. the Deputy Minister why it only applied to general dealers outside urban areas. I said there may in fact be urban areas where there are no licences, e.g. in Fish Hoek and there can be other country places where there is no liquor house in an urban area. Why does the Minister then allow himself to give permission to a general dealer to sell kaffir beer in circumstances like that&#x003F; Why does he not just leave out the provision referring to dealers outside the urban area and say any general dealer and as a matter of policy only apply it to rural areas and to urban areas where there are no liquor distribution points&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>I do not know whether I understood the hon. member&#x2019;s question correctly. If I did not, the hon. member should repeat it. The position is that we have smaller local authorities in the rural areas and, as a matter of policy, we should like those smaller local authorities to accept the responsibility for their administration of affairs in that area. Therefore, in view of the fact that this is also a source of revenue for them, those smaller authorities also have to accept the necessary responsibility, in so far as it is practicable, in connection with, in this case, the provision of <span class="col_1081-1082" refersTo="page_0558"/>Bantu beer in their areas. That is why we want to take the position of those local authorities into account and give them recognition as far as this matter is concerned. That is why we want to give this right to the general dealers only in the rural areas and why we act prudently when extending this right to those smaller places, where one has local authorities. Because those local authorities, even if they are small, can obtain Bantu beer in various ways. They can obtain it from the Bantu Investment Corporation and in Eastern Cape areas from the Xhosa Development Corporation. They can obtain it also from another larger local authority and sell it at a profit. By way of example, I should like to mention the case of a small town here in the Cape Province, i.e. Springbok, which sells excellent Bantu beer. The other day when I paid Springbok a visit, I was very interested to see what excellent Bantu beer they were selling in a small place which is so remote and in which they have so few Bantu. I think they obtain it from Cape Town from where it is transported to Springbok where it is sold at a profit. Now, in a case like that, where one has a small place like Springbok, where the local authority meets the demands for Bantu beer very satisfactorily, why would one give a dealer the necessary permission to do so too&#x003F; In that way one would be creating unnecessary problems. But on a farm near Springbok or somewhat more remote, where it is more difficult to obtain beer, we shall, according to circumstances, give consideration to the request of a general dealer, because the intention is to make Bantu beer more readily available in the rural areas as well. And, finally, let me tell the hon. member this as well; even in the case of a place like Springbok, if it is considered necessary on the basis of demand to give a general dealer the necessary licence there, we shall give consideration to that request and we shall go into the matter very thoroughly. This will be an additional reason why we shall not lightly delegate powers in this regard.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>We have heard a lot from the Deputy Minister in connection with Bantu beer and Bantu beer powder. I put certain questions to him during the second reading debate which he completely ignored, and I can see that his attitude still is that he would like to ignore them but I will not allow him to do so because we have to clear up this question of what is Bantu beer powder. I am sorry, but I am still not satisfied what it is.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in your opinion this might be a repetition of argument, but I will advance other arguments to show that the hon. the Deputy Minister cannot simply say that Bantu beer powder is a powder from which Bantu beer or some similar substance is obtained if water is added, because there is a lot more to it than that. There are certain products on the market, some of which have been sold for 50 years or more, from which Bantu beer is brewed, and which have been previously sold by general dealers for as long as I can remember. Those products are the ones in respect of which we heard the hon. member for Vryheid trying to be clever when we were discussing the Second Reading. They are kaffir corn sprouts, kaffir corn malt powder &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; maize sprouts, maize malt powder. These products are all used in the brewing of kaffir beer, or Bantu beer as it is put in this Act, and they are all used by the addition of water. Some of them are subsequently cooked; some are not cooked. There is one product called &#x201C;Utwala&#x201D; which, simply by the addition of water, produces a kaffir beer.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, with respect, I am dealing with the clause, whether or not the addition of water constitutes Bantu beer. That is exactly what we are dealing with.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>If you sit down, I shall reply to you.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>No, it is no good the hon. the Deputy Minister coming with that, because three times he has had a chance to answer and he has not answered yet.</p>

<p>This is serious because we have a provision in the Act at the moment which provides that any person who sells such a product which, with the addition of water, with or without the addition of yeast, creates a substance which is similar to or tastes like or looks like Bantu beer commits an offence. This affects every single general dealer in the country who has been dealing with Bantu. If the hon. the deputy Minister is going to include in the definition of Bantu beer powder these products which I have mentioned, every single general dealer in the country is going to find himself guilty of an offence. This is why it is serious. But not only that; this is a service which is being provided by these traders who have provided these products to the Bantu for the homebrewing of their beer which is not only a beverage, but is a food. These traders have been supplying a food, a nutritious food to the whole family. This brings me to the other question which I raised with the hon. the Deputy Minister in the Second Reading and to which he also did not reply. That is the provision which we have in paragraph (c) whereby he now levies a tax of 1 cent per 500 grams upon this Bantu beer powder. We do not know what he is taxing at this stage. Is it only those powders which give you an instant beer&#x003F; Is this the only powder to which he is referring, those that make an instant beer simply by the addition of water, or is he referring to kaffir corn sprouts, kaffir corn malt powders and, similarly, maize sprouts and maize malt powders&#x003F; If he is in fact going to tax those products as well&#x2014;many of them are marketed under trade names which I do not think I should mention here&#x2014;he is going to tax the food of the Bantu, food which goes to all the members of the family. I opposed this a few years ago, but before I even think of opposing it now, I want to know what I am opposing.</p>

<p>I also want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2014;perhaps he can answer this third question as well&#x2014;what he is going to do with the money which he is going to collect by means of this tax. He is going to create a new fund in terms of the amendment contained in the Bill. This fund is going to be under the administration of the Secretary for Bantu Administration and it may be charged with any service or expenditure or grant which may be certified by the Minister as being in the interest of the Bantu. Does he have any particular ideas that he would like to use this for; what is his intention in this regard&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I just want to tell that hon. member very peacably that I do not think one of my ailments is not to reply to questions. It was not at all necessary for him to make the remarks with which he introduced his speech. I would have replied to that in any event in the course of the replies I give to questions in this regard. I want to remind that hon. member in all friendliness that the <i>ad hominem</i> argument is the weakest argument to use. I really do take exception to his making personal remarks of that type against me. I think it is undeserved and unnecessary as well.</p>

<p>The other day the hon. member wanted to know&#x2014;as he again wanted to know now&#x2014;the definition of Bantu beer powder. The definition of Bantu beer powder is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any powder or substance, which when added to water, whether with or without the addition of yeast, produces a liquid having the appearance and taste of Bantu beer.</block>

<p>That is the definition of Bantu powder. Therefore it does not include malt, because malt is not a powder or substance. Now I want to tell the hon. member that we have no quarrel with malt at all. Therefore malt is not at all involved in this. Nor are we taxing malt. We do not have a <span class="col_1085-1086" refersTo="page_0560"/>quarrel with yeast. The Act indicates very clearly what Bantu beer powder is and since 1964 there has been no doubt as to what Bantu beer powder is, because Bantu beer powder is manufactured under licence. I want to refer the hon. member to the Bantu Beer Act, Act No. 63 of 1962. I want to refer him to paragraph (j) of section 16 (1). The person who commits an offence is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any person who&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(j) sells or delivers to any person other than a person permitted under this Act to supply Bantu beer, or a local authority, any powder or other substance which when added to water, whether with or without the addition of yeast &#x2026;</li>

</ol>

<p>Therefore I say once again to the hon. member that we have no difference in this legislation between yeast and malt&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; produces a liquid having the appearance and taste of Bantu beer.</block>

<p>By referring to these products in this way, I have probably come closer to being a farmer than ever before. I hope the hon. member now understands the whole matter. From this definition it is very clear what Bantu beer powder is. Therefore it is very clear that there has been no problem or difficulty regarding this matter since 1964, nor do I expect any problem or difficulty henceforth. Now I have replied to the hon. member on this point. As far as I know, there remain only two questions which I have to answer for the hon. member. If I should overlook any question, the hon. member is welcome to remind me of it. The one question concerns his reference to the clause introducing a levy. He referred to the new subsection (7) (a) being inserted into section 5 of the original Act by clause 2 (c) of this Bill. It reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A levy of 1 cent shall be payable in respect of each 500 grams of Bantu beer powder supplied by any manufacturer to a general dealer.</block>

<p>Now I just want to tell the hon. member than an excise duty of one cent is already being levied on an equal quantity of Bantu beer. If we want to strike a balance as far as this position is concerned, we cannot tax the one article by one cent and, in terms of the provisions of this legislation, exempt the other under certain conditions. Surely that is unfair; for that reason we state in this Bill that a levy of one cent will be payable in respect of each 500 grams of Bantu beer powder. I hope the hon. member understands that if there is an excise duty of one cent on Bantu beer, whereas there is no levy on Bantu beer powder, the matter will be unbalanced and that that would not be right.</p>

<p>The hon. member&#x2019;s final question was what we were going to do with this money. We have different funds of this nature in our department. We have, what we call, the White Liquor Profit Account apart from the Bantu Beer Account. This White Liquor Profit Account is utilized for various purposes in the interests of Bantu. Our intention is to utilize the funds which will be obtained from this levy in the same way. It is very difficult for me now to specify here for what specific purposes we are going to utilize these funds. I do not know whether the hon. member would be so much the wiser if I were able to spell out to him now for what specific purposes it would be possible to utilize those funds. After all, when it comes to Bantu Affairs we are dealing with 16 million people with many different needs in different fields. They are spread over the whole of the Republic. There are, in the first place, needs in the homelands, but there are needs at other places as well. The hon. member should allow us to utilize the fund at our discretion where circumstances are the most urgent and where the fund can be utilized best. I really hope the hon. member is satisfied with that. To that I just want to add that our policy is very clear. Our policy is home and centric. Where it is necessary to do so, we shall utilize it in the interests of that. However, there are the needs in the White area as well and where it is necessary to do so, we shall not hesitate to utilize it for that purpose. For that reason I am not in a position to spell out for the hon. member the different small items for which this fund will be utilized. Surely, he should be in a position to know that it will not be much.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I must thank the hon. the Deputy Minister for his reply. I am glad he has replied. However, he left the point dealing with the Bantu beer powder out.

As I read this definition, and from my own personal knowledge of these products&#x2014;not second or third-hand knowledge, but my own personal knowledge&#x2014;they could be classified as Bantu beer powder in terms of what the hon. the Deputy Minister has now given us as a definition of &#x201C;Bantu beer powder&#x201D;.

<speech by="#kingwill">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House urgently request the Government to consider the advisibility of granting its consent and support for the project of an outer sea wharf for unloading ore at St. Croix.</block>

<p>I move this motion which requests the Government to investigate the desirability of establishing an ore offloading berth at St. Croix at Algoa Bay, in the firm conviction that such a step will be in the best national interest. Taking into account all the facts at my disposal, I can certainly come to no other conclusion. At the same time, in moving this motion, I in no way wish to criticize a decision taken by the Cabinet giving Iscor the go-ahead to develop Saldanha as a major port for the export of steel, iron ore and possibly other minerals. I must say, in motivating the case for Saldanha, the information has always been a little obscure.</p>

<p>I also know that there was an interdepartmental committee appointed by the Government to inquire into the merits of both Saldanha and St. Croix. We have unfortunately not had an opportunity to study this report. I wonder whether I am asking too much if I request the hon. the Minister to have this report made available to hon. members at some time. I accept that the development at Saldanha in the long term&#x2014;and I emphasize &#x201C;the long term&#x201D;&#x2014;may well be in the national interest. I want to say that we on this side of the House do not contest in any way whatsoever the advisability of establishing Saldanha as a major port in the long term. However, if the development of Saldanha in the long term is feasible, I believe even more strongly that the development of St. Croix in the short term is equally as important. To substantiate this, there are many valid reasons that can be raised.</p>

<p>I do not suggest that St. Croix must be in opposition to Saldanha, but I believe that St. Croix must be complementary to Saldanha and that the development of St. Croix will, in fact, ultimately facilitate the establishment of the major harbour at Saldanha. In fact, I am convinced that if we want to develop our ore exports on a rational basis and to the best advantage of the country, both the St. Croix project <span class="col_1089-1090" refersTo="page_0562"/>and Saldanha can play vital parts. I am fully aware that the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs has indicated that there is not room for both projects in respect of handling large-scale exports of iron ore. It is because of this statement that I have seen fit to move this motion today. I believe that the development of St. Croix is so vitally linked up with the national interest of developing our export trade that I move this motion asking the hon. the Minister to persuade the Cabinet to have another look at the situation. I and other speakers will give the reasons why we believe that there is room for both major projects. For that reason I very much appreciate the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s presence at this debate this afternoon.</p>

<p>Every member in this House is fully aware that the country is confronted with a very serious, adverse trade balance and that it is of the utmost importance that every possible&#x2014;I emphasize &#x201C;every possible&#x201D;&#x2014;step be taken to rectify this situation as speedily as possible. Speed is essential if we want to enjoy the full benefit of the present devaluation situation. Under these circumstances I believe the country is most fortunate indeed in having vast, and I emphasize &#x201C;vast&#x201D; resources of manganese and iron ore available to boost our export trade. But as things stand today, we simply do not have the ports to exploit this favourable situation. This is our problem.</p>

<p>According to expert opinion, even conservatively estimated, we have something like 4 000 million tons of high-grade iron ore in the Sishen-Postmasburg area, while the Kalahari has, I believe, the biggest deposits of manganese ore in the world. When I said that we do not have the ports to handle the export of this ore, it was not absolutely correct, because at the present time Port Elizabeth harbour is handling limited quantities of this raw material. The problem is that the current throughput of the Port Elizabeth harbour is at present only in the region of 3,7 million tons per annum. I do not doubt that this figure can be stepped up considerably although it will involve further expenditure, but I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that this quantity of ore is far too little to make any appreciable difference to our balance of payments problem. We need to deal in a far bigger way if we want to effect an improvement in the balance of payments situation.</p>

<p>Another problem is that the Port Elizabeth harbour has shallow water and can only handle ships with a maximum tonnage of 40 000 tons. This fact places us in a hopelessly uncompetitive position with countries like Australia that are able to use big ships of up to 150 000 tons and more. The ability to use big ships is very vital to the ore export industry if we hope to enjoy the freight advantages that big ships offer. It is an interesting thought that if the St. Croix project, about which the country has been speaking for some three years, had been tackled at that time, we may today have been in the position to use a major exporting facility, and to use these big ships, which would have brought us into line with other competing countries like Australia. But we have been dilly-dallying and today we sit with the situation that we have the ore but not the ports to export the ore from.</p>

<p>It is also interesting to know that as a result of the tremendous progress which has been made on the Railway line between Sishen and Port Elizabeth, more ore can be delivered to the Port Elizabeth harbour today than shippers can handle. In other words, there is a surplus capacity on the Railways of which we cannot make use. I believe this is a serious matter. We have the raw materials for export, we have the trains to carry the ore, but we are in the unenviable position that we do not have the ports to take things further.</p>

<p>Hon. members will have seen the interesting picture which appeared in most of our newspapers during the last week, illustrating the biggest and the longest ore train that has ever moved along the Rallway lines of South Africa. This train was a mile long. We in the Eastern Cape value the fact that such tremendous progress has been made by the South African Rallways in this respect. I want to take the opportunity of congratulating every engineer, Rallway worker, and any other person that had a hand in bringing this to fruition. I think it is a singular achievement for our country. We in the Eastern Cape note with gratitude that steps have been taken to improve the capacity of the line to the Eastern Cape. Not only has this been done, but there is also another interesting programme for the future. We understand that 3 000 special bogies are on order to increase the carrying capacity of that line even further. Centralized traffic control is also visualized and more extra-duty diesel locomotives are on order. We see that as <span class="col_1091-1092" refersTo="page_0563"/>time progresses, the capacity of the line will be improved but there will not be a port to handle this capacity. The whole situation is getting out of balance.</p>

<p>In raising the question of St. Croix and the desirability of establishing an ore terminal there, the railway factor is important because there is not any need for extra capital outlay. There is no need for involving extra railway expenditure in the situation. The line is there. It is merely a case of providing a port. According to reliable information, St. Croix can be built within 2&#x00BD; years, at a total cost which will not exceed R50 million. It involves the building of an off-shore terminal in the lee of St. Croix Island in Algoa Bay. Accurate data in respect of wind, waves and currents reveal a most satisfactory situation. There are people who allege that this project has not been properly investigated, but here is a report from the engineers, engineers that are accredited by the South African railway s, who called for the report in the original instance. If one studies this report, one sees that in every respect the St. Croix project, from an engineering point of view, is thoroughly feasible. There are people who say there are waves of nine feet and the wind is too strong, but this is not so. This report, which is available to any member in the House, finds that the lee of St. Croix offers an 85 per cent to 90 per cent berthing capacity for ships of up to 150 000 tons.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>What is more, the Japanese approve of the situation. They are very fussy. They do not give their approval to any situation about which they are not completely satisfied. The question immediately arises: Can the country afford to have two major ports for the export of mineral ore&#x003F; As far as I am concerned, the answer is definitely yes.</p>

<p>I think all hon. members will agree that the country is heavily committed financially in many projects that are being undertaken. This is surely not the time to embark on another gigantic undertaking which at this stage&#x2014;I do not say in the long run&#x2014;is not absolutely essential for the development of our iron ore and manganese ore export programme. Apart from the construction of the harbour, the Saldanha project requires a railway line of some 850 km. The South African railways are committed to an extensive and progressive programme already. There is the Witbank-Nelspruit line, involving some R40 million. There is the Broodsnyers-Ermelo-Vryheid line involving an expenditure of R80 million. Improvements to the Durban-Rand line involve R40 million. Richard&#x2019;s Bay has to be developed. I believe that the Administration are under such pressure that the line to Vryheid can no longer be electrified, and that certain of the pylons that were put up with a view to electrification are now being taken down. Iscor itself is involved in a massive expansion programme at Pretoria, Vanderbijlpark and Newcastle. These projects alone could cost in the region of R3 000 million.</p>

<p>Now Iscor must also finance the Saldanha project. Apart from the financial aspect, I am not surprised that Dr. Tom Muller is reported to have said that, as far as skilled labour is concerned, Iscor is skating on thin ice in so far as the Saldanha project is concerned. With this tremendous programme aimed at developing our infrastructure, our resources of capital and labour must surely be sorely tested. That is why I believe that the Saldanha scheme should best be considered a long-term project rather than a short-term project.</p>

<p>There are many other projects I can mention. Our national road programme must involve a tremendous part of our financial and labour resources. The P. K. le Roux Dam is being built. The canals and tunnels of the Orange River scheme have not yet been completed. All this makes one wonder whether, at this stage, we have the resources to tackle a project of such dimensions as the Saldanha project. In this connection, I must emphasize the words &#x201C;at this stage&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, there is the reduced demand for ore overseas. We all know that as a result of certain fiscal measures which have been adopted, the demand for ore is not what it used to be. Australia is faced with a situation where Japan has asked her to reduce her supply. Is this a time to embark on the Saldanha scheme, when we cannot be assured of large-scale orders&#x003F; I think it will be impossible to contract for large orders of sufficient value to justify the Saldanha scheme.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a smaller project like St. Croix, which is going to cost only some R47 million, will be able to be justified on the strength of the orders we shall <span class="col_1093-1094" refersTo="page_0564"/>be able to obtain. In fact, to the best of my information, such orders have already been placed by private enterprise. There is no question about it; order-wise, St. Croix is assured of success. There are people who allege that if St. Croix is developed, the taxpayer will have to pay. This is absolute nonsense. Private enterprise is prepared to assist the South African railways with the finance. It has been worked out&#x2014;the figures are available; I have them here for any member to see&#x2014; that the whole project can be paid for, amortized, within eight years without any cost to the taxpayer. With an expenditure of R47 million, the country can be placed in the position where it will be exporting ore on a large scale, using the bigger ships and utilizing the freight advantage within three years.</p>

<p>I believe that in this way, if the Government embarks upon this undertaking, it will be able to play a major role in solving some of its trade deficit problems. I believe too that if we can get St. Croix operating, it will minimize any risk which the Government or Iscor must take in developing the Saldanha scheme. I think the hon. the Minister will agree with me that if we are in the trade, using St. Croix as an export base, it will be so much easier to negotiate bigger orders which, at a later stage, will justify the Saldanha undertaking.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, my time has almost expired. I leave it to other members on this side to develop further arguments to show why we believe that the development of St. Croix, even at this late stage, is a vital matter concerning the ore industry of South Africa.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, as coincidence would have it, it is today exactly four years since a very exciting report appeared in our newspapers. This was a report from Iscor reflecting their resolve to export crude ore from South Africa and to do this by way of a pipeline that would run from Sishen to a point somewhere on our coastline; i.e. the ore has to be pumped. We subsequently gathered that the three points on our coast-line that were to be borne in mind at the time for a possible project were three harbours or three points on our country&#x2019;s west coast, i.e. Boegoeberg, the mouth of the Olifants River and Saldanha Bay, and the other point was on our country&#x2019;s east coast, at Port Elizabeth. Sir, the following report in that connection was forthcoming exactly a year later, when our previous Minister of Economic Affairs paid a visit to Japan. It was reported that he had held negotiations with eight of the world&#x2019;s biggest steel manufacturers in Japan to make such a project possible. The groups with whom he held discussions at the time were the Jawata group, the Fuji group, the Nippon group, the Sumitomo group, the Kawasaki group, the Nakajama, Kobo and Jisjin groups. These discussions indicated very great potential in that connection. Sir, since these two reports appeared in our Press, I wonder whether there is a similar subject about which so much was said, written and even widely speculated as the possibility of exporting ore abroad, until the final announcement came from the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs at the end of last year, in which he told us that after thorough consideration during the preceding four years our Government had decided, in the first place to export ore; to construct a railway line from Sishen to Saldanha Bay and to transport it from there. The only condition not yet complied with was an investigation to determine what that line was going to cost us over that distance. Work is still being done on that calculation at the moment. We take it that the result will become known in the second half of this year. Mr. Speaker, the point I want to make is that in the four years that have passed the hon. member who has just spoken did not move a motion in this House, while this matter was under consideration, to the effect that the Government should bear his region, i.e. Port Elizabeth, in mind. He never opened his mouth throughout the four years in which this matter was discussed and written about, but now that the final decision has been announced he raises the matter here. He did on occasion refer to this situation and when was that, Sir&#x003F; It was on the very eve of the general election when he wanted to make large-scale propaganda out of this situation. I quote from the <i>Evening Post</i> of Saturday, 7th March&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Call to put ore berth in P.E.: Vital for future, says Kingwill.</block>

<block name="quote">Grave economic, political and employment consequences would face Port Elizabeth and South Africa if the Government decided to establish the future ore port at Saldanha Bay instead of Algoa Bay, Mr. Walter Kingwill, M.P. for Walmer, said today.</block>

<p><span class="col_1095-1096" refersTo="page_0565"/>What more does he have to say in this very long report&#x003F; He states that our ministers were chasing round with an eye on the election. He states that his part of the world&#x2014;Port Elizabeth and environs&#x2014;was going downhill; that there was no labour, no growth and no development. Instead of the Government placing this proposed project in his area, they were chasing round the country and holding election meetings. This was the first time in the past four years, during which this matter was under consideration, that this hon. member took any action in this connection. That was the kind of action he took prior to coming here today after the hon. the Minister had already made his final statement.</p>

<p>I want to say here today that after thorough study and consideration it is my conviction that the Government has taken the correct step. I just want to advance a few general arguments about why I think, in all humility that our Government has here taken the correct decision. Firstly, the ore potential of South Africa is there. South Africa must also employ this potential abroad. I now want to say that during this four-year period of consideration voices were raised in South Africa claiming that the Government should keep this raw material in the country, that we ourselves should process it here and preserve it for our descendants and export it at a later stage, or export less of it, as the circumstances demand. In this connection I want to advance a few arguments. The world&#x2019;s proven ore potential has been calculated by geologists at about 250 000 million tons. There is an additional expectation of 200 000 million tons, so the world&#x2019;s geologists tell us. South Africa&#x2019;s proven high-grade iron ore reserves total more than 10 000 million tons. If South Africa exports 15 million tons per year for 20 years, this amounts to 300 million tons, or a mere 3 per cent of South Africa&#x2019;s proven reserves. If South Africa does not export this ore, the steel factories of the world will not come to a standstill and assure us of the sole right for the export of processed products in later years. We shall have to use this opportunity. Countries such as India, Brazil, and in particular Australia will continue to provide the world with ore if we do not do so. And please note, Sir, that authorities estimate that Australia&#x2019;s ore reserves can be calculated at about 100 000 million tons, and with the advent of these massive ore carriers it is calculated that our ships here can load about 250 000 tons and more today. And it is a scientific fact that today this ore can be brought from Australia to harbours such as Durban and Port Elizabeth more cheaply than from Sishen to one of these points. In other words, it is my conviction that here the State is acting correctly and with calculation in making use of this ore potential of South Africa.</p>

<p>Secondly, the envisaged Sishen-Saldanha export scheme is much more than just an export scheme, and I should very much like to put this to the hon. member. This specific project is still going to bring South Africa large and permanent assets entailing incalculable benefits for us and our descendants. In other words, we must not think small in this matter; in this endeavour we must think big. I want to present it in these terms. In this country today we are building what I want to call a divided State structure. We want to ensure a Black majority in South Africa its territorial freedom. In this process&#x2014;and I find no difficulty here&#x2014;there has been in recent years great emphasis on, and growth momentum in connection with, the northern part of our country. In our harbour structure great emphasis has fallen on growth in the vicinity of Richard&#x2019;s Bay, Durban, East London and even in the vicinity of Port Elizabeth. I think the time has come, from a geographic point of view, for us to let new emphasis fall on other parts, i.e. the western and the north western parts of our country. For a good and calculated growth pattern in future, I consider it essential and right that we thus do so. If we now look at how this railway line is going to run, I think one could wax lyrical about the growth potential that is being unleashed and stimulated in this specific part of the country, as against these parts I have mentioned. I want to quote to you from the latest edition of <i>Iscor News,</i> in which an indication is now being given, for the first time, of how this railway line is going to run. My hon. friends who are sitting here, and who know this part of the world, will understand me when I say that one could wax lyrical about the potential, not only in respect of the transport of ore as an earner in South Africa of foreign exchange, but also in respect of the way in which that large part of South Africa can be made serviceable for the future of this country and its people. I have here a few short paragraphs to indicate how this railway line is going to run. This comes from the first <span class="col_1097-1098" refersTo="page_0566"/>official Iscor report that has appeared in that connection. I quote (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The envisaged ore railway line of standard width will be 853 km long with additional loops and junctions. The route is so favourable that the maximum grading for loaded trains is one in 250 and for empty trains one in 100. From Sishen the route takes all general south-westerly direction to south of the Olifants River mouth. From there it follows the coast southwards to Saldanha Bay. The route crosses the Langeberg mountains about 8 km south-east of Olifantshoek and then crosses the barren flats behind the mountain in a virtual straight line to Orange River, crossing it near Groblershoop. Close to Kleinbegin it crosses the Prieska-Upington permanent way, moves in the direction of Kenhardt and crosses the Hartebees River just north of this town, 274 km from Sishen. For the next 210 km the route traverses the relatively even plateau with its numerous pans. The Krom River Valley with its gentle fall is used to descend from the plateau to the Olifants River. The Cape-Bitterfontein line is crossed near Lossand. The west coast is reached just south of the mouth of the Olifants River, after which the route runs more or less parallel with the coast southwards to Saldanha Bay. On the way there it has to cross the moving sand dunes north of Elands Bay, follow a tunnel through Bobbejaansbergpunt, and cross marshes at the Berg River.</block>

<p>Knowing this part of the world as many of us do, one can wax lyrical about what is, in point of fact, being created there for South Africa, what is being released there for a new growth point, for new growth momentum in those western and north-western parts of our country that lie there in all their growth potential. I want to mention a few of these points without motivating my statements. There is, in the first place, the employment of the lower Orange River&#x2019;s water potential, particularly in respect of the mining industry in this specific part of the country. At the moment there is already talk of this river&#x2019;s water having to be brought to one of our copper mines at Nababeep in the Namaqualand area. Particularly in the spheres of industry and mining this railway line will entail the greater serviceability of the lower Orange River&#x2019;s water for the benefit of South Africa. I now want to say that attention must be paid to the fact that the mining industry remains one of South Africa&#x2019;s most stable economic struts in contrast to, for example, the agricultural industry. In 1970 alone the mining industry&#x2019;s contribution to our national revenue was somewhere in the region of R1 500 million. I therefore say that from this point of view what we are doing here is correct.</p>

<p>Secondly there are the copper fields at Prieska. I do not have time to elaborate on that now, but at a later stage there is the link-up of these newly discovered copper fields to this railway line. Thirdly there is the mining of Namaqualand&#x2019;s mineral wealth. That wealth lies there, but in the past we could not touch it because transport, if there was any, was too expensive, but chiefly because there was no transport whatsoever to afford this part of the country any growth momentum. I shall mention a fourth point without motivating it, i.e. the employment of the lower Berg River&#x2019;s water for industry. I want to lift my hat very high to the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs for the motivation he gave when the Boland water project was announced. He expressly said that as far as future growth and development in the Boland or in the greater Western Cape is concerned, it is essential that we look to the water of the lower Berg River, particularly with a view to industrial development. In addition he said that we should give greater protection as far as the other water is concerned, particularly in the sphere of Boland agriculture.</p>

<p>There is another aspect, the fifth, that I want to mention. This concerns the potential of the natural harbour of Saldanha Bay itself. I do not want to say any more about that, because I am afraid I would grow too lyrical.</p>

<p>Sixthly, there is the siting of the fourth Iscor. The chairman of Iscor&#x2019;s board of directors spoke about this recently and said that the fourth Iscor should be placed next to this train route. I must say I cannot see why the fourth Iscor cannot be placed within the lower Berg River area, or even within the vicinity of this area. Bearing in mind our tremendous Coloured population in the Boland, it is essential that we make the necessary provision here, and that in our handling of this project we ensure that it is brought within the context of the Boland growth pattern. There is the additional development of the mineral wealth deposits <span class="col_1099-1100" refersTo="page_0567"/>of Sishen and Kuruman themselves, an aspect about which my hon. Kuruman friend can wax lyrical, as we evidenced at our big and enthusiastic regional congress. Today South Africa already provides for its own needs with respect to steel products. Iscor alone takes care of about 77 per cent of that. The third steel factory, which will come into operation in 1974, will further increase this production. Over the next 10 years our steel production will double in order to provide for our own needs. Just think how it could affect a specific part of the country and how we could create a totally new future growth momentum in this part of the world if this Sishen-Saldanha Bay project can be implemented. To sum up &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member has undergone a complete transformation in his views. I claim that if we weigh up all these advantages and disadvantages, all the big benefits lie with Saldanha. I want to put it to hon. members as follows: It is, after all, an economic law that the greater the volume of ore transport on the railway line is going to be, the more economical will the project be. Let me put it differently. Any quantity of ore more than the planned or the projected 15 million tons that can be transported in the future, will make the project more economical. The experts now tell us that the St. Croix project has its disadvantages. It has its limitations; in the long run, for example, no more than 15 million tons can be exported from that specific point.</p>

<p>If this project, which is going to cost the country a great deal of money, is tackled, we want to utilize our potential, as I have tried to indicate. It is then obvious that the Saldanha project should be tackled, because in the long run we shall reap the benefits. It is calculated&#x2014;the hon. the Minister may correct me if I am wrong&#x2014;that if one could export 15 million tons for 20 years the provisionally calculated costs for this railway line can be met. After that the project shows a profit, that is, without any additional aspects involved on this railway line. The St. Croix project has, in other words, its limitations. When we come to the actual profit motive, the exporting of ore must be discontinued, because there are limitations in that specific region.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says they are advocating both schemes. This brings me to my next argument. Hon. members must now listen carefully. I say that it cannot be a Sishen-St. Croix project, i.e. a Saldanha project that is tackled on a long-term basis as hon. members opposite reason things out. I shall tell them why. It is a simple truth that the cost structure of this railway line, which we have in mind, increases so fantastically that if this Saldanha project is not tackled now, it will no longer be an economic proposition in four or five years&#x2019; time. We have no option in this. We must tackle this project now. I think our Government has given this matter very thorough consideration. In my humble opinion, and from what I have heard, the State has done everything in its power to obtain the best scientific knowledge and evidence before taking any decision. As I indicated at the beginning, four years elapsed before the Government actually made the final decision. I am convinced that under these circumstances our Government <span class="col_1101-1102" refersTo="page_0568"/>did make the correct decision, as the hon. the Minister announced at the end of last year. At the end of last year, I accompanied the hon. the Minister into that part of the world. I noticed that he is a person who is very fond of smoked mackerel. I want to tell him that I hope this matter will be concluded in the second half of this year. The people of this part of the world will be infinitely glad of that. I invite him in advance to come and have smoked mackerel with us when we celebrate the finalizing of the project.</p>

<p>I should like to tell the hon. member for Moorreesburg that I have learned to know him as a person who comes to this House with considered opinions, particularly when he speaks in an enlightened manner about the Coloureds. But I must tell him that he knows very little about the question of iron ore. He is badly informed about this, and he has got hold of the wrong end of the stick.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, South Africa&#x2019;s economy is for various reasons under severe pressure today. One of the visible indicators of imbalance in our economy is the alarming deficit which has developed in our trade balance. It has become a matter of urgency that our exports be increased. It has often been stressed, and I think it is fairly obvious, that the export of minerals is the key, in the short term, to solve this problem. South Africa&#x2019;s comparative massive devaluation and the realignment of world currencies will result in a steep increase in South Africa&#x2019;s cost structure.</p>

<p>I am quoting Cilli&#x00E9;, whom you do not understand.</p>

<p>Loans and imports from countries which did not revalue or devalue will immediately cost South Africa one-eighth more, while imports from hard currency countries will cost us anything up to one-fifth more.</p>

<p>South Africa requires a massive amount of capital for its development up to 1980. My hon. friend for Walmer touched on this, but I should like to elaborate on it. Before devaluation, Iscor announced that up to 1980 it would require in the region of R3 000 million for its development of the Newcastle plant and extensions to its existing plants at Vanderbijlpark and Pretoria. Escom estimated that it would require anything up to R2 000 million for extensions to its capital works. The completion of Richards Bay is going to call for hundreds of millions of rands. Vast sums of money will be required for the development of our railways, airways, harbours, roads, telecommunications, etc. Many hundreds of millions of rands will be required to complete the Orange River project. The introduction of television is going to cost the country hundreds of millions of rands. These are but the main projects that I have mentioned. South Africa is not yet in a position to generate sufficient capital to satisfy this astronomical demand. Vast sums of foreign capital would have to be borrowed to satisfy these demands. The realignment of currencies, as we have seen, has made foreign borrowings more expensive. Therefore it has become imperative that we should get our priorities straight.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. VAN Z. CILLI&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to tell that hon. member that this is where the men and boys are separated. He must go to the lobby and play marbles. Everybody agrees that our steel and power plants, our communication systems and all productive processes must keep pace with our needs. In the second place everybody agrees that our exports must be stepped up and that mineral exports are the obvious first choice in this regard. Everybody further agrees that the Saldanha Bay scheme is a bold one. It is a scheme which could revolutionize the economy of the Western Cape. We have never denied that. The Saldanha Bay scheme could provide a growth point for both our White and Coloured populations, which are growing fast. It is also a scheme which could provide, perhaps, the outlet for massive exports of iron ore during the 1980s and thereafter. Experts have differed widely, however, on the estimated cost of the Saldanha Bay scheme and on the expected date when it could become operational. Before devaluation, Iscor&#x2019;s experts estimated that this scheme would cost <span class="col_1103-1104" refersTo="page_0569"/>about R400 million and said that it would take five years to complete railway experts at the same time estimated that it would cost R600 million. Private marine and civil engineers have stated categorically that the Saldanha Bay project, vast as it is, will require eight to ten years to complete.</p>

<p>We all remember how the Government&#x2019;s original estimates for the Orange River project skyrocketed beyond control. I submit that, in view of the impetus which was given to inflation through our devaluation, the railways&#x2019; estimate of R600 million is a very modest one. I make bold to say that ultimately the cost of the Saldanha Bay scheme could escalate to R1 000 million or more. Furthermore, Iscor has not yet categorically stated that it has secured firm agreements for the export of iron ore which would ensure that this vast scheme would be economically viable. The St. Croix off-shore iron ore terminal should be complementary to that of the vast Saldanha Bay scheme. We have vigorously pleaded for this scheme on several occasions. If the hon. member for Moorreesburg would take the trouble of reading the debates on the Economic Vote last year he will notice that we spoke on this very same issue. We say that the cost of the St. Croix scheme is estimated to be less than R50 million and it could become operational within two and a half years. Initially it could have a capacity of ten million tons of iron ore per year but this could be increased. Apart from these facts I want to mention another virtue of the St. Croix scheme, namely that immediately it is in operation ore carriers of 150 000 tons could be accommodated. With a little extra expenditure carriers of 300 000 tons could be accommodated. With the Saldanha Bay scheme carriers of up to only 150 000 tons are visualized. It has been calculated that if the St. Croix scheme became operational in 1975, 10 million tons of iron ore p.a. could be exported via this scheme. This could rise to 14,9 million tons p.a. by 1980, which would earn during the period 1975 to 1980, R675 million in foreign exchange for the Republic. Should the Government, however, persist in blocking this scheme, manganese and iron ore would have to be shipped via Port Elizabeth harbour until the Saldanha Bay project is completed. The capacity of the existing installation at Port Elizabeth is about 4,5 million tons per annum, but with extensions this could be increased to just over six million tons per annum. The limiting factor, however, as the hon. member for Walmer has stressed, is the shallowness of the berth. Only ships of 40 000 tons and less are able to approach the berth for loading. It is common knowledge that in the international iron ore trade, carriers of 150 000 tons and more are in use. The bigger one can ship the lower the unit cost will be and in the case of St. Croix this will definitely apply. If the Saldanha Bay scheme becomes operative by 1980 or later, the export of iron ore ex the Port Elizabeth harbour would have earned R385 million less for South Africa than could have been earned had iron ore been shipped via St. Croix. If the iron ore is exported via St. Croix, it means that South Africa&#x2019;s earnings in foreign exchange would be boosted by R385 million. This would ease the chronic balance of payments situation. Foreign capital equal to the earnings need not be borrowed for capital development and a broad base for the export of iron ore would have been established by 1980. This would ensure the ultimate economic success of the multi-million Saldanha Bay scheme.</p>

<p>*However, another extremely important new factor has entered into this whole matter. It can be described as a technological revolution which has taken place on the railways. The heavy unit train which uses diesel traction has been introduced. Only some four years ago the railways were still working on the basis of steam trains which could transport 1 200 tons of ore at a time. But in 1972 the railways carried out a successful experiment with diesel locomotives and transported 9 600 tons of ore on one train. I want to emphasize again that the present railway system from Sishen to Port Elizabeth, with the present installation at Port Elizabeth harbour, can accommodate two trains of 100 trucks each and two trains of 50 trucks each every day. This means that 6,9 million tons of iron ore can be handled per year. On the other hand, if the St. Croix scheme is put into operation, the railway Administration will be able, with improvements on this line, to transport up to 17,5 million tons of iron ore per year. As regards St. Croix, the hon. member for Moorreesburg spoke scornfully of 15 million tons per year, but I want to tell the hon. member that St. Croix will definitely be able to handle up to 15 million tons per year. By that time the Saldanha Bay project could be completed and the bulk of the tonnage which would have to be exported, could go via that route. It <span class="col_1105-1106" refersTo="page_0570"/>seems as if this factor, i.e. the greater tractive power of the diesel units, will occupy the minds our experts and cause them to come to the decision that the vital growth point of the Western Cape should be created in some other way than by the tremendously expensive Saldanha Bay scheme.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. Leader of the House is aware that the iron ore dust emanating from the existing Port Elizabeth harbour installation is causing a serious and disturbing pollution and health hazard. This is happening within a radius of a few miles from the iron ore terminal. It was pointedly brought to his notice during his recent visit to Port Elizabeth. Even the buildings of the University of Port Elizabeth&#x2014;the hon. Leader is the chancellor of this university&#x2014;are being contaminated by the iron ore dust. Other representatives from Port Elizabeth and I have received many complaints and representations from householders who are being affected in this way. Attempts to contain the menace by spraying or building retaining walls are but patchwork and the only way in which it could be entirely eliminated, which would allow the Municipality of Port Elizabeth to develop the famous King&#x2019;s Beach area and the hon. the Minister of Community Development to redevelop the prestige South-End township, would be by the building of an iron ore terminal at St. Croix. The removal of the existing ore berth from the harbour would also provide immediate space for the urgently required extensions.</p>

<p>The point I wish to stress is that the Government could set in motion the necessary steps tomorrow for the construction of the St. Croix project, which would have a beneficial ripple effect on the whole of the South African economy. I plead with the hon. the Minister to review the matter once again, urgently, taking into consideration that there is a ceiling on the rate of expenditure which can be superimposed on our infra-structure and furthermore, considering the logical order of priorities, namely St. Croix, the cheap, immediate answer for the short term and Saldanha Bay, perhaps, the long-term, vastly expensive answer for the next and succeeding decades.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. HOON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when I listened to the pleas made by the hon. members for Walmer and Port Elizabeth Central, it seemed to me these hon. gentlemen were advocating an interim phase in the export of iron ore. They then hope to make this interim phase of theirs a permanent one; that is the conclusion we must draw from the word &#x201C;perhaps&#x201D; which the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central used here today.</p>

<p>Sir, the Eastern Cape members made a plea here today that the necessary facilities for exporting iron ore should be established at St. Croix, Port Elizabeth. The Western Cape members, specifically the hon. member for Moorreesburg, are very pleased that the Government has decided that a railway line will be constructed between Sishen and Saldanha and that the necessary facilities for ore exports will be established. Each of these regions sees in the export of ore through a particular harbour, new opportunities for development, new possibilities for the future, for their particular regions. We in the Northern Cape as well, where the ore comes from, would like to be put into the picture when the future possibilities of the ore industry are being considered and planned. We would also like to play a part, and have a share in the development possibilities presented by the ore industry with its tremendous potential. The Northern Cape and its people would like to derive the maximum benefit from the tremendous mineral wealth buried under its soil, but the Northern Cape and its people would like to see this wealth, this ore which is being mined, utilized to the best advantage of South Africa.</p>

<p>I, too; that is what I am advocating.</p>

<speech by="#hoon">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. HOON</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member, who is sitting there making a noise now, does not even know what I am going to advocate here; it could perhaps be in the interests of his region. But that is the typical United Party attitude.</p>

<p>Sir, last year we held a joint regional development association congress of considerable magnitude at Sishen. I think it was probably the biggest ever held in South Africa. Twelve development associations, represented by 400 delegates, convened here to consider the export, processing and utilization of the tremendous mineral wealth of this region. In addition, all the possibilities of future development which that implied for these regions and South Africa were discussed here. Although this congress was fully conversant with the possibilities of exporting ore through the <span class="col_1107-1108" refersTo="page_0571"/>harbour at Port Elizabeth and were fully aware of the existing railway facilities to Port Elizabeth and of the possible expansion of loading facilities at St. Croix, the congress unanimously resolved to request the Government to proceed with the Sishen-Saldanha project and to tackle and bring it to completion as rapidly as possible. Sir, I find it strange that the hon. member for Walmer should come to this House with this motion today. He probably has every right to have this motion discussed in this House and to put forward pleas for his region. However, I was under the impression that the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs eliminated all misunderstanding and any lack of clarity about this matter last year during the discussion of his Vote. Firstly the hon. the Minister, on behalf of the Government, gave Port Elizabeth the assurance last year that the ore exports through Port Elizabeth would not be prejudiced, and that they could even be expanded. I should like to quote the reassurance to Port Elizabeth given last year by the hon. the Minister. I am quoting from Hansard of 1st June, 1971 (column 7892)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But as the Government has now decided on the Sishen-Saldanha scheme, I should like to make the position very clear today, for it seems to me that there is some confusion in that regard as well. In the first instance, this does not mean that if the Sishen-Saldanha scheme is carried into effect, the existing exports through Port Elizabeth, which may be extended will be discontinued. In fact this is one of the conditions on which the Government agreed to the Saldanha scheme, namely that Port Elizabeth, with its exports, should not be prejudiced by this scheme. In other words, the exports going through Port Elizabeth at the moment, must be continued.</block>

<p>Secondly, the hon. the Minister made it very clear that it would not be economically justifiable for South Africa to tackle two ore export schemes simultaneously. I want to quote again from this same Hansard report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sir, personally I doubt whether South Africa can at this stage afford two schemes for the large-scale export of iron ore or minerals, i.e. schemes of the magnitude of the one envisaged in Saldanha. In the light of all these circumstances I think that, whereas the Saldanha scheme has now been decided upon, it goes without saying that the Saldanha scheme for the large-scale export of iron ore should be proceeded with, and that it would probably not be economically justifiable to bring about at the same time extensions to Port Elizabeth for the large-scale export of minerals.</block>

<p>Sir, I hope and trust that Port Elizabeth will be able to take its proper place in the future pattern of ore exports; that this area will also benefit from the envisaged ore export projects, but I want to ask them, since the hon. members from Port Elizabeth have been given these reassurances by the hon. the Minister, preferably to throw their weight in and help bring this vast Sishen-Saldanha project, with which much progress has already been made, to completion. Sir, we in the Northern Cape were delighted when it was announced by the Government during December of last year that it had been decided that Iscor should continue to call for tenders for the construction of the Sishen-Saldanha project. We took that as a sign that great progress had already been made with the construction of the project. I should like to quote from <i>Iscor News</i> of January, 1972, in which the general manager of Iscor, Mr. J. P. Coetzee, made the following announcement. He said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The aim is to put the scheme into operation at the beginning of 1976, and for two to three years to build up production gradually to the required target of 15 million tons, as set by the Government. The exchange earnings from 15 million tons will be in the region of R107 million per annum, but five million tons of cast iron and semi-processed steel products could earn as much as R400 million per annum.</block>

<p>Sir, I should like to repeat this; The currency earnings from 15 million tons will be in the region of R107 million per annum: this is crude ore, but five million tons of cast iron and semi-processed steel products could earn as much as R400 million per annum. You will note, Sir, that Mr. Coetzee makes mention here of five million tons of cast iron and semi-processed steel products which will earn a further annual amount of R400 million for South Africa. I am pleased to be able to deduce <span class="col_1109-1110" refersTo="page_0572"/>from this that a great deal of attention is already being given to the refining process of iron ore. I think that this would constitute far greater benefits for South Africa than giving attention now to a second ore export project.</p>

I should like to point out to the hon. members from Port Elizabeth that if we could proceed with the purification of iron ore at the mining source, at Sishen, Port Elizabeth would be able to play its role, in this and also in future phases, in exporting this refined ore.</p>

<p>According to geologists there is approximately 4 500 million tons of high-grade iron ore in the Sishen-Postmasburg area, i.e. ore with an iron content of 65 per cent, which is economically exploitable, which is suitable for export and for processing in our domestic foundries. It is this ore which the hon. members from Port Elizabeth would like to export through St. Croix. However, it is alleged by geologists that there are still far greater quantities, millions upon millions of tons, of low-grade ore available, ore which is not economically suitable for export or for transportation to domestic foundries. Most of this low-grade ore is handled during the mining of the high-grade ore. It is also known that plus-minus 25 per cent of every ton of high-grade ore which is mined and trimmed for transportation to an ore export harbour or to our domestic foundries is wasted. This waste product has an iron content of 25 to 58 per cent. I should like to make a plea here today for the utilization of this low-grade iron ore, which is lost as a result of mining methods during the mining of high-grade ore. I should like to see it being utilized. To utilize this waste ore and to prevent huge dumps still containing large quantities of iron from lying waste, we are asking the Government to give urgent consideration to the establishment of an ore pre-processing or refining process at Sishen, the mining source. To give you an idea, Sir, of the quantity of ore which goes to waste, I want you to consider the following figures. When the envisaged projects become a reality&#x2014;and we hope that this will happen soon&#x2014;the estimated quantity of iron ore which will be mined annually for domestic consumption and for export will be as follows: Plus-minus 15 million tons will be required for export, and plus-minus 10 million tons for domestic consumption. To make the aforesaid quantities of high-grade ore available means that an annual quantity of plus-minus 35 million tons has to be mined. Approximately 10 million tons goes to waste in the mining and production of that ore. If one makes a conservative estimate and says that this waste has an iron content of 30 per cent it means that 3 million tons of iron is going to waste annually here at the mining source. Then the low-grade ore and the ribbon ore has not yet been included in the calculation. Why should we not use this ore if ore in Europe with an iron content of 25 per cent to 30 per cent is being used there for the manufacture of steel&#x003F; I therefore want to make a plea to the hon. the Minister to give immediate attention to this important matter and to incorporate it into the envisaged facilities which have to be established in the Saldanha-Sishen project, to establish the necessary facilities for crushing the low-grade ore and waste, refining it mechanically and compressing it into pellets, and to establish blast-furnace facilities here at Sishen where this refined low-grade ore and waste can be converted into cast iron with an iron content of plus-minus 98 per cent. I think that we could succeed in processing this waste product, which is being lost at present, in such a way that it could be <span class="col_1111-1112" refersTo="page_0573"/>utilized in the interests of our country. Then we would be achieving far more than to give attention to two ore export harbours, and we would be using the waste to create a product which is easy and economical to transport. This refined product could be transported from Sishen on existing or new railway lines to existing foundries in the interior, and this refined product could then be exported to earn a tremendous amount of foreign exchange for South Africa in overseas countries. This refining of waste ore could create avenues of employment in the far Northern Cape and attract White initiative to this unspoilt and healthy part of South Africa. Avenues of employment could be created for Bantu workers from the neighbouring Tswanaland, and they can return to their homes over week-ends. Such a refining process at Sishen could create a new frame of mind among the people living in this region. Sir, we in the Northern Cape have begun to feel like a milch-cow. Our cream, our riches, are time and again being carted away to other areas to bring prosperity and development to those areas. Such a refining process at Sishen could stimulate our ideals in the Northern Cape and we would be able to conceive of a new dynamic line of development stretching from a West Coast harbour at Saldanha, through Namaqualand, the North West, the lower and central Orange, Postmasburg, Kuruman and Vryburg, and we would even like to see this line extending into the Western Transvaal. Such a refining process at Sishen could enable us to utilize every particle of our country&#x2019;s riches in the interests of South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker, we have heard this afternoon from that side of the House the lyrical&#x2014;that is to say, the theatrical&#x2014;and we have now had the theoretical. One would not think, when one listens to the conduct of the debate from the other side of the House, that we were discussing a most urgent matter of a choice between two projects which are of vital importance to this country. We are discussing priorities and these priorities can only be discussed against the hard background of facts. It is all very well to speak lyrically of the advantages of developing Saldanha. We would go along with the arguments of the hon. member for Moorreesburg on those grounds, and I would go along with about a quarter of the arguments of the hon. member for Kuruman on the benefits of refining. However, the problem is a little more complicated than he thinks. There are certain aspects of the process of refining, the cost of refining and the marketing of refined ores, which he has not taken into account, but theoretically he has made a case. But neither of these hon. members has contributed to this debate anything on the vital issue which has been brought before us again this afternoon, i.e. what choice shall we make and when shall we make it. This is what the debate is about and I propose to return to this main issue.</p>

<p>It is a truism that development in this country must proceed at a very rapid rate if we are going to satisfy the needs of our growing population. There is no question that this country will have to produce for the people of South Africa in the next 25 to 30 years eight times as much as is being produced today. This is because we are now in a state of geometric doubling. That is to say, one does not multiply arithmetically; when you look at the doubling effect of the population you have to look at the geometric doubling effect, which means that in every ten years or so, or even eight years, you get a doubling of demand and consequently you need more than a doubling of production. This means also that in the next three decades&#x2014;we are already in the first one&#x2014;South Africa will have to produce more than it has produced in the previous three centuries of its existence. This is a grave challenge, and there is no question that South Africa will need every resource that can be harnessed and every port which can be made available. The South African coastline is not very kind to us in the matter of ports. It is an intractable coastline. We have a limited number of deep indentations in our coastline indentations which can be turned to practical account as ports. There can be no question in anyone&#x2019;s mind that South Africa within the next 25 years will have to start developing every single port possibility along the South African coastline. There can be no question about that. Therefore, those who say that we must think in terms of alternatives between St. Croix and Saldanha, those who have said on that side of the House that South Africa cannot afford two ore ports, are taking a short-term view; they do not realize what the enormous demands in this country, the enormous pressures on us to export, will be within our lifetime, within the lifetime of people in this House, within the next 20, 25 years.</p>

<p><span class="col_1113-1114" refersTo="page_0574"/>We will need every port. It is not a question of accepting one port and discarding another; it is a question of determining the priorities in terms of time. These are the matters with which I wish to deal this afternoon against a hard background of facts.</p>

<p>The first thing which must be taken into very serious account is our economic situation. Is there anyone in this House who has any doubt at all that South Africa is gravely embarrassed, is gravely endangered by its growing trade deficit&#x003F; Can anyone deny this or challenge this&#x003F; Can anyone deny that South Africa must take major and urgent steps to correct this trend&#x003F;</p>

<p>Does anyone deny that the South African export performance at present is abysmally poor&#x003F; Our exports have hardly grown at all over the last three or four years. As against that our imports have soared. We cannot go on like this. We have been pleading that there should be an active export programme, that we must harness every export resource which is available to South Africa, and the case has been made over and over in this House and outside that the only immediate availability for rapid export expansion is our highly developed mineral industry. These new minerals which we can produce in such large quantities are in fact bulk exports and our problem is, of course, the infra-structure&#x2014;the railways and the harbours.</p>

<p>Another element has come into the equation and that is devaluation in December. Devaluation, the hon. the Minister of Finance said on Monday, gives a breathing space or a new opportunity. We all understand that devaluation does or can give a new opportunity, provided you use it. The benefit it offers is of short duration. There are trade equalization factors at work on the international economic scene all the time by means of which the temporary advantages of our nation <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> another are equalized out. We have domestically an inflation problem which may also very quickly eliminate the currency advantage which devaluation has temporarily conferred on us. Therefore, if we are going to correct these things, these great dangers of which I have been talking, and use devaluation to do it, above all we must move fast. We must act quickly.</p>

<p>Which of these two export points gives us the best opportunity of moving fast, of curing our economic weakness, of expanding our export possibilities&#x003F; I will deal with these two ports from this point of view because this is what is relevant in this debate and nothing else&#x2014;not the scenery, not the charm of the Boland, nothing but this question of saving our economy from disaster. We shall give marks and points to the other questions later, but this is urgent and comes first. Let us look at the first of three aspects, the three vital aspects, with which I shall deal in turn. The first is the question of the capital required for port development; the second is the question of what contracts are available to pay and to enable us to make use of these ports and the third one is the question of time scales. I shall deal with these three aspects which to my mind are the only things which are really decisive at this stage. I emphasize &#x201C;at this stage&#x201D;. We know from the exponents of the St. Croix project, who have done detailed costing and have not been shy about publishing their costs &#x2014;and they are backed by the opinions of some of the best consulting engineers in this country and outside it&#x2014;that the cost of developing the off-shore loading harbour at St. Croix will be of the order of R47 million. The railway development is already proceeding. Through dieselization and the modernization of the railways we know that the tonnages which are envisaged&#x2014;these tonnages are practical and realistic in terms of contracts available-can be carried by the railways from the Sishen area to the Algoa area without additional outlay above what is now envisaged. Therefore the basic cost, including the tugs and ancillary services, is R47 million. This is a capital sum which we can readily envisage for the sake of what it will do for us, even in our present capital-tight situation in South Africa.</p>

<p>The cost of the Saldanha Bay exercise is not known. The figures which have been quoted are vague to the point of embarrassment. A figure of R400 million has been quoted by Iscor. A figure of R600 million has been quoted by the top authorities of the South African railways. Both these figures are pre-devaluation figures. I mention &#x201C;pre-devaluation&#x201D; because of the erosion of the rand on the one hand and the higher cost of loans from abroad on the other. The hon. Minister of Finance was asked in this House this afternoon what the additional cost is <span class="col_1115-1116" refersTo="page_0575"/>in respect of our existing foreign loans on account of devaluation. The additional cost on account of devaluation, the higher price we have to pay in repayment of these loans, is over R100 million. The total amount of loans outstanding abroad is smaller than the amount which Iscor expects to borrow in order to put in hand the Saldanha project. Therefore, to any pre-devaluation figure that you mention, you have to add at least R100 million in terms of what the hon. the Minister of Finance has told us this afternoon.</p>

<p>Iscor is already very heavily involved. Dr. Tom Muller, the Chairman, said not more than a fortnight ago that they were planning an increase of production, that is to say an increase of steel mill production which has nothing whatsoever to do with Saldanha. He was essentially referring to the areas of Newcastle, Vanderbijlpark, and Pretoria. This expansion is going to cost the country in its first phase, which runs from 1976 to 1977, R1 100 million. Phase two, which they hope to complete by 1982, will cost another R2 000 million. That means a total of R3 100 million will be spent on the expansion of steel production plant other than any moneys which may be required for the development of Saldanha or for the steel mills which hon. members opposite speak of in conjunction with Saldanha. These are colossal sums; these are staggering sums. We welcome the forward-looking nature of the predictions and the projections made by Iscor. This shows imagination, but while they are contemplating such schemes, they are at the same time pressing for the rapid development of a harbour at Saldanha&#x2014; which, strictly speaking, is not necessary now as I will show in a moment&#x2014;at a cost, I venture to predict to the hon. Minister, of R1 000 million. I hope the hon. Minister will in due course have time to confirm the amount involved in the development of Saldanha. There are authorities, engineering and development authorities in this country, who agree with my figure. Let us accept that a figure of between R700 million and R1 000 million will be needed for the Saldanha project as against the cost of R47 million which will be involved in the development of the St. Ooix harbour. If we have regard to the capital shortages in this country and the high cost of borrowing money abroad and the fact that the cost of borrowing money abroad will in the last resort inevitably fall back on the taxpayer, this is a very large and a very dangerous proposition we are looking at. We have looked at the capital situation, but this capital situation only becomes realistic when you look at the contracts. It is argued that the Saldanha scheme must be implemented quickly and that it must have preference. What, in fact, is the contractual position&#x003F; The hon. the Minister has said, and it has recently been confirmed by Dr. Tom Muller, that Saldanha needs 15 million tons of ore per year to start. Starting at 15 million tons of ore a year, the Saldanha Bay scheme would be expanded to handle 25 million tons a year in due course. Dr. Tom Muller said this on the 21st January, 1972. The hon. the Minister will remember that he has used the same figure, namely 15 million tons. What are the export prospects at the moment&#x003F; The steel industry has suffered a major setback. The Japanese and European steel industries are reducing their output in consequence of the American devaluation and the American adjustment of its trade relationships. This information comes from Japan and from the European Coal and Steel Community. These are the two major potential purchasers of iron ore in the world. The Japanese now contemplate that in view of existing contracts already signed, they will be able to contract with South Africa for approximately 5 million tons in each of the years 1975 to 1977. It must be remembered that Iscor wants 15 million tons to make Saldanha a viable proposition. As I have said, Japan wants 5 million tons a year during the years 1975 to 1977. The Coal and Steel Community wants 1,5 million tons. This is a total of 6,5 million tons a year. From 1978 to 1979 Japan wants 6 million tons and the European Coal and Steel Community wants 2 million tons. The figures rise to 16 million tons in the early eighties. We do not have these contracts yet. These are merely potential contracts. It is quite clear that we cannot obtain the contracts in the world today to justify the building of a part which needs a base of 15 million tons. What we can justify is the building of an off-shore loading terminal which can handle flexibly tonnages rising from 5 to 15 million tons, transported on lines which the railways have available or will soon have available. The contracts for these amounts are virtually signed. They are ready. This is what we have and this is what this Government is turning down through its attitude on Saldanha.</p>

<p><span class="col_1117-1118" refersTo="page_0576"/>Let us assume that the Government had a change of heart and saw realistically what this country needs in its dire economic position. It is calculated that if St. Croix is put in hand immediately, it will be ready by 1975, that the contracts will go forward, and that the additional earnings over and above what is now being exported through Port Elizabeth will be R387 million during 1975 to 1980. This is virtually a guaranteed additional income. Can this country afford to do without R387 million in additional earnings&#x003F; It will not earn this amount through Saldanha. I assure this House with the utmost sincerity that we will not earn this money through Saldanha before 1980. It cannot be done.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by making an appeal to the hon. the Minister. We wish to say to him that we have nothing whatsoever against the development of Saldanha. We are for it. We think that it is essential that this should be done. However, we ask him to take account of the dire economic situation of this country, of the hard arguments weighed one against the other, St. Croix against Saldanha, in terms of time and the South African necessities. That is all we ask. If he will agree to give the green light to this ore-loading project, to save our economy in an hour of need, Sir, he can count on this side of the House to support him all the way on the eventual development of Saldanha. We see great merit in this; however, we see no merit in getting the priorities wrong and doing severe damage to the economy of this country.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the motion introduced by the hon. member for Walmer reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House urgently requests the Government to consider the advisability of granting its consent and support for the project of an outer sea wharf for unloading ore at St. Croix.</block>

<p>I must say at the outset that the Government has already given its attention to this matter. I was impressed by the enthusiasm with which the hon. members for that region championed their cause. That is why it is a great pity to have to say that this matter has been finalized and that the Government has resolved otherwise. The hard facts of the matter are that the Government has on two occasions studied, investigated and discussed this question in considerable detail. I should like to give this House the assurance that the resolutions adopted in this case were not adopted superficially but that they were adopted in me light of all the technical advice the Government had at its disposal, and after the entire matter had on various occasions been considered by a special committee appointed for the purpose. In the light of all these circumstances, the Government decided that only one scheme should be tackled for the large-scale export of iron ore, and that scheme should be at Saldanha. I am saying this right at the outset so that hon. members can know in what direction I am going to steer my discussion when I motivate this matter and furnish the grounds on which this Government took this decision.</p>

<p>Honestly, in the light of the circumstances, it serves no purpose to give further consideration now to St. Croix. However, I want to add that circumstances may perhaps at a later stage be different. Hon. members all know that in its latest resolution the Government laid down that when tenders are received by Iscor, the Government should again be consulted in regard to the tender prices. When these are submitted to the Government, the Government will see to what extent these are excessive or tremendously high, as the hon. gentleman predicted here this afternoon. As in the case of any person building a dam, constructing a building or planning any scheme whatsoever, it is always his prerogative when calling for tenders to decide not to proceed with the scheme if the tenders are too high. This frequently happens. The Government would like to play a part in considering those tenders. If it appears that the tenders are completely excessive and too high, and that the scheme cannot be proceeded with for that reason, then the Government may decide not to proceed with the scheme. In such a case the matter will be open again and we can return to the consideration of St. Croix.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Let us leave it at that for the time being. I shall come in a moment to how long it is expected this scheme will take to complete. As I said just now, I appreciate the efforts made by the hon. members from Port Elizabeth and vicinity in advocating that this scheme be developed there. However, a scheme of this nature has far wider implications than just <span class="col_1119-1120" refersTo="page_0577"/>those. It has far wider implications than merely to take the development and the interests of a particular part of our country into consideration. I do not want to create the impression now that hon. members on the opposite side are short-sighted and do not see the situation in its entirety, but the fact of the matter is that a person is influenced by his environment. I should therefore like to request that we take the wider interests of South Africa into consideration when we consider this matter. When these two possibilities were initially mooted, hon. members did not adopt the attitude they have now adopted. Then they were opposed to the Saldanha project. The private organization which was a great advocate of the development of St. Croix was also hostile to the Saldanha project and said that it should rather be built at St. Croix. But subsequently the Opposition changed their tune. Subsequently the merits of the Saldanha project appeared to be greater than those of St. Croix. The possibilities of the Sishen-Saldanha project do not terminate at some stage or other in the future, but become greater and greater. When the United Party realized that the merits of this project were so great, they decided to change their tactics. They then decided to say what they again told us today, i.e. that they are in favour of Saldanha as well, but that an interim scheme should be established at St. Croix.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am not making a political issue out of it. The hon. member seems to be obsessed with politics, and that is why he is sitting there. I am stating the facts. This is what actually happened in this case. I want to go on to prove that even today, although they have said that they are not opposed to the Saldanha scheme, each one of them is still advancing arguments as to why the Saldanha project should not be proceeded with. Each of the hon. members on the opposite side who spoke, advanced arguments as to why the Saldanha project cannot be proceeded with. Last year I made an announcement in regard to the Saldanha project, and we then had a discussion on the matter. I should just like to remind hon. members that the estimated costs of the project at the time were put at R328 million. Recently we have been talking about R400 million because we have realized that there have in the meantime been cost increases and that the final amount will be more. I do not want to mention the merits of the Saldanha project again, for I did that last year, but while this motion is before the House it is nevertheless necessary for me to touch upon certain aspects of the matter.</p>

<p>In the first place, I think it is necessary that we ask ourselves whether two schemes of such vast magnitude can be carried out in South Africa. I think that hon. members on the opposite side, as well as the hon. member for Walmer who introduced this motion, proved convincingly in the House that the two schemes cannot be tackled simultaneously. We simply cannot afford two schemes of this magnitude at this stage. The statement made by hon. members that St. Croix will only cost R47 million must be complete nonsense. I shall deal with the costs in a moment, but if one were to develop the Sishen-Port Elizabeth line so that it could carry more than 15 million tons per annum, it begins to become more expensive than Saldanha. In any case, it is not possible to carry more than 15 million tons a year. As development on the Port Elizabeth line takes place, the transport of ore will be excluded to an increasing extent, so that one will gradually have to taper off in respect of ores, and will eventually be heading for a cul-de-sac.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Walmer objected to the many obligations the railways have. He mentioned a few examples, and mentioned all the places where the railways has to undertake construction work, and said how much this was going to cost the railway s. Why did he present that argument&#x003F; Why did he mention that it is costing the railways so many millions to build railway lines in South Africa&#x003F; What one has to conclude from that, is that it is already costing a great deal. How could we in these circumstances still tackle two schemes&#x003F; How could we spend R93 million on the improvement of the railway line between Sishen and Port Elizabeth, and at the same time work on another project&#x003F;</p>

<block name="quote">Preference was then given to Saldanha Bay over the St. Croix scheme, specifically because the carrying capacity of the Port Elizabeth line would have had to be increased tremendously.

<p>This R93 million is only in respect of the railway line which has to be improved. It does not even include rolling stock, which has still to be included in the calculation, and will probably cost an additional R80 million. Let us finish dealing with this matter here. If this R90 million has to be spent on the railway line, R47 million on the wharf and R80 million on additional rolling stock and what goes wtih it, the Port Elizabeth scheme, according to this estimate a year ago&#x2014;I am adding nothing for the increase in costs which has taken place in the meantime&#x2014; would already have cost R220 million. These are not my figures; I obtained them from the Minister of Transport. The figure of R47 million for building the wharf was given to me by the hon. member for Von Brandis. That is, after all, his figure. I do not have the additional figures with me now, but there is still rolling stock which has to be purchased to carry that additional load.</p>

<p>Yes, but surely the hon. member cannot, because I want to purchase it for Saldanha, wish to use it on the Port Elizabeth line. I must purchase it for Saldanha, and it is included in the R400 million. [Interjection.] Of course it is included. The hon. member has been interrupting me a little now, but the fact of the matter in respect of rolling stock is that you need far less rolling stock for the Saldanha scheme for the same load quantity, because the turn-round time is calculated to be only half, or less than half of turn-round time in respect of the Sishen-Port Elizabeth line. I said we should consider whether we could tackle that. I also said that hon. members on that side&#x2014;all of them&#x2014;advanced arguments which indicated to me that we could not do so because we could not afford it.

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It depends on what the hon. member wants. If the hon. member wants to lay out St. Croix and wants us to export only 5 or 10 million tons per annum through St. Croix, then it will of course be cheaper, but we are not geared to the export of ore on a small scale here, we are geared to the export of ore on a large scale, whether we are going to export it through St. Croix or through Saldanha. We must meet the need, which the hon. member for Von Brandis mentioned here, which exists for us to promote our exports. After all, it is of no use tackling a scheme by means of which we could export a few million tons of ore when the possibility of a scheme exists by means of which we could export 15 million tons per annum, which could be expanded to 25 or 30 million tons. [Interjections.] Hon. members must give me a chance; my time is very limited. Sir, the hon. member for Walmer refers us to all the obligations Iscor has, and the hon. member for Von Brandis did the same. What do they mean by that&#x003F; Why do they point out to us all the financial obligations Iscor has&#x003F; To my mind this is the first indication that we may perhaps be able to tackle one scheme, but not two. The Cabinet arrived at the conclusion to which hon. members on that side also, by implication, arrived this afternoon, i.e. that South Africa cannot afford to tackle two such large schemes, and therefore had to <span class="col_1123-1124" refersTo="page_0579"/>make a choice between the two. The Cabinet made that choice, taking a few factors into consideration. The export harbour and the scheme which is constructed for the exporting of iron ore, must in the first place serve to export iron ore. The proposed scheme, as the hon. member for Von Brandis correctly stated, is a scheme which in the initial stages will be able to handle 15 million tons per annum, in other words it must be constructed in such a way that when it comes into operation it will be able to handle 15 million tons. The hon. member for Von Brandis kicked up a great fuss about the fact that we might not get the contracts. Sir, it is true that we do not have the contracts yet. The hon. member mentioned other contracts which private organizations have; that may be the case. Two conditions were laid down when the decision was taken to proceed with the construction of the Sishen-Saldanha railway line. The one condition was that the exports going through Port Elizabeth would continue to go through Port Elizabeth, that these exports could not be taken away there, for doing so would of course be prejudicial to the economy of that line and the harbour works, etc. The other condition was that the Sishen-Saldanha railway line would also have to be made available for the transportation of other goods and for its use by other organizations for ore exports if necessary. If the hon. member for Von Brandis has so many contracts, he can come and discuss the matter of a tariff with us when the Saldanha scheme has been completed, and then he can export through Saldanha.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central referred to the ocean depth at Saldanha. He was not correct when he spoke about the depth of the ocean at Saldanha. The technical experts have assured us that Saldanha, although it is not deep enough, can be dredged and made deep enough for the biggest ships we would like to use. Consequently that argument does not hold water. But what I want to emphasize is that we must not commit ourselves to a course here of exporting only iron ore in perpetuity. The greatest aim in this whole exercise must be to be able to export semi-processed products. We could build blast furnances.</p>

<p>I do not want to venture now into the realm of saying whether it will be in Saldanha or at Sishen, but we could build blast furnaces and we could prepare ourselves to export cast iron, or whatever there is a demand for. It is becoming a very popular idea in Europe, in Japan and other parts of the world, where atmospheric pollution is becoming a major problem, that they would prefer not to import ore but semi-processed products. In that lies the great idea behind this exercise. We must have those opportunities, when we carry this exercise into effect, so that we can export far less in bulk in the form of semi-processed products instead of these millions of tons of ore. Let us tell our clients that they must prepare themselves for our exporting not only ore, but for our also wanting the benefit of processing the iron ore in South Africa. With a view to these possibilities there is not really any choice between the two projects, because, as I said a moment ago, Saldanha opens up future possibilities while Port Elizabeth does the opposite.</p>

<p>If one asks the question of whether we can afford two, the answer is: &#x201C;No, it has to be one.&#x201D; If one then comes to the question of where the greatest future long-term possibilities lie, with a view to the processing of iron ore into semi-processed products, one must conclude that the possibilities lie with the Saldanha scheme and that the possibilities of the Port Elizabeth scheme are scant. There are various factors which the Cabinet took into consideration. In the first place I want to refer to the harbour.</p>

<p>When we considered this problem at the beginning of last year, and again at the end of last year, the harbour facilities were of course a major and important consideration. Saldanha is a very naturally suited harbour, not just as it is at the moment, but a breakwater is still to be built to keep out the waves which may perhaps be dangerous, and the experts tell us that there is not the least danger there that a half-loaded ship will have to be removed from its berth because weather conditions are such that loading activities cannot be proceeded with. But this is a very great possibility at St. Croix. Although the hon. members allege that all the tests in regard to wave and wind conditions at Port Elizabeth were successful, I say that that is unfortunately not the case. Let me now tell you why I say that this is not the case. The tests at Saldanha are much more advanced than those at Port Elizabeth. On 9th February, 1970 a letter was written to the Secretary for Industries by Mr. Zwamborn, the chief of the hydraulics research institute, attached to the C.S.I.R., <span class="col_1125-1126" refersTo="page_0580"/>and he wrote as follows to the Secretary for Industries &#x2026;</p>

<p>9th February, 1970. This was about two years ago, but you will see that it makes no difference. It could just as well have been written at the present time, for nothing has been done since then. He wrote as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Because the scheme is in many aspects unique &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is the scheme at Port Elizabeth&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; existing knowledge and data has to be extrapolated in order to find answers to many of the problems. In general the Soros approach is a sound one, and the extrapolations have been carried out in a reasonably responsible way. However, extrapolations and predictions of expected weather conditions remain a very risky venture, as appears from the experience in Tasmania, where a year after the construction of the berthing facilities, wave conditions were twice as bad as had been expected. As has already been mentioned, the availability percentage has been kept reasonably conservative by Soros, but since the loading facilities are virtually unprotected, an increase in average wave heights and wind velocities could reduce the percentages drastically. But the available local wind observations &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is at the Swartkops River mouth&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; as well as the wave observations cover a period of only one to two years, and consequently the possibility should be taken into account that during a specific year conditions could be much worse. It is also deemed absolutely essential that as a result of the sensitiveness of the scheme to weather conditions, statistical data on wind and waves should be available over a period of at least three years, but preferably five.</block>

<p>These are highly technical people supplying this information. He goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As has already been mentioned, the handling of very large ships is one of the most important aspects of the scheme. However, this is not dealt with in any great detail in the Soros proposals. To study the local wave conditions at St. Croix, a model study should be made, as was recommended by Soros. In my opinion the model study would have to include tests with model ships in order to determine whether mooring is in fact possible with the wave position as accepted by Soros. These model tests are complicated and could take up a great deal of time because the model techniques have not yet been fully developed. The handling of ships at St. Croix will also be made very difficult since the prevailing wind direction is west south-west, almost directly in line with the prevailing wave direction.</block>

<p>In the light of these circumstances I cannot accept that, as the hon. member said here, the Port Elizabeth scheme has been properly tested and shown to be possible. That is not the case. I must rather accept what Mr. Zwamborn said here, i.e. that in these circumstances it is essential that tests should first be made.</p>

<p>As far as Saldanha is concerned, the C.S.I.R. built a model, which is in Pretoria at the moment, and hon. members can go and have a look at it if they wish. The necessary tests are being carried out there with a view to the Saldanha scheme. This is all I want to say about harbours.</p>

<p>As far as the railway lines are concerned, a matter which the Cabinet also had to consider, I must say, to begin with that the St. Croix scheme railway line will be approximately 20 per cent longer than that of Saldanha, because Port Elizabeth is about 20 per cent further from Sishen than Saldanha. The gradient is also a very important factor. The hon. member spoke with great praise of the jumbo trains which are being used. The Saldanha gradient, as the hon. member for Moorreesburg said, is one in 250 to Saldanha and one in 100 for the empty train on its return. This jumbo train, which we read about in the newspapers&#x2014;the hon. member for Walmer had a photograph of the train&#x2014;which ran to Port Elizabeth, was hauled by six locomotives with one on stand-by. This made it, in truth, seven. On the Saldanha railway line four locomotives will be able to pull the same number of trucks which will carry the same quantity of ore with great ease. In regard to this aspect of the gradient, it is therefore no problem to make <span class="col_1127-1128" refersTo="page_0581"/>a choice between Saldanha and Port Elizabeth.</p>

<p>In regard to the cost factor, to which I referred briefly a moment ago, I repeat that the estimated costs for St. Croix amount to R220 million&#x2014;this cannot be only in respect of wharf facilities, but must also include the railway lines. At present it is expected that the cost in respect of Saldanha, as calculated and made available to me, will amount to approximately R400 million. This R400 million includes not only the harbour, the railway lines and the rolling stock, but also the mining development necessary to mine the ore.</p>

<p>If one regards this matter from a long-term point of view, and you have to choose one of the two, I think there will be agreement on the conclusion which the Cabinet arrived at. And if you have to choose between the two and you take South Africa&#x2019;s interests in general into account, and if you consider the long-term aspects&#x2014;the possibility of blast furnaces somewhere along the line; the possibility of processing the ore; the possibility of the future export of refined ores&#x2014;one cannot but choose the Saldanha scheme, as the Government has in fact done.</p>

<p>The St. Croix scheme has a few short-term advantages. It may be possible to complete it a little sooner than the Saldanha scheme; that is perhaps possible. However, if the tests at sea in regard to the St. Croix scheme still have to be made, I doubt whether it will be possible to finalize this scheme sooner. It is the intention of Iscor that this Saldanha scheme must be completed within a period of four to five years.</p>

<p>There is another factor which was of course taken into account by the Government, and that is that with the Saldanha scheme a particular growth-point will be created in the Western Cape, where a growth-point is really needed. The creation of such a growth-point is important, particularly at this moment, with a view to the position of the Western Cape in respect of the E.E.C., etc. It is important to point out this aspect. Recently Dr. Hupkes compiled particulars for the Federale group in regard to the Coloured population of the Western Cape. He indicated therein how much more rapidly the Coloured population was increasing than the Whites, and to what extent the proportion of Coloured to Whites was mounting. He arrived at the conclusion that there would probably be a half million unemployed Coloureds in the Western Cape by the year 2000. As far as the Sishen-Saldanha scheme is concerned, or rather, as far as a large-scale ore export scheme is concerned, this is to my mind an act of faith. To my mind this is as great an act of faith as the establishment of the first Iscor. There were doomsayers at that time as well. At that time there were also those who said that we could not afford the scheme, and that it was too big, as the hon. members said here again today. To my mind this is an act of faith, and with a view to the future this is the scheme we must tackle. I hope that since the Government has now taken this decision, we will put an end to these little squabbles among ourselves. Let us focus our attention on this great scheme, with the tremendous prospect it offers.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister concluded by telling us what great confidence he had in this act of faith on the part of the Government in wanting to tackle the Sishen-Saldanha Bay railway line. I just find it strange that there should be one act of faith that will be great benefit to a specific part of the Cape, while acts of faith for the rest of the province, which need them so badly, are of lesser importance. I think the hon. the Minister is quite wrong in wanting to approach it from that point of view. If he approaches it from the point of view of what is necessary to create a growth point in the Western Province, then I think he is making a big mistake. If it is necessary to create growth points, then growth points are also truly needed in the Eastern Cape. This is so under these circumstances, because without being parochial I must nevertheless say that the Western Province is much better off than the Eastern Cape in that respect. Therefore the hon. the Minister cannot come along and tell us that it is an act of faith to create such a big growth point in the Western Province. The hon. the Minister said that the original advocates of the St. Croix scheme had amended their tactics, because earlier on they were opposed to the Saldanha Bay scheme. I now want to tell the hon. gentleman that he is quite wrong. He is altogether wrong, and I am already going to quote to him what the advocates of the St. Croix scheme were <span class="col_1129-1130" refersTo="page_0582"/>saying a long while back. Since then they have again drawn up a document, and I believe this to be in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s hands. I have here the first document they drafted. I shall quote what they stated in paragraph 6 on page 2:</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member knows who they are, they are Consolidated African Mines and others who were in favour of it. They state, and I quote:</p>

<block name="quote">It seems therefore that advantage should be taken of the short and medium-term economies of the Port Elizabeth scheme by proceeding with it as a first step in the ore export programme. At a later stage when growth in the volume of the ore trade justifies Saldanha, this could then be phased in to provide continuity.</block>

<p>That is what they said. There was never an idea of the Saldanha Bay scheme being abhorrent to the champions of the St. Croix scheme. The hon. the Minister is creating the impression here that the St. Croix scheme must also include the railway line costs and so on. Just imagine the two schemes for yourself; the distances traversed by the railway lines to these two places differ by only about 50 miles. At the one at Port Elizabeth a railway line has already been established. At Saldanha there is no such railway line and the harbour also still has to be built. At Port Elizabeth only an off-loading quay has to be built, because there is already a Rall link. The hon. the Minister tried to prove here that the St. Croix scheme would actually be just as expensive as the Saldanha scheme. That is the impression the hon. the Minister wanted to create here. But what are the true facts of the matter&#x003F; The hon. gentleman referred here to the Minister of Transport. On 5th August, 1970 the hon. the Minister of Transport replied, <i>inter alia,</i> as follows to a speech the hon. member for Walmer made about this scheme (Hansard, volume 29, col. 1150)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The hon. member for Walmer raised the question of the St. Croix scheme.</block>

<p>And in passing that is also a reply to the hon. member for Moorreesburg, who said here that the hon. member for Walmer had never opened his mouth about this matter, and that he now wants to make politics out of it.</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>But listen now to what the Minister of Transport said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I may say in passing that, in the nature of things, I have a very soft spot for Port Elizabeth.</block>

<p>Then he continues and comes to the next point&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Cabinet has, however, considered this matter very thoroughly and they came to the conclusion that it would be in the interests of the country to support the Saldanha scheme instead of the St. Croix scheme. I do not want to go into details now, but the hon. member knows that I am not financing this line. If it were left to me to build that Saldanha line, I would not have built it.</block>

<p>Those are the words of the hon. the Minister of Transport. He adopted the view here that if he had that choice he would never have built the Saldanha line. The simple reason for that is that the railway line from Port Elizabeth to Sishen has already been completed. The hon. the Minister knows that use was made of 96 lb. Ralls, which can be changed in the course of time to 115 lb. Ralls. This change is usually presented as being a doubling of the railway line. But what are the facts about the railway line to Port Elizabeth&#x003F; The installation of &#x201C;central traffic control&#x201D; would mean an additional expenditure of R33 million. This is being done, in any case, to cut costs and to promote greater safety on the line. To extend the &#x201C;loops&#x201D;, as they are called, will cost R7 million.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, which they would in any case. The &#x201C;off-shore terminal&#x201D; <span class="col_1131-1132" refersTo="page_0583"/>at Port Elizabeth will cost R28 million and the tugboats will cost in the vicinity of R6 million. This means a total of about R74 million. If the hon. member wants to go as far as including this as well, it would cost R74 million, but the central traffic control costing R33 million will in any case have to be there &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Saldanha or no Saldanha. Lengthening the so-called &#x201C;loops&#x201D;, so that long trains can pass, will in any case have to be done in the course of time, Saldanha or no Saldanha. Therefore it would cost more or less R74 million. But if the railway system from Sishen to Langebaan is constructed, it would cost R350 million. Now the hon. gentleman is trying to create the impression that the Port Elizabeth line would be just as expensive as this line that is now going to be constructed. An additional R50 million must still be added for the harbour that must be created at Saldanha Bay. I do not want to say that this money must not be spent in the course of time, because we are of the opinion that this is a good long-term construction scheme. I do not want to detract from that, but I just want to mention it to show the hon. House how ridiculous is the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s argument that if the St. Croix scheme is constructed it would cost only a little less than the Saldanha Bay scheme.</p>

<p>The hon. member says they know. At the same time the hon. the Minister tells us that the Cabinet had to make a choice. How could the Cabinet make a choice while they were still busy with tests to determine which is the best scheme&#x003F; I can tell the hon. the Minister that while they are still engaged in tests at Saldanha, the facts in connection with the tests at Port Elizabeth have long been available to the Government.</p>

<p>What are the facts of the matter&#x003F;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Leading South African engineering contractors consider that the St. Croix construction period can be confined to 30 months. Data on wind and waves is available over a long period; seven years&#x2019; wind records are available at Port Elizabeth airport; four years of wave readings are available for Mossel Bay; two years for Cape St. Francis &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is about 50 miles further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and several years for East London. These available wind and wave readings have only to be correlated with six months&#x2019; readings to be taken at St. Croix and we will then have the equivalent of years of observation.</block>

<p>The tests have, therefore, already been completed. How could the Government already have made its choice when hon. members now say they have been engaged all the while with the tests for the scheme that is going to be constructed at Saldanha Bay&#x003F; The hon. gentleman quoted the Soros association, and I am also going to do so&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Soros Association, an American firm of consulting engineers, regarded as the world&#x2019;s leading authority on off-shore terminals, have made a feasibility study of the installation proposed at Port Elizabeth. Soros conclude that it is entirely practical to build an off-shore terminal in the shelter of St. Croix Island, about 14 miles from Port Elizabeth, which will eventually be able to accommodate vessels up to 350 000 tons and provide berth availability of 86 per cent of time for vessels of 100 000 tons and over.</block>

<p>They then go further and state the facts in connection with the tests that were carried out with respect to storms, etc. They then make this interesting point&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1133-1134" refersTo="page_0584"/>Secondly, storms at Port Elizabeth tend to be of a relatively short duration, so it will be most unusual for vessels to wait for more than a few hours. Marine conditions at the proposed Port Elizabeth terminal will, in the view of the South African railways, be as good as those of Saldanha, while international shipowners consider that manoeuvring space for large vessels will be better.</block>

<p>If the hon. the Minister can therefore quote Soros in connection with the situation in Saldanha, we can do exactly the same &#x2026;</p>

<p>Then I apologize to the hon. the Minister because I heard incorrectly. But what are the actual facts of the matter&#x003F; Everyone wants the Saldanha Bay scheme to be developed and no-one has anything against that. All we ask, since South Africa needs this very necessary foreign currency&#x2014;and we do need it and can obtain it by means of improved exports&#x2014;is whether South Africa can afford not to obtain a share in international iron ore trade as soon as possible. That is the real choice facing South Africa. In recent years the international iron ore trade pattern has changed radically and completely, both in volume and in its direction of movement in the past two decades. The growth in this trade was exceptionally rapid. It increased from 33 million tons in 1950 to about 188 million tons in 1965. It is thought that this amount will double by the year 1980. As far as the volume of international trade today is concerned, iron ore is exceeded only by oil, i.e. in importance iron ore is second only to oil. Not only is the change that took place here of importance, but also the rapid increase in the world&#x2019;s steel production. What is also important is the decrease in some countries&#x2019; iron ore deposits, particularly those in Western Europe. An important factor is the fact that in recent years Japan has allowed its position in respect of the world&#x2019;s steel producers to increase fantastically in importance. This industry in Japan is based specifically on imported iron ore. It is calculated that the world&#x2019;s steel production increased from 480 million tons in 1960 to about 600 million tons in the early seventies. It is expected that by 1974 the production will increase 775 million tons of steel annually. Australia and other countries with large iron deposits are now trying to find markets for their products, and because of the fact that those markets are so competitive, it is absolutely necessary for South Africa that we penetrate this market. We cannot penetrate the market if our prices are not competitive and we do not have off-loading spots for our iron ore in South Africa. In the light of the tremendously high costs to iron ore producers today in respect of railway and shipping rates, it is necessary for us to give them the chance to export that iron ore as cheaply as possible. It is very clear to me that the Government&#x2019;s choice lies in finding a footing for South Africa as soon as possible when it comes to the iron ore that we have and to find us markets overseas. This appears to me to be the most important choice. Let the Government bear in mind that since it will take another six or eight years before the Saldanha scheme is completed, we shall be completely squeezed out of the market by our competitors in this field. At the present stage South Africa uses only about six million tons of its iron ore annually for its own purposes. Experts believe that we have anything between 10 000 million and 16 000 million tons of iron ore deposits. Even though we create a fourth Iscor, one wonders whether in the near future our own use will be much more than 10 million tons annually. We have these wonderful deposits that we can mine and export, and here we now want to wait from six to eight years for a scheme, while in the case of St. Croix we have a scheme that will be completed within years, with all the necessary tests, and that can earn us up to R387 million in foreign currency within a very short time, within a question of a year or two, as the hon. member for Von Brandis indicated. I think that is the choice.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister now asks us to think on a large scale and to discuss this subject. We must not only think in terms of local interests. I think that is a good idea, but if we need this foreign currency and we have these deposits, why then waste any time&#x003F; Again recently one of the <span class="col_1135-1136" refersTo="page_0585"/>biggest deposits was discovered in Australia. Here we sit with our thousands of tons of deposits, while opportunities are passing South Africa by and while the St. Croix scheme could be established for South Africa cheaply and in the shortest possible time. I therefore say that it is regrettable that the Government has already taken its final decision and that they do net see their way clear to fitting the St. Croix scheme into their general plan for the export of ore.</p>
