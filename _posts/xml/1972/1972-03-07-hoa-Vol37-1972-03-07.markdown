<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>We supported this measure at the Second Reading and we support it now. The clause of overriding importance is the one dealing with the aid centres. In 1964 we originally opposed the provisions in that Act dealing with aid centres. I think it can be said that the Government, by the steps they are taking today, is conceding the wisdom of our opposition then. For that measure contained provisions in regard to aid centres as places of a very different character from those before us at present. At that time it smacked of a place of detention, had other unacceptable features and, indeed, was very little used by the Government in the eight years that have elapsed since 1964. Now we have before us a Bill which makes these aid centres very much more like an advice bureau, an advice bureau with all the facilities and powers of the State to back it up. I think unconsciously the Government has paid a tribute to those various advice bureaux which have grown up and which have in fact been the friend of the Bantu who has not known what to do about his pass and influx control matters. The spirit which will imbue this new legislation, the hon. the Deputy Minister has assured us, will be a spirit of friendliness and helpfulness, and this we welcome. We welcome also that there will be, on his say-so, a man of senior standing and of high calibre at the head of these aid centres, and this indeed is most necessary. In the past such a man has not always been available at police stations and elsewhere to handle the affairs of these people in distress. This Bill, therefore, should relieve the Police of considerable investigating work. It should reduce the number of people detained in cells and other places overnight and it should reduce the convictions for pass and influx control offences, and this we welcome. It should do this partly because there will be a careful sifting out of these problems by people with special knowledge of these matters, people whose first concern will be to achieve an unravelling of these problems. In the past it has often been left to the Police and others, who have had sterner duties to contend with and perhaps had little heart for this work.</p>

<p>It is pleasing to see that the Government appears to be discarding some of the red tape which has bedevilled the supply of labour and the opportunities of Bantu to get jobs. We welcome this very much. For example, it seems that it is unnecessary for the Bantu to be sent back to a homeland, whether mythical or otherwise, so that he may be signed out there before coming back to the place where he has found a job. It would appear that there may be an exception in the Western Cape in this regard. There is not complete clarity and I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister will still clarify the matter further. I think it is fair to say that this is another cautious step by the Government in the direction of United Party policy to use influx control to relate the labour offering to the jobs available. This is an important advance. For this reason, too, we welcome it. There would seem to be an attitude to helpfulness that will imbue the administration of this legislation. That we welcome as well. There is one possible fly in the ointment, it seems, namely that a Bantu cannot obtain a job unless there is housing for him. I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister will tell us something about what the housing policy will be. We know, to our regret, how great the housing backlog has become for the Bantu. I refer only to Bantu in this regard. It is important to know that that backlog will be tackled with great energy because it will clearly otherwise frustrate the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s best intentions. I hope that he will be able to give us some assurance that this aspect of housing will not frustrate the good work which this Bill could otherwise do.</p>

<p>In conclusion I would merely say that the proof of the value of this Bill, like of any pudding, will be in the eating. The mixture, however, is far more promising than the 1964 mixture. In the circumstances, we shall support the Third Reading.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am not going to oppose the Third Reading of this

 Bill, because, as I told the hon. the Minister at Second Reading, I am prepared to give the aid centres a chance of reducing the number of Africans&#x2014;the incredible number of 2 000 per day&#x2014;who are convicted as a result of pass law offences. Like him, I am prepared to do practically anything to try to reduce the enormous prison population due to technical offences, people who really go to gaol for the crime of looking for work in areas where they <span class="col_2665-2666" refersTo="page_1350"/>do not have permits to be. I must say that after hearing the hon. Minister talk yesterday, I am not as optimistic as I was at Second Reading in thinking that the aid centres are really going to accomplish very much. As far as technical offences are concerned, there has always been a directive to the Police that they should not arrest Africans who are in possession of valid permits allowing them to be in urban areas but who simply cannot produce them on demand. Since 1954, there has been a directive to the Police not to arrest those people but to give them a reasonable chance of producing their documents. This could have been achieved without any amending legislation. But if as the result of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s aid centres at least those people are going to be spared spending ten days to two weeks in gaol or paying a fine of R10 one would be grateful. What worries me is what the hon. the Minister said yesterday in reply to a question I put to him at the Committee Stage. He emphasized that there was no intention in this Bill for the aid centres in any way to lessen the impact of the influx control regulations. He made it quite clear and emphasized this fact. I have always been of the opinion&#x2014;as a matter of fact it is self-evident&#x2014;that unless the influx control laws are amended quite radically, there is little chance of the prison population being reduced. I understand that the aid centres, for instance the aid centre at Langa in Cape Town&#x2014;the one which has probably been longest in operation and which has dealt with a large number of cases&#x2014;in fact does not allow people already in employment to remain in employment simply by fixing up the registration book in such a way as <i>post hoc</i> to ratify the entry of such people into the urban areas. What happens to these people is that they are endorsed out. Therefore this has nothing to do with a correlation of labour requirements, the jobs available to the labour offering, which is the phrase used by the hon. member who has just sat down. Thousands of people are already in employment in the urban areas and these are the people who are picked up by the police, and if they are women they often cannot prove that they have been in the urban area since before 1959. Although all these people are accommodated, although they are housed either on the employer&#x2019;s premises or elsewhere, they lose their jobs and they are sent back home &#x2014;whatever &#x201C;home&#x201D; may mean, since these people have lived in the urban areas for a long time, some of them for over 20 years&#x2014;but they cannot produce the necessary documentary proof to show that they have been in Cape Town or Johannesburg, or whatever area it is, for the requisite time. What the hon. the Minister fails to take into consideration, is the fact that the law which was introduced in 1964&#x2014;the law that makes it necessary for women to prove that they have been in the urban areas since before 1959&#x2014;was implemented in such a way and at such a time that women had to prove registration before there were registration centres in existence. In other words, these women who could not track back their old employers to get affidavits to prove that they had been in the urban areas for the required length of time had been given an impossible task. I was hoping that at least these people particularly would get sympathetic treatment at the aid centres, instead of which they are simply presented with tickets and told to go home. When they get home there is no question of available jobs at the other end; they are unemployed. Women are not allowed to return to the urban areas even as contract workers, except under very special circumstances. What is the hon. the Minister going to do about these people&#x003F; The aid centres, as far as I can see, are only going to affect those people who technically do not have their books properly fixed up, while those people already in employment and already accommodated but who cannot prove that they have been in the area for the requisite amount of time, are still either going to go to gaol or pay a fine or be sent home. So the over-all problem is not going to be tackled, nor is the overall problem of those people coming in from the rural areas seeking employment in the towns without the necessary permits, going to be tackled. These constitute the bulk of the people who are picked up under the pass offences. As I say, I am afraid, or rather I am really not optimistic that there is going to be a big reduction in the prison population for <i>bona fide</i> workseekers who come to the areas without permits. I am afraid the basic problem is not going to be tackled, for with all the good intentions in the world, which I am sure the hon. the Deputy Minister has, unless there is some radical change in the attitude towards those people who are coming into the urban areas and those people who are already in the urban areas and who have found employment, without permits. As I have said, I am certainly prepared to give this new system a chance.</p>

<p><span class="col_2667-2668" refersTo="page_1351"/>I shall be visiting these aid centres as the hon. the Deputy Minister has stated we can. I shall certainly be asking many questions next year to see how the aid centres have worked or have not worked.</p>

<p>Finally, I would like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister to give some really deep consideration to the particular case of African women who are suffering very severely from a law which was introduced at a time when there was no provision for them to meet the requirements of that law. In other words, there were no registration offices where women could register and therefore prove their right, at a later stage, to be in the urban areas. I hope he will give this matter some urgent consideration.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when these two hon. members rose and said that they supported this Bill and that neither of the two Opposition parties were going to vote against it, one wondered for a moment what had gone wrong for this to be so. We in this House have grown accustomed to this situation that when the Government comes forward with something good and the United Party is obliged to endorse it, they give us to understand that that allegedly was United Party policy the Government was taking over. [Interjections.] If this is the case, it is amazing that in fact there still is such a deep-rooted difference between the Opposition and this side of the House on such important matters.</p>

<p>Having said that, I also want to express my thanks and appreciation to both the hon. member for Houghton and the hon. member for Pinelands, and through them, to the Opposition for supporting this measure. I myself think it is a good measure; I think it is a measure that deserves general support. I want to express the wish and hope that the effect of this legislation will be such that these aid centres will in fact be developed into what they are envisaged to be.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, because the hon. member aimed a smart political slap in the face in our direction you must allow me to defend myself and not expect me just to sit back and take it. The hon. member left a very wide gap when he said: &#x201C;The only fly in the ointment is the question of housing.&#x201D; This House will remember that with regard to Bantu labour in White South Africa I stated very emphatically in my reply to the Second Reading debate that it was the Government&#x2019;s view that if there were vacancies for Bantu labourers, those vacancies would not simply be filled because we on this side of the House believed that Bantu labour in White areas should always be coupled to the necessary provision of housing. From the history of this country we have learned only too well what hardship is brought down on the Bantu and particularly on the Whites as well, if the question of housing is not taken into account as priority No. 1 as far as it relates to the provision of Bantu labour in White South Africa. If housing is not provided, that must give rise to conditions of squatting, and chaos and all the other miseries that are known only too well in this country, must arise from those conditions. For these reasons it is this very side of the House which has chalked up the biggest achievements in respect of housing for Whites, Bantu and non-Whites during its 20 years of government. This is one of the most important reasons why peace and order and quiet prevail in this country. The Government will continue to take the necessary steps in respect of this question of housing.</p>

<p>Then there is another aspect to which I want to refer. Both hon. members referred to the question of influx control measures and related it to these aid centres. The success of these aid centres is highly essential and already there is proof of special success in this regard. This morning I was informed of the latest position in respect of the aid centre in Johannesburg which was established at the beginning of this year. For the month of February, the position is that 3 636 technical offenders applied for aid to that centre. On the recommendation of the aid centre the cases against no fewer than 2 481 of them were withdrawn. This is a success factor of 68,25 per cent for the month of February. In other words, 68,25 per cent of the 3 636 Bantu who were picked up for technical offences in February were dealt with in such a way by the aid centre that they did not land in court or in prison. I think this is an outstanding achievement.</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Deputy Minister mentioned 2 400 cases that had been withdrawn. Do they include people who have been placed in employment and whose documents were possibly not in order beforehand&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from><span class="col_2669-2670" refersTo="page_1352"/>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, they undoubtedly include people who have been placed in employment, because this is one of the most important aims of the aid centres. However, that is done through the agency of the labour bureau.</p>

<p>However, this is not all that I want to say in this regard. The highest percentage on different days during that month was, for example, a success factor of 79 per cent on one day. What is important, is that 118 Bantu detainees in Johannesburg were assisted in February by the aid centre in respect of the issuing of reference books. In other words, they were people who did not have reference books previously. We are particularly proud of what has been done at the aid centre in Johannesburg, because we have in fact been waiting to see how the aid centre would work in this big city with its big concentration of Bantu labour. During the month of February no fewer than 206 Bantu voluntarily applied to the centre for aid which they were given. It is very heartening that this is so, and I am not afraid to come to this House next year to talk about this matter, because it has been placed on a very sound basis. Having said this now and wishing to mention real successes, I want to emphasize that there is a very deep-rooted difference between this side of the House and the hon. member for Houghton and the hon. member for Pinelands on that side of the House in regard to this matter. The effect of this Bill will accentuate that difference. What is that difference&#x003F; I have already mentioned the difference in the approach to housing. The second and most important difference is the one in the approach to influx control measures. There should be no misunderstanding about the fact that the aid centres, while they are there to render aid to technical offenders, are not there to condone contraventions of the law on the one hand, and neither are they established for the evasion of influx control measures. It must be clearly understood that the influx control measures remain. The aid centres are there to help only within the framework of technical offences.</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. the Deputy Minister a question&#x003F; How do you correlate what you are now saying with the statement you made earlier about Africans being allowed to bring newly married wives from the rural areas&#x003F; Are you going to adjust the laws in respect of these newlyweds&#x003F;</p>

<p>The kind of cases the hon. member is mentioning now, are not ones which will be aid centre cases in the normal course of events.

If we have clarity on this second point, we understand each other very well as regards the establishment of these aid centres. The effect of this measure which is now being passed unanimously in this House will really be a beneficial one to the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#heunis">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. HEUNIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendment standing in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<p>I want to reply immediately to certain statements the hon. member for Albany made in his Second Reading speech about this legislation.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. HEUNIS</person>:</from>

<p>I shall reply to that immediately. In anticipation the hon. member discussed the amendment in his speech. He remarked that in the first place he had obtained information about the amendment as printed, apparently from an undisclosed source. The hon. member made a few statements. You will find that he actually made contradictory factual statements in the same speech. I am going to explain this to the House. He asked (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What is the position at the moment&#x003F; I can tell you that the farms in Paarl are economic units at the moment.</block>

<p>But he goes further and says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For how long are they going to be economic units&#x003F;</block>

<p>Then he referred to the fact that the farmers within the Paarl urban area have to pay double rates for their farms. He alleges, <i>inter alia,</i> that in certain cases they have to pay ten times more than their colleagues farming outside the urban areas. But what are the facts, specifically in respect of the farms in Paarl&#x003F; Let me say immediately that Paarl was used as an example of an urban farming area with agricultural units. At the same time there are numerous other local authorities, urban in nature, that ought to be dealt with on a similar basis to Paarl.</p>

<speech by="#heunis">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. HEUNIS</person>:</from>

<p>I think we now have the explanation of the hon. member&#x2019;s standpoint concerning this legislation. With him it is therefore not basically a matter of the protection of agricultural land within and outside the compass of our urban local authorities, but a matter of the effect he can gain in Oudtshoorn with his standpoint that quite incidentally relates to the legislation. His interjection confirms my conclusion in that specific connection.</p>

<p>Let us look at what the position is in respect of the agricultural land in the Paarl urban area. In contrast with hon. members, the Cape Provincial Administration not only welcomed the legislation in the first place, but also requested it. In fact, Sir, after the Second Reading debate had been concluded and I had given an indication of the proposed amendments, the M.E.C. entrusted with local administration in the Province not only reacted favourably to the expected amendment, but actually expressed his pleasure and welcomed it; what did the Paarl local authority have to say in the person of their Mayoress&#x003F; They reacted immediately and said that the amendment standing in my name would enable them to take the protectional steps with respect to agricultural land within the area of jurisdiction of the Paarl municipality. But what did the Paarl municipality itself do in co-operation with the Cape Provincial Administration to make it possible for the farmers with agricultural units within the urban local area to conduct their industry on an economic basis&#x003F; It made a special arrangement in respect of the ratability of farmers within the area of jurisdiction of Paarl. If the hon. member had rather consulted more effective sources, he would have found, <i>inter alia,</i> that a special proclamation was issued on negotiations between the local authority and the relevant farmers to reduce their burden in respect of municipal rates. I refer him to Proclamation No. 361 of 1968. By the way, this proclamation is valid for a period of 10 years. In that proclamation it is stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That for a period of 10 years with

 effect from 1st January, 1968, only the following percentages of the general rate made and levied by the Municipal Council of Paarl shall be assessed and payable in respect of rateable properties within the municipal area which are separately registered and which are being developed for agricultural purposes and the ground area of which covers three morgen or more.</block>

<p><span class="col_2673-2674" refersTo="page_1354"/>What is the

 reduced rate which makes this possible&#x003F; It is 33&#x2153; per cent on land and everything used for agricultural purposes, and not already exempt from rates, calculated on the site value of land only. Secondly, it is 100 per cent on the dwelling and all rateable improvements not used for agricultural purposes. In other words, the Paarl Municipality and the Administration as the controlling authorities have already, with the differentiated rate allowance on agricultural land, confirmed the point that within the area of jurisdiction of this local authority there is land that must be protected for agricultural purposes and used for that purpose. The hon. member went further and referred to the fact that irrigation can only take place late at night. But what are the actual facts&#x003F; The fact is a further confirmation that the land must be preserved for agricultural purposes, because the Paarl municipality decided to supply water, within their area of jurisdiction, to agriculture at a lower rate than the ordinary domestic consumer must pay for it. Thirdly, the municipality supplied additional services to these farmers in respect of their labour and the availability of labour. The hon. member says that those farmers have problems because their labourers cannot be housed on their land. That is not correct, Sir. The fact is that the number of labourers they may house is limited. However, there is no absolute prohibition whatsoever on the housing of labourers. I want to claim that if the hon. member endorses a specific standpoint, which it is his positive right to do, I believe he should also state the factual information correctly.</p>

<p>In conclusion I just want to remark that the hon. member is correct in respect of one statement only&#x2014;in respect of all the others he is wrong&#x2014;and that is that the scope of the measure is being extended by the amendment. In that respect he is correct, but it is being extended specifically because a particular shortcoming exists, i.e. that where a local authority, the provincial administration and the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure are agreed, and all are prepared to preserve land in respect of this and other urban local authorities with large and fertile agricultural land surfaces, they do not have the power, in terms of their own legislation, to adopt the same norms as in the case of the test for sub-division. The department was asked whose authority it is to protect agricultural land, and therefore steps were taken to extend this legislation in accordance and in co-operation with local and provincial authorities, and therefore, in my opinion, there is no reason&#x2014; in any case, not with an agricultural basis &#x2014;why the scope of the measure should not be extended in this specific case. That is specifically what I am advocating and also proposing here. I just want to emphasize that the purpose of this legislation in respect of the sub-division of land lays down a specific test if and when it is approved or rejected, and that the local and provincial authorities must apply another norm in respect of requests for the subdivision of land within their area of jurisdiction and within the compass of their powers &#x2026;[Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#deacon">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. D. DEACON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for False Bay has endeavoured to reply to what I said during the Second Reading debate in regard to his proposed amendment, of which he had given notice. However, I believe that he has succeeded only in substantiating what I had to say. He said firstly that I had said that the farms in Paarl were doubly taxed, as far as fixed property tax is concerned; they are taxed by the Divisional Council and by the Municipality. That is what I meant.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#heunis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. HEUNIS</person>:</from>

<p>That is not a double tax.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deacon">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. D. DEACON</person>:</from>

<p>Of course it is. Then the hon. member questioned my statement that some farms in Paarl had to pay a fixed property tax up to ten times as much as other farms. This, of course, depends on the size of the farm and the development of the farm, but it is a fact that some farms in Paarl pay up to ten times as much. He can check this with the South African Agricultural Union, and he will find out that that is so.</p>

<p>Then he came to Proclamation No. 361 of 1968. I am fully aware of that Proclamation, but if he would care to check the latest Provincial Auditor&#x2019;s report, he would see the taxation figures in respect of Paarl. If he then takes into account the morgenage and value of property, he will find that I am quite correct; the farmer in Paarl has to pay more in fixed property tax than the farmer outside Paarl. That is a fact. Then, Sir, he made a &#x201C;groot gebaar&#x201D; and said that the Paarl Municipality are letting the farmers in Paarl have water at <span class="col_2675-2676" refersTo="page_1355"/>a cheaper rate than the house-owners. Quite obviously they must. Those farmers in Paarl must use millions upon millions of gallons more than the householders; therefore the householders must be charged more for their water. The farmer in Paarl cannot be charged at the same rate. Sir, I think this hon. member has the bull by the tail completely.</p>

<p>There is a Group Areas Proclamation in respect of Paarl, and it is a fact that a very limited number of servants, household servants, are allowed to stay on the property, but not the agricultural workers. Another point which the hon. member missed entirely is that although this is agricultural land, there is a municipal regulation which prevents one from keeping livestock on that land. What kind of farming can you have without any livestock&#x003F; Where do you get your manure from&#x003F; Not a chicken, not a rabbit, not a horse and not a cow may you keep on that land. You can only develop that land agriculturally. It is very beautiful, and I believe that the owners of that land in Paarl should have the right to decide what they are going to do with their land themselves. Furthermore, I still believe that I was correct when I said during the Second Reading debate, that this amendment extends the scope of this measure, and can therefore not be accepted by this House. I do not believe we need discuss it any further.</p>

<p>I welcome this idea because as far as the provinces in particular are concerned, the following sometimes created problems for the provinces: It was difficult for the provinces to decide which criterion should be applied in respect of which subdivisions fell within the limits of their authority, and which were the province of the Central Government in terms of the provisions of Act No. 70 of 1970. Sir, the position has become progressively complicated as these provincial powers were delegated and were applied by the local authorities, and the local authorities were indeed confronted with a major problem because they had to cope with the fragmentation of smallholdings which really created a perpetual problem; they were neither flesh nor fish; they were not in the town nor were they farms. That is why I say that this idea is a welcome one. We have this position in the Transvaal, for example, and therefore I welcome the amendment in the Act where a provision is now being inserted to the effect that that area is included which is incorporated under the Peri-urban Areas Ordinance. Sir, in the Transvaal you have the two areas, the general area and the special area, in respect of peri-urban areas. The position has therefore arisen that as long as it is a general area you may in fact apply the provisions of Act No. 70 of 1970 through the Central Government, but the moment it is converted into a social area, when a village council or an area committee is appointed, other norms are applicable. That is why you found that special areas were established where the primary, underlying purpose was not to establish a township, but where the area authority was established solely for other purposes, such as the control of the Bantu of the area, and you have the position that some of the areas have been demarcated in an arbitrary way as many as 16 to 20 miles beyond the township. This entailed that the subdivision of those lands did not fall under the jurisdiction of the Central Government in terms of the provisions of Act No. 70 of 1970, and this has created a terrible position. I am thinking for example of my own area, the area of Lothair, an area with a very high rainfall where trees are being planted. This area has been proclaimed as a special area for the sole purpose of controlling Bantu, while the control falls under the area committee for a radius of 20 miles around Lothair, and you could therefore have subdivision of land there by means of the special area committee. Sir, we regard this as undesirable and therefore I welcome and support the idea that it can now be excluded and controlled by the Central Government.</p>

<p>It is interesting to hear from the hon. member for Ermelo that in Ermelo he has these problems to which he has referred and which he describes as abuses of subdivision. The <span class="col_2677-2678" refersTo="page_1356"/>problem, of course, is due to a weak or bad provincial administration in his province. If he were living in Natal, which is subjected to a United Party provincial executive committee, he would find no such problems as he has described. The very point made by the hon. member for Ermelo emphasizes one of the main points that we have made throughout the various debates on this legislation relating to the subdivision of agricultural land, and that is that where a provincial authority does its job properly, there is no need for the Central Government or the department of the hon. the Deputy Minister to step in and, in fact, it is undesirable because provinces are in a better position to say what particular areas of the province should be maintained either for particular agricultural purposes or for other purposes such as future residential development or future industrial development. However. I leave the hon. member for Ermelo at this point.</p>

<p>I want to come now to the amendment proposed by the hon. member for False Bay. The House has not been told yet whether the hon. the Deputy Minister intends accepting this amendment. It would be surprising if he did. [Interjection.] No, he says he will. Perhaps, Sir, it is after all not surprising. Anything that a Nationalist on that side of the House will propose, the hon. the Deputy Minister will accept. But if the hon. the Deputy Minister is serious in his intentions to produce good legislation&#x2014;and one begins to doubt whether he is in view of the lackadaisical and casual way in which he replied to the Second Reading debate on this Bill&#x2014;but if he is interested in producing good legislation I would suggest to him that he gives further thought to this amendment of the hon. member for False Bay. It is a most curious amendment. It produces, first of all, double exceptions. Has the hon. the Deputy Minister given thought to that&#x003F; It produces a double exception because the definition clause deals with the definition of agricultural land and provides that agricultural land is any land except the land which is then referred to. That is the first exception. Now we come to the amendment of the hon. member for False Bay, and we find another exception at the end of the clause. What exactly is the net result of a double exception in a definition clause&#x003F; Perhaps the hon. the Deputy Minister will tell us because the hon. member for False Bay has not told us. I can assure the hon. the Deputy Minister, if he is not aware of the position, and perhaps those members on his side of the House with some legal background will enlighten the hon. the Minister as to the effect of a double exception in a definition clause&#x2014; but I can assure the hon. the Deputy Minister that this will give rise to quite a lot of litigation. But apart from that, if the hon. the Deputy Minister intends accepting this amendment, perhaps he can tell the House what exactly he means when he does accept it. Sir, I will wait until the Whip and the hon. the Deputy Minister have finished their private conversation and the Deputy Minister is in a position to pay attention to the Bill which is before us and which he is piloting through the House. I specifically directed my remarks to the Deputy Minister and he proceeds to have a conversation with one of the Whips. [Interjections.] What I wish to know from the hon. the Deputy Minister, and I hope we will have a straight answer from him and not just the sort of casual and evasive approach that we had in the Second Reading, is this. What precisely does he intend achieving by the amendment of the hon. member for False Bay&#x003F; Is the effect of the amendment of the hon. member for False Bay that the Deputy Minister will be in a position to declare some land within these areas mentioned as being specifically excluded from the definition of agricultural land&#x2014;will he now be able to declare some of these areas to be agricultural land despite the initial exception&#x003F; Is that the intention&#x003F; I get no reply from the Deputy Minister.</p>

<p>It is a simple question. He apparently cannot give a simple answer now to that simple question, so I will leave it and wait for him to reply. But if that is the intention, then we can assure the hon. the Deputy Minister that we will be very firmly opposed to that amendment, because it is quite unreasonable to start by excluding from the definition of agricultural land, land situated in these local authority areas and then to proceed to give the Deputy Minister a sort of blanket power to re-declare some parts of these areas to be agricultural land. There is no justification for such a provision. We will certainly be very much opposed to this. I suggest that a lot of the local authorities <span class="col_2679-2680" refersTo="page_1357"/>will be opposed to this and so will the provinces who control these local authorities. It means that the local authorities can never be secure in the knowledge that the area which has been declared to be under their jurisdiction is going to remain. The hon. the Deputy Minister, in terms of that amendment, will be able to exclude from local authority areas, any land which he now thinks should, despite the fact that it falls within a local authority, be regarded as agricultural land.</p>

<p>I want to deal with another aspect of this clause, namely paragraph (f). As the Act stands at the moment and as it was passed only two years ago at the request of this Deputy Minister, land zoned for any particular purpose under a town planning scheme which is in force in terms of any law, is excluded from the definition of agricultural land. That surely is a sensible and reasonable approach.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Musgrave expressed his concern about powers being adopted here in terms of this envisaged legislation that he regards as undesirable. He says it is the task of the provincial administrations to do the planning because they have the necessary knowledge. That is specifically what is being envisaged. The hon. member&#x2019;s point of departure is altogether wrong. Provincial administrations do not have authority over this land. Their authority is limited to 25 morgen and no more. In terms of the envisaged legislation an extension of powers will be granted to them with the necessary permission. That is the most important task being entrusted to them. Here their powers are being extended. Then there is something else the hon. member is concerned about, i.e. that local authorities, with a view to future planning, will be uncertain whether they may use particular land.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for Albany objected to the restrictions on available land and to the fact that thousands of morgen of agricultural land are being taken for future industrial development. The fact that the land that must be taken in future must be covered by proper planning, serves as a further proof of how important this envisaged legislation is. In this legislation provision is being made for proper planning, and when municipalities want to extend their boundaries, they must obtain permission to do so where this involves agricultural land. Clause 1 (f) creates the opportunity for the envisaged steering committees to establish timely planning for our urban areas. I do not think hon. members have read the legislation properly, because this legislation chiefly envisages the establishment of timely planning, and when a municipality wants to extend its area it must obtain permission to do so. Then every person knows what land is going to be included. None of the provincial councils have these powers, and in that respect the hon. member for Musgrave is altogether wrong. The provincial administrations have not had the powers to do this in the past and they could only grant approval to developments of up to 25 morgen. Through this legislation the provincial administrations can obtain permission to include that area in the planning if they contemplate certain areas for future development. Then the hon. member for Newton Park objected to the use of land &#x2026;</p>

<p>The whole reason why the hon. members object is that they are opposed to control being exercised over the subdivision of land. We know they oppose the principal Act and now the idea is that they must also oppose this legislation, because here more powers are being adopted to prevent the cutting up of land. It is important that we take steps to prevent this cutting up of land and that there is proper planning to allow future development to take place on an orderly basis. The phenomenon of small land ownership around our urban areas is one of the greatest of evils. It should have been prevented years ago. Unfortunately the legislation only came along at a later stage, but this small land ownership is probably one of the major causes of the impoverishment of many people round the urban areas and elsewhere. This was the largest contributing factor towards making conditions difficult for these people in the past. Even the sympathetic aid on the part of the Government in the past was only aimed at delaying the evil day further. It is impossible for a person who is farming on an uneconomic piece of land to make a living, and that is why I think that the United Party&#x2019;s standpoint, i.e. to oppose this legislation that prevents the cutting up of land, is very foolish.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member, who has just resumed his seat, completely missed the hon. member for Musgrave&#x2019;s point. He did so for the simple reason that the hon. member for False Bay came along with an amendment that now wants to include agricultural land that fell under a village management board&#x2019;s area and was excluded. In other words it has nothing to do with those smallholdings that circle the town beyond the urban limits. We know it relates to this legislation, but not to this specific clause.

<p>As an example. My point is specifically that Paarl is not the only example of agricultural land in an urban area. In all the south-western districts one has it. Bonnievale, Swellendam, Calitzdorp, Ladismith, Montagu and dozens of other places have agricultural land within the urban area. Now the hon. member wants to prevent those people from perhaps dividing up their land for a purpose other than agriculture. I think this is a totally wrong principle, because those pieces of agricultural land within urban areas, are already small pieces of land. They are usually not big, with the exception of Paarl where a very large piece of land, of 15 or 20 morgen or more, could perhaps be obtained in the town, but in the majority of small rural towns those agricultural smallholdings are small pieces of land. However, people still try to supplement their incomes from that land. Frequently one finds that people are completely <i>bona fide</i> farmers on those pieces of land.</p>

<p>No. The hon. gentleman wants to protect those people. That is the reason why he is moving this amendment. After all, he says that the reason why he is moving it is that he wants to protect these people. I now say that this is wrong, because the municipality of that specific town is already under the impression that when it is perhaps necessary to develop it will have that land at its disposal for urban development. Now the hon. the Minister, if he accepts this amendment, wants to prevent something of this nature. It might happen that as a result of industrial <span class="col_2683-2684" refersTo="page_1359"/>development round, such a rural town there are a large number of newcomers. Because the hon. the Minister can say that this land may not be used because it is good agricultural land, he will be able to restrict any development in a direction other than that of agriculture. I now want to state my objection to this. Previously it was provided by law that that land would be excluded from the provisions in the legislation we are now discussing. In other words, the hon. gentleman originally thought he did not want the power to interfere even with agricultural land lying in such an urban area.</p>

<p>Yes, that is one of the foremost points. What has happened since that legislation was passed that the hon. the Minister must now obtain the authority to prevent the subdivision of this land while those powers were vested in the provinces&#x003F; If one wants to subdivide land into areas smaller than 25 morgen, one had to have the approval of the provincial administrations to date. In other words, there was already a form of control. But I believe that when such an application for subdivision is made to the province, it will immediately take the difficulties of new development into consideration and that permission for that development will be granted. But if I have a five morgen erf in Montagu that is planted with grapes, why must the hon. the Minister be able to tell me that I may not subdivide it if Montagu is perhaps to become an industrial area in the course of time&#x003F; I believe that the majority of farmers, even these small farmers in a town &#x2014;and there are not many of them after all &#x2014;will not like this kind of legislation.</p>

<block name="quote">(<i>f</i>) land zoned for any particular purpose under a town planning scheme which is in force in terms of any law.</block>

<p>In clause 1 certain words are being deleted, and the justification for the amendment I am moving on behalf of this side of the House is that we originally lodged an objection with the Minister, when the Bill was submitted for the first time, to the effect that certain government departments will be excluded and that they can subdivide at will, while it is expected of the individual farmer first to obtain the approval of the hon. the Minister. This Bill also makes provision for applying these provisions to South-West Africa; in other words, if the administration wants to subdivide land there, there is no provision of this measure that will be applicable to them. Whether this is economical or uneconomical, the hon. the Minister is giving them that power. What justification is there for involving the private land-owner more and more in the provisions of this legislation, as the hon. member for False Bay&#x2019;s amendment also indicates, while the hon. gentleman is not prepared to also include Government bodies in the provisions of this measure. I cannot see that there is any justification for this at all. Yet it would have given the appearance of fairness if other Government departments, whether it be the Department of Land Tenure or whatever, were made subject to the provisions, and this also applies to Government administrations, for example in South-West Africa, while now only the private individual, the owner of the land and the farmer are being affected by the <span class="col_2685-2686" refersTo="page_1360"/>provisions of this legislation. We are of the opinion that the words &#x201C;land zoned for any particular purpose under a town-planning scheme which is in force in terms of any law&#x201D; of paragraph (f) of the definition of &#x201C;agricultural land&#x201D; in section 1 of the principal Act, which is now being deleted by this clause, should remain, because we really cannot see why the hon. the Minister wants to delete this portion. We are also prepared to allocate the words, which the hon. the Minister wants to add to the relevant paragraph, to a new paragraph (g). As far as the Provincial Administration in South-West Africa is concerned, we feel that they must also be included in the provisions of the Bill, and that this should not only relate to private individuals.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I just want to come back to what the hon. member for Musgrave said. Apparently the hon. member has problems in connection with understanding the amendment in its context. It is possible to explain to him what is contained in the amendment, but it is unfortunately impossible to give him the comprehension with which to understand it; but this side of the House does not actually have much to do with that. He spoke of Natal, which controls the sub-division of land effectively, but in reply to that he will surely allow me to quote what the Leader of his party said in the Cape Provincial Council. In passing I can just mention that the Cape Provincial Council or rather Administration requested the amendment that I moved. He said in the Provincial Council, (Hansard of 1969, vol. 52, col. 160): &#x201C;We in the Cape are better governed than in any other province&#x201D;, also Natal. What is the gist of the matter&#x003F; The gist of the matter is that we are dealing with a definition and that this must be traced back to the particular object the legislation envisages.</p>

<p>1969, Vol. 52. This definition, as it now stands, and traced back to the amendment I am moving, includes certain land for control and in (f) excludes other land from control. The included and the excluded parts are related to a specific norm. The norm that is being laid down in this legislation and which falls within the powers of the department and the hon. the Deputy Minister, relates to the control of agricultural land for agricultural-economic purposes. We can now try, as hon. members opposite did, to make a debating point of this, but the fact surely remains that the hon. member for Newton Park&#x2019;s suggestion is untrue, that when the area is included within the urban area, there is now an absolute and static prohibition and restriction on the sub-division of land.

<p>The fact is that in terms of existing legislation urban local authorities can extend their boundaries. For what purpose&#x003F; Because new circumstances lay down new requirements in respect of town planning for residential purposes. They lay down new requirements in respect of the extension of boundaries for industrial development purposes. In other words, we shall surely be exercising control over land <i>ad infinitum</i> from various angles and with various objectives according to the changes in the needs of society. When the hon. the Minister has drawn up his guide plan in terms of this legislation and proclaimed certain areas for agricultural purposes, as he foresees himself doing in paragraph (f), along comes an alternate control authority who must judge that released area according to the requirements for which it is responsible and in accordance with its powers. The opposite is surely also true. This amendment and the legislation itself allocate powers that must be implemented by the hon. the Minister in consultation with other bodies. The amendment states that if he wants to include urban agricultural land in the Act, he shall not do so dictatorially. He shall do so in co-operation with the executive committee of the province in which the land is situated. The province in turn makes its recommendations in consultation with the local authorities under it.</p>

<p>The answer to that is: &#x201C;Yes, he can&#x201D;, unless the Minister, in consultation with the executive committee of the Cape Provincial Administration, has proclaimed specific agricultural land in Paarl or in any other urban local area, as agricultural land in terms of the Act.</p>

<p>Sir, I cannot give the hon. member for Albany the intelligence to understand this; I was not there when his intelligence was given to him. In terms of existing legislation, a local authority at the moment surely has the right, in respect of land within its area of jurisdiction, to determine the use of land and to zone it. With that right the local authority surely also has the right to affect the rights of individual owners. It is surely a principle, Sir, that when one exercises rights and when one serves general interests, the individual&#x2019;s rights may be affected for the sake of over-all interests. The function of the urban local authority and the provincial administration is not agricultural in nature, and the norms they apply cannot be applied according to agricultural considerations. They can only apply them in accordance with the powers granted to them by way of legislation. Now I cannot understand why the hon. member for Newton Park, who is actually their speaker on agricultural matters, and who probably shares with us this general concern for the preservation of our agricultural land, is now adopting this standpoint.</p>

<p>Well, Sir, then I shall quote it for the hon. member&#x2019;s edification. This is a finding in the Niemand Commission report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_2689-2690" refersTo="page_1362"/>Representatives of all bodies having a direct or indirect interest in township establishment procedures were outspoken on the subject of the slow progress of township establishment. It was stated that in the Transvaal it actually takes years to have a township established. In the Cape and the Orange Free State the machinery operates more rapidly and in Durban no problems are experienced because of the existence of master plans and delegated powers enjoyed by the City Council.</block>

<p>Sir, that is the very issue which was raised as a result of the amendment by the hon. member for Newton Park, which was aimed at the retention of paragraph (f), namely that any land which is subject to an approved town planning scheme, should not be regarded as agricultural land. The hon. member for False Bay will know that every municipality is obliged to provide a town planning scheme within that municipality and that his Paarl case will be covered by the town planning scheme of the municipality. But he does not want to leave it there. He wants the Minister of Agriculture to come in and say what must be done with regard to the development of that town. Sir, I am very glad the hon. the Minister of Housing is here. The Minister of Housing is sitting here with an enormous problem with regard to the provision of housing. He gave us certain figures recently in this House to indicate what the problem is. He indicated to us that there are something like 80 000 families on waiting-lists for housing&#x2014;Whites, Coloureds and Asiatics&#x2014;under the Group Areas Act. The hon. the Minister himself at this very moment has announced that there is to be a symposium on high density housing. Sir, this is all to deal with the urban development which is taking place. Where there is land within an urban area, the hon. member for False Bay wants to give this Minister the right to say, that it will not be available for housing even if the owner of that property wants to make it available for housing.</p>

<p>I hope the hon. member for False Bay is not going to lead the hon. the Deputy Minister along this wrong road. Sir, the whole problem that we have is the movement of people from the rural areas into the urban areas and their housing, and if that is so, then surely we must look at what was found, for instance, by the Niemand Commission. The report of the Niemand Commission, dealing with the requirements within the urban areas and dealing with land of the nature to which the hon. member for False Bay has referred, had this to say, and I quote from page 29 of the report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">So far as the South African scene is concerned, it was noticeable that even representatives of township developers time and again testified spontaneously before the commission that undeveloped land was a diminishing asset. The word &#x201C;asset&#x201D; was used in the sense of an asset of the country in the interest of its urban population, which implies that the concern about the diminution was not for the individual farm-owner, who must give up his land, but in the national interest for the urban communities for whom such land is required. It was also stated repeatedly that while land could be subdivided into several small portions for township development, land as such could not be augmented or increased. It was therefore not a commodity that could be produced. The commission is firmly convinced that as far as urban communities are concerned, the time has come when undeveloped peri-urban land in South Africa shall not only be used sparingly and judiciously, but should indeed be considered an inseparable adjunct of the neighbouring or adjoining urban area and be reserved through the authorities for the ultimate systematic and programmed use of the people of that urban area.</block>

<p>For those reasons I believe that the amendment of the hon. member for False Bay is a retrogressive amendment; it is unnecessary; it is not required in legislation of this sort. We should be looking forward to providing more land for housing, not less land for housing, within the municipal areas. Secondly, Sir, when one realizes the time, the money and the energy and the man hours that have been spent in devising the town planning schemes of our major municipalities and local authorities, it would be a waste of time, a waste of energy and a waste of that money if the hon. the Minister can override those town planning schemes in directing how land should be used. I believe the hon. member for Newton Park is quite correct.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, there is one major point which hon. members of the Opposition do not see correctly. They say: &#x201C;Two years ago you passed this Act; why are you now coming forward with amendments&#x003F;&#x201D; It often happens that you find, when you are implementing a law, that there are difficulties and that adjustments have to be made. As far as the amendment by the hon. member for False Bay is concerned, I want to say that I am grateful to him for that amendment. The hon. member for Green Point must not tell me that that hon. member is leading me astray; I am not that blind. But I shall definitely not allow myself to be led by the Opposition and by the amendment of the hon. member for Newton Park. What happened in practice when we were implementing this Act&#x003F; The hon. member for False Bay mentioned his experience in Paarl. We may just as well take places like Krugersdorp and Kempton Park; everywhere there is land which is excluded under this Act because it is economic agricultural land. From Krugersdorp up to the Hartebeestpoort Dam and across to Pretoria and round to the other side of Babsfontein and back again to the Johannesburg area, there is a need for the subdivision of agricultural land. The Act gives us the right to control agricultural land, but if there is a need for land which has already been subdivided&#x2014;some pieces of land are 100 morgen in extent&#x2014;then we no longer have control over that land, and the Provinces have said that if that land is subdivided into 50-morgen <span class="col_2693-2694" refersTo="page_1364"/>smallholdings, they have no control over it. I stated emphatically in the Second Reading debate that we do not want all these unsatisfactory conditions around our cities as we already have. We want development to take place in an orderly manner. Sir, the hon. member for False Bay knows more about local authority matters than any hon. member on that side; he was an M.E.C. He has the necessary practical experience.</p>

<p>I come now to the hon. member for Albany. The hon. member referred to farms which pay double taxes&#x2014;divisional council tax and municipal rates. Sir, I ask the hon. member to take a look at clause 3 (f). What is the intention of clause 3 (f)&#x003F; The intention is that no municipality can, to its heart&#x2019;s content, extend its boundaries for purposes of taxation. We are aware that some farms are paying double taxes. The hon. member for Ermelo told us about a practical problem which he is experiencing; that problem relates to peri-urban health boards. There is no co-ordination in the Transvaal as far as these things are concerned; they can subdivide land as they wish.</p>

<p>I come then to the hon. member for Musgrave. Sir, I do not know why the hon. member for Musgrave wants to insult me in such a Cassandra-like way by saying that I went through the Second Reading too rapidly and that I only touched upon the Bill here and there. Must I today repeat for his edification everything the hon. members for False Bay, Ermelo and Bloemfontein District said&#x003F; After all, I said that I agree with those hon. members, but should we not endeavour to achieve efficiency&#x003F; The hon. member repeated one point three times in his speech, and I certainly do not want to suffer from the same ailment. The hon. member was almost insulting, and I say that he achieves nothing by that. I can just say, in passing, that I am disappointed. The other day the shadow cabinet of the Opposition appeared in the <i>Argus,</i> but I did not see his name there, and he will never get there either if this is the way he conducts himself. I explained to him in the Second Reading why this amendment is here, because this is the way this works in practice. He asked whether land which has been excluded is now being included again. That is correct. What was previously excluded is now being included. The hon. member for Newton Park said that newcomers who wanted to live around the municipal area and wanted to subdivide &#x2026;</p>

I said this legislation does not apply to Bantu, Coloured or Rehoboth land. I stated expressly that this is the case because they have a different system to ours; they have a system of chiefs, and it is their own land, and our department does not want to exercise control over the work of Bantu Administration and Development.

<p>That you must discuss with that hon. Minister. They have a completely different system&#x2014;a system of chiefs, etc. The hon. member said he had confidence in the farmer, that the farmer would not subdivide, but I think the hon. member has far more confidence in the land speculators in our country than in the farmers, for I have stated repeatedly that the municipalities and the provinces tell us that they do not have the machinery which the Department of Agricultural Technical Services has to determine what constitutes an economic unit. He asks why the municipalities cannot determine this. But here there is a department with highly trained technicians who are determining this, and both the provinces and the municipalities are requesting us to help them with that staff.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. member for Green Point that he should not in any way insinuate that the hon. the Minister of Community Development had said there were 80 000 people waiting for houses, and that this matter would delay everything. It is not in any way our intention to cause a delay in the establishment of housing amenities with this legislation. We will go out of our way to facilitate matters as much as possible when townships are being established, because we realize that the prices of plots are going up, and the fewer delays, the better. The department of the hon. the Minister and the hon. Minister himself have also told us that when it comes to the establishment of townships we must do so as quickly as possible. So do not create the idea that we want to put machinery into operation here which will delay the establishment of townships, etc. That is not the intention. But if only you can get one thing into your head. This matter is not concerned solely with the areas around the towns. The legislation as a whole deals with subdivision in an orderly and correct manner in a fine country, because we know that we must find 50 million people a place to stay within the next 30 years. We are not so stupid as to say that this is agricultural land, and that it will always remain agricultural land. We do have the intelligence to know&#x2014;something the hon. member for Newton Park cannot realize&#x2014;that if you have wonderful loamy soil near Stellenbosch, which is among the best vineyard soil in the world, and right next door to this farm you have a rocky outcrop on which nothing can be produced, and if the farmers themselves are asking: Protect this jewel of ours which can result in agricultural production, and establish the town on the unproductive sandy soil or on the rocky outcrops, then we say we are no longer considering the money individuals are able to make; we are considering posterity.

I see that the hon. member for False Bay is waving his hand. If the hon. the Deputy Minister is really concerned with not imposing any hindrance on the provision of housing, why then must he accept the amendment to the section as it now stands in the Act&#x003F; The Act as it now stands excludes property which is within municipal or local board areas, or very broadly, local authority areas. There are two amendments: the one which is in the draft of the Bill before us, and the amendment moved by the hon. member for False Bay, aimed at extending the net with regard to what is agricultural land so as to cover, in certain circumstances, land which is within a municipal area. What astounds me is that the hon. member for False Bay&#x2014;I do hope he will respond to this&#x2014;who has had experience in the provincial administration with the establishment of township, town planning, etc., can believe that these two amendments namely the deletion of section 1 (f) and the extension of the powers over land which is agricultural land within a municipal boundary, are not going to inhibit the development of townships to provide housing within municipal areas.</p>

<p>This is bound to create one more obstacle. Obstacles already exist for anybody who wishes to establish a township or subdivided estate for housing. There are enough authorities he must go to already. Now there is another added, namely the Minister of Agriculture, who is not primarily concerned with housing of the urban population, but with the agricultural prosperity of the country and assistance to the farmers.</p>

<p><span class="col_2697-2698" refersTo="page_1366"/>I want to mention some figures which are material and relevant here. I have said before and I want to repeat that the Government is putting the clock back by introducing this. I say this for a reason. According to a report in the <i>Volkshandel</i> a year ago:</p>

<block name="quote">Daar is vandag sowat 3,3 miljoen Blankes in ons stede teenoor 2,1 miljoen in 1946, toe 75,6 persent verstedelik was teenoor sowat 87 persent tans.</block>

<p>If that is the growth of our urban population, surely it cannot be contradicted that more and more land is required for housing in the urban complexes. If more and more land is required, surely one does not want to introduce on to our Statute Book legislation which can&#x2014;I shall not put it any stronger&#x2014;withdraw from those local authority areas land which could otherwise be used for housing. This situation concerns me, because I know the problems the hon. the Minister of Community Development and his department have. They have untold problems. One of the greatest problems, which was found by his commission and reflected in his own statements, is the uncertainty experienced by persons who wished to establish townships for residential purposes. They do not know when they are going to get the authority, or how long it is going to take. With the interest rates as they are at present, every month of delay in the approval and the making available of land for housing purposes pushes up the price of the erf concerned. Can the hon. the Deputy Minister really conceive any circumstances even in Paarl itself, or in any of the other towns that he has mentioned, where the land which is within the town itself is not more likely to be required for individual housing purposes&#x003F; There is a demand, an insatiable demand, in every urban area for more land for housing purpose. By all means, let the hon. the Minister take these powers&#x2014;and he has them under the present Act&#x2014;to deal with agricultural land which is agricultural land at the moment and not land which has already been enveloped in a municipal area. It has already been enveloped in the process of time. Surely that is land, that is property, which should be excluded. This is not a matter of attempting to put hindrances in the way of the hon. the Minister, because if a man knows that he is in a municipal area and if the municipality has approved of a town planning scheme, this land of his can be used for residential purposes and he can go ahead and subdivide the land into plots available for housing purposes. By the amendments which are proposed to this clause, we shall introduce two further hindrances and stumbling blocks&#x2014;&#x201C;struikelblokke&#x201D;&#x2014;which will cause persons to hesitate in the investment of money in housing projects. It will cause them to hesitate because they will now have another authority to go to. Within a municipal or local area there is another authority to go to for the establishment of housing. I want to appeal to the hon. the Deputy Minister to give this serious consideration. I have not heard of any argument which, in the realities of today&#x2019;s growth and the realities of today&#x2019;s population movement into the cities justify one to say that any city, that any municipality is likely to be able to give up land rather than to acquire more land within its boundaries to house the people who are moving into the cities. I want to make a very serious appeal to the hon. the Deputy Minister not to accept the amendments which have been moved by the hon. member for False Bay. I would appeal to him not to proceed with the deletion of the existing subsection (1) (f) as it stands in the law at the present moment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not think that the hon. the Deputy Minister really appreciates the problems that he is creating. Therefore I am pleased to see that the hon. the Minister of Community Development is in the House. I hope he will pay attention to this debate and perhaps discuss this matter again with the hon. the Deputy Minister before this Bill goes to the Other Place, because it is obvious that we are unlikely to have any success with the hon. the Deputy Minister in this Committee. I would like to develop the argument which has been presented to this Committee a moment ago by the hon. member for Green Point. Land which is already in a local authority area is obviously land which is intended for future residential development or perhaps future industrial development. However it is, above all, not intended for future agricultural activities. It may continue to be used for agricultural purposes for a few years to come, depending on the growth of that particular town or city, but the very fact that that land has been incorporated within the area of jurisdiction of the local authority implies necessarily that it is intended, <span class="col_2699-2700" refersTo="page_1367"/>that it is earmarked, for future expansion of that town or city for future residential or industrial development. In those circumstances I cannot see how the hon. the Deputy Minister can justify his interfering. He is now taking the power to be able to take from that local authority area certain portions and declare them to be agricultural land. The hon. the Deputy Minister may think that this is a simple matter. He merely earmarks that particular land within the local authority area as agricultural land and that is the end of the matter. The local authority then knows that that area cannot be dealt with for future expansion and that they must look elsewhere for future expansion. But does the hon. the Deputy Minister realize what that implies&#x003F; A local authority is obliged to prepare a town planning scheme for its area in which areas are zoned for future residential development, for single residential development, for high-rise development, for industry, for playing fields, for schools, for churches and so forth. That plan is prepared so that it is a co-ordinated whole, so that it is a cohesive whole and so that it is able to be developed in the future in the best interest of that community. If you now extract portions of that plan and say that that particular land which has been prepared for future urban development of one sort or another, is now earmarked for agricultural purposes, in many instances you destroy the plan completely. You then have to start afresh to devise a new town planning scheme for that town. It does not always necessarily mean that that will be the effect. I concede that. But in many cases &#x2014;and I would go so far as to say in most cases&#x2014;if a substantial area is declared to be agricultural land, it will mean that that local authority will have to start again and reconsider its whole town planning scheme with a view to establishing whether or not the zoning of that particular land changes the plan to such an extent that they will have to start again. Does the hon. the Deputy Minister realize what position he is placing the local authorities in&#x003F; Whenever they spend time and money on preparing a town planning scheme, at the back of their minds all the time there is the possibility that this work may be wasted, the time spent may be useless and they may have to start again because of the actions of this Deputy Minister. Does the hon. the Minister of Community Development think that that is a situation which is in the best interests of the future planning of this country&#x003F; The hon. the Minister of Community Development knows already the problems that not only township developers face but that local authorities face in regard to proper planning for the future of their towns and cities. To have another problem of this sort intervening, will create even greater delays, even greater problems and above all, will be discouraging for local authorities because they will never know whether a plan that they have spent a great deal of time and money on conceiving and preparing will be ruined by this Deputy Minister.</p>

<p>I want to come to another matter which was raised by the hon. the Deputy Minister. He said that a number of these local authorities are expanding their areas, taking agricultural land just to increase their rates. He made a great point of this. He now nods his head. If there are some instances, I suggest that those are rare and exceptional because a local authority cannot expand its area without the &#x2026;</p>

<p>They cannot expand their area without the approval of the Provincial Executive Committee. If, in fact, in the Transvaal local authorities are expanding indiscriminately, the Deputy Minister must speak to his own Nationalist administrators and the Executive Committee in the Transvaal and get them to do their job properly. It is nonsense to suggest that a local authority is going to expand its boundaries indiscriminately just to earn greater rates. Very few local authorities would be so irresponsible, and I again reiterate that if they were to do so irresponsibly, the provincial administration will not allow them to do so. For the hon. the Deputy Minister to suggest this as an argument to justify these amendments is nonsense. The hon. the Deputy Minister completely overlooks the delaying factors that he is introducing. Already the problems of township development are subject to inordinate delays These have been improved since the Niemand Committee&#x2019;s recommendations are beginning to be put into operation, but there are still long delays The hon. the Minister must not suggest to this Committee that when applications are made to his department, that they are dealt with promptly. They are not dealt with promptly and there are long delays, in the same way as other applications that <span class="col_2701-2702" refersTo="page_1368"/>are made to the Department of Planning for example Not only are there long delays, but his department, because he has no knowledge of what is involved, is imposing ridiculous conditions I will put one to him.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. D. DEACON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Deputy Minister is a very nice chap,

 and I am quite sure that he is motivated by very high principles. He has, however, come to this House with the wrong legislation and is also very badly informed on the Cape Province. In reply to what I said about the double load of fixed property taxation in Paarl, he referred me to the new section 3 (f) added to clause 3, which reads as follows: &#x201C;No area of jurisdiction, local area, public health area, peri-urban area or other area referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of the definition of &#x2018;agricultural land&#x2019; in section 1 shall be established on, or enlarged so as to include, any land which is agricultural land, unless the Minister has consented in writing to the subdivision, vesting, registration, sale, offer, advertisement, establishment or enlargement concerned.&#x201D; Now what has this to do with the specific farms that we were talking about in Paarl which are being affected by the amendment of the hon. member for False Bay&#x003F; Those farms are already within the municipal area and are already paying municipal tax and divisional council tax. How can the hon. the Deputy Minister then tell me that the new section 3 (f) is going to help them in any way whatsoever&#x003F; If he is going to accept this amendment he must guarantee to those farmers and to this Committee that they will have sufficient deductions on fixed property tax to bring them into line with farmers outside the municipal area. If necessary, he will have to subsidize the municipality or divisional council for their loss in revenue. I believe that this is absolutely necessary. You cannot make fish of the one and fowl of the other.</p>

<p>I now come to a further point in connection with this amendment. This amendment has an absolutely opposite effect to what the hon. the Deputy Minister says he has in mind in this legislation. The hon. the Deputy Minister tells us that he is trying to prevent subdivision in order to encourage consolidation. I believe that is correct and that is what he is trying to do, but what will he be doing if he accepts this amendment of the hon. member for False Bay&#x003F;</p>

<p>All he will be doing then is to force farmers to remain on the land whether their properties remain economic or not. This is far more restrictive than any other part of this legislation that he is trying to force upon these people. He deprives them of their right of freehold, because if the Minister declares this land to be agricultural land in terms of this Bill they will still be in a municipal area because they cannot get out of it. There they will sit, with the town around them, with their houses in the main street, unless the hon. the Deputy Minister gives the guarantee I mentioned earlier, namely that he should give a balancing of taxation to these people. It must be done. You cannot expect one farmer to pay an excess of fixed property tax.</p>

<p>The hon. member for False Bay said that the Cape Provincial Council welcomed his amendment.</p>

<p>No, that is not nonsense. Why must they inconvenience the

 individual farmer in Paarl because they want to keep a monument&#x003F; I believe they want to preserve the beauty of those farms. They are beautiful, but it is a nonsensical idea to force certain people to do things simply because certain people in authority would like to preserve the beauty of the farms. I also believe that we should try to preserve the beauty, but for heaven&#x2019;s sake, let the individual know what he is doing. The hon. the Deputy Minister mentioned the case of Stellenbosch, but it was at the request of the Stellenbosch people that it was done. Surely, the farmers of Paarl can do the same. The Stellenbosch farmers asked that the agricultural land be preserved. I believe that this is the way it should work. Let us not work from up above; let us not restrict people.</p>

<p><span class="col_2703-2704" refersTo="page_1369"/>There is another point. Many towns in this country have huge commonages which are municipal areas. Now the Minister, in terms of this amendment, will have the right to declare all those commonages agricultural land.

<p>It does not matter how many there are, whether there are 10 or

What will the norm be now&#x003F; Suppose the Minister declares those farms to be agricultural land. If it is subdivided, what is the norm going to be&#x003F; Is it going to be that R4 000 story again, that there must be an economic income of R4 000&#x003F; There is no argument for that R4 000 story, because the progressive, economic farmer will never show a R4 000 profit on his balance-sheet. He ploughs that money back into his farm and he shows a small profit. Some of them show a loss year after year. The hon. the Deputy Minister knows that himself. He is a big farmer, and he probably does it himself; he develops his farm. How are you going to apply that norm of R4 000&#x003F; How are you going to know whether or not that farm is economic&#x003F; No, Sir, I reject this amendment of the hon. member for False Bay completely.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when I last rose to speak, I made the point that the hon. the Deputy Minister and his department were causing delays and I reiterate it now. But apart from it, they are imposing conditions which are unreasonable, clearly because they are inexperienced in the field of township development and they do not appreciate what is involved. This is the only explanation that can be given for the sort of conditions imposed in this particular instance. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is a condition of this consent that&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>1. (a) the subdivisional diagram for the portion of Farm &#x2026; measuring approximately &#x2026; hectare, which represents the outside figure of the proposed township may only be approved by the Surveyor-General after the Administrator&#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(i) has granted permission in writing for the establishment of a township &#x2026;</li>

</ol>

</li>

</ol>

<p>That is perfectly all right, but then it goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and (not or)</block>

<ol>

<li>(ii) has issued conditions of establishment.</li>

</ol>

<p>Anyone who has had any experience at all of township development will know that there are a great many steps that can be taken before the issue of conditions of establishment, to reduce the delay. One of the normal steps that are taken before the issue of conditions of establishment is to obtain the Surveyor-General&#x2019;s approval of the subdivisional diagrams. Whereas this is the normal procedure, because of this condition imposed by the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s department, it cannot be done. It means that the delay up to the stage of the issue of conditions of establishment is even greater, because the applicant can only lodge his survey diagram for approval by the Surveyor-General after the conditions of establishment have been issued. I ask the hon. the Deputy Minister to look into this matter and to discuss the conditions that are being imposed with, possibly, provincial administrations, who know a lot more about the matter than the Department of Agriculture, which has only just started to become involved. His department is creating more and more frustration, delays and annoyance to people who legitimately wish to subdivide their properties for one reason or another, and especially to those who wish to subdivide for the purpose of township development.</p>

<speech by="#heunis">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. HEUNIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to say at once that the hon. member for Albany amazes me. The hon. member says that these people have freehold title. Apparently he suggests that there should be no control whatsoever over the property where the person possesses it in terms of a freehold title. What really upsets me is the fact that the hon. member for Green Point charges me with having <span class="col_2705-2706" refersTo="page_1370"/>quoted from the Niemand Report, which I did not do. But I want to go further. The hon. member&#x2019;s standpoint is that the legislation and the amendment which I moved would militate against the interests of the township developer, with prejudicial effects to the housing situation as it exists at present. That is the core of the argument put forward by the hon. member. Other hon. members repeated his argument on the same point in other respects. Sir, what are the facts&#x003F; The fact of the matter is that land can be utilized for various purposes, regardless of whether it is situated in an urban or rural management area. I think hon. members agree with me on this.</p>

<p>I think there is a second matter in regard to which hon. members on the opposite side agree with me. This is that in respect of the utilization of land there should be some or other form of control. I think the hon. member for Green Point agrees with me on this. Town planning is only another form of control over the utilization of land. As soon as hon. members accept the principle that land is from time to time required for various purposes, this presupposes that the authorities to whom certain powers have been entrusted will make proper arrangements for the rights owners have in respect of the use of that land. Surely the hon. member for Albany is completely out of step when he advocates absolute freedom of the rights owners have in regard to the use of their land. Surely this does not happen anywhere, except as advocated by people with a <i>laissez faire</i> attitude, such as that hon. member, who became an exponent of that this afternoon. I want to tell the hon. member for Green Point that I personally reject the attempt he made to play off the needs of the town dwellers in respect of housing against the needs of our agricultural industry. [Interjection.] Yes, that is what the hon. member is doing.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member would do well not to speak on the basis of the limited knowledge he has.

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Greenpoint must not make of this a peg on

 which to hang an idea which does not exist. I said, when I gave notice of my amendment, that there were lands within the areas of urban local authorities which were being utilized for agricultural purposes, and should be so utilized, but that this should not be a static situation. Why are hon. members on the opposite side not prepared to admit that there are different needs for people which have to be accomodated within a planning situation, of which housing requirements are one, of which industrial development is another, and of which recreation is a third, and of which agricultural development a fourth&#x003F; We will never make progress with orderly planning, where the necessary evaluation of all these requirements has to take place, if we are not prepared to get away from the idea that all we have to do is score debating points off one another and make a political issue of a matter which is a very serious one. That is all the hon. member wants to do. The hon. member for Musgrave is a know-all and he stated here in bombastic language that all urban areas had been planned. Sir, surely not all urban areas have been planned. I do not know in what century the hon. member is living. Do you know, Sir, that in the Cape with its extensive areas, there is essential planning of towns&#x2014;that is true. But within its own area of jurisdiction there are large tracts which do not form part of its planning scheme and which have not been zoned at all for any specific purpose. The point I want to emphasize, in reply to what that hon. member said, is that within urban areas land has also been zoned for agriculture by the local authority&#x003F; Is that wrong&#x003F;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. HEUNIS</person>:</from>

<p>I say there are such areas; I did not say that they are all like this. Does that mean now that they have to zone that land for a specific purpose <i>ad infinitum</i>&#x003F; The answer is obviously &#x201C;no&#x201D;. Then the hon. member for Green Point made the generalization that in every urban area there is an urgent need for <span class="col_2707-2708" refersTo="page_1371"/>plots, and that included townships. But, Sir, it seems as if he is concentrating on Cape Town, for surely that statement is not true.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that I think that this amendment, and the legislation, empowers this department to control and for the purpose for which it is responsible and that it will do this in a responsible way, in conjunction with other organizations which control land for purposes for which they in turn are responsible. This Department will, together with the other departments, draw up guide plans, undertake the evaluation process and establish what interests in a particular area or a particular town are decisive. If there is a need for residential development, that will be the prevailing principle, and if it is agriculture, that in turn will be the prevailing principle. In other words, for the first time we have an opportunity, with this amendment and this legsilation, to acquire, in conjunction with the provincial administrations and local authorities, an orderly plan for the rights in respect of the use of land, in accordance with the needs which will from time to time prevail.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to the remark made by the hon. the Deputy Minister, i.e. that we, in our opposition to this clause, are in fact siding with the land speculators. Sir, we on this side of the House are not siding with the land speculators; we are in the first place siding with the farmers. In the second place, if any person wants to sub-divide his land, he must now go hat in hand to a certain party and say; &#x201C;Please, may I subdivide my land for this or that purpose&#x003F;&#x201D; As the hon. member for Green Point was quite right in saying, there is not only one organization involved in this matter: there are also the provincial administrations, the Minister of Planning, the Minister of Community Development and now the Minister of Agriculture as well. The argument of this side of the House is that in terms of the present legislation in the Statute Book we have the provincial authorities and the local authorities which can deal with this type of thing.</p>

<p>If agricultural land is situated within the area of jurisdiction

 of a town, who is responsible then if that municipality wants to

 lay out a new residential area in that town&#x003F; Surely application has to be made to the provincial authority and the townships commission and if they approve of it, it is allowed. The hon. member is saying now that they do not have the power. Our standpoint is that it is not necessary also for these organizations to have a say in regard to agricultural land which is situated in a township. The farmer must be able to do what he likes with his land. If he wants to set aside a portion of his land for industrial development, for township development or for residential area development within that township, why should the minister have the right to say whether the farmer may do that or not&#x003F; I could to a certain extent understand this if it was an agricultural area outside the jurisdiction of a municipality, but within a municipal area it is to my mind simply impossible to understand this. The hon. the Deputy Minister told us in his reply that the officials of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services are the people who can give the answers in this respect, as if the local authorities do not co-operate today with Agricultural Technical Services. Many of the local authorities have commonages; they lease that land; soil conservation work has to be done on that land, and who does the hon. the Deputy Minister think gives them advice&#x003F; No one but the local extension officers. The services of the local extension officers are already available to the local authorities. If they think it is good agricultural land and that it should not be used for township development, then there is nothing to stop them going to the local extension officers and asking their advice. The hon. the Deputy Minister has now advanced that as an argument as to why he agrees with the amendment moved by the hon. member for False Bay. I also want to point out to the hon. the Deputy Minister that if he omits this paragraph (f), as he intends doing&#x2014;it reads as follows: &#x201C;Land zoned for any particular purpose under a town planning scheme which is in force in terms of any law&#x201D;&#x2014;it means that the hon. gentleman can wipe out any township planning scheme which is already on the drawing board, in respect of which <span class="col_2709-2710" refersTo="page_1372"/>plans are being drawn up, and which is on the verge of being put into effect, if it were to be situated on good agricultural land.

But I want to deal with the amendment of the hon. member for False Bay. Unfortunately he is not here, but I am sure the hon. the Deputy Minister can handle it without his support. I want to say a few words to the hon. member for False Bay in connection with his amendment, and his defence of this amendment, where he refers to thousands of acres of land which is unzoned in local authority areas. I guess that what he is referring to is the commonage areas of these small townships and villages. I am sorry the hon. member is not here because I would have liked to put this question to him pertinently, but perhaps the hon. the Deputy Minister can answer the question. Is he asking that the Minister of Agriculture should take control of this land even to the point of putting a farmer on it&#x003F; Because the object of the Act which is now being amended is to retain land for the purposes of producing food, or for agricultural purposes.</p>

<p>Yes, butter included. Is this the intention of the hon. member for

 False Bay when he moves this amendment&#x003F; I would like a reply to that question, because if that is so I believe that the local authorities must know what is happening on the Government side in regard to this amendment before it is passed by this house. I am sure that if it is the intention that the hon. the Minister should take control of the land for agricultural purposes, it would also mean, in terms of a further amendment in this Bill, that the Minister could determine the use for the land as well, and is it the Minister&#x2019;s intention to put farmers on that land to farm it&#x003F;</p>

<p>But there is another aspect to this amendment as well. The Pietermaritzburg Corporation owns vast areas of land which is under agricultural use at the moment. There are hundreds of acres of timber planted on commonage land which belongs to the Pietermaritzburg Corporation. But that is land which is earmarked and used for extensions to the residential area of Pietermaritzburg as and when required in exactly the same way as the commonage land to which the hon. member for False Bay refers has been set aside for further development of the local authorities concerned, but they need not encroach on the land which the Minister of Agriculture has already taken control of, i.e. genuine farm land. Now, is it the object of this hon. Minister to take over the control of that land from the Pietermaritzburg Corporation&#x003F; Is it his intention to say to the Pietermaritzburg Corporation that they may do this on that land but they may not do that&#x003F; All this must be known before this House is asked to approve of this amendment of the hon. member for False Bay.</p>

<p>I want to come also to the amendment moved by the hon. member for Newton Park, and this is to introduce this new paragraph (f) which reads &#x201C;land zoned for any particular purpose under a town planning scheme which is in force in terms of any law&#x201D;. The effect of the amendment of course is to withdraw land which is the subject of a town planning scheme from the control of this Minister. Now I submit that we already have control of that land through the hon. the Minister of Planning in terms of the Physical Planning Act. But I want to remind the hon. the Deputy Minister of his words when he introduced the Second Reading debate on this particular Bill, where, in dealing with paragraph (t) he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Because most town planning schemes are situated within the areas of jurisdiction of municipal authorities, the object envisaged in the original measure is not being achieved.</block>

<p>What does he mean by that&#x003F; He means that he has not been able to take control of those areas which are the subject of a town planning scheme. He is prepared in terms of the further amendment which he <span class="col_2711-2712" refersTo="page_1373"/>moves now to forgo the control of an area which is the subject of a town planning scheme when it falls within the area of jurisdiction of a local authority, but what about those which are outside the area of jurisdiction of a local authority&#x003F; We have a township developing in my constituency at the moment on a piece of land, a farm, which up to four years ago was producing, but which was sub-divided in 1850. In 1850 a town planning scheme for that particular farm was approved. In terms of that town planning scheme, only within the last four years has the development taken place and has the township now developed, providing much-needed homes for the hard-pressed people of Pietermaritzburg, because it is in close proximity to Pietermaritzburg. But if this amendment of the hon. the Minister had been in force and the amendment of the hon. member for Newton Park had been rejected, the Minister would have been able to prevent that development. Now, what does he want to stop that kind of development for&#x003F; Over the years we have had various authorities and bodies which have had control over this subdivision of land and in their wisdom I believe that they have done an excellent job of work. But there are in Natal, at least, many such farms which have been subdivided, at least on paper, if not actually surveyed, to which a town planning scheme applies in terms of the Private Townships Ordinance of Natal, and which is a valid town planning scheme. This hon. Minister is now taking the power to wine out any benefit which a landowner may have in terms of that town planning scheme. Sir, that landowner has gone to considerable expense to obtain approval for the establishment of a private township in terms of the Private Townships Ordinance. He has had not only legal expenses but also surveyors expenses. If this hon. Deputy Minister is now going to take the power to wipe out any approval which a landowner may have in terms of such a town planning scheme, is he prepared to compensate such a landowner for any potential loss that there may be&#x003F;</p>

<p>But he goes even further. If this hon. Minister is going to take control of all the land outside the area of jurisdiction of a local authority, and even some of the land within the area of jurisdiction of a local authority, where are the local authorities going to expand&#x003F; They can only expand with the approval of this hon.

<p>Here we have the Minister of Community Development accepting that we need these regional plans for development, but this hon. Minister is going to stymie the Minister of Community Development. Why do we need control by Agriculture as well&#x003F; To me this is incomprehensible. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District has quoted from Hansard what I said during the Second Reading. I have already replied to a question in this connection. The hon. member must understand that we have been busy for about 2<b><i>&#x00BC;</i></b> hours now while he only came in 20 minutes ago. I cannot reply to all those questions again, because that would be a repetition of what I have already said. I want to ask the hon. member to read my Hansard instead, because those very words of mine were quoted by another member. Therefore I have already replied to it.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke of land in the possession of the Pietermaritzburg City Council on which forestry is practised. Many farmers have land adjoining a municipal area. I have already replied to that as well <span class="col_2713-2714" refersTo="page_1374"/>The hon. member for Green Point spoke of areas which were specifically excluded. I see that the hon. member is not here&#x2014; then I shall leave it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Musgrave referred to delays. There is the pilot plan committee under the Department of Planning. The hon. member referred to delays in connection with a series of applications for subdivisions made in the past and said: &#x201C;I know it is a waste of time.&#x201D; Let him bring me one case where we did not act promptly. I gave the figures yesterday in connection with applications for subdivisions, appeals received by us and the speed with which it is dealt with when there is an application for subdivision. Most of the applications for subdivision are cases which can go through unaltered where the Surveyor-General has our norm himself and can refer them to us very quickly. I have not encountered delays. The hon. member must just give me an example of how long the delay was in getting through an application for subdivision.</p>

<p>The hon. member, as well as the hon. member for Albany, said that

 I was talking nonsense when I said that the proposed new section 3 (f) would help to ensure that a man was not doubly taxed. The Bill specifically provides: &#x201C;&#x2026; shall be established on, or enlarged so as to include, any land which is agricultural land, unless the Minister has consented in writing to this subdivision, vesting, registration, &#x2026; or enlargement concerned.&#x201D; I want to give the hon. member a practical example.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>When I have given my example the hon. member may ask his question. I received a letter from a chap called Pieter Knoesen. He said that he was farming next to the town and that he had received a letter from the municipality in which he was informed that the municipality was going to enlarge the town area and include 600 morgen of his farm and that he had the right to object within 14 days. And he did object, but they told him that his objection would not be heard and that that land was going to be incorporated with the town area. Hon. members on that side are so fond of the farmers! This chap then received an account for property tax amounting to R704 from that town council, and this was approved by the province. Now he is paying a double tax. This is prohibited by the proposed new section 3 (f). Pieter Knoesen is getting neither a road, nor sewerage, nor a rubbish-cart; he is getting sweet blow-all to help him. Hon. members say that they want to help the farmers and I have now given a practical example of a man who pays R704 in taxes to help that particular little municipality with additional revenue. That is why we have the proposed section 3(f).</p>

<p>Now I come to a further point of the hon. member for musgrave, namely the permission of the Surveyor-General. That is so. Let me tell the hon. member that the province of Natal was also consulted in this matter. I am being honest when I say that the province of Natal is favourably disposed towards this matter. We corresponded with them in connection with requests for subdivisions. They may not be so hot as M.E.C.s, but I think they have very competent officials. Natal is the garden province of our country and they want to keep it that way. That is why they agree with us in regard to most of these matters. They ask us to see to it that our soil is subdivided in an orderly way.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister has missed my point completely. The question which I put to him is why does his department stipulate a condition such as the one which I read out, because the effect of that condition is that there must be delay. No application can be submitted to the Surveyor-General for the approval of the diagrams until the issue of conditions of establishment. The point I made is that that is quite unnecessary and that it causes delay. That is the question that I would like to put to him.</p>

<p>The Surveyor-General has more or less the idea, but he must bring

He must find out whether it is an economic unit or not. There might be <span class="col_2715-2716" refersTo="page_1375"/>a delay of two weeks, but I would like to have a definite example and then I will go into the matter.</p>

<p>You must not try to be popular by saying <i>laissez-faire.</i> I told you yesterday that a good Government is a Government which can tell a man &#x201C;no&#x201D; or &#x201C;yes&#x201D;, and it does not matter if we make an enemy along the way. Our children will thank us one day for not allowing the country to be ruined. The hon. member for Albany must be careful as well. He says we cannot define an economic unit because you will never get a farmer who shows a profit of R4 000, because he is &#x2026; In other words, the farmer is dishonest because he does not pay income tax. I want to tell the hon. member that I do not want to catch him out; I wish it had been said by another person. I should not like to be at loggerheads with him because he is a decent person. I say that there are many farmers who pay there taxes and now the hon. member for Newton Park says he does not want the farmer to go around asking hat in hand. He says he is on the side of the farmers, but I have repeatedly said that we were asked to introduce this measure by all five agricultural unions, the wool growers association&#x2014;every body, in fact. The hon. member wants to be popular among the farmers and he wants to follow the policy of <i>laissez-faire.</i> Is the hon. member prepared to grant a Land Bank loan to a man with a small-holding&#x003F; No, he will not reply to that, but he will allow that land to be subdivided without exercising any control. We say we cannot allow that sort of thing to go on. That hon. member admits himself that you cannot grant a Land Bank loan to a man with 25 morgen.</p>

He quoted the case of Knoesen in connection with the enlargement of a municipal area. I am now talking about the farms which are already within a municipal area and which can now be declared agricultural land in terms of this legislation.

<p>It will be balanced, but as far as this amendment of the hon. member for False Bay is concerned, I am sure that this only applies to three municipal authorities at most.

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the original Act provides that under certain circumstances the Act will not be applicable to Government bodies. In terms of this clause the Act is now made applicable to South-West Africa as well, and that means that any person may subdivide land, without having regard to the provisions of this Act, and hand it over to the Administration of South-West Africa. Sir, it is by no means my intention to repeat arguments that have been advanced before, but I should like to propose, in keeping with what our attitude was in the past, that this clause be rejected because it is our feeling that a Government department should not be excluded from the provisions of this Act.</p>

<p>In this case it means, therefore, that an individual who wishes to cut off any portion of his land and make it available to the Administration of South-West Africa, need not be at all concerned about the provisions of this Act. To us it is quite inexplicable why the individual land owner is expected to comply with the provisions of this Act, but when he hands over the land to the Administration of South-West Africa, he is free to subdivide, irrespective of whether this is done in accordance with the requirements laid down by the hon. the Minister. That is why we are opposed to this clause.</p>

<p>Clause 3:</p>

<speech by="#palm">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. D. PALM</person>:</from>

<p>This clause provides that before any agricultural land may be subdivided, the Minister has to grant his consent to such subdivision. In his Second Reading speech the hon. the Deputy Minister very clearly told us what the three fundamental matters were which are involved in this clause. I should like to mention these three points, and then I want to come back to them and deal with the hon. member for Newton Park. The hon. the Minister said, in the first place, that this clause sought to prevent persons from using long-term leases in order to evade the Act and, in the second place, that this section was being introduced in order to prevent the exploitation of the general public, and, in the third place, that he wanted to prevent good agricultural land from being used unnecessarily by township developers. These are the three very clear points which the hon. the Deputy Minister made. But now I have a problem with the hon. member for Newton Park. Whether he has wilfully twisted the words of the hon. the Minister or &#x2026;</p>

<p>Then I withdraw it. Now, what did the hon. member for Newton Park say&#x003F; He said that this clause now meant that no farmer could lease any portion of his farm. Sir, surely this is not correct. He said that the Minister now wanted to interfere with what a farmer could earn. He went on to say that the clause was much wider in scope and interfered with those local authorities which might require certain agricultural land for township development, and he also said that the Minister could now prevent any further development. Sir, this clause is very clear, and the Minister told us that he would only prevent good agricultural land from being used, and that as far as it was in his power, agricultural land should be retained for agricultural use. But now the hon. member comes along and he actually says things which I honestly believe are things he did not mean, or perhaps he did not understand the hon. the Minister, but he says that the object of this clause is to take a firm grip on the owners of agricultural land, and then he calls it the worst form of socialism. I think that is outrageous. Whether the hon. member for Newton Park made this speech with a view to Oudtshoorn, I do not know, but I am sure that the story will now be spread there that this side of the House and this Government now want to prevent a farmer from leasing his farm or a portion of it. Sir, it often happens that one farmer leases a portion of his farm to a neighbour or to another person for farming purposes, and therefore we just want to ask him to make it very clear that this section does not seek to prevent one owner from leasing a portion of his farm to another person or another farmer for agricultural purposes.</p>

<speech by="#deacon">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. D. DEACON</person>:</from>

<p>As I have indicated on the Order Paper, we intend opposing this

 clause because it appears to us that this again is legislation brought in by the Minister to legislate for a problem which arises mainly in the Transvaal, and that is this question of plots. We have no real problem of this kind in the Cape Province: in fact it is very limited here, but he always mentions certain areas that he knows of in the Transvaal when he talks about plots in reply to the debate. We have our problems about this, as I mentioned in the Second Reading. I do not want to name these areas again, but there are instances where stands in the past have been leased to people for a long time, over a long period of time, and where temporary structures have been put up on the private properties and these are not surveyed. I should like the hon. the Minister to pay attention here because I am repeating something that he nveer adequately replied to in the Second Reading. There are areas, holiday resorts along the coast-line of the Cape, which have never actually been surveyed. They are on private property and temporary structures are allowed to be erected on these properties as holiday houses. These temporary structures are sold from time to time by one family to another. Now as I read (e) this can also upset the resale of this type of property and there <span class="col_2725-2726" refersTo="page_1380"/>are many of these areas which have traditionally been there, some of them for over a hundred years, and of various sizes. Families have got used to going down to them and enjoying their holidays once or twice a year, for the health of the family. These are simple holiday resorts. They are cheap places to go to and spend a holiday at. We know that with the classification of our hotels today it is almost impossible for the average family man to go and spend a holiday in a hotel. Consequently he acquires a caravan and our roads are cluttered up with caravans. I appeal to the Minister to be very careful about this (e) because it will cause complications which will cause unnecessary hardships to people. These holiday resorts are not in fact taking up agricultural land; they take up part of private land along the coastal area, and I sincerely hope that the hon. the Minister will reply and that he will tell us that he will deal sympathetically with any such cases. We feel that there is an extension of powers here in regard to controlling the lease of land. The hon. member for Worcester attempted to reply to that, but here too it says that no lease in respect of a portion of agricultural land shall be registered in a deeds registry. There are so many that are not registered. Are these allowed or are they not, because it starts off by saying that no lease in respect of a portion of agricultural land can be registered. Is this only in terms of long leases, that have to be registered over a period of 25 years or 99 years, or does it apply also to short-term leases where a widowed woman lets her farm to somebody to help her through a difficult period.</p>

<p>I am glad to hear that. Then we come to (f). I would say that no local authority may extend its area of jurisdiction without the Minister&#x2019;s approval. In the last debate he spoke under the first clause about this question, and the question of Stellenbosch was raised, but Stellenbosch itself said that they wanted to go that way. If the local authority approves, and knows what the position is in its own area, why must we now poke our noses in there&#x003F; We feel that this is not a clause we can vote for and therefore we will oppose it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there are several reasons why we cannot support this clause. The hon. member for Albany has given some of them. I want to deal more closely with paragraph (f). This is a curious provision, as I pointed out during the Second Reading debate and again I must point out to the hon. the Deputy Minister that he did not answer the arguments which I advanced in relation to this matter. This Bill, as it stands at the moment, purports to deal with the subdivision of agricultural land; it purports to curb the subdivision of agricultural land. In terms of paragraph (f) the Minister is now introducing a power which will enable him to have a say not only in regard to subdivision, but in regard to any dealing with an entire farm so far as a local authority is concerned. It is not limited to subdivision only but (f) provides that no area of jurisdiction of a local authority may be extended by the acquisition&#x2014;I am now summarising&#x2014;of land which is agricultural land. In other words, a local authority will not be able to extend its boundaries to take in an entire farm, let alone a subdivided farm. A provision dealing with entire farms is quite out of place in a Bill which only deals with subdivision as the title itself makes clear. I think that the hon. the Deputy Minister should reconsider that aspect of the matter. It is misleading to have a clause of that sort in a Bill which is termed &#x201C;Subdivision of Agricultural Land Amendment Bill&#x201D;. This paragraph has nothing to so with subdivision at all, but is enabling the Minister to step in and to prevent a local authority from expanding even to the extent of acquiring a whole farm and not merely a subdivided farm. I want to look at the reason given by the hon. the Minister in introducing this bill for the provision in paragraph (f). His reason was, and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Because local authorities tend to extend their areas of jurisdiction arbitrarily, it is deemed necessary for the Department of Agricultural Technical Services to obtain control in order to ensure that any extension will not take up only the best agricultural land.</block>

<p>In passing, I emphasize once again that this has nothing to do

 with the subdivision of land. He is now suggesting that this power

 should be taken to prevent local <span class="col_2727-2728" refersTo="page_1381"/>authorities from extending their boundaries to take in what the Minister describes as &#x201C;the best agricultural land&#x201D;. Several questions arise out of this and I hope we will get an answer from the hon. the Minister. First of all, will he give the House examples of local authorities that have extended their areas of jurisdiction arbitrarily&#x003F; This is a bald statement without any proof, without any example and without any motivation. Mr. Chairman, I reject this statement of the hon. the Deputy Minister. I believe that he would not be able to substantiate it. He may perhaps be able to give some examples where a local authority has extended its area of jurisdiction, as he puts it, arbitrarily. But as I have mentioned in relation to clause 1, if that is unjustified, if a local authority expands its boundaries by taking a greater area than it requires in the reasonable future, the provincial authorities have powers to stop that. I challenge the hon. the Deputy Minister to dispute that. It is illogical to suggest that the Department of Agricultural Technical Services should have the power. In my submission, it is a power which should properly be exercised by the provincial authorities who are in a position to decide whether a local authority does need to extend its boundaries or not. What does the Department of Agricultural Technical Services know about the needs of a local authority or a town&#x003F; It has no experience of matters of this sort. All it can do is to seek information and it can arbitrarily, to use the word used by the hon. the Deputy Minister, decide that the particular local authority in question is acquiring too much land. Why does this Government have a Department of planning if the Department of Agricultural Technical Services is going to interfere in this way&#x003F; I use the word &#x201C;interfere&#x201D; advisedly, because this is an interference and it is an unjustified interference. I ask pointedly this question of the hon. the Deputy Minister: Why is he asking for this power in view of the fact that his Government has a Department of Planning&#x003F; Has he no faith in the department of the hon. the Minister of Planning&#x003F; I wish the hon. the Minister of Planning would wait for a while, because I should also like to know from him why he is prepared to divest himself of this power and to hand it to the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. I should like to hear from the hon. the Minister of Planning in what way he regards the Department of Agricultural Technical Services as being more competent than his department to decide whether a local authority is expanding its area unreasonably, or arbitrarily, as the hon. the Deputy Minister puts it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Let me rather say that it will be absolutely unnecessary to have this power, for the simple reason that the record built up by the Provincial Administration and the local authorities in this respect is quite unquestionable. I am not aware of any instance where they took good agricultural land without consulting anybody, but where they did so arbitrarily just because they felt that that municipal area had to be extended. I do not believe that if they had in any way stood a chance of getting land of a less agricultural nature, it would not have been their policy to do just that in that manner. Now the hon. the Deputy Minister holds up the example of Mr. Knoesen so as to impose restraints on every province and local authority when it is necessary for them to allow township development to take place naturally.</p>

<p>However, I want to bring the hon. the Deputy Minister back to this point of the leasing of certain pieces of land after they have been subdivided. I am not so sure that the case mentioned in paragraph (d) can be prevented, and that a farmer who may find it necessary to lease certain portions of his farm, may not be prosecuted in terms of paragraph (d). In this clause it is stated very clearly that no lease in respect of a portion of agricultural land shall be registered in a deeds registry. The question I want to put to the hon. the Deputy Minister is whether, if a person takes the leasing of land seriously and wants to be covered in all respects, he will not find that in nine out of ten cases such a farmer will in fact register such a deed of lease. In that respect he can in fact find examples to the effect that, because a farmer wants to protect himself as well as his income when he leases land or a portion of his land, he will in fact register it. In the case of registration the Minister may then prevent something of that nature. In the Second Reading debate my point was that one often found farmers who had no heirs, but who retired from farming and then found it necessary to lease that land or portions of it to a neighbour, a friend or another relative. If such a person wants to enjoy the protection of the registration of that deed of lease, it will be possible to prevent him from doing so, unless he has obtained the consent of the hon. the Minister.</p>

Or is it aimed at stopping people who, through hire-purchase, tried to subdivide land and then to get past the subdivision of land as a result of such hire-purchase&#x003F; If that is the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s intention, he should state it very clearly to us.</p>

<p>But then it falls under a long-term lease, as it is more than 10 years. That is the kind of lease this clause deals with. The hon. member for Newton Park wanted to suggest just now that this clause related to any lease. He made the ridiculous statement that, if a farmer wanted to make sure that he was covered in every respect, he wanted to register a lease. The hon. member for Newton Park does not know what he is talking about. Short-term leases are concluded in writing between lessor and lessee. They are not registered, and the lessor and the lessee are absolutely safe. This clause only relates to long-term leases, which in terms of the Act must be for periods of 10 years or more. Now, what is wrong with this being controlled&#x003F; This is a typical case of evasion of the Act of 1970, i.e. to lease land on the basis of a long-term lease instead of selling. I want to make the statement that the Opposition is moving the amendment that clause 3 be omitted as a whole merely for the purpose of retaining loopholes which the hon. the Deputy Minister wants to eliminate. The Opposition is very illogical as far as this matter is concerned. Only the other day we discussed in this House a private motion of mine in which the Government was requested to give serious attention to the more rapid consolidation of land. The hon. member for Newton Park was so kind as to follow me in that debate and to say that he did not find any fault with that motion. In other words he associated himself with it.</p>

<p>With consolidation, precisely.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move, first of all, the amendment printed in my name, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In lines 3 and 4, page 6, to omit &#x201C;which has not been surveyed&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;whether surveyed or not&#x201D;.</block>

<p>This is merely to comply with the legal aspect of the matter.</p>

<p>For the most part the hon. member for Worcester replied to the member for Newton Park and pointed out how the latter had apparently not understood the Second Reading speech correctly.</p>

<p>Then he also referred to socialism. I do not think there is any need for the hon. member for Worcester to be concerned about the voters of Oudtshoorn giving any thought to those stories about socialism to the effect that the Government now wants to deprive a person of the right to lease land. That was the tenor of the words used by the hon. member for Newton Park.</p>

<p>I should like to reply to the hon. member on the question of leasing land. All the farmers on this side of the House lease land. One can have the lease registered at the Deeds Office if the period of lease is more than 10 years and up to 99 years. But if it is under 10 years, it is not necessary to have it registered. The hon. member and I myself are leasing land without any deed of lease. There is no problem. Now the hon. member wants to create the impression with the farmers that there should in fact be registration at the Deeds Office and that we may refuse the lease.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>One should see it from the point of view of the lessor.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>From the point of view of the lessor, too. If one draws up an ordinary lease for a period of less than 10 years, and the other person dies, that contract remains valid. The hon. member for Kroonstad replied very well. Here I have one shining example that one finds in the newspapers&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Be a gentleman farmer for R100 deposit and only R25 per month.</block>

<p>In this article it is explained how one can make money&#x2014;the hon. member says he wants to protect these people&#x2014;but the person <span class="col_2735-2736" refersTo="page_1385"/>never reads the fine print which says that he will never get a title-deed. Does the hon. member want to protect the public, or does he not&#x003F; That is the object of this clause.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Albany said here, &#x201C;Mention to me more places in the Cape Province where there are small holdings 25 morgen and more in extent, for you are only referring to the Transvaal.&#x201D; Sir, there are places such as Kimberley, Vryburg and Mafeking.

<p>That is a problem all over the country, but the hon. member says it is a problem which only affects the Transvaal. Sir, the same applies to the holiday resorts or &#x201C;holiday homes&#x201D; to which he referred; we are not going to step in there if it does not create a problem. There are many cases where leases have been in force for as many as 30 and 40 years, but where there are no registered deeds of lease. If such a person wants to register the lease, he has to refer it to the guide plan committee. If it is not going to result in subdivision, it will not create a problem in the future, and what is more, this did not create a problem in the past, for the person in question does not obtain a title-deed to that specific piece of land. If he is going to build up that piece of land, then he has to fall in with the rules for pollution, for which hon. members opposite asked and with which we are just as concerned as they are.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Musgrave referred again to clause 3 (f). He said that clause 3 (f) had nothing to do with subdivision, as one could cut up half a farm or an entire farm bordering on a town. If it is the entire farm, then, of course, it is not subdivision. The Minister of Planning, the provinces, Agricultural Technical Services and Community Development are meeting in order to draw up a plan for the entire country, from area to area, and we are going to work according to that guide plan so as to have orderliness. I have said repeatedly that there are certain parts in respect of which we will find, as a result of the advice given by this specialized body, that there is a need for &#x201C;holiday homes&#x201D; if it is necessary to cut up Mooi River, if we want to cut up Mooi River into small pieces, it is earmarked &#x2026;</p>

He gives as his justification the reason that a local authority is not in a position to decide what is an economic unit, but, Sir, I pointed out to the hon. the Deputy Minister and he conceded that (f) entitles the Minister to step in even if the local authority is not attempting to seek to extend its boundaries by obtaining a subdivision of a farm but by obtaining the entire farm. If the local authority is acquiring the whole farm, what has that got to do with an uneconomic unit&#x003F; It is not a subdivision. It has nothing to do with an uneconomic unit at all.</p>

<p>Sir, I would like to know this from the hon. the Deputy Minister. He misses the point altogether. Either the Government is going to rely on these regional and guide plans, or it is not. If the Government is going to rely on them, then the hon. the Minister does not require the power which he is taking under (f), for the simple reason that under the regional and guide plans, there will be established&#x2014;this is the object of these plans&#x2014;areas which are for future agricultural purposes, areas which are for future residential purposes and areas which are for future industrial purposes. Once you have that plan, then surely it does not matter if the local authority is acquiring land in areas which are zoned for future residential or industrial expansion. Obviously they will not be able to acquire land which is zoned and reserved for future agricultural purposes, but they will be able to expand in those areas which are specifically set aside and zoned for residential and industrial expansion. The hon. the Minister is taking the power to step in even in those cases, and this is why I keep asking the hon. the Deputy Minister whether the Government intends to rely on these regional and guide plans and, if so, why he requires this power, and he keeps on telling me that they are serious about these regional and guide plans, but he still wants to be able to interfere to prevent local authorities from even acquiring land which will be in areas zoned under the regional and guide plans for future residential and industrial expansion. It just does not make sense; not only does it not make sense, but it is becoming increasingly frustrating to people who have to work in these spheres to find this interference from various departments which are all pulling in different directions. The department of the hon. the Minister of Planning has taken a very good step forward by creating regional and guide plans for the various parts of South Africa. This is in the process of being implemented. Despite that, we find the Department of Agricultural Technical Services wanting to step in and tell the local authorities that they cannot acquire farms even though those farms are situated in areas which the regional and guide planners have zoned for future expansion of their township. It not only does not make sense, but it is extremely frustrating and it nullifies the work of the local authorities in preparing their town and regional plans.</p>

<p>The land about which the hon. member is feeling so frustrated is. being deproclaimed as agricultural land. We are preparing the guide plans for the whole of the country, but in the meanwhile, although we have the guide plans, we must have the necessary powers. The hon. member should just read the clause correctly; it reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Subject to the provisions of section 2&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(f) no area of jurisdiction, local area, public health area, peri-urban area or other area, referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of the definition of &#x201C;agricultural land&#x201D; in section 1 shall be established on, or enlarged so as to include any land which is agricultural land.</li>

</ol>

<block name="quote">unless the Minister has consented in writing to the subdivision, vesting, registration, sale, offer, advertisement, establishment or enlargement concerned.</block>

<p>It does not relate only to a whole farm,, about which the hon. member is so worried; it relates to all those things I have read out here; the Minister&#x2019;s written consent to all these matters must be obtained. How can it be so frustrating if the entire matter will still be determined by the guide-plan committee&#x003F; Surely it comes to the same; it is another pip from the same pumpkin. Either the matter is with the guide-plan committee, which refers it to the Minister, or it is not. I can see no difference in that.</p>

<p>Many arguments have been advanced with regard to the proposed new paragraphs (d) and (f). In regard to paragraph (d) the point which the hon. the Minister has failed to make is in regard to the question of a lease being registered, not just any lease. We accept this point, but at the same time the Deputy Minister must understand that our objection to this is the fact that before a lease can be binding against a third party it must be registered. What he is doing <span class="col_2739-2740" refersTo="page_1387"/>is insisting that before such a lease can be registered it must get his approval.</p>

<p>What for&#x003F; The Deputy Minister says &#x201C;of course&#x201D;, and later on he will take the power to say to the farmer that he may do only this on his farm or only that.

That is what he is saying. That is why we are opposed to it. It is all very well saying that the widow, as he said in reply to the hon. member for Albany, who needs a lease for a year or two to tide her over bad times, can go ahead without the Minister&#x2019;s approval because it does not have to be registered. But who leases a farm for less than ten years today&#x003F; [Interjections.] If it is his intention to farm on that farm, who leases it for a lesser period&#x003F; And then, who else leases a farm today without registering the lease&#x003F; [Interjections.] Who does not register such a lease&#x003F; The hon. members on that side must be very trusting people if they do not have their leases registered because you know that we have a principle in law that &#x201C;huur gaan voor koop&#x201D; but if it is not registered &#x2026;</p>

<p>It is not nonsense. I would like to refer the Deputy Minister to the General Laws Amendment Act of 1965. In order to be binding against a third party, a lease must be registered. That is the point that the hon. the Deputy Minister missed.</p>

<p>I also want to come to the new paragraph (e). Initially the hon. the Deputy Minister wanted to insert a new paragraph that &#x201C;no plot, on agricultural land, which has not been surveyed, or any right to such a place, shall be sold or advertised for sale&#x201D; without his consent. But now he wants to extend it even further with the amendment he has on the Order Paper to read that no plot on agricultural land, &#x201C;whether surveyed or not,&#x201D; can be dealt with. I want to come back to the question I put to the hon. the Deputy Minister earlier to which he did not reply. Is he going to compensate the owners of land for the rights which he is now taking away from them&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>The new paragraph (e) which the Deputy Minister is introducing, which says that without the permission of the Minister of Agriculture no plot on agricultural land, whether surveyed or not, shall be sold or offered for sale. Well, I know he has a problem in the Transvaal, where a property developer, in order to establish the need and the necessity, will advertise and will produce a number of signed purchase agreements for plots before they are subdivided&#x2014;I know he has that in mind, but he must at least safeguard the rights of those people who have gone through the proper authorities. As I pointed out earlier, there are in Natal innumerable properties, land which in terms of the definition of agricultural land is affected by this Act and which falls within in the purview of this Act, which has already been subdivided on paper, where the necessary authority has been obtained by the owner of the land to subdivide the land and to sell these plots, whether they are economic or not economic, in pursuance of what the hon. the Minister of Community Development wants, namely to provide more housing opportunities for the citizens of South Africa. This hon. Deputy Minister is now taking the power to render all those sub-divisions null and void. He now becomes the Lord High Chancellor of the land in South Africa. He alone is the Lord Pooh-bah who will decide who can sub-divide his lands after he has gone through the necessary details and after the approval has been received from the bodies concerned. This man will suddenly find that a whole lot of that is gone and that this hon. Minister will be the one to decide whether or not he can continue with the plans which he has possibly made a long time ago. Earlier on I named an example of a farm that was sub-divided in 1850. That private township of 1850 was only surveyed and worked on during the last four years. Is it the intention of the hon. the Deputy Minister to take those rights away from the land owners&#x003F; If it is his intention to take those rights away from these land owners, is it his intention to compensate them for the potential loss which they will suffer as a result of this action&#x003F;</p>

[Interjections.] I was in this House when he said he was a lawyer, and now he comes along and tells me, a stupid farmer, that no lease is entered into without it being registered. This is the biggest nonsense I have ever heard. Then the hon. member asked who leased land today for a shorter period than 10 years. You will find nobody in agriculture today who is prepared to lease land for longer than 10 years. The lessor is not prepared to lease land for longer than 10 years, because he has to increase his rental and consequently does not want to bind himself for 20 or 30 years. There is no such thing. I wish I could find someone who would lease land to me for longer than 10 years, because he would be done for (<i>in sy swernoot</i>) as a result of the constant increase in rental.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. D. DEACON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we want to indicate our opposition to this clause very clearly, because it introduces an amazing new power which the hon. the Minister wants to take for himself, namely to grant an application on such conditions as he may deem fit&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; including conditions as to the purpose for which or the manner in which the land in question may be used.</block>

<p>What does he require this power for&#x003F; He has told us about this &#x201C;gidsplankomitee&#x201D; and the great &#x201C;gidsplan&#x201D; in the Second Reading debate and frequently in this debate. If he wants a guide plan for the whole of South Africa&#x2014;we would like to see that too&#x2014;why did he not bring to us the Act that he is amending and tell us what he has in mind&#x003F; We could then have drawn up suitable amendments together in a Select Committee. But the hon. the Minister wants this amazing power in terms of clause 4 to control the purpose for which land is going to be used. This gives him very wide powers. He has powers under the Soil Conservation Act to control inefficient and bad farming. The hon. the Minister of Planning has powers under the Physical Planning Act to control certain subdivisions and the misuse of land. I am quite amazed that now he also wants powers to refuse or grant applications on such conditions as he may deem fit&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; including conditions as to the purpose for which or the manner in which the land in question may be used.</block>

<p>For whatever purpose one intends to use the land, whether to build a house on it, or put a &#x201C;kleinhuisie&#x201D; on it or graze cattle on it, the Minister is going to have control over it. If this is for the purpose of producing a guide plan, I think this world is becoming a very strange place. Both the hon. the Minister and I know farmers and landowners pretty well. He is a landowner himself. We, as farmers, are all prepared to accept advice and guidance from the department and from an efficient Ministry, but this is plain dictation. We cannot accept dictation. On behalf of the farmers I reject this provision wholly and totally. The hon. the Minister must clearly explain to us why he needs these powers.</p>

<p>*Mr. Chairman, the Minister wants very wide powers here.</p>

<p>These powers are much wider than those granted in terms <span class="col_2745-2746" refersTo="page_1390"/>of the first clause. If a farmer sells his farm today, the Minister may determine how the purchaser may use that land.</p>

<p>It is true. The clause reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; including conditions as to the purpose for which or the manner in which the land in question may be used.</block>

<p>Is the hon. member prepared to accept that&#x003F; It is very explicitly stated here, but I am not prepared to accept it. I am certain that no farmer is prepared to accept it either. The Soil Conservation Act is a good Act in terms of which control may be exercised over bad farmers. A man may, however, be a good farmer and it may happen that not this Minister, but another Minister tells that man that he should not use the land for sowing wheat, which he is doing, but that he must use it for maize. Or the Minister may say that apple trees must be planted on that land. This is what the amendment in this clause means. We cannot agree with that.</p>

<p>&#x2020;As I have said before, if the Minister wants a guide plan for South Africa, we agree that it is a good idea. He must not, however, come with this limiting, crushing and restricting measure that we have before us. Let us put these facts before a Select Committee and come with a decent redrafted Bill that can produce what we want in South Africa, namely the proper planning of our future.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, again it is very clear to me that the hon. member for Albany as well as the hon. member for Newton Park in his Second Reading speech definitely did not understand this clause. This clause deals solely with the subdivision of land. The hon. member for Albany has just said that the Minister wants to take powers to determine the use of agricultural land over the whole country. Surely this is not true. I just want to tell him that in terms of the Soil Conservation Act the Minister already has the authority to do so. This clause deals solely with the subdivision of land and the determination of the use of such subdivided land. I want to mention an example. If a person applies for subdivision and the cutting off of a small piece of land on which to build, for example, a shop or a filling-station, and he finds after a while that nobody is interested in building a shop or filling-station there, and he then wishes to use that land for something else, for example, for farming again, surely something like this cannot be allowed. In other words, because he obtained the right to subdivide that land for one purpose, the person should now be allowed to utilize it for another purpose. These people do not understand what these things are about. In his Second Reading speech the hon. member for Newton Park said on this clause that we were interfering with the rights of the individual. The hon. member made a speech at Graaff-Reinet in regard to another matter, but it also concerned the question of interference with the rights of the individual. He referred to certain provisions in regard to the stock withdrawal scheme and said: &#x201C;He should be compelled to farm with the remaining 25 per cent of his breeding stock and the State should prescribe to him how to farm.&#x201D; If this is not interfering with the rights of the individual, I should like to hear what it is.</p>

<speech by="#hayward">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. S. HAYWARD</person>:</from>

<p>I shall abide by your ruling, but I am speaking specifically about the question of interference with the rights of the individual with regard to this clause in terms of which the Minister is requiring powers to determine how that land should be farmed. I want to say to the hon. member for Newton Park, to the hon. member for Albany and to the Opposition that if the leader of the agricultural group is prepared, in respect of a certain matter, firstly, to compel a farmer to remain on his land and, secondly, to have the State tell him how to farm, I cannot see how they can have any objection to this clause. As far as I am concerned, that has a much more far-reaching implication than that which is contained in this clause. This clause specifically seeks this right for the Minister where subdivision applies, and I want to repeat, where subdivision applies. The Minister must retain the right to prevent a person who has asked to subdivide land for a specific purpose and who has not used it for the purpose for which he obtained permission, from using it for another purpose, and I say it is right that the <span class="col_2747-2748" refersTo="page_1391"/>Minister should tell him that he may not do so.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Graaff-Reinet has dragged something completely different into the discussion of this clause, but if the hon. member wants a reply to it, it is very simple. I was explaining our stock reduction scheme to those farmers at Graaff-Reinet. What I told them at the time, was that whereas in our case a farmer would be allowed to retain 25 per cent of his breeding stock, they should remember that it was a completely voluntary scheme. If one has a voluntary scheme and the State spends much more on the stock withdrawal scheme than this Government is prepared to spend, one can expect that the Department of Agricultural Technical Services will prescribe to those people how they are to farm. This is the reply to that hon. member.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Definitely not, Sir. In the Second Reading debate we objected very strongly to clause 4 because, we said, it was an entirely new principle which was not previously contained in this Act. When the hon. the Deputy Minister came forward with his Subdivision of Agricultural land Bill, it was his object to prevent subdivision. In terms of this he not only wants to prevent subdivision, but after I, as a farmer, have applied to him to subdivide my land, he may tell me now by means of conditions he lays down, what I am to do with that land. This is an entirely new principle. We then asked the hon. the Deputy Minister whether it meant, for example, that if he had granted me permission to subdivide my land, I would simply have to keep to his directives and would not be able to devise any other plan at all with that land. In other words, if, for example, a farmer found an excellent type of clay on a piece of land and wanted to start a quarry there, would the hon. the Minister, with this power, be able to prevent that land being used for this purpose&#x003F; It is stated very explicitly here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; including conditions as to the purpose for which or the manner in which the land in question may be used.</block>

<p>Originally I described that as a form of socialism. The hon. the Deputy Minister should realize that he is not dealing only with the subdivision of agricultural land here, but that most farmers, as I know them, would have the strongest objection not only to the hon. the Deputy Minister wanting to prescribe to them that they should farm the land, because if they did not, he was not going to give them the right to subdivide&#x2014;but also to the hon. the Deputy Minister perhaps going further and telling them that they should use it for no other purpose but agriculture.</p>

<p>This is the reason why I say it is an entirely new principle which we want to apply to farming in South Africa. If the hon. the Deputy Minister had good reasons for this amendment, he would rise&#x2014;I do not want to say &#x201C;like a man&#x201D;&#x2014;and take this House into his confidence and tell us what motive is behind this. He should not come along and tell us the story of the &#x201C;feed lots&#x201D; along the Orange River or along the Vaal River, and that dirty water was flowing into the river. This is not the reason. The reason is to get a firmer grip on the farmer as an individual in the country and in the course of time to prescribe to him with what he should farm.</p>

<debateSection name="#review_of_financial_year_1971-72">

<heading>REVIEW OF FINANCIAL YEAR 1971-&#x2019;72</heading>

<p>Trends in the national economy in recent months have reacted unfavourably on railway, harbour and airways finances and I should like to review the situation briefly.</p>

<p>As hon. members know, inflationary pressures have been building up in the economy for several years. Not only have increased salaries and wages, including those for the Bantu, raised production costs and consumer demands, but rapid price increases in South Africa&#x2019;s main supplier countries have also caused imported inflation to accelerate. The suspension by the United States of gold/dollar convertibility and the subsequent international currency crisis added to South Africa&#x2019;s difficulties, and in order to combat both inflation and balance of payment problems various monetary, fiscal and import control measures had to be introduced and subsequently tightened.</p>

<p>During 1971 there were clear indications that the policy of reducing excessive demand was gradually achieving its objective and more recently there have been signs of an easing of pressure on the factors of production and the development of some surplus capacity in certain industries.</p>

<p>Inevitably there has been a distinct levelling off in the growth rate of the South African economy. After an increase of 5,1 per cent in the real gross domestic product in 1970, the rate of increase had fallen by the end of June, 1971, to 4 per cent, and the Bureau for Economic Research of the University of Stellenbosch now estimates that the growth rate at constant prices for the year 1971 as a whole was only between 3,5 and 4 per cent.</p>

<p>The Administration&#x2019;s revenues during the current financial year have suffered as a result of this decline in economic activity. The average goods earnings per day&#x2014;a reliable economic indicator&#x2014;during the months of greatest traffic density, viz. from August to November, were actually lower than those of the preceding four winter months, and subsequent weekly earnings figures indicate that this adverse trend has not yet been halted. The curtailment of imports is affecting harbour revenues, and in recent months the growth rate in both main-line rail passenger and airways traffic has declined.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that revenue has lost the impetus of recent years, it is still necessary to build up the transport infrastructure to provide a springboard for renewed growth in the economy after the present stage of consolidation and, more particularly, to make a practical contribution towards the stimulation of exports. The cost of servicing the necessary capital investment by way of interest and depreciation charges is, however, a heavy drain on our limited resources. Much of the Administration&#x2019;s expenditure is inelastic, and it must therefore be accepted that the current deficit on the working accounts will continue for some time.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#prospects_for_1972-73">

<heading>PROSPECTS FOR 1972-&#x2019;73</heading>

<p>The general realignment of currencies and the bold devaluation of the Rand have improved South Africa&#x2019;s competitive position in export markets, not only in the case of primary products but also for many industries of the manufacturing sector. Import replacement industries will naturally benefit primarily, but exporters, for example of processed foodstuffs, will now enjoy a considerable price advantage over competitors in countries like Australia and New Zealand, and the outlook for South African products generally, upon Britain&#x2019;s entry to the Common Market, is now brighter.</p>

<p>It is nevertheless in certain commodity markets that our hopes for increased exports lie, and although the world demand for primary products levelled off sharply during 1970, the economic situation in America <span class="col_2751-2752" refersTo="page_1393"/>and in the countries of several of our European trading partners, holds promise of improvement, and commodity prices should benefit thereby.</p>

<p>Climatic conditions are again favourable for increased maize exports.</p>

<p>Manganese prices have been dropping, but thanks to the benefits of devaluation it is expected that the volume of sales will maintain, if not improve on, the 1971 figure. There has been a fall off in the demand for chrome ore, and in the case of iron ore the volume of exports may also be restricted initially on account of the depressed state of the overseas steel industry in recent months, but it is expected that the demand for ores will improve during the course of the year.</p>

<p>To sum up, it is expected that devaluation will provide a strong stimulus to growth generally, and that economic activity will develop more favourably during the latter half of the year. It is on this basis that the railway budget for 1972-&#x2019;73 has been prepared.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#new_works_programme_and_capital_expansion">

<heading>NEW WORKS PROGRAMME AND CAPITAL EXPANSION</heading>

<p>In addition to its normal functions as national carrier serving agriculture, commerce and industry locally, the Department will henceforth be called upon to play an increasingly important role in the stimulation of the export trade in general and in particular of base minerals, ores and coal. The provision of a transport infrastructure to a level consistent with the demands that will be made upon it for the efficient transport and handling of traffic, must necessarily go hand in hand with large-scale capital expenditure. The Capital and Betterment Estimates for 1972-&#x2019;73 which I have already tabled, make provision for a number of projects of considerable magnitude which will provide the further basis for projected expansion.</p>

<p>Stage 1 of the construction of a deepwater harbour at Richard&#x2019;s Bay is estimated to cost R121 million. A Bill to provide for this project will be introduced shortly. Although the port is primarily intended for the handling of bulk cargoes, general cargo will be catered for, but only to a limited extent during the initial stages. Facilities for other commodities, including containerized traffic, will follow as and when the need arises. Although the first stage of the harbour development is scheduled for comple tion in 1977, it will be partially commissioned in April, 1976. Vessels up to 150 000 tons will be catered for, but the bulk-handling berths will have sufficient depth to provide for the accommodation of vessels of up to 250 000 tons after further dredging.</p>

<p>Two new railway lines are to be constructed in the Cape Town complex for departmental purposes. Firstly, a double electrified line is to be built between Kensington and Bellville, at a cost of some R17 million, along a route approved by Parliament in 1945. Secondly, a new double electrified line is to be constructed&#x2014;branching; off near Kensington from the Kensington-Chempet line&#x2014;to serve the new harbour extensions. The cost of this project is estimated at R9 million. In addition a guaranteed line will be constructed from Drummondlea station to a terminus on the farm Grasvally in the Northern Transvaal, for the conveyance of chrome ore for local processing as well as for export. Parliamentary approval for the construction of the last-mentioned two lines will also be sought during the current Session.</p>

<p>To provide adequate facilities for the projected large-scale export of coal through Richard&#x2019;s Bay from 1976, it will be necessary, in conjunction with the scheme to construct a new railway line between Broodsnyersplaas and Ermelo, also to rebuild the existing line between Ermelo and Vryheid. Provision for the latter project is being made in the Estimates at an estimated cost of R125 million.</p>

<p>A centrally situated marshalling yard complex will be constructed in the Reef area to take over the major functions of ten smaller traffic yards. This major project will take several years to complete, and will ultimately comprise three&#x2014;and possibly four &#x2014;fully mechanized hump marshalling yards fitted with the most modern equipment. Stage one of this project is provided for in the Estimates at a cost of R25 million.</p>

<p>The installation of centralized traffic control between Wellington and Touws River at an estimated cost of R24 million is aimed at increasing the capacity of the Cape Western main line.</p>

<p>The decision to establish the third Iscor works at Newcastle will lead to a considerable increase in traffic between Volksrust and Newcastle, the section over which a large proportion of the raw materials for the steelworks will be conveyed. It is also likely that considerable industrial development <span class="col_2753-2754" refersTo="page_1394"/>will follow in the wake of the new Iscor works, whilst the Ingagane power station and the availability of adequate labour and water supplies will no doubt provide further incentive for rapid industrial expansion in the Newcastle area. It is therefore proposed to double the Vooruitsig&#x2014;Newcastle section in three stages at an estimated total cost of R76,4 million.</p>

<p>Provision is also being made for the electrification of the lines between Kroonstad and Hamilton and between Whites and Welkom at a cost of R27,9 million.</p>

<p>Satisfactory progress is being made with new works already in hand.</p>

<p>The new single line between Metsi and Kaapmuiden will be ready for full use during this month while the new single electrified line from Vryheid to Empangeni is nearly 46 per cent complete.</p>

<p>The partial doubling of the line and installation of centralized traffic control between Klerksdorp and Fourteen Streams is 75 per cent complete and is partly in use. Work has also started on the installation of C.T.C. and lengthening of loops between Queenstown and Burgersdorp. The line improvements between Noupoort and Springfontein are 98 per cent complete and certain sections have been taken into use.</p>

<p>Electrification of the line between Harrismith and Kroonstad was completed during the year and the greater portion of the electrification between Duff&#x2019;s Road and Mandini has been completed, whilst the quadrupling, electrification and signalling work between Booth and Reunion in the Durban area is nearing completion. The new goods depot at Bayhead is now in full use. The doubling and electrification of the line between Hercules and De Wildt is nearing completion, whilst work on the deviation, regrading and strengthening of the line between Hoedspruit and Metsi was completed in September, 1971.</p>

<p>Work on stage 1 of the outer harbour scheme at Table Bay Harbour is progressing well and is expected to be completed in January, 1973, whilst a contract was recently entered into for stage 2 of the project.</p>

<p>In Durban Harbour Pier No. 1 is partly in use and a contract has been awarded for the construction of Pier No. 2. In order to provide for containerized cargoes, land reclamation is being increased from 37 to 97 hectares. The modifications to the grain elevator and the replacement of the No. 1 coal dumper by a modern type tippler were completed in May, 1971, and January, 1972, respectively.</p>

<p>Mechanical handling equipment comprising altogether 37 wharf cranes of four and 15 tons capacity, 303 fork-lift trucks, three side loaders, 11 shunting tractors and seven mobile cranes, were ordered for the various harbours during the year. Provision is now being made for a further ten wharf cranes, 30 fork-lift trucks and one shunting tractor, as well as one 125 ton floating crane for Durban Harbour.</p>

<p>On the question of rolling stock, I should like to inform Hon. members that a programme has been drawn up in terms of which all steam locomotives on the standard-gauge lines will, by 1986-&#x2019;87, be replaced by diesel and electric locomotives. Tenders for narrow gauge diesel locomotives are being adjudicated upon for the replacement of steam traction on the Humewood-Assegaaibos section.</p>

<p>The elimination of steam traction will be a comprehensive, country-wide undertaking and the execution of the programme will to a large extent depend upon the availability of capital and physical resources to absorb the change-over. Steam locomotive enthusiasts, with whom I&#x2014;for very good reasons&#x2014;am proud to be associated, will, no doubt, feel saddened at this prospect, but they will be consoled by the knowledge that it is the intention to preserve a selection of steam locomotives, particularly the classes 6, 7 and 8, for viewing at various stations and local museums in the Republic.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the 1971-&#x2019;72 financial year the locomotive establishment consisted of 2 367 steam, 1 196 electric and 379 diesel locomotives. Since then 74 new electric and 41 diesel locomotives have been placed in service, whilst 56 steam locomotives, 3 diesel and 6 diesel hydraulic locomotives have been withdrawn from service.</p>

<p>Delivery of 225 diesel and 250 class 6E1 electric locomotives on order, is expected to be completed by June, 1973, and October, 1974, respectively.</p>

<p>Provision is now being made for the acquisition of a further 200 class 6E1 electric locomotives and 253 diesel locomotives.</p>

<p>During the period 1st April, 1971, to 31st January, 1972, 4 998 new bogie wagons were placed in service, which increased the total number of merchandise-carrying <span class="col_2755-2756" refersTo="page_1395"/>bogie wagons in service to 98 742. The merchandise-carrying capacity of all goods stock including 43 092 short trucks, has now been increased to more than 4,5 million tons.</p>

<p>At 31st January, 1972, there were 2 897 main-line, 823 steam suburban and 3 172 electric suburban coaches in service. Of these 1 099 main-line, 457 steam suburban and 2 146 electric suburban coaches were for the conveyance of non-White passengers. Passenger coaches still on order include 144 first class and 189 second class main-line coaches for Whites, as well as two Blue Train sets, and 91 coaches for non-Whites, whilst 78 electric suburban stock for Whites and 171 for non-Whites are still to be delivered.</p>

<p>Tenders for the supply of an additional 229 coaches for the Soweto service closed on 28th January, 1972, while provision is now being made for a further 122 coaches for the same service. This will enable the Department to replace all the old swingdoor stock operating to Soweto by the sliding-door type, and also to strengthen the train sets to 14 coaches each.</p>

<p>In keeping with modern rail transport trends, the Department has in recent years intensified its efforts to design special-purpose goods wagons adapted to the mass conveyance of particular commodities. Thus far highly satisfactory results have been achieved. Some of the new types of wagons are designed for specific commodities whilst others are so designed that they can be diverted to other uses. A common factor to nearly all these wagons is the considerably increased load to tare ratio which not only assists in more efficient bulk conveyance, but also contributes towards economical transportation and handling costs.</p>

<p>I am particularly referring to the wagons for the conveyance, <i>inter alia,</i> of iron ore, container, coal, grain and fruit traffic. A new type of wagon which has also been designed has a smooth interior to lessen the risk of damage to merchandise, whilst a prototype bottom-discharging wagon for unrefined sugar, which can be emptied in approximately two minutes, is a further example of the most recent developments.</p>

<p>In view of the experience gained and the excellent results obtained with the running of heavy ore trains to Port Elizabeth, the use of air-brake trains has now been extended to the Sishen-Newcastle haul where one train with 50 ore trucks is scheduled daily.</p>

<p>A test conducted during last month with an ore train comprising 150 trucks was most successful. The length of the train was 1,6 kilometres and its mass, with locomotives, amounted to almost 12 000 tons, the net payload being 8 850 tons. As far as can be ascertained this was the heaviest and longest train yet to operate in Africa, adequately illustrating the versatility of the 1 065 millimetre gauge track.</p>

<p>During the year good progress was maintained with the programme for providing an improved departmental communication network and an important change will be brought about in the Railway telecommunications system during the next year. The old obsolete manual trunk switching system will be replaced by a fully automatic country-wide trunk dialling system.</p>

<p>The teleprinter network is being continually expanded and the stage has now been reached where it is being used for rapid visual communication as an aid to computerized air seat reservations and truck control. Truck control is one of the more interesting developments in the data processing field and is now assisting in the monitoring of goods traffic flow over the railway network. The sophisticated programming and control methods used are entirely South African in concept and were devised by our own staff to meet the particular needs of the South African Railways after careful evaluation of overseas systems.</p>

<heading>CURRENT YEAR&#x2019;S PERFORMANCE</heading>

<p><i>Passenger services</i></p>

<p>The upward trend in the total number of passenger journeys featured in previous years was again evident during the first nine months of the current financial year, and in comparison with the same period of the previous year an increase of almost 5,5 million passenger journeys, or 1,3 per cent, was recorded. Suburban journeys increased by nearly 8 million, or two per cent, whilst main-line journeys decreased by 2,3 million, or 7,9 per cent, probably on account of the extension of certain suburban areas.</p>

<p>It is anticipated that passenger earnings during 1971-&#x2019;72 will total R99,6 million, that is R1,9 million more than the original estimate.</p>

<p><span class="col_2757-2758" refersTo="page_1396"/><i>Goods services</i></p>

<p>Although the tonnages of revenue-earning goods traffic conveyed during the first nine months of the current financial year did not come up to expectations, substantial increases were nevertheless recorded over the figures for the previous year. General traffic conveyed amounted to 60,3 million tons as compared with 56 million tons during the period April to December, 1970&#x2014;an increase of 7,7 per cent&#x2014;whilst the tonnage of livestock conveyed advanced by 9,8 per cent from 793 000 to 870 000.</p>

<p>The overall tonnage of coal and coke on the other hand, decreased minimally by 0,8 per cent from 17,7 million tons during 1970 to 17,6 million tons during 1971. This decrease was, however, confined to export coal which declined from 936 000 tons to 690 000 tons, largely as a result of the partial closure of the Bluff coaling appliance at Durban Harbour during the period June, 1971, to January, 1972, whilst the No. 1 dumper was being replaced. With the completion of the new loading facilities in Durban Harbour the tonnage of export coal is expected to increase. Coal for local consumption advanced to 16,9 million tons&#x2014;an increase of 0,6 per cent over the 1970 tonnage.</p>

<p>Hon. members will recall that the Department experienced considerable difficulty in maintaining adequate inland coal supplies during the winter of 1970 when available truckage had to be diverted to the conveyance of fodder and drought-stricken stock. In order to avoid a recurrence of the shortages experienced during that year, a timeous stockpiling programme was embarked upon, and by 31st March, 1971, stockpiles for power station use alone exceeded 331 000 tons as compared with only 221 000 tons on the same date in 1970. This satisfactory state of affairs prevailed throughout the winter and was achieved without in any way encroaching upon truckage for other commodities. In anticipation of the coming winter season, a total of 281 500 tons of power station coal was already available by the end of December, 1971, as against 225 800 tons in December, 1970.</p>

<p>The tonnage of manganese, chrome, iron and magnetite ores, as well as asbestos, clay and kaolin conveyed for export during the nine-month period advanced to 5,9 million, an increase of 852 500 tons, or 16,7 per cent, over the figure for the corresponding period in 1970. During the same period, the conveyance of such ores and minerals for local consumption increased by 11,9 per cent to 6,3 million tons.</p>

<p>It is significant that notwithstanding the fact that cement could be conveyed freely by road, up to December last a decrease of only 17 000 tons, or 0,6 per cent, in the tonnage conveyed by rail was reflected. In fact, the position as regards the transport of cement was improved to such an extent that the concession for the unlimited transport of cement by road was withdrawn as from 1st January, 1972.</p>

<p>Whilst maize conveyed by rail for local consumption decreased from 2,8 million tons to 2,1 million tons during the period April to December, 1971, as compared with the corresponding period during the previous year, exports advanced from 626 400 tons to 1,3 million tons. The Maize Board&#x2019;s expected exports for the present season amount to 3,2 million tons and no difficulty is being experienced in meeting rail transport commitments.</p>

<p>The substantially increased volume of traffic conveyed, although not up to expectations, is indicative of the manner in which increased efficiency and productivity have overcome the continuing shortage of personnel in certain key grades.</p>

<p>Goods revenue for 1971-&#x2019;72 is now estimated at R488,8 million, that is R18,5 million below the budgeted figure, and coal traffic is expected to yield R59,4 million, or R1,8 million short of the original estimate.</p>

<p><i>Road Transport</i></p>

<p>During the period April to December, 1971, there was a marked decline of 30,1 per cent in the number of first-class passengers utilising the Department&#x2019;s Road Transport Service. This is mainly attributable to the cancellation of uneconomic services and an increasing tendency of people to use their own private transport.</p>

<p>Third-class passenger journeys, however, increased by 8 per cent to more than nine million, chiefly as a result of the increasing support by Bantu passengers of services to the homelands.</p>

<p>Goods traffic conveyed dropped from 2,8 million to 2,5 million tons, partly as a result of the loss of asbestos traffic and the completion of cement supplies to the H.F. Verwoerd dam site.</p>

<p><span class="col_2759-2760" refersTo="page_1397"/>It is expected that the year will close with a loss of R1,6 million on the road transport services, as compared with the shortfall of R1,2 million in 1970-&#x2019;71.</p>

<p>In the process of modernising and maintaining the fleet of vehicles at full strength, the Department placed orders during the year for 297 passenger vehicles, 30 dual purpose vehicles, 23 goods vehicles, 165 haulers and 291 trailers and semitrailers at a cost of R14,5 million. Vehicles being provided for in the Estimates for 1972-&#x2019;73 at an estimated cost of R5,2 million include, <i>inter alia,</i> 13 luxury buses with seating capacity ranging from 18 to 30, six 123-seater inter-city passenger buses, 20 ten ton goods vehicles, one 143 ton abnormal load trailer, nine refrigerator semi-trailers, 20 insulated semi-trailers, 30 petrol tankers and 79 haulers.</p>

<p><i>Harbours</i></p>

<p>The cargo handled at the ports during the period April to December, 1971, increased by 4,3 million tons, or 12,4 per cent, compared with the figure for the same period during the previous year. The totally unexpected and abnormal growth in the tonnages of cargo imported during the first half of the year placed a considerable strain on the cargo-handling resources of the ports. By implementing a crash programme for the acquisition of additional mechanical-handling equipment, and utilizing non-Whites in graded positions as well as casual and seconded personnel wherever practicable, the situation improved considerably from July, 1971.</p>

<p>Cargo landed showed an increase of 1,87 million tons, or 9,2 per cent, whilst exports advanced by 17,1 per cent from 14,12 million tons to 16,53 million tons. At the same time transhipped cargo increased from 262 000 tons to 285 000 tons. Grain exports increased by 54,2 per cent from 992 000 tons to a total of over 1,5 million tons.</p>

<p>The containerization of sea-borne cargo to and from South Africa is not expected to be fully developed for at least another five years and is totally dependent upon the decisions of the shipping lines serving the South African trade. At this stage overseas shipping interests as distinct from coastal operators have not given a clear indication of their actual requirements. The Department has nevertheless done all the necessary preparatory work and is ready to adapt itself to any of the established schemes which may be decided upon.</p>

<p>The latest estimate of habour revenue for the year 1971-&#x2019;72 is R59,2 million, which falls R1,8 million short of the budgeted amount.</p>

<p><i>Airways</i></p>

<p>A highlight of the activities of the South African Airways during the current financial year was the introduction of the Boeing 747 services during December, 1971.</p>

<p>The seven weekly Boeing 747 services now in operation to London and the nine weekly Boeing 707 flights terminating in Europe, will continue until October, 1972. After the delivery of the additional two Boeing 747 aircraft during August and September, 1972, an integrated programme of international and domestic services with Boeing 747s will be brought into operation.</p>

<p>In order to cope with increasing passenger volumes an automated departure control system for passenger check-in was introduced at Jan Smuts Airport towards the end of 1971 as an extension to the SAAFARI reservations system, and it is planned to extend this to the other airports.</p>

<p>As from 1st April, 1971, the South African Airways took over the apron services at all the airports used by it in the Republic, as well as those at Keetmanshoop and Windhoek, from the Department of Transport.</p>

<p>The private airline which took over the coastal services between Cape Town and Port Elizabeth from the South African Airways two years ago, gave notice during the early part of 1971 that for economic reasons it intended withdrawing these services. In order to continue to provide air services to George, Oudtshoom and Plettenberg Bay, an arrangement has been concluded whereby these services would be maintained by that airline on behalf of SAA.</p>

<p>In contrast to the very high growth rate of 16,2 per cent in passenger traffic and 20,6 per cent in freight experienced during the previous year, the growth rate during the period April to December, 1971, dropped to 7,5 per cent for passengers and 5,4 per cent for freight on all routes.</p>

<p>During the period April to December, 1971, passenger traffic on the domestic services increased by 5,4 per cent to 989 000 whilst freight ton-kilometres increased by 11,3 per cent to 10,7 million.</p>

<p><span class="col_2761-2762" refersTo="page_1398"/>Due to the introduction of an additional weekly Boeing 707 frequency on the Wallaby route, passenger traffic increased by 44,3 per cent whilst freight ton-kilometres increased by 86,7 per cent to 1,69 million during the period April to December, 1971. Passenger traffic on the American service reflects a minimal increase of 0,8 per cent, but freight ton-kilometres increased by as much as 29,6 per cent to more than 3 mill lion.</p>

<p>Passenger traffic on the regional services increased by 31,9 per cent and freight ton-kilometres by 33,2 per cent. This rise is due to the increased capacity provided by SAA on the services to Rhodesia, coupled with the replacement of Viscount by Boeing 727 and 737 aircraft as from 1st October, 1971. On the Springbok services, passenger traffic increased by 7,6 per cent, but freight ton-kilometres decreased by 1,4 per cent.</p>

<p>The slower growth rate was undoubtedly brought about by the cooling off in economic activity not only in South Africa but also in the United Kingdom and certain other Western European countries to and from which SAA operates. Furthermore, the uncertain world monetary conditions and their dampening effect on world trade, have had an adverse impact on international air transport. The tapering off of traffic growth on the routes to and from South Africa is a manifestation of the same trend that has been experienced by international airlines on other routes during the past 18 months.</p>

<p>It is now estimated that S.A. Airways&#x2019; revenue will amount to R116,9 million, which is R20 million more than that of the preceding year, but R11,6 million less than the original estimate.</p>

<p><i>Pipelines</i></p>

<p>The overall tonnage conveyed by the pipelines increased from 5,75 million during the period April to December, 1970, to 5,8 million tons during the same period of 1971. The figures in respect of white-products reflect an increase of 51 000 tons, whilst the tonnage crude-petroleum advanced by 9 000 tons.</p>

<p>The extension of the pipeline from Alrode to Pretoria, including feeder lines to Pretoria West, Waltloo, Isando and Benoni, as well as the extension from Sasolburg to Klerksdorp and the draw-off facilities at Potchefstroom, are expected to be completed during July and December, 1972, respectively. It has also been decided to construct a separate pipeline of a diameter of approximately 150 millimetres between Sasolburg and Jan Smuts Airport specifically for the conveyance of aviation fuel. This project will be completed in November, 1972.</p>

<p>As the commissioning of the refinery at Sasolburg took place later than estimated supplies for the Reef continued in the interim to be drawn from Durban, and pipeline revenue benefited from the conveyance of the traffic over the longer distance. There was also an unexpected increase in the volume of naphtha towards the end of 1971, and the revised estimate of revenue amounts to R54,5 million, as compared with the budgeted figure of R46,8 million.</p>

<p>As the revised Estimates of Expenditure approved by Parliament total R1 092 025 000, the year is expected to close with a deficit of R38,96 million. It is proposed to meet the shortfall from the Rates Equalization Fund. [Interjection.] When hon. members get over the shock, I shall continue.</p>

<debateSection name="#staff">

<heading>STAFF</heading>

<p>The staff position remained fairly constant and according to the latest information there is an increase of approximately 500 White and 3 400 non-White workers compared with last year. The position in respect of bread and butter grades is, however, still far from satisfactory. At present there are 6 500 vacancies and this figure represents 19,4 per cent of the total establishment of nearly 34 000 in these grades. Concerted efforts to recruit staff, particularly in the bread and butter grades, were not very successful. This, however, is symptomatic of the country-wide shortage of trained manpower. By the introduction of certain other measures, the Department has nevertheless been able to cope with the situation effectually.</p>

<p>The application of sophisticated mechanical and technological aids as essential adjuncts towards achieving greater efficiency and productivity, is constantly being reviewed and actively pursued whereever possible.</p>

<p><span class="col_2763-2764" refersTo="page_1399"/>The intensive training programme in operation at the Railway College and its branches at various centres, has been supplemented by special short-term courses in duties applicable to grades where acute shortages are being experienced. To date more than 2 000 members of the staff have been trained to render auxiliary service over and above their normal duties. This short-term measure and the rationalized deployment of available staff on a country-wide basis to ensure that the various systems receive a fair quota of staff in key grades to cope with fluctuations in the traffic offering, have enabled the Department to bridge the gap fairly successfully.</p>

<p>The employment of female staff in certain positions traditionally filled by men is also helping to alleviate the position. At present 64 females are undertaking duty as ticket examiners at station barriers. 151 as checkers and 20 as drivers (departmental). The extension of this practice is being actively pursued.</p>

<p>Vacancies for artisans were reduced by over 500 mainly because improved selection and training methods have made it possible to reduce the apprenticeship period from five to four years.</p>

<p>The employment of non-Whites in certain graded positions previously occupied by Whites, on a basis whereby the duties of the two groups are clearly demarcated, has widened the scope of work in which the services of non-Whites may be utilized. Government policy in terms of which non-Whites are served by members of their own race in their own territories, is being implemented wherever feasible and has resulted in releasing Whites for work elsewhere and in the filling of more vacancies in the bread and butter grades.</p>

<p>I am pleased to say that the Railways have enjoyed the fullest co-operation of staff associations in the implementation of measures to alleviate the serious shortage of manpower by the employment of non-Whites in certain selected positions, and I should like to express my sincere appreciation of their realistic and responsible approach to our staff problems. The Department will, in consultation with the Staff Associations, continue to examine the practicability of placing non-Whites in graded positions where necessary.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that through the greater utilization of non-White labour the Department has been able to offer many White workers better positions. A departmental committee, on which one of the staff associations was represented, visited the main centres some 12 months ago in order to interview railworkers with a view to their appointment to graded positions. Although more than half of the railworkers recommended for promotion by the Committee declined, 1 250 have since been appointed to higher-graded positions.</p>

<p>During the past decade the productivity of the Railways, expressed in net ton-kilometres, has improved by approximately 70 per cent, with an overall staff increase of less than six per cent. Whilst this achievement has indubitably been facilitated by the application of modern technical and other aids, there can be no doubt that an appreciable contribution towards this significant achievement has been made by the Administration&#x2019;s staff.</p>

<debateSection name="#financial_prospects_for_1972-&#x2019;73_revenue">

<heading>FINANCIAL PROSPECTS FOR 1972-&#x2019;73 REVENUE</heading>

<p><i>Passengers</i></p>

<p>Considering the poor trend in passenger traffic during the past year, an increase of just under 3 per cent is forecast, and passenger revenue is estimated at R102,5 million.</p>

<p><i>Goods</i></p>

<p>Provided weather conditions continue to be favourable it is anticipated that 3,12 million tons of maize and kaffir corn will be exported during the coming year, which will be an increase of 800 000 tons on the 1971-&#x2019;72 figure.</p>

<p>The shipment of iron and manganese ores is expected to increase from 5,35 million to 6,45 million tons, and an overall increase of 5,1 million tons of goods traffic is anticipated. Goods earnings are estimated at R519,25 million, or 6,2 per cent more than that of the current year.</p>

<p><i>Coal</i></p>

<p>Whilst provision is made for the export of approximately two million tons of coal during the coming year, the consumption of coal by power stations within the Republic is expected to fall by almost 1,3 million tons. Revenue from coal traffic is therefore not expected to exceed the amount of R59,5 million, which is only R150 000 more than the 1971-&#x2019;72 figure.</p>

<p><span class="col_2765-2766" refersTo="page_1400"/><i>Subsidiary services</i></p>

<p>With the prospects of full capacity while maize and kaffir corn are being exported, it is expected that the grain elevators will show a surplus just short of R1,3 million during the coming year.</p>

<p>In the case of the road transport services, however, the estimated revenue of R24,7 million falls nearly R1 million short of the expenditure.</p>

<p><i>Harbours</i></p>

<p>As the greatest proportion of harbour revenue is derived from wharfage dues, calculated <i>ad valorem,</i> the anticipated increase in the export of primary products in the coming year will not adequately compensate for the loss of high value imports which have had to be curtailed in the interests of the national economy. Harbour earnings are expected to decline by 4,8 per cent to R56,4 million.</p>

<p><i>Airways</i></p>

<p>The year 1971-&#x2019;72 showed a growth rate of 20,7 per cent in Airways revenue, the steepest increase having occurred before the international currency crisis. Although the volume of air traffic has been affected by the state of the economy, it is anticipated that with the introduction of Boeing 747 aircraft on both overseas and domestic routes airline earnings in the coming year will increase to nearly R137,5 million.</p>

<p><i>Pipelines</i></p>

<p>Prior to the commissioning of the refinery at Sasolburg in December, 1971, white petroleum products for a number of towns in the Northern Cape and South-Western Transvaal were conveyed by pipeline from Durban to Kroonstad, and thence by rail to the final destination. This area is now served by Natref, resulting in a loss of traffic to the pipeline.</p>

<p>Only 1,4 million tons of crude petroleum are expected to be conveyed in the coming year, compared with 1,9 million tons in 1971-&#x2019;72, and the forecast is that total pipeline earnings will amount to only R53,7 million, as against R54,5 million during the current year.</p>

<p><i>All services</i></p>

<p>Total revenue from all services during 1972-&#x2019;73 is therefore estimated at R1 105 933 000.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#expenditure_and_results_of_working:_1972-73">

<heading>EXPENDITURE AND RESULTS OF WORKING: 1972-&#x2019;73</heading>

<p>Until such time as the economy improves, it is necessary to take all possible steps to keep expenditure within our means. Direct working costs have been, and will continue to be, cut to a minimum and for the coming year I propose suspending the Renewals Fund contribution for Pipelines, which is a relatively new asset, and rebating by 50 per cent the contribution to the permanent way section of the same Fund, which is sound.</p>

<p>Total expenditure for the year is expected to amount to R1 144 922000, leaving a deficit of R38 989 000 to be met from the Rates Equalization Fund.</p>

<p>Considering the present state of the economy I wish at all costs to avoid any action which may increase the national cost structure and fritter away the opportunities offered by devaluation.</p>

<p>Our economy is basically strong, and it is my firm opinion that the country will respond to the lead given by the Government in keeping a tight rein on costs, stepping up productivity and exports, and generally instilling new life into the economy. When we have achieved this objective we will have the means to replenish our resources and build up our funds.</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there are occasions when an important speech, such as the one we have just had from the hon. the Minister of Transport, is important not only in itself, but also because of some of the interesting side glances it affords on what is happening in the political and economic life of South Africa. I think we experienced, such a revelation this afternoon, during the course of the Minister&#x2019;s speech. He referred&#x2014;I think with gratification, to which he was entitled&#x2014;to the fact that as a result of the labour policies which the hon. the Minister is applying, no fewer than 1 250 poor White people in South Africa who are in a job normally regarded as a dead-end job, had been promoted to graded positions on the South African Railways. We rejoiced in that, but on the side of the Government there was a stony, unhappy silence. I think the attention of the country should be drawn to the fact that all this wonderful talk about their care for the poor man, about their being &#x201C;die vriend van die arm man&#x201D;, does not apply in this case where the hon. the Minister of Transport is giving progress and hope to these people because he applied sensible labour policies and is willing to use non-White labour in more important occupations. I think that should immediately be noticed. I now want to take this opportunity of congratulating and thanking the hon. the Minister. For the first time in my life I thank a Minister of the Nationalist Party Government for his labour policy which is bringing hope, progress and greater happiness to the Whites also on the South African Railways.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think hon. members will agree with me that we have heard from the hon. the Minister a dismal and sad statement today of the affairs of the South African Railways. There may be the temptation on the part of members on this side to gloat and to revel in the discomfiture of the Minister, but we shall not do so, Sir; we are sincerely sympathetic towards this hon. Minister. Like all of us, he has his blind spots. He has a blind spot, for example, in not seeking greater correlation between the State monopoly of transport and the contribution that private enterprise can make to the transport of goods in our nation. That is unfortunate, but in other ways he has insight far beyond that of the average member of the South African Cabinet today. It is sad to us to see that the hon. the Minister, who administers this great department, suffers so when, in spite of his insight, he cannot fully apply the policies he wishes to apply to the Railways, and when he has to operate this vast undertaking, this greatest of all single enterprises in South Africa, within the framework of Government policy. There, Sir, we see the fundamental problem of this great business enterprise. It has to exist, like private enterprise and like any business in South Africa, under the policies of this Government, and not even the Minister of Transport, not even the angel Gabriel, can make a full success of an enterprise in those circumstances.</p>

<p>I want to begin, therefore, by extending our sincere sympathy to the hon. the Minister. He tries to do his best, but for some reason or other, in spite of the fact that he can deviate within his own department from Government policy, he has not yet succeeded in persuading the rest of the Government that his example is right and that their practice is wrong.</p>

<p>The Budget reveals the Minister&#x2019;s problems; he is the victim of Government policies. He has to operate under the Minister of Finance; he has to suffer under the Minister of Economic Affairs; he cannot plan, because he is the victim of a stop-start economy; he cannot foresee when he will be deprived of the income he is entitled to from the high-rated goods that are imported, because one drastic, unannounced and unexpected import control measure imposed by the Minister of Economic Affairs will throw his Budget completely out of gear, as it did last year. The hon. the Minister must plan according to Government announcements and Government policy. When the Minister for Economic Affairs tells him that import control will remain unchanged, he plans accordingly and he hopes accordingly. How can he expect that within a fortnight or a month the Minister will cut imports by 20 per cent and throw all his calculations out of gear&#x003F; He has our sympathy, Sir, He has our sympathy all the more because, as I have said, he has the intelligence to see the answers; he applies it in his own department. Then, Sir, he is frustrated by the policies of the Government. <span class="col_2769-2770" refersTo="page_1402"/>His success in his own department, with the use of non-White labour, for example, is not reflected in the Government&#x2019;s policy. It is not offered to the same extent to private enterprise, who are ultimately his clients and his customers, to whom he must look for the success of the Railways. It does not help if he and the Railways can break away from Government policy and ease the problems of the Railways, when his own customers, the businesses of this land upon which he depends for his success, are denied the privileges that he takes unto himself as a Minister of the Cabinet&#x2014;a deviate Minister of the Cabinet.</p>

<p>And so, Sir, in spite of the Minister&#x2019;s attempts, in spite of our acknowledgment that he is the last remaining Minister of competence in the Nationalist Party Government, in spite of all that, he fails. He tells us today that over two years almost R40 million will have to come from the Rates Equalization Fund. The Fund will be exhausted and the prospects for the future are uncertain. We had no real indications from the Minister about what the future would hold, except his statement that he relies upon what he calls &#x201C;bold&#x201D; devaluation to save him from his troubles. It is the first time in my life that I have known any Minister or any Government describe what was really an act of insolvency with such a fine and inspiring adjective as &#x201C;bold&#x201D;! After all, devaluation is the last resort of a failing government; it is the last hope for an economy that is in trouble. No government likes to devalue. Every government of the world resists devaluation until the last moment. A few years ago, when Britain devalued and many people expected this Government to follow suit, they quite rightly looked at the economy of South Africa and said: &#x201C;We are sound enough; we need not follow in this instance.&#x201D; Now, Sir, they do it as an act of virtue. But, in fact, they have landed South Africa in such a mess that even the Opposition had to admit that in the circumstances they had created we had to devalue. [Interjections.] Now it is a virtue; now we are asked to see the solution to the problems of South Africa in the act of devaluation, which in itself is a confession of failure.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>We ask ourselves, Sir, why there were so many silences in the

 Minister&#x2019;s speech. Why, if what I say is so funny that it even amuses someone as humourless as the Minister of Defence, were there so many silences in the speech of the hon. the Minister of Transport&#x003F; Sir, the South African Railways is one of the most important budgetary bodies in the economy of South Africa. As the experience of other countries has shown, such an organization can play an important part in determining the financial experience of a nation for the year in which the Budget operates. The Minister gave glimmerings of the fact that he appreciates this, when he spoke about continuing to supply the infrastructure for future development and future progress. He complained about the difficulty of trying to find the capital and the resources; yet he failed to investigate, as one could have hoped he would do, the part which private enterprise could play in providing the infrastructure for our transport in South Africa. He hinted that he would have to take steps to stimulate exports, but he was strangely silent about something which he stated with emphasis last year, and that is that there was a world demand for certain ores that we could supply. He said last year that this was &#x201C;a development in which the South African Railways and Harbours would have an important part to play&#x201D;. But there was not a word about that today. The whole nation wants to know what the Railways are going to do now that the Japanese have broken off negotiations with South Africa. What is to be the fate of the projected line to Saldanha Bay&#x003F; What is going to happen to the immediately more practical line to Port Elizabeth and the extension to the harbour installations at Port Elizabeth&#x003F; We heard not a word of that. This is a matter of vital importance to the economy of South Africa and for the future of South Africa, because in the decades to come, if we want to restore our balance of payments, we shall have to follow the Australian example and rely more and more upon the export of raw materials, such as ores. But not a word have we heard in this connection from the Minister, who himself last year told us that we must expect developments and that the Railways would have a part to play in these matters. The nation is entitled to know.</p>

<p>Another thing about which he was strangely silent is what has happened in regard to his negotiations with the Staff Associations. They are feeling the pinch of devaluation; they have made suggestions that there should be increases, but <span class="col_2771-2772" refersTo="page_1403"/>we do not hear a word about that. Are there no negotiations&#x003F; Does the Minister think there is no need &#x2026;</p>

<p>The most important problem that we are going to face in the economy of South Africa in the next year or two is the effect of devaluation and continuing inflation on the income of the workers of South Africa. Here we have a Minister who is probably the largest single employer of labour in South Africa. He introduces a Budget running into over R1 000 million, and not a word about the position of the workers and the claims already announced by his staff associations. Sir, I think it is a deplorable performance. I think the only thing one can say in mitigation of the Minister&#x2019;s attitude is, as I have said before, that he cannot help it; he belongs to the worst government that we have ever known in South Africa. As I think it is necessary that we should go into that in a little more detail, I move&#x2014;</p>

<heading>BANTU LAWS AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Committee Stage)</summary>

<p>Clause 2:</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>This clause purports to bind Bantu women in the Transvaal and Natal to obtain the consent of their guardians or their fathers before they marry. It provides that if the father or the guardian cannot be found, or if the refusal to give permission to a marriage is unreasonable, the woman concerned can appeal to the Minister for his consent or she can go to the Supreme Court. Sir, I indicated in the Second Reading debate that we would oppose this clause. We object to this provision obliging a mature, adult woman to get the consent of her guardian before she can enter into a civil marriage. We made it quite clear that as far as customary unions are concerned, we have no objection to that provision; it is in fact Bantu law that the consent of the father or the guardian shall be obtained before there is a recognized customary union. But, Sir, this provision that we are now writing into our law is contrary to the progress which has taken place amongst the Bantu. I say it is wrong to bind them to old customs which in any event are often difficult to Minister that the leaders of the Bantu in ascertain. We are now told by the Deputy the homelands themselves asked for this. We asked him whom he had consulted besides the leaders of the Bantu in the homelands, and he told us that those were the only persons he had consulted. When we asked him whether he had consulted the urban Bantu, he said that the urban Bantu were represented in the councils in the homelands but that at the time this consultation took place with the Bantu in the homelands there was in fact no such representation. It appears from his reply that they took no steps to consult the local Bantu boards in the urban areas. We say, Sir, that these people should have been consulted. After all, they are the people who will be affected most by this Bill. We have no objection to the Bantu Legislative Assembly or Territorial Authority, or whatever body is in charge of the homeland, making laws appertaining to that homeland. If they wish to make laws through their bodies, defining how their marriages will be regulated, they are entitled to do so. What we object to is the fact that these Bantu Authorities will be able to tell the Minister what law he must apply outside of the homelands. We pointed out that in the Transvaal and Natal, outside of the homelands, there are Bantu belonging to other tribes, or other nations, as this Government calls them. In Soweto there must be thousands of Transkei citizens. Why should they be bound by a measure of this nature&#x003F; In the Transkei we do not bind a woman who is a major to get her father&#x2019;s consent before she marries; she is treated like any other woman. We say it is time these disabilities were removed from Bantu women in the same way that they have been removed from other women. The tendency in this Parliament has been to remove disabilities from women, and we say <span class="col_2773-2774" refersTo="page_1404"/>it is a backward step now to go and impose further disabilities upon Bantu women. Once a Bantu woman marries in the Transvaal or Natal, she will have to get her parents&#x2019; consent, no matter how old she is. She may be a widow or she may be a divorcee, but she will still have to get her parents&#x2019; or her guardian&#x2019;s consent.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Rissik said that I was pleading for a permissive society &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; because I had said in my Second Reading speech that with this permissive society that we have today, we should make it easier for people to get married, not more difficult, so that in fact they can have a legal union. What did he say&#x003F; He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hulle is besig om vir hom&#x2014;die Naturel&#x2014;te s&#x00EA;: &#x201E;Maak jou eenvoudig maar los; ons leef in &#x2019;n w&#x00EA;reld wat permissief is waar geen norme moet tel nie; gaan eenvoudig maar aan totdat ons &#x2019;n toestand bereik van totale promisku&#x00EF;-teit of totale agamie.&#x201D; Ek dink dit is &#x2019;n baie onverantwoordelike standpunt.</block>

<p>He then went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Maar hy (referring to me) het die Stelling gemaak dat die moderne gemeenskap meer permissief geword het en op grond daarvan moet jy nie &#x2019;n paartjie wanneer huile gaan trou, bind aan die ou reels en regulasies nie.</block>

<p>Sir, that was not the gist of my argument. What I said was that you should make it easier for them to marry so that they can live in lawful union, not in unlawful union. By making it more difficult for them to marry, you will increase the number of illegal unions amongst the Bantu and you will increase the number of illegitimate births, and it will further undermine the already unstable structure of Bantu family life which is presently being disrupted by influx control and the migrant labour policy. Sir, if it is difficult for a man to marry the woman of his choice because her parents or her guardian will not agree, he is simply going to live with her. We know that this is happening more and more frequently, and I say that this is something that we should try to avoid. As I pointed out in the Second Reading debate, the guardian may in fact have no interest in the woman at all, except for her dowry. He may be far removed; he may be a cousin far removed. Her father may be dead, there may be no brothers, and the guardian may be a distant relative, and the only interest he would show in her would be because of her dowry. I say it is wrong for her to have to worry about getting the consent of a man of that type. It is all very well for the hon. the Deputy Minister to say that the guardian&#x2019;s refusal is not final. Sir, why should these women be put to the expense of having to go either to a court of law or to employ somebody, as they would probably have to do, to take steps to obtain the Minister&#x2019;s consent. The hon. the Deputy Minister will say that the present law in Natal is being maintained under this Bill. The White Paper says that it is the same in the Transvaal, too, but I dispute that; I am not certain that that is the position in the Transvaal at the moment. However, there is no doubt about it that that is the law in Natal. In Natal a Native woman now remains under perpetual tutelage and I submit that in our time, today, that is quite wrong. Sir, we have developed. We have changed our own customs. We do not abide by the customs of our forefathers and I do not see why we should expect these people, in the changed circumstances in which they live, to abide by the customs which they obtained when the White man first came to this country. We will oppose this clause.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. D. K. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Just as on the previous occasion, I have again listened attentively to the hon. member for Transkei, and I find it interesting that now, so it seems to me, he is advocating &#x201C;women&#x2019;s liberation&#x201D;, just like the hon. member for Wynberg. The problem of modern society is not the emancipation of women, but I think it is the &#x201C;ewomancipation&#x201D; of some men. I want to tell the hon. member that in his speech he said &#x201C;in these days of permissive societies it should be our aim to make marriage easier and not more difficult for these people&#x201D;. I think that this view on the part of the hon. member is a very superficial one in the sense that I pointed out to him in my Second Reading speech that marriage, the ways of getting married and the forms of marriage, have a specific meaning in the Bantu communities, and that the fact of these people&#x2019;s coming into contact with the White man has, very often through circumstances <span class="col_2775-2776" refersTo="page_1405"/>and at other times through deliberate influencing by the imperialistic White governments and very often also by people who said that their own customs were worthless, resulted not only in the ways of getting married and the marriage forms being changed, but also in a really detrimental influence being exerted on family life as such. Making it easier to get married without seeing the full context is very irresponsible and not well-considered. I want to refer the hon. member to a work compiled by A. Schapira a number of years ago. <i>The Bantu-speaking Tribes of South Africa,</i> in which a certain lady, Ellen Heilman, wrote <i>inter alia</i> the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Marital infidelity is extremely common &#x2026;</block>

<p>She was writing under the title &#x201C;The Native in Towns&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; so common, indeed, that many Natives state in their exaggeration of bitterness that happy marriages and peaceful homes no longer exist. This increasing sexual promiscuity is due in part to the prevailing laxity of the urban moral code, strict standards of behaviour and sanctions to enforce them barely existing.</block>

<p>If you read her comments further, what they amount to is that leaving the tribal context and discarding those old values have a detrimental influence on Bantu family life. The hon. member referred rather mockingly to the so-called Bantu leaders.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>No, I did not want to mock them.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. D. K. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Very well, you did not refer to them mockingly, but you did say that these Bantu leaders to whom we referred and whose advice we had accepted, should in truth just confine themselves to their homelands. But the hon. member must not think that the Bantu leaders of the homelands, or those Bantu living in the homelands, are quite so far removed from their compatriots or tribal associates in the cities that, on the one hand, they have no interest in them and, on the other hand, know nothing about them. You will be amazed to know what knowledge and interest in each other those people still have. But if the hon. member does not want to accept the requests by the Bantu leaders, who I think are responsible in the sense that they realize that there is a measure of disintegration in their own national communities, I should like him to go and read the works of White sociologists who have studied the state of family life in urban complexes. Then he will see that the solution he wants to offer in place of the wishes of these Bantu leaders, is very far from a really meaningful solution. I want the hon. members opposite to go into these matters very thoroughly. I want to say that in order to comply with the requests of these Bantu leaders, whom I myself regard as responsible persons and as persons who are interested in their people as well as in protecting family life, it is essential that we listen to these people and not to those who do not care and who want to be so modern that they recklessly reject the essential things that modern life needs for stability.</p>

<p>Before calling upon the hon. member for Houghton to speak, I want to draw hon. members&#x2019; attention to the fact that we are here dealing with the Committee Stage of a Bill. The general principles of this Bill were agreed to at the Second Reading, and therefore I cannot allow a broad, general discussion to be conducted today on the principles of this Bill. Hon. members may briefly mention their objections to this clause, but I cannot allow another broad, general discussion to be held.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would say that Dr. Ellen Heilman, whom I know very well indeed, would be most surprised to hear the hon. member for Rissik quoting her in support of his somewhat &#x201C;verkrampte&#x201D; views on this subject. Dr. Ellen Heilman is a well-known anthropologist and an expert on the urban African. Her whole thesis is that the society in which the urban African finds himself or herself today leads to broken homes and illicit union. She would indeed be very surprised to hear the words she has written being quoted to substantiate the support that the hon. member for Rissik is giving to clause 2 of this Bill.</p>

<p>Like the hon. member for Transkei, I am going to oppose this clause most strenuously. The hon. the Deputy Minister stated that the African leaders want this clause introduced, but he failed to tell us with which African leaders he consulted. I <span class="col_2777-2778" refersTo="page_1406"/>should like to ask him whether, for instance, he consulted with Chief Buthelezi of Zululand since this matter particularly affects Natal, and whether Chief Buthelezi asked that this clause be introduced in the law. I should like to know, too, if he consulted chiefs in the Transvaal, the Venda chief, the Tswana chief and other chiefs of the Transvaal homelands and whether he has asked them if they want this clause. However, never mind about that&#x2014;that is just information.</p>

<p>I want to know if he consulted the urban Bantu councils about this clause, for instance, the Urban Bantu Council of Soweto, the largest urban African concentration, where hundreds of thousands of African women live. Indeed, on that Urban Bantu Council there are women councillors who are very able people who should be consulted about this matter. There are African women who are running child welfare societies, marriage guidance societies; all sorts of welfare societies are being run by educated, urbanized, sophisticated African women and I want to know if the hon. the Deputy Minister consulted any of these people, who are surely in the best position to be able to advise him on the advisability or not of extending what is an archaic law.</p>

<p>The laws that govern marriage of African women in the Transvaal

 and Natal hier back to the turn of the century and I cannot for the moment understand why, in the year 1972, we are trying to extend the authority of those laws. The hon. the Deputy Minister must also explain to me why it is all right for African women in the Orange Free State and the Cape to marry under civil laws which apply to women of other races but it is not all right for African women in the Transvaal or Natal to marry under those laws. As I understand it, the position at present is that in Natal, where the Natal Code of course still operates, permission of the guardian or father has to be obtained for a woman to enter into a customary union unless she is emancipated. If she is emancipated then that is not required. Do I understand that this measure is now going to make it compulsory for women entering into civil marriages to acquire the consent of the guardian or father&#x003F; Until now I understand that there has been no provision for civil marriages at all for African women in Natal. They can only marry, unless they marry under customary union, under religious ceremonies. This, I understand, is now going to make it possible for women in Natal to be married by civil ceremonies. Will even the emancipated women in Natal have to acquire the consent of the guardian or father&#x003F; This is the first question I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister.</p>

<p>So civil marriages are now open to Bantu women in Natal for the first time. I want to say immediately that this is an improvement. But even emancipated women, who do not under the present law have to have the consent, if they are over the age of 21, of the father or guardian, are now going to have to obtain consent if they want to enter into civil marriages. Is that the position&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>That, of course, is a retrogressive step. I understand that the legal position in the Transvaal is that in fact women do not have to get the consent of guardians or fathers if they are over the age of 21 in order to marry by civil rites in the Transvaal. What they have to get at the present stage, is an enabling document from the Bantu Affairs Commissioner to allow them to marry. They have to present this enabling document to the marriage officer before they can get married. Are women in the Transvaal now actually going to have to get the consent of their fathers or guardians&#x003F; If that is the case, this is utterly retrogressive. As the hon. member for Transkei has pointed out, it is very often very difficult to trace either a guardian or a father if a woman has been living in an urban area for many years and the guardian or father lived in the homelands. Provision is made for her to get the consent of the Supreme Court or a Bantu Commissioner, but this is both a costly and complicated procedure. The hon. the Deputy Minister has advanced no reasons whatsoever why he is taking this retrogressive step as far as African women of the Transvaal are concerned. I do not understand the purpose of clause 2 at all. I really do not. As I have said, we have thousands of women today who are living sophisticated lives in the urban areas of South Africa. They are educated, manage their own household and many of them are earning a living. They do not need to be treated <span class="col_2779-2780" refersTo="page_1407"/>as children. If a woman&#x2019;s husband dies and she wishes to remarry she has to become a minor again. What sort of nonsense is this&#x003F; Any woman who is not married and is over the age of 21 has to go seeking some person whom she may never have set eyes on&#x2014;and the hon. member for Rissik nods his head with a satisfied smirk, so &#x201C;verkramp&#x201D; is he&#x2014;in the homelands before she can marry the man of her choice. This is the most ridiculous piece of legislation I have come across in a long while and I shall certainly oppose this clause.</p>

<p>When he replied to the Second Reading debate&#x2014;and here I am afraid it is the first time we have had this sort of information &#x2014;the Deputy Minister told us that he did not consult with the leaders of the urban Bantu councils because, at that stage, the urban Bantu councils were not represented on the tribal authorities.

<p>What was there to prevent this hon. the Deputy Minister from consulting with responsible urban Bantu leaders, such as the members of the Urban Bantu Councils&#x003F; It is no excuse for him to tell us that he could not consult with them because they were not represented on the tribal authorities. What sort of nonsense is this&#x003F; Does he not recognize the existence of urban African people until they have some sort of representation through their tribal authorities&#x003F; No, that does not wash at all. When he says that he thinks it is only reasonable for these people to decide for themselves what should happen to them, it is precisely what he is not allowing for. He is not allowing the people to whom this will apply to decide for themselves. Take Soweto as an example. To how many adult women of Soweto will this clause apply&#x003F; 100 000&#x003F; I should think it is probably far more. Why could he then not go to the Urban Bantu Council of Soweto and test the opinion of the local people&#x003F; Is there some ideological reason for this&#x003F; If so, he has not told us. Or did he realize from the start that the people of Soweto&#x2014;and I am only using Soweto as one example&#x2014;would from the start simply say: &#x201C;Look, we do not want this&#x201D;&#x003F; That must be the case.</p>

<p>Returning to the hon. member for Rissik, I am afraid that in spite of all that was said after he spoke in the Second Reading debate, and in spite of what the hon. members for Transkei and Houghton have said in this Committee Stage, he still has the blinkers on. When he talks about the permissive society, what could militate more against a permissive society &#x2026;</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Rissik was allowed to make a reference to the work by Dr. Ellen Hellman. I should like to reply very briefly to him on that point. I want to refer to this just by way of reply. He quoted her referring to the marital infidelity that takes place in the urban African community. He referred to sexual promiscuity and that sort of thing. That is for one reason, and one reason alone, namely that in the urban African communities there has been a relaxation of the tribal authority over the people. It is the sort of thing that happens anyway. They have come to accept the same sort of norms that we, as urban dwellers, accept, and that is precisely why we should reject this clause, so as to substitute for the very sort of discipline, the tribal discipline, which is being removed. What better discipline could there be than when persons can marry when they want to, and take upon themselves the responsibility of marriage rather than just living together, with all the attendant consequences. I cannot conceive of any reason why that hon. member should argue against us on this clause. What, in any case, could be better than trying to arrange a system whereby people can get married instead of simply living together&#x003F; I do not propose to recap the arguments dealing with the principle, but I want this hon. Minister to tell us whether he will not consider even at this stage agreeing with us on the question of this clause. It is not too late for him to agree to leave this clause in abeyance until he and his department have had a chance of consulting with the people to whom it is going to apply. He gave as his reason earlier the fact that urban Bantu councils were not represented on the tribal authorities and he indicated that they now are. If that is the position, what harm will be done if clause 2 is simply dropped from this Bill at this stage. He can always come with this clause again; he can come with it later this Session, if he wants to, in the General Law Amendment Bill. What is to prevent him from agreeing with us to drop the clause now until proper consultation has taken place and, I want to add, until proper consultation has taken place not only with urban Africans, but also with people such as Chief Buthelezi.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member became quite excited when I interrupted him about his question as to whether the urban Bantu Council of Soweto, for example, has been consulted and whether the urban Bantu in general have been consulted about this matter, while at this stage of his political career he knows quite well what the policy of the National Party is in regard to a situation such as this. The National Party recognizes one Tswana people, one Venda people, one Zulu people&#x2014;and not one people in the homeland and another in Soweto. The Government does not regard them as a people who are partly independent here and partly independent somewhere else. This is not the policy of the Government, and this is one of the reasons why consultation should not take place in this manner to confuse those people further as the United Party and the Progressive Party confuse them in the ethnological sense. They have their leaders in the homelands and they have their leaders who represent them in the urban areas. Those people have been consulted in the proper way. This is one of the aspects I want to point out to the hon. member. Another aspect I want to mention to the hon. member, one he failed to see and one which led to my interjection&#x2014;because I think the hon. member does fail to see this aspect&#x2014; is that if he refers to the Act which applies to the urban Bantu Councils and the functions prescribed for those councils in that Act, he will see that it is by no means the function of such an urban Bantu Council to consider legislation or a principle of this nature. That is the crux of the matter. One does not consult a council such as this, a council charged solely with local administrative functions, on the basis the hon. member wants it to be consulted on matters pertaining to the principle which applies here. I do not want to discuss the <span class="col_2783-2784" refersTo="page_1409"/>principle which applies in section 2, but for that reason I say to the hon. member that the question he asked the hon. the Deputy Minister as to whether these people have been consulted in the manner he wants them to be consulted, is completely out of step with the debate which has been conducted here. I think my point of view on this matter is quite correct.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Potchefstroom lives in a cloud-cuckoo land, it seems to me. He takes absolutely no cognizance of the enormous changes that have taken place in African society as the result of urbanization. It does not occur to him that the tribal woman living in the homelands is an entirely different human being from the sophisticated, educated westernized woman in the town, who has learnt to dress in Western style, talks a Western language and uses Western transport. She would no sooner dream of going down to the river and carry a pot of water on her head than she would, I would say, dream of sitting down to a cup of tea with the hon. member for Potchefstroom. I might say it would do him the world of good if he met some of these urbanized African women. If he would sit down and have a conversation with them, he would see that his idea that there is one nation with no differentiation, irrespective of education or the effects of urbanization, is utter nonsense. He ought to meet a lady like Mrs. Constance Ntshona who is a member of the Urban Bantu Council in Soweto, a highly intelligent and sophisticated woman, who has been running her own business with the greatest success for a number of years. For him to suggest that a lady like that, in the unfortunate event of her becoming a widow, would have to go and seek out some guardian in the homeland, is utter nonsense.</p>

<p>Well, Sir, he may not have said it, but that is the practical effect of clause 2. In fact, the Urban Bantu Council does have to do with matters like marriages, illicit unions and the general way of life of people in the urban areas. One of their great concerns is the way in which the White man&#x2019;s laws and customs have in fact resulted in their having to live the sort of life in the urban areas of which they strongly disapprove. Now, when marriage ought to be made easier among urban Africans, we come along with a law in 1972 to make it more difficult for Africans to contract marriages. What sort of nonsense is it that we are engaged in this afternoon&#x003F; I say that the African women, with all their disabilities, the status, the legal status of African women, deserves a thorough investigation. In fact, in 1965, if my memory serves me rightly, Minister De Wet Nel actually appointed a departmental committee to go into the whole question of the legal status of African women, because he realized at that time that considerable changes were needed. I sincerely hope he was not thinking of changes in this direction. He was thinking perhaps of changes to modernize the status of African women. Well, the committee gave up the unequal struggle about a year later. We have never heard from it since. But I believe an investigation is absolutely necessary, because we have not only to do with the question of the discrimination against African women in the Transvaal and Natal, who have to get permission from these guardians&#x2014;whom they may never have seen&#x2014; but also with all sorts of other questions about their right to inherit, and so on, which we should be investigating. Instead, this Committee is passing a law this afternoon which is retrogressive and takes African women further back as far as status and equality are concerned. I want the hon. the Minister to explain to me what makes an African woman in the Cape or in the Orange Free State more responsible and more able to decide whether or not she should marry after the age of 21 without the consent of a guardian or her father, than a woman who lives in the Transvaal or in Natal. That explanation has never been given.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Houghton makes her allegation on the basis that members on this side of the House are completely unaware of the social and other circumstances of the Bantu in urban areas. I want to tell the hon. member that during the session of the Urban Bantu Council of Johannesburg a week ago I had an opportunity of listening to a short speech made by the Bantu woman the hon. member referred to. It was simply a case of my not being able to remember her name. Of course, I agree with her wholeheartedly that there are people in the urban areas who have achieved this <span class="col_2785-2786" refersTo="page_1410"/>cultural level. But that is not what this clause is concerned with. That is my argument. Hon. members opposite want to drag into this Committee Stage&#x2014;with all due respect to the Chair&#x2014;matters which have nothing to do with this clause. Whether we on this side of the House admit that the urban Bantu woman has a different way of life, a Westernized way of life as against that of the majority of women in the homeland areas has nothing to do with the matter. The question hon. members ask the hon. the Deputy Minister is whether he consulted these people or not. Our reply to that is: Consultation has taken place through the recognized, constitutional bodies which have been established for the purpose of consulting these people. This is what it is all about, and these other matters should not be dragged into the discussions to make a little political gain in this regard.</p>

<block name="quote">Indien die Minister &#x2026; na behoorlike ondersoek oortuig is dat &#x2019;n Bantoevroue-persoon bedoel in subartikel (1) nie &#x2019;n vader &#x2026; het nie &#x2026;</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the arguments that have been advanced in regard to this clause this afternoon deal for the most part with the question of consultation. I made the position quite clear during the Second Reading, and I shall repeat it now. In the first place, I just want to say that I was not asked whether the urban Bantu council had been consulted. As far as I know, I was asked whether the urban Bantu had been consulted. My reply is, of course, that certain avenues have been established; the Bantu people have their leaders and they have their political bodies. Any person who wants to make representations and who belongs to one of these peoples, is free to make representations through those recognized bodies. Suppose we consult these peoples in the urban areas and their replies differ from those of the others. Should we make changes then or should we decide to do this, that or the other thing&#x003F; Perhaps I should state again what our approach is. We are not passing a new law here. This law has been in existence for almost 100 years, and the Bantu have asked that it continue to exist. Our argument is that it is now for the Bantu to decide. They have their recognized avenues; the Government has assisted them in establishing those bodies and these various peoples can now make representations to the various leaders in the various areas. If any changes are to be made, let them make the changes. Right from the start argument was: In this regard it is not for us Whites to force any decisions down the throats of the Bantu peoples. On what grounds does the hon. member for Houghton or any other hon. member now argue &#x2026;</p>

<p>Yes, that is what he said a moment ago. Let me read from his Hansard. Sir, this makes me wonder what sort of Government we are dealing with. This is the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s Hansard of two days ago. He was dealing with the question of consultation and my colleague, the hon. member for Transkei, asked him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Het u vir die Bantoerade in die stede gevra wat hulle wil h&#x00EA;&#x003F;</block>

Sir, this is nonsense. I would suggest to the hon. the Deputy Minister that he reads his own Hansard. He may then remember what he said.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the hon. member for Potchefstroom, who allowed his own arguments to confound him. He argued that the Government recognizes only one Venda people and only one Sotho people and that, he said, was the reason why there had been consultation only with the tribal authorities in the decision to apply this clause to the entire Transvaal and to the entire Natal. But his own argument militates against what he was saying. After all, it might be very well that the Government recognizes only one Venda people, but then why do they not recognize only one Xhosa people, for instance&#x003F; What about the Xhosas of Soweto&#x003F; Why were the Transkei and Ciskei authorities not consulted because their people are also being affected&#x003F; That in itself is reason enough why there should have been consultation with the urban Bantu councils, because they represent the people who live there. By no stretch of the imagination can it be said that the tribal authorities of the Transvaal or the tribal authorities of Natal are truly representative of all the Bantu people of those provinces. Is this not elementary&#x003F; If the hon. member for Potchefstroom will only sit down quietly and think for a moment while another speaker on this side, or on his own side, talks for 10 minutes, he will have to agree with us. We must now come back to the hon. the Deputy Minister <span class="col_2789-2790" refersTo="page_1412"/>and insist on an answer from him. Why was there no consultation with the people to whom this clause is going to apply&#x003F;</p>

<p>Hon. members opposite, at the outset, spoke about councils in general and of the urban Bantu. I did furnish a reply, but I referred to the councils of deputies which were not in existence at that time. I do not want to split hairs, but I made the position quite clear that no avenues existed at that time; even if such avenues had existed the urban Bantu should nevertheless have made representations through their authorities. These channels are in existence now, and with that I want to conclude. As far as I am concerned, it is no use arguing about it. Basically it is for the Bantu to decide. These are laws which have been in existence and which we want to change after we have consulted them; we shall not change the laws without consultation. If there are any Bantu who want to make representations to their respective peoples they may do so, and we can then discuss the matter further. I do not want to argue about the merits of the case. The position is simply that this is the custom of these people; this is a longstanding custom; and we cannot ignore the fact that this is so and summarily do away with it, i.e. the political leaders have every opportunity of taking this matter further through the right channels. They can then approach us and we can consider this matter further. I can see no reason why the law cannot be changed to suit them should a request of this nature be made. That is why we approached these people when we contemplated the repeal of the old Act. This will be done again, but let them ask for it. Let us not come to this House with clever talk and dramatize this matter as the hon. member for Kensington did. I accept the fact that he gets very little opportunity to make himself felt elsewhere, and this debate about the rights of Bantu women affords him an excellent opportunity to do so. I do not begrudge him the small degree of satisfaction he derives from this, but I feel that we are wasting the time of the Committee by discussing this matter any further at this stage.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the way in which the hon. the Deputy Minister has replied to the hon. member for Kensington shows that the little authority that he has has gone to his head. He now has an opportunity of dealing with this matter, but instead of doing so he makes jokes at another person&#x2019;s expense. Sir, it does not befit a Minister to reply to a debate in this manner. It is all very well for him to say that he consulted certain leaders and chiefs, but he is not going to give their names. Why did he take that attitude&#x003F; Is he afraid to give us the names of these leaders&#x003F; Sir, if these leaders were true leaders of their people and if they spoke the way their people wanted them to speak, there would be no harm in giving their names. You only refuse to give names when you fear that there will be some sort of reaction against the people who have given you the information. We cannot be satisfied with the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s statement that he consulted with &#x201C; &#x2019;n Bantoe wat baie sterk gestaan het onder sy mense&#x201D;. Sir, his excuse for not consulting with the urban Bantu is not valid either. It is quite clear that, after speaking about &#x201C;Bantoerade&#x201D;, I went on to refer to the Bantu in the cities. He could easily have consulted with them. After all, there are more Bantu living in Soweto than there are in the Transvaal Reserves. If this law is to be for the good of all the Bantu, then I ask him what is to happen to the people from the Transkei and the Ciskei&#x2014;the Xhosas and the Basothos. Is it fair to bind them to the custom of the Tswanas&#x003F; Is it fair to them in terms of the Government&#x2019;s policy&#x003F; Not at all. As far as the Xhosas and the Basothos are concerned, they can have a civil marriage without the parents&#x2019; consent. The arguments advanced by the hon. members for Rissik and Potchefstroom would hold water if they were proposing to abolish civil marriages altogether amongst the Bantu and to bind them only to customary unions; then I would say that they would have a valid argument, but if they are going to allow the Bantu to have civil marriages, then the civil law should apply as it applies in the Cape and in the Free State.</p>

He is only arguing about consultation. <span class="col_2791-2792" refersTo="page_1413"/>He agrees with me that if you are going to allow civil marriages, then the civil law should apply. The hon. the Deputy Minister, in his reply to me in the Second Reading, said there was no necessity for him to consult the Transkei. I say there was necessity because I do not see why the citizens of the Transkei should be bound by the laws of the Tswanas. Why could you then not amend your laws to this effect. We know the citizens of the various nations, as they call them now, because certificates are being issued, so it is quite easy to say that citizens of the particular tribes whose leaders have asked for this prohibition, shall have the consent of their parents or guardians, but where other Bantu women marry I submit that they should be allowed to marry in terms of the wishes of their leaders.

<p>No, it is not a new measure, but a measure which has been in existence for a hundred years and may therefore well need revision. And it is indeed being revised in the case of the African men, but it is not being revised in the case of the African women. One would have thought that that was of enormous importance and that great care would have been taken to consult. I think this is the moral one must draw from this. The hon. member for Potchefstroom and the hon. member for Rissik gave us the answer. We are saddled with this stupid provision because the Government are so obsessed with their ideology in this regard that they really did not take the trouble to consult with these people in the cities. That is the trouble. Had the hon. the Deputy Minister in fact consulted with these urban representatives of the tribal authorities, I would have asked to what extent did those urban representatives consult with the urban Bantu people. And I was going to say that one would wonder what advice they gave back to the tribal authorities, and, if they advised that it was acceptable, it would show how unsatisfactory this arrangement is. Indeed I believe that also is the position, that this arrangement whereby 5 million urban African people have their views conveyed to the Government through a handful of representatives, stationed in the cities, is indeed a system which is not going to be satisfactory, never can be satisfactory, and is a further indication of the wrong road upon which this Government is in this regard.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we do not seem to be able to get any real explanation from the hon. the Deputy Minister as to why this clause is being introduced. He keeps on saying it is because &#x201C;they&#x201D; wanted it. I would like to know who came to see whom about this. Did he receive a deputation of African leaders from the various tribes such as the Vendas, the Tswanas and the Zulus, asking him for this clause&#x003F; Firstly, then, I should like to know what motivated the introduction of this clause.</p>

<p>Secondly, the hon. the Deputy Minister tells us this has always been the law. I must say that that justification for reintroducing in 1972 in a somewhat different form a law which dates back to 1897 in the one case and, I think, 1900 in the other, is no explanation whatsoever.</p>

<p>Then I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister whether he is aware that it is in fact not the law in the Transvaal that a woman over the age of 21 must get the <span class="col_2793-2794" refersTo="page_1414"/>consent of a guardian or her father to marry. The opinion I have is as follows: That marriages of Africans in the Transvaal, which are regulated by Law No. 3 of 1897 and Proclamation No. 6 of 1900, have certain requirements. By the way, they can choose either a civil or a religious marriage unlike the Africans in Natal, who can only be married by religious ceremony, at least until now. Before a marriage in the Transvaal can be solemnized, each partner must submit to a Bantu Affairs Commissioner, a certificate from his or her parent, guardian, chief or a minister of religion, stating that there is no legal impediment to the marriage. That is different from obtaining consent. In addition, the bridegroom must satisfy the official that he has complied with both the pass and the tax laws. The official must, in turn, explain the moral and legal significance of the marriage. Thereafter, if the official is satisfied, he issues an enabling certificate. The couple produce this certificate before a marriage officer, who may then go ahead and perform the ceremony. But the bride, if she is over the age of 21, does not at present require in the Transvaal the legal consent of her guardian. That is how I understand the position. The opinion I have been given is that this has been confirmed by the magistrate at the Bantu Affairs Commissioner&#x2019;s court in Johannesburg. The authority quoted is the Native Appeal Court Ruling of 1949 in the case of <i>Letabe vs. Ralithlalo.</i> I will give the hon. the Minister the exact reference.</p>

It is no excuse for the hon. the Deputy Minister to say that they want it. They want a lot of things which this House never has any difficulty in refusing them.

<p>No, I merely mentioned his name because he was the chief of the Zulu nation. He and his chiefs, amongst others, expressed the feeling of the majority in stating this should be maintained. After all, the other leaders may consider the matter and make representations to us. However, this is the factual position and we should not argue unnecessarily about who should be consulted and where this should take place, or about whether the Bantu in the Transkei, for example, should be consulted about a law of the Whites which applies in the White areas of the Transvaal and Natal. Surely we cannot act as comprehensively as all that, because then we will also have to consult the Swazis in Swaziland, large numbers of whom work in the White areas. <span class="col_2795-2796" refersTo="page_1415"/>We have to be practical. I am very sympathetic to the approach of the enlightened century in which we are living, in accordance with which the Bantu females in the cities are so different. I want to ask that we should bear in mind that these Bantu form part of a people and a culture, and that they decide on it collectively. Let us leave it to them to decide these matters. I do not think there were any other questions which have a bearing on this. It seems to me we are unnecessarily wasting time on this matter, but I think I have replied to the really significant questions.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am terribly sorry, but let us not talk about wasting time. This measure is going to apply to probably hundreds of thousands of people right away and I think this Committee could well spend a bit of time on it, because it involves the personal interests of so many people. Let us therefore not try to brush this matter aside. The hon. the Deputy Minister still has not replied to the points raised by the hon. member for Transkei, why he relies entirely on the decisions of tribal leaders and then tries to apply this clause willy&#x002D;nilly throughout each province. We now have the authority he consulted, namely Cyprian Bekhezulu. I would suggest that before we go any further with this, he should perhaps check with some other African leaders. I do not think that the authority he gave us is good enough. I think that he should go, for example, to somebody of the character of Chief Gatsha Buthelezi &#x2026;</p>

<p>Why not&#x003F; I want to take the point raised by the hon. member for Transkei a little further and ask this hon. Deputy Minister to be very careful in replying to me. Flowing from what was said by the hon. member for Transkei, I want to draw his attention to something that he said when he replied to the Second Reading Debate. He said: &#x201C;Ons moet vir hierdie mense die reg gee &#x2026;"&#x2014;he is talking about the Bantu people&#x2014;&#x201C;om in hulle gebiede, onder hulle mense, sekere dinge te laat geld, en dit is wat ons hier doen&#x201D;. He talks about this applying in their territories and I want to ask him immediately whether, as a point of Government policy, Soweto is now to be regarded as being within the territorial jurisdiction&#x2014;not the jurisdiction over people&#x2014;of the Bantu tribal authorities. This is a very important point. He himself has said so. If this is going to be made to apply to the entire province, which includes places such as Soweto, he is now conceding, on the authority of his Second Reading speech, that in terms of Government policy the tribal authorities have territorial jurisdiction over the urban Bantu areas.</p>

<p>Clause 6:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, here we have a clause where the Committee is being asked to provide that certain persons, having been convicted within the Republic, or what the Government likes to refer to as White South Africa, can be transferred to prisons which will now be under the control and the administration of th&#x003F; Transkei Government. Many questions were asked during the Second Reading debate questions which the hon. the Deputy Minister did not answer in full. The fact that the Transkei Government will be allowed to make its own laws, laws which may differ from those which apply in the Republic, and the fact that a person, having been convicted in the Republic, can be transferred to the Transkei, will mean that a person would find himself imprisoned under the laws of the Transkei. This is the one point that the hon. the Deputy Minister has not replied to. The fact that different regulations may govern the remission of sentence and the fact that different regulations may govern the imposition of extra conditions of imprisonment, such as spare diet, such as solitary confinement, for prison offences&#x2014;I must admit, for prison offences&#x2014;the fact that these could be different when applied by the Transkeian Government, was mentioned during the Second Reading debate, but again we did not get any answer from the hon. the Deputy Minister.</p>

<p>Then there is one particular point which I do not think was raised with the hon. the Deputy Minister in the Second Reading debate, and it is a point in regard to which I would like an explicit answer from the hon. the Deputy Minister. The proposed new section 50A (2) determines and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A convicted Bantu person who has been sentenced to imprisonment and is still liable to serve the sentence imposed or part thereof may&#x2014;</block>

<p>and then certain provisions are mentioned. Why does the hon. the Deputy Minister embrace all Bantu people in this case&#x003F; Here we are dealing with an amendement to the Transkei Constitution Act. It is an amendment which applies to one area of the Republic only and that is the Transkei. We are giving this power to one authority only, viz. to the Transkei Legislative Council. Yet it is being applied to all Bantu persons within the Republic and in terms of this, as I read it, a Zulu who had been arrested in Johannesburg and who had been sentenced to imprisonment there, can be transferred to a prison in the Transkei. Similarly, a Sotho, a Venda, a Shangaan or a Twsana. Is there any particular reason why this should be so wide as to allow for any Bantu person or all Bantu people to be transferred to a prison in the Transkei. I hope I shall get an answer from the hon. the Deputy Minister in this regard.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District says that there may be different laws and regulations in regard to prisons in the Transkei and that we can transfer a person from the Republic to a prison in the Transkei, something with which he is apparently not satisfied. This is the position as regards prisons at the moment, but I do not think it will be easy to change if there are going to be drastic changes. It is not likely to happen before the people are completely independent, because then we will not have that kind of arrangement any more. These people are now in a stage of development and the proposal here is exactly the same as what was proposed in the Republic. If we have drastic changes we shall have to approach it in a realistic way, of course. I think this applies to the question of the laws and the treatment as well as to the handling of these prisoners. What I have just said covers, I hope, the <span class="col_2799-2800" refersTo="page_1417"/>first two questions asked by the hon. member.</p>

<p>In the third place the hon. member said that we were now calling this legislation &#x201C;Bantu legislation&#x201D; and that the classification and the issue of identity cards to the various peoples were only going to be done this year. We may classify it in detail later on, but we have not yet reached the stage where these identity cards or identity documents which are issued to a particular people have been issued. They are in the process of being issued. That is why there is reference to &#x201C;a Bantu&#x201D; in a general way. When all the documents have been issued and all the Xhosas have been identified as citizens of the Transkei by the document of citizenship we can introduce a change to make it more specific, but at the moment this does not apply yet and the general term &#x201C;Bantu&#x201D; is used. This does not mean that Vendas, Swazis and Shangaans will be transferred, however. It goes without saying, after all, that this is aimed at people of that area, at Xhosas.</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I must thank the hon. the Deputy Minister tor his reply, although I do not wholly agree with him. In regard to the first point, section 65 of the Prisons Act of 1959 makes provision that the laws for those prisons shall remain in force until they are repealed by the &#x201C;competent authority.&#x201D; I wonder if the hon. the Deputy Minister can give us an assurance now that the Transkei Government as it is constituted today would not be a &#x201C;competent authority.&#x201D; In terms of this amendment we are now giving the Transkei Government the power&#x2014;because we are amending their Constitution&#x2014;to control and regulate these prisons. Therefore I would submit that in terms of section 65 of the Prisons Act, the Transkei Government would now be a &#x201C;competent authority&#x201D;, an authority competent to change the laws, as they stand today, and to constitute its own laws for these prisons.</p>

<p>This brings me to the second part of the discussion, namely the fact that I believe that, because of that provision, the whole clause with which we are dealing now should be limited only to citizens of the Transkei. The hon. the Deputy Minister says it will happen in time. But I submit that even today it is possible to establish whether a Bantu is a citizen of the Transkei or not. We have passed the Bantu Citizenship Act and in terms of that Act certain people are citizens of the Transkei. Whether they have been issued with their documents of identity or certificates of citizenship, is incidental. Either they are citizens of the Transkei or they are not. It is a matter which is identifiable by law. It is a fact which can be ascertained in terms of the law as it is today. Because I am worried about this matter and because during the Second Reading debate the only reply the hon. the Deputy Minister could give was that in certain exceptional circumstances you might want to transfer a prisoner for specialized hospitalization, which I am afraid I cannot accept, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 43, to omit &#x201C;Bantu person&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;citizen of the Transkei&#x201D;.</block>

<p>In other words, the line would read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A convicted citizen of the Transkei who has been sentenced to imprisonment &#x2026;</block>

<p>In this way we hope to limit the application of this section to those people who are outside of the Transkei and are indeed Transkeian citizens.</p>

<p>Amendment put and negatived.</p>

<p>Clause, as printed, put and agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 7:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to discuss subsection (1) (c), which amends part B of the First Schedule to the Transkei Constitution Act&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">By the insertion after Item 12 of he following item: 12A. Motor carrier transportation in the districts mentioned in section 2, excluding any area in the district of Matatiele or Port St. Johns which is not a Bantu area: Provided that if the Motor Carrier Transportation Act, 1930 (Act No. 39 of 1930), continues to apply in the Transkei, there shall be no appeal in terms of section 6 (2) of the said Act to the Board referred to therein.</block>

<p>I am not so much interested in the second part, the proviso, but in the first portion. The Transkeian Assembly has certain powers, which are set out in Part B of <span class="col_2801-2802" refersTo="page_1418"/>the First Schedule to the Act. Item No. 10 reads as follows.</p>

<p>Public works and undertakings, roads, outspans, ponts and bridges in the Transkei, excluding bridges between the Transkei and any other part of the Republic and roads which have been declared to be national roads.</p>

<p>That means that the Transkei Government has no authority to control national roads or to pass legislation in respect of national roads. If we read the first portion of this paragraph again, we see that it applies to the districts mentioned in section 2 of the Transkei Constitution Act. Section 2 of that Act, which deals with the description of the Transkei, states <i>inter alia.</i></p>

<p>The Transkei shall, subject to the provisions of section 3, consist of all the Bantu areas described below, namely&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Then it sets out the different districts in the Transkei. We are now proposing to apply this law to all the districts in the Transkei and not only to the Bantu areas. If the Deputy Minister reads this paragraph, which we now intend passing, he will see that it states:</block>

<block name="quote">Motor carrier transportation in the districts mentioned in section 2, excluding any area in the district of Matatiele or Port St. Johns which is not a Bantu area &#x2026;</block>

<p>Now I submit that if it was intended to exclude the White areas from the districts mentioned in section 2 of the Transkei Constitution Act, that section should have included at the end &#x201C;but excluding the White areas&#x201D;. Special mention is made, in this reference to Matatiele and Port St. Johns, to the fact that the White areas are excluded, because only the Bantu areas are included. Now I want to ask the Deputy Minister: Is this intentional&#x003F; Has he considered this matter&#x003F; After all, we do not want to pass laws which are going to be meaningless and which cannot be applied. If it is meant to include all the White areas in the Transkei&#x2014;the White areas of the towns and the villages&#x2014;then I say it is <i>ultra vires,</i> because the Transkeian Legislative Assembly has no authority over the White areas, in terms of the description of the Transkei in section 2 of the Act. If, also, I am correct in saying that they can not legislate for the national roads, in terms of the item in the schedule, which I have quoted, then you are going to have the position that the Transkei will be cut in two, because the national road in fact runs from the Kei Bridge right through to Umzimkulu, practically cutting the Transkei in half. It will mean that the Transkeian Legislative Assembly will not be able to legislate for that road or the areas covered by that road, the White areas adjacent to that road. If I am right in my interpretation of the law, this will mean that their boards will only be able to grant exemptions for operators operating outside the urban areas, in the Bantu areas, and then they will only be able to operate on roads other than national roads. In reply to me during the Second Reading Debate, the Deputy Minister said that the operators wishing to proceed from outside the Transkei through the Transkei, for instance from the Cape to Natal, would have to obtain a permit from the Transkeian authorities. He said (Hansard 6/3, page 00.2)</p>

<block name="quote">Wat die transport betref om die magte van die Motortransportwet van 1930, nou oor te gee aan die Transkeise Regering, is daar &#x2019;n vraag gevra of &#x2019;n persoon van buite af nou deur die Transkei sal kan ry sonder inmenging. Ek wil net s&#x00EA; dat dit ongelukkig so is dat daar &#x2019;n permit sal moet gegee word.</block>

<p>Now I want to know: Will it be necessary in fact for an operator operating under a permit covering the Republic, to obtain a permit to travel on the national road through the Transkei&#x003F; The Deputy Minister will know that there has been trouble about provincial traffic officials not being able to operate in the Transkei on the national roads. I shall be glad if he will answer these points I have raised.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as regards the national roads, I want to say that the road as such as well as its construction and maintenance, does not vest in the Transkei Government. But the traffic on that road is controlled by them. Therefore the position will be that persons who want to transport goods on that road, as well as the traffic passing through, will have to make the necessary arrangements and obtain the necessary permits. I think this answers the first question, and at the same time the second one as well.</p>

<p><span class="col_2803-2804" refersTo="page_1419"/>In respect of the White towns, the same reply applies. The interpretation is as it is stated here in the Bill.</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2020;As the hon. member stated, it reads:</block>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the district mentioned in section 2, excluding any area in the district of Matatiele or Port St. Johns which is not a Bantu area &#x2026;</block>

<p>According to the hon. member&#x2019;s argument, that would mean that these European towns are excluded.</p>

<p>*According to the approach of the legal men, the position is that that area, although it is a White area, falls under the management of the Transkei Government in respect of these particular functions it performs there. There are other matters too over which they have control in those towns, but they are specified. For example, the question of traffic is specifically mentioned. Therefore it means that they will control the traffic there.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am surprised to hear the Deputy Minister say that the Transkei Government has authority over White areas in the Transkei. I have never heard that before. They in fact have no authority until the State President issues a special proclamation to that effect. I am just trying to find it in the Act now. There is a provision in the Transkei Constitution Act, giving the Minister the power to have the White areas zoned and reserved for Bantu occupation, but until the State President issues a special proclamation placing them under the authority of the Transkei Government, they do not fall under the Transkei Government, although they have been reserved for Bantu occupation. Therefore I cannot accept that this Transportation Board, which is now to be established by the Transkei, will have any authority in the White areas of the Transkei. I shall be glad if the hon. the Deputy Minister will confirm this with his legal advisers, or give us an example in this connection. He said there were cases of this nature. I should like him to give me an example of cases where they have exercised authority in a White area.</p>

<p>I can mention two cases where the Transkei Government has authority, namely in respect of estates and the lower courts. But I promise to go further into the matter and all the implications. It sounds ridiculous to say that the Transkei Government has authority as regards the Bantu area, while there is a White town in the Bantu area, but they do have authority in the White town as regards certain matters.</p>

<p>Sir, certainly as far as the lower courts are concerned, that is nonsense. The Department of Bantu Administration has a lower court in Port St. Johns which is a White area. The Transkei Government has no authority in Port St. Johns. The court sits in Umtata, but the magistrates, who are members of the Transkei department, fall under the Department of Justice.</p>

<p>Sir, we are now learning something that we did not know before. This clause is going to have a drastic effect on the free movement of traffic on our national roads. I would like to suggest, as the hon. member for Transkei has suggested, that the hon. the Deputy Minister should take another look at the situation. In fact, I suggest that he should look again at the Transkei Constitution Act. You see, Sir, one of the sore points about the Transkei&#x2014;and it is necessary to canvass this&#x2014;is that there has been a total lack of road traffic control on the national road running through from East London to Durban. In other public forums reference has been made by other members of my party to the appalling accident rate on this road, and on every occasion that I can remember it has been stated that the Transkeian Government itself has no control over the traffic on these roads because they are national roads. I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister is going to rise here and now and tell us exactly what the position is. If one looks again at Item 10 in Part B of the First Schedule to the Transkei Constitution Act, one sees that the Transkeian Government is given control over public works and undertakings, roads, outspans, ponts and bridges in the Transkei, and then it says &#x201C;excluding bridges between the Transkei and any other part of the Republic and roads which have been declared to be national roads&#x201D;. To me it seems that this has a plain meaning, and that is that the Transkei Government, in terms of Item 10, has no control over the national road, for instance, between East London and Durban, that part of it which runs through the Transkei. I seem to recall that even the hon. the Minister of Transport has made this point in the past. I do remember the hon. the Minister of Transport being questioned about something else that has a close bearing on this. I remember that when he was questioned about railways, for instance, he said that the Transkei Government would never have control over railways. Railways are exactly the same sort of thing as national roads. They still fall entirely under the control of our Central Government. If the hon. the Deputy Minister is now going to tell us that in terms of this legislation, or generally speaking, it is the policy of this Government that we only travel the national roads, for which we are paying, by the courtesy of the Transkei Government, then I think this is something entirely new, and I think he should get up here and now and tell us. I for one am not prepared to accept his argument. I am not prepared to accept for one moment that the situation now is that my movements over the national road in the Transkei should be controlled by the Transkei Government; it is nonsense.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I wonder if the Government realizes what it is in fact creating here. It seems unbelievable that this could be slipped through as though it is a measure of no moment; every road transport organization in South Africa, which has a certificate to carry goods of one type or another anywhere in the Republic, is now going to have to obtain up to 10 motor carrier certificates in order to be able to operate. It makes it absolutely farcical if you think what the position is at the moment under this Deputy Minister&#x2019;s Government with White, sophisticated, educated officials holding high posts controlling motor carrier transportation exemption certificates; even under those circumstances there has been trouble. Is the hon. the Minister aware&#x2014;and here I can speak for Natal&#x2014;that every single field inspector in the whole of the road transport inspectorate in Natal and in the Southern Transvaal, in the Standerton area, was charged with corruption some three years ago and that except for one they were all found guilty&#x003F; I repeat: with one exception the total inspectorate staff checking on road carrier certificates was found guilty of corruption. Sir, that is the situation now under a sophisticated Government with one controlling body and yet this Government cannot control the situation; they cannot control their own inspectors, and now the hon. the Deputy Minister tells us blandly that in addition to that control, there are now going to be, if we have eight Bantustans, eight additional certificates, making a total of nine certificates to be obtained.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister said so. Is the hon. member repudiating his own hon. Deputy Minister&#x003F; I put a very clear question to him and the hon. the Deputy Minister rose and clearly replied &#x201C;Yes&#x201D; to that question. Is the hon. member for Rissik alleging that the Deputy Minister does not know what he is talking about; is he alleging that the Deputy Minister spoke nonsense&#x003F; Sir, we must have clarity about this. Either the hon. member for Rissik or the hon. the Deputy Minister is correct, but the hon. the Deputy Minister said that a motor carrier operator&#x2019;s certificate would now have to be approved by each of these Bantu authorities. If we are already having difficulty with one organization, what is the position going to be if we expand this in such a way that soon we shall have to approach nine different bodies each of which may have its own rules, regulations and licence fees and impose all kinds of restrictions in this respect. Now the Transkei may say that in order to pass through its territory, one has to pay R500 for the certificate, and who will be able to prevent that, because we are now giving them the authority to control these certificates. As I see the matter, we have here before us something which is much more important than it would appear to be on the face of it. Therefore I am requesting the hon. the Deputy Minister to examine the matter thoroughly and to tell us whether he still persists with this attitude that now each motor carrier operator must obtain a certificate from each area which has these powers.</p>

<p>It is all very well these hon. members shouting like this. I do not believe they have even looked at this Bill, but if they have looked at it, they certainly have not understood it and they are completely unaware of the circumstances under which we are being asked to accept this amendment. Anybody who has had anything to do with the Transkei, will know exactly the dangers which are inherent in what we are being asked to approve of here. We are now being asked to give to the Transkeian Government, not only the control over the issue of drivers&#x2019; licences, which they had before, but the licensing of taxis and of buses, the issue of certificates for the transport of goods by lorry, and, as has been pointed out by hon. members on this side, there is the duplication of control which will now arise. I want to give the Deputy Minister an example. He knows that between Umtata and Kokstad there is no form of public transport, except the road motor transport service. Does he know how many bus services there are operating on that section between Umtata and Kokstad, private bus services&#x003F; Does he know how many private transport operators there are in that section and particularly between Mount Frere, which lies midway between these two points, and Kokstad, Mount frere being one of the largest trading centres in the Transkei and Kokstad being the railhead for that area&#x003F; Does he know that there are buses which transport people as well&#x003F; And what is the position going to be with every one of those buses&#x003F; Must they carry two certificates because Kokstad is in the Republic and Mount Frere is in the Transkei&#x003F; But it goes even further and becomes even more ridiculous if you consider the case of a transport operator who wants to operate between Umzimkulu and Umtata, that he will also have to have two certificates, because he will go through the Republic <i>en route</i>&#x003F; But let us come back to the question of the taxis, the licensing of those vehicles and the testing of those vehicles which is going to be handed over to those people, unsophisticated people, people who have not been trained for it.</p>

<p>Yes, because of Government policy. What have we got at the moment because of this dual control and the hazard that has been created on the Natal roads because of unroadworthy vehicles which are coming out of the Transkei at the moment and entering Natal, because of the lack of control in the Transkei&#x003F; Here the hon. the Deputy Minister is going to compound it now. He is going to license these people to drive these unroadworthy vehicles with fare-paying passengers out of the Transkei into the Republic. No, I sincerely believe that the hon. the Deputy Minister has not thought this thing through. He is not aware of the far-reaching changes he is asking for in this amendment. I believe <span class="col_2809-2810" refersTo="page_1422"/>he should have another look at it. The hon. member for Kensington has given him an opportunity to withdraw gracefully and have another look at it and then come with an amendment later on if he wishes, when he really feels that he has sorted this thing out thoroughly. I believe he has come here with a half-baked measure. I hope he can stand up and tell us that he has not come with a half-baked measure and that he has thought all these things out, and that he has some reasonable explanation for these points.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister has not said a great deal on this clause; but what he has said has made it quite plain to us that once this power is granted to and exercised by the Transkei Government any motor carrier in the Republic who is on a route through the Transkei will need a second permit in order to make the trip. And as this type of provision gets extended to other similar Bantu areas, the number of permits will be further multiplied until you get to nine. That is an entirely unsatisfactory position. I do not believe hon. members opposite were aware that this would happen or that they approve of it. Indeed the hon. member for Rissik is clearly shocked.</p>

<p>But nobody has suggested the aspect of strangulation before, Sir. I want to lead that to its logical conclusion which, I submit, Sir, is also a new argument, that once you introduce this there must be accompanying regulations and that means more red tape to carry it out. I do not know if the hon. the Deputy Minister is aware of the procedure when applying for a road carrier certificate. One must apply, the application must be heard and, if there is an appeal, it goes to the central board. That appeal is specifically excluded here. It can take six months or more&#x2014;although it can be obtained quickly for one single journey. There is provision for objections so that other carriers and the Railways can object if they wish to do so. Other carriers can object and say that an application is not necessary. The procedure is laid down by an Act of Parliament, a Statute which is specifically referred to here. If this clause is passed as it stands, how does, for instance, firm X in Pretoria know that firm Y has applied to the Transkeian Road Transportation setup&#x2014;whatever is going to be established there&#x2014;for a certificate&#x003F; How does he exercise his right of objection&#x003F; How does anybody know what is going on when there are going to be up to nine of these bodies functioning each with their own purely administrative procedures&#x003F; I do not believe that the hon. the Deputy Minister can sit there and refuse to participate in the debate, unless he knows nothing about it&#x2014; which I doubt. Surely he must know what he is introducing. I appeal to the hon. the Minister to stand up and reply to the points which have been made by this side of the House.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District referred to the question of licensing, etc. Licensing of motor cars and drivers is a power which the Transkei has had for a long time. It is not something which falls under this Bill. What we are concerned with here is motor transportation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Certain of these have already been dealt with and consequently they are not relevant now. They have dealt with the licensing powers they have had in a reasonable way. I do not think we can complain about that. Now they are obtaining additional powers. The very same hon. members who have said here that the Bantu should be given a bigger part to play, are now saying that these people will not at all be able to exercise these powers. The Bantu do this under the leadership of White officials. Our approach is that this is the only way in which the people will in fact be able to perform this task. On the one hand that side of this House says &#x201C;give them a part to play&#x201D; and on the other hand, they say that these people are not able to do anything and that we cannot trust them.</p>

<p>I now want to come to the point made by the hon. member for Durban Point. He theorizes about eight or nine territories that will become involved in this. At the moment we are dealing with the Transkei. The people involved in transport will simply have to accept this arrangement. We shall arrange for the issuing of permits to take place as smoothly as possible, but if they want to pass through the Transkei, they will have to have a transportation permit. That is the position; I want to make it clear once more that the construction and maintenance of the road as such is a matter for this Government, but that the control of traffic on that road, where it runs through the Transkei has been transferred to the Transkeian Government. Should practical problems arise which, as the hon. member said, would strangle the transport system, we would be able to give them our attention and iron them out. The hon. member is meeting trouble half-way and is conjuring up all kinds of problems which may possibly arise.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>The Deputy Minister has given his opinion, but it was exactly the same as when he gave his opinion just now about the &#x201C;ordentlike mate&#x201D; in which the control of licences is being conducted in the Transkei. I want to say that the way licences are issued in the Transkei is anything but &#x201C;ordentlik&#x201D; today. I am not talking about drivers&#x2019; licences to drive private motor-cars. I am not talking about the control of a taxi or a bus, or a lorry which is used for public transport where you are going to place the lives of hundreds of people in the hands of these drivers, a matter which is now going to be controlled by the Transkeian Government. I am sure that that hon. Deputy Minister must be aware that in the Transkei at the moment they do not have the people to control the issue of drivers&#x2019; licences. He must know of the scandal that has arisen in connection with the issue of certain licences <span class="col_2813-2814" refersTo="page_1424"/>in the Transkei. Licences are issued in a shocking manner because this Government does not have enough officials to place in every one of those districts in the Transkei to control this type of thing, let alone to control all these additional powers which it is now proposed to hand over to the Transkeian Government. They cannot do it, and one only has to refer to reports of the Natal Motor Traffic Bureau about the vehicles and drivers that are coming out of the Transkei, let alone the hair-raising stories that farmers are telling about their Bantu employees who go to the Transkei to apply for drivers&#x2019; licences and come back and haven&#x2019;t the first clue about driving a vehicle. Some of them have never been behind the wheel of a vehicle, but they come back with drivers&#x2019; licences.</p>

<p>Yes, before they get their independence. It will be given to them as they develop. What is going to stop these Bantu authorities from legislating to the effect that no goods will be transported through their territories except by transporters of their own people&#x003F; This can happen and we can find ourselves in that position. The goods will then have to be transported to the Transkeian border, for instance, and then transhipped into another vehicle and carted through the Transkei, and then transhipped again into another vehicle. Perhaps I am being extreme, but these are extreme powers which he is now asking us to give to the Transkei Government. This is why I am raising this particular point. I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister is now going to let us have a meaningful debate&#x2014;this is what we are supposed to be having in the Committee Stage&#x2014;about the details of this matter. At the moment there is no debate, but a monologue. It is only speakers on this side who are raising points, because nobody on that side is defending, and even less the Deputy Minister.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, if I understood him correctly, the hon. member who has just sat down, referred to, <i>inter alia,</i> the licensing of drivers of motor vehicles. In the first place, he referred to it and maintained that we were giving such powers to a body which, if I understood him correctly, did not set proper standards, etc. Does the hon. member know that we passed an Act in this House as far back as 1963, which authorized that body to undertake the licensing of drivers of motor vehicles&#x003F; That has been the position since 1963. This, however, concerns the question of road traffic. It does not concern the question of the licensing of motor vehicles, but the question of exemption certificates. The hon. member did not read the clause concerned properly. Clause 7 of this Bill provides that the Motor Carrier Transportation Act will possibly be used by the Transkei. We have its equivalent in our own constitutional development. We wrote into our own South African Act that we may <span class="col_2815-2816" refersTo="page_1425"/>maintain our pre-Union legislation. In fact, we went so far as to maintain several British Acts. Even in this Session we repealed a British Act from the previous century. That hon. member is conjuring up spectres. What is more, how do two states operate next to each other when they have communal interests such as these&#x003F; Take Rhodesia, for example. Every day motor vehicles with heavy loads travel to Rhodesia, and it is not made a requirement that these should be handled by Rhodesian transport. Why not&#x003F; Because there are sensible people in both countries. The hon. member will not understand what I am saying to him now. There are sensible people governing in the Transkei, and here as well. In the interests of their economy, it is absurd even to argue in this way. But the most important argument still remains that the Transkei can pass legislation in terms of this empowering provision, which will enable it to retain our Motor Carrier Transportation Act. Its provisions need not be exactly the same nor need it be subject to legislation here or to boards such as those appointed here, but they may retain its framework and its implementation as they are. This is what the hon. member does not understand. It is so logical, that before he rises again, I think the hon. member should consult with the other hon. members who sat laughing at him a moment ago.</p>

I am not going to waste time with him, but I merely want to suggest that as soon as the Hansard is ready, he must get hold of that Hansard and read what was said by my colleague. What I want to do is to move the following amendment:</p>

<p>While we are at it, the hon. member for Stilfontein, a few moments ago, made some loud interjections.

<p>Mr. Chairman, before we have a direct reaction from the hon. the Deputy Minister to the amendment which I have moved, namely to delete subsection (1) (c) I would like to draw the attention of the House to some of the immediate serious consequences which may follow if this Committee accepts this amending clause. If hon. members look at clause 7 (2) of the Bill in front of us, they will see that it has immediate far reaching provisions. I wish to read it:</p>

<block name="quote">Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c) of subsection (1), &#x2026;</block>

<p>that is the portion I am moving to delete&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the Motor Carrier Transportation Act, 1930 (Act No. 39 of 1930), shall continue to apply in respect of any certificate or exemption granted thereunder prior to the commencement of the said paragraph, but any certificate or licence so granted shall not continue to be valid after the 30th June immediately following upon such commencement.</block>

<p>In other words, once subsection (1) (c) becomes law, and after the 30th June following, certificates and licences granted shall cease to be valid. This fact therefore immediately makes it necessary for the permission of the Transkei Government to be obtained for these matters. It underlines the urgency of the matter and the need for this Committee to reject it immediately.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, before replying to the hon. member for Pinelands, I just want to return to the amendment moved by the hon. member for Kensington. We can look up his Hansard, but first he must just confirm for us that he said &#x2026; [Interjections.] This concerns a very important aspect of the entire debate. He must just confirm here that he said they were satisfied with the situation as it is at present. Now we must take note of the methods of that side of the House. They have been debating here for the past hour or two. Consequently I want to make the statement that those hon. members have been wasting the time of the House deliberately.</p>

<speech by="#coetsee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>I withdraw it, Mr. Chairman, but I want to say that they come to this House with unmotivated arguments. I have no doubt that they would not have come to the House with that argument if they had studied the Act of 1963 properly. Further to that I also want to advance an argument. That hon. member said they were satisfied with the situation as it is. What is in actual fact the situation as it is&#x003F; It is that the regulation and control of road traffic, including the licensing and control of vehicles, is in the hands of the Transkeian Government. Thus he attacked the hon. members for Stilfontein and Cradock and charged them before their voters with now being prepared to accept a clause&#x2014;the clause we are discussing now&#x2014;in terms of which we shall no longer be entitled to use the roads of this country and shall be prohibited from doing so. But this provision dates back to 1963. By using an argument which has no basis whatsoever, the hon. member is deliberately just making political capital this afternoon. We must take note of their methods.</p>

<p>As far as the argument of the hon. member for Pinelands is concerned, I think he is not exercising any imagination. Surely it is clear that the Act concerned, as applied by us, will still be applied by the Transkeian Government, but that amending and/ or substituting it will be left to their discretion. It is very clear that they can pass an Act enabling them to take over the entire operation of this Act, so that they will issue the necessary exemption certificates before the date mentioned. Therefore it is only a logical action by that Government that will flow from this.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Transkei put certain statutory references to the hon. the Deputy Minister regarding the effect of the repeal of the words &#x201C;the Motor Carrier Transportation Act, 1941&#x201D; in clause 7 (i) (b). Sir, our problem is this. In terms of the Transkei Constitution Act of 1963, the Transkei is defined as comprising certain areas, and it excludes White areas such as Umtata and other towns in the Transkei. These towns are not subject to the Transkei Government at the present time. In terms of section 37 of the Act the legislative power of the Legislative Assembly of the Trans kei is to make laws not inconsistent with this Act in relation to all matters appearing in Part B of the First Schedule to this Act; in Part B appears this Item 12, which at the present moment excludes from the Transkei Legislative Authority the power to legislate in matters falling under the Motor Carrier Transportation Act. If this amendment as printed in the Bill goes through, then the difficulty that we see is this: The Transkei Legislative Authority can then issue the necessary road transportation certificates for vehicles operating in the Transkei, but when those vehicles reach the municipal boundary of Umtata they will not be lawfully licensed or certified to operate in the White area. I think this is a valid point. If we do this, we are going to have that hiatus and a permit would have to be obtained for each vehicle in addition to the certificate under the Road Transportation Act which had already been granted by the Transkei Legislative Authority. I think that is the reason why this power was left out in 1963&#x2014;so that there would be one authority dealing with the Act. Obviously vehicles are not going to stop on a municipal boundary before they go into a White area which is not under the control of the Transkei Legislative Authority. I know that this is a matter which the hon. the Deputy Minister will probably want to go into in some detail, but I want to give him the point which was raised by the hon. member for Transkei and which he was unable to pursue since he had already spoken three times on this particular clause. I want to give the hon. the Deputy Minister the references, the first one being section 2 of the Act, in which the Transkei is defined; then section 37, which defines the powers of the Legislative Assembly and then Item 12 in Part B, the item which is proposed to be amended.</p>

You must remember, Sir, that the same provision applies to the other Bantu homelands as well under other Acts. His interpretation, which will be the official Government interpretation of the position throughout the country wherever these Bantu homelands are, is that we, the Central Government, are able to build national roads and pay for them; he said that a few moments ago and that is so.

<p>Clause 9:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>It is our policy to establish communal councils for the reserves or homelands and to give them powers to control their own affairs, but we do not propose to do this haphazardly and merely for the sake of making a pretence of bringing about constitutional developments. Under our policy there will be ordered constitutional advance as the people in any particular area give evidence of being able to manage their own affairs. We are not of the opinion that the various homelands in South-West Africa have at the moment developed to that stage where they can manage all the affairs which is proposed to hand over to them by means of this legislation, but the Government has embarked on its policy and it proposes to hand these powers over to them. We have this protection that the State President has the control there and can legislate for the area as well and so we will let these provisions go through except in regard to (20) (j), which provides for the establishment, with the concurrence of the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, of public holidays in substitution for the public holidays established by or in terms of the public Holidays Act. We have no objection to the various homelands being able to have their own holidays. We have no objection to regional holidays being set aside for certain areas. We do not expect them always to respect the holidays acknowledged in the Republic, but we contend <span class="col_2825-2826" refersTo="page_1430"/>that these holidays must be arranged by the Government of the Republic, by Parliament. We regard this granting of power to be in line with the Government&#x2019;s policy of giving them constitutional development towards eventual independence, whereas we still regard the Republic as one body, and South-West Africa as being with us, for the time being at any rate, and therefore we say there should be only one authority controlling a matter of this nature. We look at it also from the economic point of view. If we allow every authority in South-West Africa or in the Republic&#x2014; and I mention the Republic now because the matter will crop up again under clause 12&#x2014;to establish their own holidays in lieu of the Republican holidays, as was pointed out the other day, we could have something like 168 public holidays in the Republic and South-West Africa.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oliver">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>It will be 180 with the ones we have already.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Obviously it will not happen to that extent, but it could and we say that for the protection of the economy there must be some control to see that this number of holidays is not overdone. The Minister will reply that the different South-West African reserves cannot legislate outside their own area, and the same will apply to the Republic, and that is so, but if the reserves, a homeland Government, sets aside a national day for its people, we will find that its people living and working outside that reserve will be inclined to regard that as their day of celebration and they will wish to recognize it by staying away from work. We want to obviate the prospects or possibilities of that nature and therefore for these reasons we say that this control should be left with this Parliament and not just with the Minister, because we contend that this is fundamental to one government having control over the whole of the area of the Republic and of South-West Africa. Therefore I move the amendment standing in my name, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;concurrence&#x201D; in line 57 up to and including &#x201C;Development&#x201D; in lines 58 and 59 and to substitute, &#x201C;by resolution, of the Senate and the House of Assembly&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The effect is that they will still be able to ask for their holidays, the same as they will have to ask the Minister for a holiday. They can still make their representations. We are not opposed to their being able to have a regional holiday, but we say that that authority must come from Parliament and not from the Minister. Parliament should not delegate its authority.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am still surprised and as the years go by I grow even more surprised at the attitude of the United Party in respect of matters such as these. When we were discussing the Second Reading of this Bill the hon. members for Kensington and Transkei referred specifically to this and to a later clause. I then told the hon. member that in my humble opinion they did not have the right in principle to vote for this particular clause. The hon. member for Kensington then said that there was still lots of time and that they would explain everything. There is still lots of time, but the hon. members wasted so much time that I was of the opinion that they did not want to talk about this particular clause. We cannot understand why the hon. members on the other side want to ridicule this particular clause. They try to present it in a very ridiculous light, but still they have not voted against it. Now they come along with the proposal and the assertion that this Parliament should lay down for those people exactly when their national days and holidays should be. If I may refer to clause 2 for a moment want to point out that we said during the discussion on that clause that the hon. members of the Opposition simply want to force their attitude and their view of life on the Black people without the slightest consideration of their feelings. That is the reason why the hon. member for Transkei is proposing this amendment. In this way, without even consulting this particular population group, they simply want to force their holidays on those population groups. The way I interpret it they simply want to take the White man&#x2019;s holidays and give them to the Bantu people as they are.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister is trifling with me now and he is trifling with the Committee. I do not want to know whether they were consulted or whether they raised any objections, but I want to know whether they approved. I want a positive statement that the Department of Veterinary Services did approve, that they were satisfied that this was the right thing to do. We are now dealing with the question of various diseases on our borders, a question which have been a recurring headache and worse than a headache to our veterinary departments for many years. The problem still remains despite all the resources at the command of our own Government and its Department of Veterinary Services. They are unable to cope adequately with the threat that is perpetually facing them. They would like to have still further resources if it is at all possible. For a power such as that to be handed over to one of the Native Governments in South-West Africa is, to my mind, simply throwing us open to a very grave threat which can affect the whole of the Republic. We are not only facing the problem of foot and mouth disease, but as one proceeds there are also the threat of corridor disease and rinderpest, among others. Foot and mouth disease is, of course, the worst of these. In regard to other diseases, other than that of domestic animals&#x2014;such as poultry diseases&#x2014;the threat is also immediate and of immense economic consequences if it should, by any chance, be introduced into this country. This is the point I want to make, and if the hon. the Deputy Minister cannot give us the assurance that the Department of Veterinary Services has positively approved and said: &#x201C;Yes, we believe that this is a service that can rightly be transferred to the control of the Native Governments in South-West Africa&#x201D;, then I think that the Government is taking a very great responsibility and that the direct blame for anything that goes wrong will have to be pinned on the shoulders of the Government. In a matter of this kind, above all others, where these scientific matters are concerned, I believe the Government should be guided by its scientists and the people who are in authority, and responsible, if disease should break out, to cope with it.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to reply in the first place to the point raised by the hon. member for South Coast. I just want to point out that it is only a small change which is involved here. &#x201C;Stock diseases&#x201D; now become &#x201C;animal diseases&#x201D;, &#x201C;veesiektes&#x201D; now become &#x201C;dieresiektes&#x201D;.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is obvious, after all, that these people do not have all the trained experts. They then either use the Republic to act as agent for them or appoint individuals to do the work for them. I have explained over and over again to the hon. Opposition that we are training those people to accept responsibility, to realize the importance of the matter, and that the White officials who have the expert and the technical knowledge are used by them. This is done when they are unable to appoint their own officials. We are doing it particularly because we want co-ordination, and they use the Department of Veterinary Services of the Republic to perform that task. I do not think hon. members should proceed from the assumption now that we are going to be irresponsible and just let them have their way. This applies to Owambo and Kavango as well, where those diseases are under the control of our own veterinaries.</p>

<p>As far as holidays are concerned, the hon. member for Transkei said that they were worried about these people now being able to make any day a holiday and about the effect this might have on the White <span class="col_2829-2830" refersTo="page_1432"/>sector. I have already replied to this, but I want to point out that the Public Holidays Act, No. 5 of 1952, section 2, provides that the State President may declare any day to be a public holiday without consulting this Parliament. If we now want the Bantu Governments to come to this Parliament as well when they want holidays, surely this is to a certain extent inconsistent with the arrangement of our holidays. The main objection is that we want to regard every little thing as being so important that this Parliament has to decide about it for the Bantu. I feel that we must be realistic if we have reached the stage where we can say that it is not sufficient for the Minister to decide about something like this&#x2014;because there is the restriction that they must have the approval of the Minister for such a decision. We saw this afternoon what a lengthy and wide&#x002D;ranging discussion can be held on small things. I think we should be realistic&#x2014; people talk of being practical&#x2014;so that we do not have to refer every little thing in regard to these peoples to this Parliament. We must accept that the Minister will consider those things after those people have discussed it with him. Suffice it to say that I cannot accept that amendment of the hon. member and that the clause must remain as it is.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think it is a most incredible statement that we have just had from the hon. the Deputy Minister in regard to a serious matter such as animal diseases and their control.</p>

<p>As I understood the hon. the Deputy Minister, if the Owambos cannot handle an outbreak of disease, they will apply to our Department of Veterinary Services for support. We will then make personnel available to take control of the remedial measures, whatever they may be, which the Government then decides upon. But what will happen if the Owambos are not even able to recognize the cause of the outbreak, to start with, let alone ask for help by the Veterinary Department&#x003F; The question I should like to put to the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2014;let us get this quite clear&#x2014;is whether the control of veterinary science all along the border and in Owambo will remain as it is, vested in the hands of the personnel at Onderstepoort&#x003F;</p>

<p>I want to put this to the hon. the Deputy Minister. This is no trifling matter. The control of animal diseases in those areas along the border and in Owambo will rest, as it is today, in the hands of the Veterinary Department. There will be no change whatever in the control. The watching for any outbreak in disease which may take place, and so forth, will be entirely in the hands of the Veterinary Department.

<p>With regard to the question of holidays, I want to say that I know that the State President can proclaim regional holidays. But the reason why we want Parliament to control the other holidays which are set out in our present Act and which have to be respected by all is that there are holidays in those regions that mean more to one section than to the other. Therefore we do not want the Minister alone making up his mind about which holidays he will do away with, because he will have to substitute holidays. If these different bodies want a holiday on 24th <span class="col_2831-2832" refersTo="page_1433"/>May as Empire Day or something like that, instead of on the 31st May, the Minister can give them that permission and do away with Republic Day. Republic Day means a lot to us. We consider it one of the main days in our calendar. Therefore we think that this Parliament which represents all sections of the community, should be the body to decide what holidays will be respected in the Republic and which not. It should not just be left to a Minister to decide which ones he will do away with. This will in effect mean that he will be abolishing certain of our holidays in certain areas. It is not the same as giving the State President the power to proclaim regional holidays which, I admit, he has at the moment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to come back to the hon. member for Rissik. I hope that the hon. member for Rissik now has a clearer idea of United Party policies and attitudes. Because he thought it was completely impossible for us to vote for the principle of a regional holiday for one of these ethnic groups. He said so in effect. But now we have shown him through the amendment proposed by the hon. member for Transkei that in fact we are perfectly happy to meet the desire of such a group for a holiday within the framework of the central guidance of this Parliament. I hope, therefore, that he will realize something wider, too. I want to say this because we hear, day in and day out, from the National Government that we have to create sovereign, independent Bantustans in order that these various ethnic groups may protect their own possessions, their own culture. It is perfectly possible without having sovereign, independent Bantustans to have the very highest respect for all the cultural treasures, the language and everything else of these groups. After all, if I may give a clear example, let us take the case of the Afrikaansen English-speaking South Africans here. There is no separate independent state for each of these people, but neither of them would feel their cultural treasures threatened. The position is likewise with these Black ethnic groups. It will be perfectly possible for all their cultural treasures, their language and everything else to be placed in the hands of the United Party and justice is perfectly possible. Then there will be no question of introducing the difficulties and the dangers attaching to these sovereign independent states. By this amendment we show that it is perfectly possible for them to have a regional holiday.</p>

<p>A few things have become apparent during the discussion on this particular clause. One of them is what was said by the hon. member for Transkei. That is that they see South Africa as a political unit, a state which governs all the people with this Parliament as the sovereign authority. Your public holidays must be established from here. He will remember that in his arguments so far he, and the hon. member for Kensington as well, referred in a very jocular and foolish way to these so-called public holidays which the various Bantu ethnic groups are going to get. Then the hon. member for Pinelands spoke, but he had not paid close attention to the arguments advanced by the hon. member for Kensington.

<p>I withdraw it, Mr. Chairman. He listened to them very half-heartedly and referred to them in a rather jeering way. Another argument is that these holidays which we want to give the various Bantu groups instead of other holidays are going to have terrible consequences for the economy of South Africa. Hon. members can imagine how <span class="col_2833-2834" refersTo="page_1434"/>ridiculous this is. They say that we are a unitary state of which all the various ethnic groups with their various areas form part. They say, however, that those various areas can ask for their independence days and that they will get them. Hon. members must imagine the results of this. If you have a unitary state as they say and you accept the culture of those people as you accept the culture of the Afrikaans and the English-speaking people, as the hon. member for Pinelands said, they still want to establish 168 holidays throughout the country. Can hon. members see the foolishness of this argument&#x003F; I should very much like the hon. member for Pinelands to reply to this.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister to give us when he replies, if he replies, the information which I believe is necessary to give proper consideration to this extension of powers. Last week his colleague, the other Deputy Minister, asked for additional money because&#x2014;that was the reason he gave&#x2014;the establishment of territorial authorities provided for citizens of those territories to fill the posts. In practice it was found that they were not available and therefore they had to have White officials filling the posts created for the different territorial authorities. In other words, there were not local citizens available and Parliament was asked to vote additional money so that White citizens could fill those posts. We are now being asked to extend the powers; in other words, to create more posts than those which existed and which already cannot be filled by local citizens. In the <i>Government Gazette</i> which I was reading this morning&#x2014;I assume it must have been Friday&#x2019;s <i>Gazette;</i> I did not look at the date&#x2014;there is provision for Public Service regulations for the officials of the territorial authorities, and one in particular, namely the Eastern Caprivi. I quote that because it is current; I was looking at it this morning. Now could the hon. the Minister tell us how many citizens of the Eastern Caprivi have a university degree and how many are matriculated&#x003F; In other words, what potential is there of people to carry out these duties&#x003F; The duties include the controlling of animal diseases, fish and game preservation and the conservation of flora and fauna. The last two duties are new ones, whereas the control over animal diseases is an extension. Other duties are the control over intoxicating liquor and the appointment of commissioners of oaths. These are all additional powers. Let us take three areas at random, say, Owambo, Kavango and the Eastern Caprivi. Here we have three authorities recently established or being established. Can the hon. the Deputy Minister tell us how many degreed and matriculated people, or people with a lower educational standard, but able to do clerical work, there are available to exercise these powers&#x003F; If they are not available, we are simply creating a sham structure. We are creating a structure, saying, &#x201C;here is a pack of cards&#x201D;. [Interjections.] We are setting up this house of cards, but if you blow on it, you will find that all the jokers are sitting on that side of the House and it will collapse just like that. This is nothing more than using jokers, if you give powers which require jobs for which you do not have people. It is not then a genuine body you are creating. The Minister said the veterinary department would carry on doing the job. The hon. member for South Coast then asked, &#x201C;why pass it&#x003F;&#x201D; Earlier on, during the discussion of another clause, the hon. the Deputy Minister said that they could carry on with our law and we would see that they did not go wrong. Either we are giving them power and creating meaningful self-governing bodies, or we are creating a sham, a facade. The hon. the Deputy Minister can show that it is not a sham and a facade if he can prove that the people are available, educated and qualified, to exercise the powers which he is asking us to transfer. I hope he will give us a full picture of the educational situation of the citizens of those three territorial authorities to which I have referred so that we can judge the merits or otherwise of saying that they are capable and that it is realistic to hand over these powers to them.</p>

When we look at the powers which are being written into the law now, let us at all times remember that they will not only apply to the territorial authorities, but that the State President has the power, when advised by the hon. the Deputy Minister, to give these powers also to regional authorities and even to tribal authorities.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to deal initially with the hon. member for Rissik, who seems to be quite a popular person on that side of the House. That hon. member raised a few points about the question of public holidays. His main objection seemed to be that we want the whole question of the Bantu homelands&#x2019; holidays referred to this House and the Other Place. His basic objection was, if I understood him correctly, a procedural one. He felt that this should not be done in this manner. In terms of our attitude, what would happen&#x003F; A homeland Government, a Bantustan Government, would make a decision about a public holiday, a regional or territorial public holiday that they want to have. In terms of our suggestion the question of whether this holiday should be granted or not would have to be brought before this House and the Other Place for approval. I ask him immediately what his objection is to this procedure; why is he so upset about it&#x003F; Why does he not want to support us in this&#x003F; If one looks at the new item 20J which is proposed to be inserted by clause 9, one sees that in practice a homeland Government will have to decide in the first place on a regional holiday to be introduced in substitution for a public holiday already in force in the Republic. What will happen then, is that this homeland government will have to negotiate with the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration. All that we are trying to insist on here is that the homeland government in question should not get itself involved in any private deal with the Minister of Bantu Administration or <i>vice versa,</i> but that this Parliament, these two Houses, should make the actual decision. Our submission is that as long as this country is one country, until the final fragmentation takes place, this should remain the position. The hon. member and the hon. the Deputy Minister made reference to the Public Holidays Act, No. 5 of 1922. The hon. the Deputy Minister himself seemed to have relied quite heavily on this Act in trying to argue why this item should be introduced in the schedule. What does this Act provide&#x003F; The hon. the Deputy Minister made the point that the State President may by proclamation in the <i>Government Gazette</i> declare any day to be a public holiday. However, in its first schedule this Act stipulated what days were to be public holidays from the date of commencement of that Act. One power it did not give the State President was to remove any of these holidays from the schedule. This is a power the State President does not hold. If any holiday is to be removed from the schedule to this Act, it must be done by means of legislation passed in this Parliament. The Bill wants to place greater powers than the powers of the State President into the hands of the Minister of Bantu Administration. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The Bill seeks to place greater powers into the hands of the Minister of Bantu Administration than the State President himself has in terms of the Public Holidays Act. This is obviously wrong. Why should the Minister or any of his Deputy Ministers have a claim to assume powers to override the provisions of our Public Holidays Act&#x003F; To our mind it is an affrontery in that it impinges on the real authoriy of this Parliament. We feel that is wrong in principle.</p>

<p>While I am dealing with the hon. member for Rissik and the hon. the Deputy Minister, I want to come back to this question of how these Bantustan holidays can be brought about. It is quite true that during the Second Reading debate I made the point that at the moment we have in <span class="col_2837-2838" refersTo="page_1436"/>South Africa and South-West Africa, to which the Public Holidays Act applies, 14 Bantu homelands and we all know that we have 12 public holidays.

<p>No, Sir, I am not repeating my Second Reading argument at all. I want to tell the hon. member for Rissik that I was not joking at all when I referred to this; in fact, I made the point that it is quite obvious that in terms of the proposed new item we shall not have 168 holidays. I said so. What did concern me&#x2014;I said this in all seriousness &#x2014;is that in terms of this proposed item, with the concurrence of the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration, we can have sufficient public holidays to cause serious disruption in this country. That is why we on this side of the House feel that it should not be left in the hands of the Minister of Bantu Administration. It should certainly not be left in his hands to assume greater powers than the State President has. That is why we come forward with this amendment: to insist that these matters be left in the province of Parliament, where they rightly belong.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to pursue the argument started now by the hon. member for Kensington and in the course of my speech I hope to answer the hon. member for Rissik who asked me a question. I want to do this because it has considerable bearing upon whether this Committee should accept this portion of the clause or not. I think the hon. member, and indeed all hon. members opposite, accept that theoretically, with the 14 Bantu area governments that could gain this power, we could have the position that while we have our 12 holidays they may have holidays which substitute our holidays and the situation could then arise that we have 168 different holidays coming from their side and 12 Republican ones, taking the total to 180. I think the hon. member accepted that that would in theory be so. I want to emphasize that not only in theory could that be so at this stage of the constitutional development of these areas, but once they get the promised sovereign independence, then indeed it is highly likely that given an example of 12 public holidays by the Republic, they may each well wish to institute 12 separate public holidays of their own. There is a very great possibility, therefore, that we will have a tremendous multiplicity of holidays under the policy of this Government. The hon. member for Rissik now says to me, &#x201C;Equally, in theory, in terms of your amendment, you might have a very large number of holidays.&#x201D; But, Sir, there are two very important differences. In the first place, as I explained in my earlier speech on this clause, we see the Republic as one entity, and since we retain in the hands of this House and the Other Place the power to grant holidays and having the general approach which we do have, namely not one of fragmentation but one of cohesion and co-operation, it is quite obvious that under our policy there would be no possibility of getting such a vast number of holidays, although we readily concede that we would gladly grant regional holidays to the various ethnic groups, but clearly within limits. It is quite apparent, therefore, that under the policies of hon. members opposite, you will very possibly have many sovereign, independent states, many of which will institute a large number of holidays, perhaps totalling the 168 that I mentioned, whereas under our policy that could never possibly be so. But, Sir, here is the next very important difference: Hon. gentlemen opposite keep on proclaiming that a Zulu is a Zulu and a Xhosa is a Xhosa, etc., whether he is in the Bantu area or outside. They keep on urging the Bantu in the urban area to respond to the cries of his ethnic countrymen in the homeland area. Consequently, in the case of the policy of hon. members opposite, it stands to reason that the urban Bantu of a particular ethnic group is to be encouraged by them to respond to the public holidays of that particular ethnic area, and consequently there is a very real possibility that with this large number of sovereign, independent states with their separate holidays, different from and substituted for ours, you could get large numbers of Bantu citizens in the White areas responding to calls to take holidays on their days. This provision therefore opens up a tremendous possibility of disruption of our economy. That is my answer to the hon. member for Rissik. Under our approach that sort of thing could not happen, because we do not emphasize at every opportunity the fact that these people must <span class="col_2839-2840" refersTo="page_1437"/>be tied to their ethnic links of the past. We accept that people of Zulu origin in the towns do in fact become urbanized and that they have a different approach. We do not drive them and encourage them at all times to act as a unit in everything that they do. Consequently, where we are very happy to see a regional holiday for these various ethnic areas, always within limits, as in the case of the other groups in this country, the fact remains that although the holiday will operate in the regional area, it will not spill over into the towns with the tremendous dislocation of our economy and everything else that is implicit in Government policy.</p>

<p>Both the hon. member for Pinelands and the hon. member for Kensington made the point here that there would be consternation if holidays were established in the Bantu homelands by the Bantu homelands themselves or by the Minister of Bantu Administration. Sir, many citizens of Lesotho and Swaziland and Botswana are working in South Africa today. Those people all have their respective holidays in their homelands, but when they are working in South Africa, they respect the laws of South Africa and they do not observe their holidays in South Africa, for those holidays are only applicable in their own homelands.</p>

<p>Their loyalty only extends as far as Lesotho, not as far as South Africa, and this also applies in respect of the Transkei and any other homeland which is going to gain independence in the future. Those people will observe their holidays in their own fatherland, but when they are in South Africa, they will respect the South African laws. Just as we as Whites do not participate in the holidays of Lesotho or Swaziland or Botswana, so those people will not participate in our holidays.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member referred here this afternoon to English and Afrikaans-speaking people and said that English-speaking people and Afrikaans-speaking people could not have been two separate peoples on a basis of ethnic grouping, but English and Afrikaans-speaking people have their Republic in South Africa; they are enjoying full political rights here in South Africa, whereas the Bantu are now being trained in that direction. That is the difference. We as Whites enjoy full political rights&#x2014;we are independent&#x2014;whereas those people are now being trained for gaining their independence. That is the difference between us on this side of the House and that side of the House. Members on that side believe that they should suppress any feeling of nationalism on the part of the Black man.

<p>Then I want to come to the hon. members for Pinelands and Kensington, who cudgled their brains over the holidays in working out how many holidays there were possibly going to be. Of course, it is possible for one to waste one&#x2019;s time on making calculations of this nature. They said they wanted this Parliament to decide, not the Minister. We are satisfied with the position that the Minister has to decide; that is actually the only difference. The hon. members are therefore welcome to carry <span class="col_2841-2842" refersTo="page_1438"/>on with their calculations. I do not wish to elaborate any further on that matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Point wanted to know exactly how many Bantu would be eligible for the various posts in the veterinary services, to which the hon. member for South Coast also referred. Now, I may just tell him that this is the way it will be done. These people are given control over that particular service in their area, and as far as possible their people will take over this service from the bottom upwards. For instance, we have the case that in the Transkei, to use this as an example, they still have only White magistrates in the courts. The other services they render themselves. And now this party, which never stops saying that we should enlist the services of the Bantu everywhere, actually comes along in Parliament and raises objections when the National Party seeks to enlist the services of the Bantu on this particular basis.</p>

So the position is already that these people fill these posts up to where they can manage, and if they cannot fill them we get Europeans to do the work. And these better qualified people we get from the veterinary services. They do the work as agents for this government.</p>

<p>*I think this disposes of all the matters argued here.</p>

<p>May I ask whether there are in fact any trained people who are capable of dealing with, for instance, a veterinary service or a medical service in the areas I mentioned&#x003F; In other words, I do not expect large numbers, but are such people available for filling these particular posts in the three areas I mentioned&#x003F;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>In each of those areas stock inspectors of various categories are available for taking the lead in doing the practical work; the trained professional officers, the veterinary surgeons, are not available. The same applies to the hospitals. The Bantu are trained as nurses and they become sisters and in some cases even matrons, and here and there we already have medical doctors. There we have the same position. But we provide them with this opening in their own area for rendering that service. Let me state frankly that to my knowledge there are no veterinary surgeons available. I do not think there is one Bantu veterinary surgeon available in the entire Republic. That is the position.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry that the hon. the Deputy Minister has not replied at all. He has said he cannot give the figures, but they are building up the posts and the people will fill them from the bottom up. What we want to know is whether they can even get off the ground, let alone fill them from the bottom up. I gave him three territories; the Eastern Caprivi, the Okavango and Owambo, which are all in the process of getting legislative authorities, or have recently got them and will therefore be affected by these powers. All I asked was a simple question. Is there any possibility whatsoever for the foreseeable future of any of these powers being handled by citizens of those territories, and if so, can he give us some examples&#x003F; The hon. the Minister said nurses become sisters and matrons. Let him tell me of one citizen of Eastern Caprivi or one Okavango, who is a nursing sister. Can he name just one single person&#x003F; Can he tell us of one qualified stock inspector&#x003F; I am not talking about the veterinary surgeons. We have said that there are no vets, but right at the bottom of the ladder, can he tell us that he has one Eastern Caprivi or one Okavango stock inspector who is qualified to do that job&#x003F; Can he tell us that he has got one Okavango or one Eastern Caprivi citizen who would be qualified to be a justice of the peace or a commissioner of oaths&#x003F; These are practical questions. Is this a facade and a sham, or has he indeed got people to fill these posts&#x003F; His answer is that they start at the bottom. That is not an answer. We want an answer to the question whether it is real or whether it is only a dream. Is it pie in the sky, a structure with nobody to make it work&#x003F; That is <span class="col_2843-2844" refersTo="page_1439"/>the answer that the Government has to give South Africa. Is it a bluff or a sham, or can it be made to work&#x003F; On the Minister&#x2019;s answer we must accept that it is a sham and a bluff because he has given no evidence that it can be made to work unless White officials are provided by this Government to do the work. If this Government, the Republican Government, has to control all these powers, why pretend to give them to another authority when in point of fact, according to the hon. the Deputy Minister, we are still going to control them&#x003F; Is not that the position, that we are still going to control stock and animal diseases and we are still going to control road transportation certificates&#x003F; All these things we are still going to control. Therefore why create a sham structure unless you can say there are in fact people qualified, educated and able to accept the responsibility which is called for in these positions&#x003F;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister will explain to me why there is a different test, a different yardstick, so far as the South-West African Bantu people are concerned compared with the South African Bantu people. We dealt earlier this evening with clause 7, when the exclusion of matters dealt with under the Motor Carrier Transportation Act was to be removed so far as the Transkei was concerned. Under this clause 9 we find that that exclusion is to remain so far as South-West Africa is concerned. It appears to me that there are different yardsticks which are being used in regard to what the Minister refers to as different measures. What is the test&#x003F; Why should there be a different rule and a different power as far as the Bantu nation of South-West Africa are concerned from the powers given to the nations in the Republic&#x003F; The hon. member for Etosha looked at me and I am sure that he is also puzzled as to why the Okavango and the Owambo should not have the same authority under this Act as is given to the Xhosas in the Transkei. Perhaps the hon. member for Etosha can explain, because there is nothing that the hon. the Deputy Minister has said which explains why there should be that differentiation.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to make it quite clear to this House that what that particular hon. Minister may say about me does not concern me one bit; not with his record! [Interjections.] To get back to the hon. the Deputy Minister in charge of this Bill, he said that the Transkei is being given this additional power because they have the experience; they have had a Legislative Assembly since 1963 and they had a territorial authority before that. We know that the <i>Bunga</i> system was instituted almost 100 years ago, so they have had experience. The hon. the Deputy Minister nods. These powers which are now going to be transferred to South-West Africa can go to any homeland with a legislative assembly. That is right, is it not&#x003F; We Enow that the Ovambos have got their Legislative Assembly and the Kavango&#x2019;s got theirs not so long ago. The Caprivi people are going to get theirs shortly. I want to ask what experience they have had in administering such matters. This is the question the hon. member for Durban Point asked the hon. the Deputy Minister, to which the hon. the Deputy Minister has not replied. It is not a question of experience, because he is giving these powers in this instance to new authorities. When we first started discussing this clause, I pointed out that we were not opposed to giving communal councils, as we call them, or regional councils, powers to control their own affairs, but that we did not agree with the speed with which this is being done in this particular instance. We cannot accept that these particular councils are able to administer all these matters. I said that we hoped that strict control would be kept over these assemblies by his department and its officials and through the powers which the State President has. What disturbs me is the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s suggestion now that, the fact that he is giving these additional powers, is proof that those bodies are able to control and manage them. Surely he is not suggesting to the House that a body, which has not even been established yet, can manage its own affairs&#x003F; We have no idea how it can manage its own affairs. We know that the Transkei is doing it, but as regards the authorities in South-West Africa, he cannot pretend that they have the experience which the Transkei has.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Deputy Minister in charge of this measure has refused to answer, but by way of interjection the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development and the other Deputy Minister have repeatedly said here that there are plenty of people. If that hon. Deputy Minister cannot tell us what trained and qualified people there are, I ask his colleagues to intervene in the debate and to tell this House&#x2014;and this they can give, because no Bantu person can go to university without the approval of the Government&#x2014;how many citizens of South-West African homelands <span class="col_2847-2848" refersTo="page_1441"/>are studying&#x2014;I shall not even say qualified&#x2014;to become veterinary surgeons and doctors and how many are registered and are training as nurses in these territories to which we are referring. They must know how many are qualified in terms of the qualifications laid down by this Government to be Justices of the Peace or Commissioner of Oaths. If these hon. Ministers say there are plenty of people, let them tell us. They must not merely say there are plenty.

<p>I think I am coming to new arguments. We are being asked to give here some 14 new powers to a country with five matriculants. By whom and how are these powers going to be administered&#x003F; Obviously each one of them is going to have three new portfolios, excluding the existing powers they have. All we are trying to do in this debate, and we cannot get it from that Deputy Minister, so I ask these Ministers who interjected so confidently that there are plenty of people, to say how many there are. We are not against the giving of powers, but we want to know that they are given on a responsible basis. We do not oppose the giving of powers, but what we want to know is that when powers are given they are given at the right time, at the right tempo of develop ment and to people qualified to handle them. We are therefore not objecting to the principle of giving powers, but we are in Committee to see whether there are people able to handle it. That is all we are asking. Let us take the question of deceased estates. How does the Kavango Parliament handle the legal intricacies of a deceased estate&#x003F; It can be done either by Kavango tribal or traditional law or by existing Western law. We want to know how they would handle these things. How is it decided who will inherit in that case&#x003F; These are practical issues. It is not the principle of whether there should be the power that we are questioning, but the administration and this Government&#x2019;s judgment of when a transfer is properly timed. Our belief is that you should train people and get them ready to take over a power and then give it to them. Unless the Minister can show otherwise, we and South Africa must assume that the Government gives the powers without first having provided the people. That is the fundamental difference between us, namely whether people should be trained first or whether they should be given power first when there is nobody qualified to take it over. That is the simple issue in regard to which we are seeking an answer from the Government. We want to be satisfied that they are not creating pie in the sky, a facade which cannot work.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause will give to any of the authorities established in terms of the Bantu Homelands Constitution Act, the powers to establish, with the concurrence of the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, public holidays in substitution for public holidays established in terms of the Public Holidays Act. It means that the homelands governments, with the concurrence of the Minister, can change any one of our holidays and substitute another date and another holiday in their area. The great difference between the United Party and the Government is that we regard the Republic as one whole over which our Government will always have sovereignty. There are certain powers which we will give to the homelands communal councils, but the declaration of national days and holidays is not one of those powers. I am not going to repeat all the arguments we had under clause 9, which gives the same powers to the authorities in South-West Africa. Suffice to say that the Deputy Minister has pointed out that the State President can declare national holidays or regional holidays and we have no objection to that. We have no objection to regional holidays. But the Act was passed by Parliament, laying down certain specific days which are to be regarded as holidays throughout the Republic. If those days are to be altered anywhere in the Republic, we say that this Parliament should do it by way of a resolution of this House and the Other Palce. I repeat, we would have no objection to certain amendments if so requested by the homelands government; but we are not going to hand over the power of this Parliament to a Minister on his own to decide what days, having been fixed by Parliament, can be abolished by a homeland authority with his permission.</p>

<p>Oh, you say hear, hear! As hon. members already know, Bantu homeland development has in recent years been characterized by important constitutional, financial and other changes. Inevitably these changes had to result in the old system of financing Bantu education being reviewed. With the establishment of the new Bantu Governments for the homelands a new system of preparing estimates and providing funds was established also for these homeland governments, as happened previously in the case of the Transkei. Now I am listening eagerly to hear whether you say hear, hear again. In fact, the pattern of these financial arrangements for the Government services in the Bantu homelands was laid down in the Transkei Constitution Act (1963). Therefore, already with the passing of the Transkei Constitution Act in 1963, there was a departure, just for the Transkei, from the existing system of financing, so essentially the Bantu Education Account has no longer been operative in the case of the Transkei since 1963. Therefore, with the further constitutional development of the other Bantu homelands, it goes without saying that these homelands should also be financed on the pattern of the Transkei.</p>

<p>Hon. members will recall that the Bantu Homelands Constitution Act (1971) laid the foundation of further constitutional development for the other Bantu homelands. But what is more, in section 6 this very Act lays down for all these homelands the same system of financing as that which exists for the Transkei. The Bantu Homelands Constitution Act (1971) and the Transkei Constitution Act (1963) both provide that the various Bantu Governments will each have its own Revenue Fund, just as we have our own Consolidated Revenue Fund. Into this revenue fund of the homeland government the following moneys are paid&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li><span class="col_2855-2856" refersTo="page_1445"/>(a) Taxes, levies and rates imposed in terms of the Bantu Taxation Act, 1969, to the extent determined by the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development in consultation with the Minister of Finance &#x2026;</li>

</ol>

<p>In passing it should be pointed out that the procedure which is followed is that the Revenue Fund of a specific homeland is credited with a <i>pro rata</i> portion of the total general taxes collected. In the course of the debate I shall furnish full particulars in this regard&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(b) all revenue and other moneys deriving from or in the course of the administration of those matters in respect of which a legislative assembly may make laws;</li>

<li>(c) an annual grant, to be paid from the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Republic, corresponding to the expenditure by the Government of the Republic in respect of the matters the administration of which has been transferred to the Government of the area, during the financial year preceding the date of the transfer, <i>less</i>&#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(i) the income from existing sources of revenue which accrued to the Consolidated Revenue Fund during the said financial year but which will in future accrue to the Revenue Fund; and</li>

<li>(ii) the salaries, allowances, pension contributions and other benefits payable by the Government of the Republic to officials in the Public Service of the Republic assigned for service to the Government of the area;</li>

</ol>

</li>

<li>(d) such an additional sum of money as may be appropriated by Parliament for payment out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the due performance of services and duties assigned to the Government of the homeland area.</li>

</ol>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what the new system of preparing estimates and providing funds in the Bantu homelands amounts to in brief is that every homeland itself will henceforth prepare its own estimates for its Government services, including, of course, education. However, it is foreseen that for many years to come it will not be possible for the Revenue Funds of the various homelands to be self-sufficient, in other words, it will not be possible to defray the full expenditure of the said homelands from the Revenue Funds of the homeland governments. It is in consequence of this that it was provided in the Act to which I referred that Parliament may make additional appropriations to the various Bantu Governments. Estimates will be submitted to the Department of Bantu Administration and Development for the consideration of the Minister. However, the education estimates of each homeland will be referred to the Department of Bantu Education of the Republic by the Department of Bantu Administration and Development for export scrutiny and advice. Thereupon the additional funds deemed necessary for the various homelands will be channelized in accordance with the usual procedures of budgeting to this Parliament for approval. Therefore, as in the case of the Transkei, all additional appropriations for education in the homelands will, together with funds for other purposes, be provided on the Bantu Administration and Development Vote.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, not in the Vote here. These details will of course, be furnished in the course of the discussion, but in the Vote itself, only the overall amount will appear.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I have already indicated to you, Sir, that it was laid down by law that the taxes payable by citizens of a homeland in terms of the Bantu Tax Act (1969) have to be paid into the Revenue Fund of the government of that homeland. Under the new dispensation the largest portion of the Bantu tax which accrued to the Bantu Education Account up to now, will therefore be allocated to the various Bantu governments. This will leave the Bantu Education Account with a small balance which, together with the amount of R14&#x00BD; million (R13 million plus R1&#x00BD; million for higher education) which is allocated to the Account from the Consolidated Revenue Fund annually, will be insufficient to cover the expenditure in respect of Bantu education in the White area, as well as university education for the Bantu.</p>

<p>In the light of what I have already said, it will be clear to hon. members that with <span class="col_2857-2858" refersTo="page_1446"/>the implementation of the new constitutional system of financing in respect of the homelands, these homelands will be separated completely from the Bantu Education Account and that this account will then receive only a meagre amount from general Bantu tax. Therefore, everything indicates that the Bantu Education Account has become obsolete in the constitutional development process of the homelands and for that reason the Government has decided that no justification exists for it to continue to exist, and that it should be abolished.</p>

<p>The necessary financial provision for the training of Bantu at universities and for Bantu education in the White part of the Republic will, with effect from 1st April, 1972, be made under the Bantu Education Vote, and this service will henceforth be financed in full from the Consolidated Revenue Fund.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Will this be free education now&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, that is not relevant now. That portion of Bantu tax which does not go to the homeland governments will be paid into the South African Bantu trust Fund, to be utilized for development in the Bantu homelands. This will entail that a smaller appropriation will be made to the Trust from the Revenue Account, which will then serve as partial compensation for the amount which will have to be made available out of Revenue for Bantu educational services. However, I must emphasize at once that this small compensation paid into the Revenue Fund is not the only contribution to that Fund which comes out of the pockets of the Bantu. Consequently, this brings me to the other important consideration which applied with the abolition of the Bantu Education Account, viz. whether the revenue from Bantu taxes, i.e. indirect and direct taxes, has shown any appreciable increase since 1955, when the Bantu Education Account was established. This is of major importance here because the Government is still of the opinion that the Bantu should, to an increasing extent, contribute to the expansion and development of their own education.</p>

<p>The Government has no doubts whatsoever that the revenue from Bantu taxes, particularly since 1969, has increased considerably as the result of important mesures which this Government has in fact adopted in this regard since 1969. As you know, the pattern according to which the Bantu have to pay taxes has changed considerably since 1955. In the first place the Bantu Taxation Act (Act No. 92 of 1969), was passed. According to that Act the Bantu pay a general tax which consists of a fixed amount of R2,50 per male person, the so-called poll-tax, and income tax which has to be paid by Bantu persons according to their income. A PAYE system was also introduced for the Bantu by this Act, in terms of which a Bantu earning in excess of R30 per month pays tax according to the PAYE system. In addition the 1969 Act also makes provision for local tax.</p>

<p>In the second place&#x2014;I have not dealt with the question of direct taxation here &#x2014;in respect of indirect tax paid by the Bantu, sales duty was introduced approximately two years ago, and it is also applicable to the Bantu. Although it is not possible to indicate precisely what the contribution by the Bantu to the Exchequer in this respect is, it can be accepted that it is a considerable portion of the total income from sales duty, which was estimated at plus/minus R180 million for the 1971-&#x2019;72 financial year. In addition to this the Bantu, in the same way as the Whites, are subject to customs and excise duties. Direct and indirect taxation out of the pockets of the Bantu has therefore compensated to a generous extent for the additional financial assistance rendered during the past few years to the Bantu Education Account.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>You hope so.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I do not hope so; it is so. It will in future also compensate to a large extent for the expenditure in regard to university training and Bantu education in the White areas.</p>

<p>What we must have clear in our minds therefore is that in principle no change is being effected with the abolition of the Bantu Education Account. The principle that the Bantu themselves should accept the primary responsibility for their education services is being maintained. The policy is still that his tax contributions should be related to expenditure in the field of education, a policy which is just as applicable to the Whites. [Interjections.] I cannot understand why hon. members opposite are laughing. The fact of the matter is that the policy is still that the tax contributions of the Bantu should be related to the expenditure <span class="col_2859-2860" refersTo="page_1447"/>in the field of education, a policy which is also applicable to the Whites. Although hon. members on the opposite side are laughing about this, they must be under no illusions that the fact of the matter is that since 1969 the Bantu have through direct taxation been making a considerably greater contribution, and that they have also been making a considerable contribution through indirect sales duty; there is therefore no reason at all to laugh if one takes into account that the policy of the Government is that the Bantu should, to an increasing extent, make their own contributions, through direct and indirect taxation, in respect of Bantu education, and that this is already happening.</p>

<p>During the past 18 years the Government has ensured that Bantu taxation kept pace with educational requirements. The old poll-tax&#x2014;and now the hon. members may as well start laughing again when they hear the following&#x2014;was increased from R2 to R3-50, and with the introduction of sales duty this amount was reduced to R2-50 again, precisely because it was calculated that the Bantu would make a considerable contribution through sales duty. The rest of the population also received tax concessions when sales duty was introduced.</p>

<p>Since 1969 there has been a considerable increase in Bantu taxes as a result of the improvement of the economic position of this population group, and as a result of the new additional tax, based on income. The tax which is being collected will continue to be a determining factor in the nature and extent of the educational services.</p>

<p>During the past few years there has been a steady increase in the expenditure on Bantu education. Since there will continue to be an increase in the taxation this will not be in conflict with the policy of the Government to allow a justifiable increase in expenditure on education every year, in accordance with the policy of the Government. However, the usual control will be applied and, as in the past, the Minister of Bantu Education will, in consultation with the Minister of Finance, determine what increase will be allowed. Let there be no doubts whatsoever that this House of Assembly will be the body which will decide whether increases will be allowed, and which increases will be allowed each year &#x2014;these matters can be discussed here.</p>

<p>The proceeds from the general tax on Bantu has for some time now been insufficient to meet growing educational requirements, but taking into consideration the contribution of the Bantu to sales duty the Government has felt itself at liberty to supply the deficit which arose. This was first done by way of interest-free advances. With effect from 1970-&#x2019;71, however, this was done by way of supplementary contributions from Revenue. Statutory provision was made for this by means of section 3 of the Second Finance Act of 1970 and in round figures the supplementary contributions in respect of 1970-71 were R19&#x00BD; million, and for the present financial year, 1971-72, R26&#x00BD; million. It cannot therefore be alleged that education, either in the White area or in the homelands, will be better or worse off after the abolition of the Bantu Education Account. In both cases this depends on the contribution which the Government of the Republic is prepared to make towards this, unless the homelands become so economically prosperous that they can afford, without any contribution from the Central Exchequer, to spend an increased <i>per capita</i> amount, i.e. unit costs, on education than the Government of the Republic is prepared to do for the Bantu children in the White area. As long as the Bantu homelands are subsidized by the Government of the Republic in respect of education, the unit cost in the White area and homelands will, for the most part, have to remain the same. It goes without saying of course that the expensive educational institutions such as teachers&#x2019; training colleges, universities, trade schools, etc., will only be provided in the homelands, but these are usually residential institutions which are also at the disposal of students from the White areas. Although the Bantu in the White areas will rely to a large extent on the homelands for advanced education, they need not fear that they will be any the worse off. Furthermore, an agreement is being entered into with all homeland Governments for professional control to remain the concern of the Republic&#x2019;s Department of Bantu Education for the sake of good and uniform standards in these institutions in the Bantu homelands.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to emphasize that in the matter of financial provision the Government will always take into account new needs which arise and new developments which will make particular demands on the education service.</p>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from><span class="col_2861-2862" refersTo="page_1448"/>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, that is not true at all. The national economy and, more specifically, industry constantly call for the Bantu labour force to receive training which keeps pace with the demands made by development. And let the hon. members have no doubts that this is what will happen. I am surprised that they do not say that this is their policy which is being taken over. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I also know that there are people who maintain that we should spend much more on Bantu education, that the unit costs of approximately R20 at present is inadequate, but Bantu education is of such tremendous magnitude that the available funds must necessarily be utilized judiciously and economically. Whereas the enrollment at the largest provincial education department increased by approximately 8 000 in one year, the enrolment in Bantu education has, at present, increased by more than 200 000 per annum. While the attitude of the Government is not unsympathetic towards this major need which is being created, the attitude of the Bantu himself cannot be one of indifference towards the major responsibility he is creating for himself either. Therefore it should be clear to everyone that the more comprehensive social services are, the larger the contributions of the community concerned, of the Bantu, will have to be. Therefore it is the Government&#x2019;s policy that the revenue of the Bantu themselves from direct and indirect taxation should consequently be the criterion for the education services the Bantu receive in the Republic and in their homelands.</p>

<p>I should like to say in anticipation that we are aware of the Bantu&#x2019;s contribution to the development of the country in general as well as the indirect taxation he pays, but, of course, there are also other services apart from education which he receives, such as health services, hospitalization, police protection, subsidized feeding and transport as well as the numerous general public services which the Republic offers its entire population and which have to be financed from the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Republic.</p>

<p>Through this legislation the Bantu still retain not only the privilege of exercising control over their own schools through school committees, school boards and other parents&#x2019; bodies but also to provide to a large extent the necessary funds for their education. On the other hand it affords this Government the opportunity to keep a constant eye on the situation and, with due regard to circumstances, to help where necessary.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I should like to point out that this Bull actually contains only two clauses which, as far as principles are concerned, are of material importance, and they are clauses 1 and 27. Clause 1 abolishes the Bantu Education Account and regulates financial matters incidental thereto, whereas clause 27 makes provision for that portion of the Bantu taxation which does not go to the homeland governments to be paid into the South African Bantu Trust Fund. All the other amendments are consequential amendments which flow from clause 1, i.e. the abolition of the Bantu Education Account.</p>

<p>Because this Bill undoubtedly crystallizes the successful implementation of the policy of multi-national development it is a privilege to me to move the Second Reading of this Bill.</p>

<p>The account was introduced to make provision for limiting the amounts which Parliament would vote through Consolidated Revenue for Bantu education. What was our attitude when this measure was introduced in 1955&#x003F; We opposed it, and moved an amendment that the Bill be read this day six months, because we said that it was an impractical measure, that it was unfair and that Bantu education could never be financed in the manner then proposed by the Government.</p>

<p>At that time there was another party besides the United Party in this Assembly, namely the Conservative Party. The Conservative Party, represented by Dr. Jonker, moved to omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House declines to pass the Second Reading of the Exchequer and Audit Amendment Bill unless the Government undertakes to change the basis on which the money will be made available to the Bantu Education Account from the Revenue Account&#x201D;. The member moving it said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If we accept that and make this basis more elastic so that in future it can be applied unchanged to enable us to make our Native education an example to the world in a reasonable and just way as in the past, I think that we would have put this Bill on the correct basis. Let us get away from this limitation of only &#x00A3;6y million &#x2026;&#x201D;</block>

<p>A division was called on the amendment moved by Dr. Jonker and as there were fewer than 15 members in favour of that amendment their names were recorded. They were Mr. Bekker, Mr. Blaar Coetzee, Dr. Jonker and Mr. Waring. Two Ministers in the present Cabinet disagreed at that time, and rightly so, with the method of financing the Bantu Education Account.</p>

<p>We pointed out all the difficulties that were going to arise in connection with this account and I must say, although we do not want to tell them that we told them so, it is hard for us not to make political capital out of this measure, which amounts to a complete capitulation by the Government. How does the Minister explain the demise of this account&#x003F; He said that there had been political developments in the Reserves and talked about the advance of the homelands, tribal authorities and legislative assemblies. He said that because this progress had taken place, it was not necessary to have this account any more.</p>

<p>I do not believe all this, and I am going to tell him why this account has to be abolished. There is one reason, and one reason only, namely that the Bantu Education Account has been a flop. Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s policy has failed. His intention was, and it is quite clearly stated, that Parliament should peg the amount it would vote for Bantu education and when he introduced the Bill it was pegged at &#x00A3;6&#x00BD; million, R13 million, plus R1&#x00BD; million for universities.</p>

<p>I am going to quote what the Minister of Finance suggests. He said as follows: &#x201C;Dr. Verwoerd intended that the Bantu should pay for himself if he needed more than the R13 million&#x201D;. If this amount was not pegged, there was no object in introducing the measure. He saw the expenditure on education mounting every year and he and his fellow-members remembered the attacks they made on the United Party when it was in power for spending money on Bantu education. We were the &#x201C;kafferboeties&#x201D; and they were disturbed at the way in which the amount was increasing.</p>

<p><span class="col_2865-2866" refersTo="page_1450"/>After all, Mr. De Wet Nel had once attacked us for spending &#x00A3;6 million on education shortly before they took over. Do hon. members know what the United Party spent in 1947-48 on Bantu education&#x003F; We spent R9 378 542.</p>

But his Government was spending much more, and as he saw the demand growing every year, decided to peg the money voted by Parliament from the Consolidated Revenue Account and insisted, as I say, that the Bantu themselves pay if more money was required for their education. Every year when the Bantu Vote was discussed in Parliament, the United Party attacked this system of appropriating money for Bantu education. Right from the time when it started, when we voted against the Bill and moved &#x201C;this day six months&#x201D;&#x2014;the worst condemnation we could give to the Bill&#x2014; we opposed it and every year we queried the unjust manner in which it was attempted to finance Bantu education, especially when we saw how the Bantu was treated in relation to the other race groups and what they were getting for their education.</p>

<p>I am not going to pretend that we have not raised this question year in and year out. We have raised it year in and year out; we said that this was impracticable and that it could not work. But we were ignored. It did not work; it could not possibly work, even although the Bantu children had to pay for their own books. They were discriminated against. But it still could not work; it still was not sufficient money. It was nowhere near sufficient. Even though, as I say, much less was spent <i>per capita</i> on the Bantu child than on the other race groups, the provision made by Dr. Verwoerd was still not enough. As I have said, in 1947 the expenditure was less than R9&#x00BD; million. For the financial years 1970 to 1971 it was R71 million, and with capital expenditure added, it came to R75 million. In 1969-70 it was R56 million. We had an increase of R15 million in one year. How was all this financed&#x003F; Obviously, the amount set aside from the General Revenue Account, the R13 million plus the R1&#x00BD; million, with Bantu taxes, could not meet this amount. A subterfuge was adopted. Instead of increasing the R13 million, and so going back on Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s undertaking to the electorate not to spend more than R13 million, they embarked on a system, firstly, of giving loans to the account on which interest was payable. We objected to this and pointed out that it was very difficult to find out exactly how much money was being spent on Bantu education. It was difficult to find out. Did the hon. the Deputy Minister want to say something&#x003F;</p>

<p>Sir, I want to go on and explain how else they financed it besides the taxation. Besides giving loans, when they found that the loans were mounting up and that there was no hope of their being repaid, what did they do&#x003F; They then changed to giving advances without interest. Who was going to repay this amount&#x003F; How was it ever going to be repaid, when the amount owed by this account was mounting every year&#x003F; For obvious reasons the amount spent was hidden in loans and advances to the account because they did not want the Verkramptes to know exactly how much they were spending. The chickens which they had reared during the war years, when the United Party had to finance Bantu education, were now coming home to roost. As I have said, they embarked on the system of loans and then advances. Now we see from clause 1, subsection (4), of this Bill that they are formally going to write off R32 657 010-67. That is what they are going to write off in terms of this clause. They are going to write off both the loans and the advances, but that is not all they have received in that account. When it was obvious that this camouflage could not go on forever, in 1970, they had the courage to abandon this system as &#x2026;</p>

<p>In addition to the R13 million set aside each year plus the R1&#x00BD; million for university education, Parliament in the last ten years has voted an extra R32 million in loans and advances, plus R46 million in grants. In addition we have had the various Bantu taxes added to the account. Quite obviously this ridiculous system cannot continue, as the Minister said.</p>

<p>While we are on the subject of the Act of 1970, I just want to quote from it. Although the Minister thought that it was going to be R17 million, he actually had to pay R19&#x00BD; million in that first year. This is how the Act reads:</p>

<block name="quote">Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other law contained, any deficiency existing in the Bantu Education Account on the 31st day of March, 1971, or on the 31st day of March, 1972, shall be met by means of transfer of the requisite amount from the Revenue Account to the Bantu Account on the date in question.</block>

<p>Parliament gave him the right, the power to balance the account. No matter what the account was, we gave him the right because we knew that the R17 million which the Minister hoped it would cost, would not be nearly sufficient. In fact it has proved to be so. We are not going to rub this in. [Interjections.] After all we do not have to gloat in victory. We have had so many victories lately that we take this in our stride.</p>

<p>We will support this Bill for two reasons. Firstly, because we think it is right that whatever money is necessary&#x2014;I am not going to discuss the amount now because that we can discuss under the Vote&#x2014;must come out of the Consolidated Revenue Account.</p>

<p>We will support it, secondly, because we are only human and we are pleased to see an acknowledgment by the hon. the Deputy Minister that we have always been right on this score. But why did the hon. the Deputy Minister have to make so much fuss and capital out of the fact that the Bantu taxes, direct and indirect, were going to pay for the education&#x003F; What is the position with the Coloured, the Indian and the White man&#x003F; Do our taxes not all go to our education as well&#x003F; Do our direct tax and our sales tax not go towards the education <span class="col_2869-2870" refersTo="page_1452"/>of our children&#x003F; Are the Bantu any different&#x003F;</p>

<p>I take it from that that he will allot the money on the basis of the number of pupils in each homeland and in the urban areas and on the basis of R20 per unit. I do not know whether this is so, but if, for argument&#x2019;s sake, the Transkei collects more in direct taxation for education then, say, the Vendas will the Transkei be able to have better education than the Vendas or not, and will the children in the urban areas receive the same standard of education as the children in the homelands&#x003F;</p>

<p>Sir, as I have said, we will support this Bill because we have had enough of bungling in this Vote and it is time this country knew what the Government intends spending on the most important aspect of our life in South Africa, namely education. The Bantu form the major source of our labour supply and it is in the interests of all the population groups in South Africa, Black or White, that we should know what the Government intends doing for the education of the Bantu, because it is of the utmost importance to the economy and to our life generally that we see to it that the Bantu receives a proper education in this country.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, on the Order Paper of Monday, 6th March, the third item was the Second Reading of the Bantu Education Account Abolition Bill. When we came to this item the hon. the Leader of the House had to stand up and ask that this matter be held over because the Opposition had requested it. Yesterday, when we had reached about the same stage in the proceedings, the hon. the Leader of the House had to stand up again to give the Opposition a chance to prepare themselves. We thought today that the main Opposition speaker on Bantu Education, the hon. member for Transkei who has just spoken, would come along here with a very magnificent speech. Sir, I am terribly disappointed in what the hon. member dished up for us here. The hon. member referred here to the Estimates of previous years and the expenditure on Bantu Education from the Loan Account and other sources. I find it so remarkable that the hon. member now raises this matter here, while at every opportunity during the discussion of those Estimates they could have raised the same argument. The fact that the hon. member now raises that matter in this specific way and on this occasion gives one the impression that what he said here is meant for consumption in Oudtshoorn. I also found it remarkable that the hon. member took <b>so</b> long to come and tell us that the Opposition supports this measure. Subsequently the hon. member, in point of fact, only struggled along with a few general statements and questions. [Interjections.] When in his Second Reading Speech the hon. the Deputy Minister mentioned the principle that the Bantu must themselves contribute to the services they receive, the hon. members of the Opposition laughed about it, why I do not know. This principle has long been included in the Bantu policy of our country.</p>

<p>This principle is the striking aspect of the National Party&#x2019;s policy, and this same principle is also subtly embodied in the old South African Party&#x2019;s policy and in the policy of the United Party. This applies particularly to Bantu education. The principle that the Bantu themselves must help contribute to their services, particularly as far as education is concerned, has been a conspicuous one since 1919. For the information of those hon. gentlemen I want to mention that in 1919 a Native Education Commission was appointed in the Cape. This commission made a very clear recommendation to the effect that the Bantu population should contribute <span class="col_2873-2874" refersTo="page_1454"/>part of the costs for its education. This policy principle of the co-responsibility of the Bantu for the financing of their children&#x2019;s education is a very sound one. That commission, to which I referred, consisted of Whites and Bantu, and they unanimously endorsed this principle.</p>

<p>In 1925, under National Party rule, the Natives Taxation and Development Act, Act No. 41 of 1925, was placed on the Statute Book, an Act embodying the principle of the co-responsibility of the Bantu for the development of their education. Under United Party rule in 1945 it is true that Minister Hofmeyr piloted Act No. 29 through Parliament. This Act contained a broad principle whereby the State directly finances Bantu Education, and any development thereof, from the Treasury&#x2014;these are now apparently the arguments the hon. gentlemen want to stick to. However, this does not replace the basic principle that the Bantu must help contribute to his education.</p>

<p>After the National Party came into power in 1948, the Eiselen Commission was appointed, and this commission came to specific conclusions, five of which I shall mention: In the first place, Bantu must contribute a portion of all costs for development incurred in their interests. In the second place there must be a direct connection between the tax levied and the services furnished. The third conclusion was that by means of Bantu authorities there must be active Bantu participation in education, and subsequently school committees, parent committees and so on, were also created. The fourth conclusion was that the Bantu should carry part of their education costs and, fifthly that the Bantu&#x2019;s ability to contribute more&#x2014;and this is very important&#x2014; would in time increase through education and development. This dual principle was later embodied in the form of legislation. In the first place, there is the contribution of the Bantu through the channels of their general taxation and, secondly, the contribution of the State that was fixed and would remain so for a time. Thus the Finance Amendment Bill was introduced by Dr. Verwoerd in 1955. This provided that there would be a Bantu education account and that the relevant account would chiefly draw its funds from two sources. The first source of contributions was the Bantu&#x2019;s general taxation; in this case it was four-fifths of the direct tax. The second source of contributions would be the State which contributes up to &#x00A3;6&#x00BD; mil lion, later R13 million, annually from the Treasury. At that time it was estimated by Dr. Verwoerd that the contributions direct from the Treasury were three times as much as the Bantu were contributing in direct tax at the time. The principle of co&#x002D;responsibility of the Bantu for the financing of their education came strongly to the fore. As education grows and develops, its costs must be carried by the developing Bantu themselves.</p>

<p>In my opinion this Bill is a very efficient and appropriate measure. It also still contains the principle that the Bantu must pay for their own services. What is more, that he will still have to pay to an increasing extent, particularly as far as his education is concerned. But here the positive principle also applies, i.e. that since the Bantu must honour greater financial obligations, his responsibility for education grows and he obtains more of a say by means of educational bodies I have just mentioned, such as parent committees and school boards. The tribal, regional and territorial authorities also accept, without reserve, responsibility for the maintenance, control and the spending of finances. The monetary obligations the Whites of South Africa have for so long shouldered to pay for the upliftment and the development of the Bantu are slowly being transferred to the Bantu. This is, of course, also a logical result of an inevitable consequence of the policy of separate development. The Whites, to put it like this, must actually contribute minimally to the Bantu&#x2019;s education and other services, while the Bantu himself&#x2014;to use the words which the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development frequently uses&#x2014;contributes an optimum amount to it.</p>

<p>I should like to emphasize that this Bill essentially means that the Bantu must continually contribute, to an increasing extent, for their children&#x2019;s education. This has always been this Government&#x2019;s policy. The Bantu&#x2019;s economic position has improved, and more money is collected from him by means of direct tax, to which the hon. the Deputy Minister referred, but also through indirect tax, which he also mentioned. The revenue obtained from this already justifies a Bantu Education Estimate in the Consolidated Revenue Account. The Government is deciding on this step because it believes that the time is ripe to take such a step and because it has been assured it has the guarantee that there will be a substantial contribution from the Bantu. Over the past <span class="col_2875-2876" refersTo="page_1455"/>decade and longer there have been considerable funds from the Consolidated Revenue Account for various matters, including Bantu education, as the hon. member has just mentioned. But these funds were voted by this Parliament, and this will continue to be the case in the future. The voting of funds will take place through this Parliament. The amounts that will be allocated will remain in accordance with Bantu incomes, there will, in other words, be a direct link between the income of the Bantu and the appropriation.</p>

<p>Reference was made here to the R13 million, but Dr. Verwoerd himself foresaw that this amount could not always apply.</p>

<p>Now listen; do not be too clever. Being a realist, Dr. Verwoerd mentioned a period of five years that could serve as a point of departure for an average arrangement. I want to quote from Hansard (volume 87, column 314) of 31st January, 1955, the Hansard the hon. member had here and also referred to briefly. There we find the following words used by Dr. Verwoerd on that occasion in reply to the Second Reading debate&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is right therefore that we should see that the amount voted by Parliament from the General Revenue Account remains pegged and that we should determine what the Native can actually afford in the interests of expansion. Let me tell hon. members that we have worked out that if the expansion of Native education takes place in a sensible way, it can be borne for the next five years by this amount, plus a reasonable increase in the Native poll tax.</block>

<p>That is what Dr. Verwoerd said. He did mention a period of five years.</p>

<p>I believe that with this measure good human relations between the Whites and, in this case, the various Bantu peoples are being developed and strengthened, because the Bantu realizes that greater responsibility is also being given to him as far as the recovery and spending of the funds is concerned. The Bantu will realize, and is already beginning to realize, that he cannot always expect the Whites to carry the financial burden for him. The Whites also want to emancipate the Bantu in this sphere. This measure is a positive result and a reflection of the National Party&#x2019;s policy. It therefore confirms&#x2014;and I want hon. members to listen well to this; they do not believe in this, but we on this side of the House do&#x2014;the respect of the National Party for national identity and national sovereignty and underlines the concept of multinationality, particularly as far as the Bantu peoples are concerned. This is effected as a result of the fact that each Bantu people obtains its own revenue account and that each people will receive its <i>pro rata</i> share from Bantu taxation.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to mention that it is remarkable that the biggest driving force and initiative, as far as Bantu education itself is concerned, comes from the homelands and that it has revealed itself there in the past few years and not in the White areas. The attitude and the approach of the Bantu in the White area is that the Whites are responsible for the Bantu in all respects. This attitude has unfortunately gone very deep and become firmly entrenched as far as the Bantu are concerned. The hon. members of the Opposition and the newspapers that support that side of the House are to a large extent responsible for that attitude we encounter amongst the Bantu in the White areas. I hope and believe that this Amendment Bill will also contribute towards new insight for the Bantu in the White area, and particularly bring them to realize that they are not in a political and racial no man&#x2019;s land, but that they are citizens of their own peoples.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Koedoespoort has spent a great portion of his speach dilating on the philosophy of the late Dr. Verwoerd in regard to Bantu Education. I believe that the presentation of this Bill tonight is a tacit admission and a positive substantiation that the philosophy of Dr. Verwoerd, in so far as Bantu Education is concerned, has failed. I believe that time will reveal that other philosophies will also fail.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Koedoespoort also referred to the contribution that should be made by the Bantu to their education. My colleague, the hon. member for Transkei, referred to this. He made it quite clear that every race should contribute to its education. But when we take the poorest economically and limit their education mainly to their ability to pay their tax, I do not believe that this is a <span class="col_2877-2878" refersTo="page_1456"/>principle that should continue in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Koedoespoort also referred to various commissions. He was very careful not to refer to the Holloway Commission of 1954 and 1955, which dealt in a very logical manner with higher education for the non-White people.</p>

<p>I should like to address a question to the hon. the Deputy Minister. I should like to draw his attention to the fact that in the latest report of the Controller and Auditor-General there is an item which indicates that there has been a Treasury Committee of inquiry into the financing of non-White universities. I listened carefully but I did not hear the hon. the Deputy Minister refer to this departmental committee. Surely it is involved with the financial aspects of all non-White education. Surely it is fair that this House should be made acquainted with some of the findings of this departmental committee if it has sat and has concluded its deliberations. If it has not concluded its deliberations and made its recommendations, is it not a little premature to proceed before the recommendations are made known&#x003F; I trust that the hon. the Deputy Minister will give some clarity on this point, because surely a Treasury Committee of Inquiry should be taken into consideration in a matter of this sort.</p>

<p>Sir, my colleague has indicated that we on this side of the House support this Bill. We support it with reservations. We support it because we know that basically this is a take-over of United Party policy in regard to Bantu education. [Interjections.] At this stage I want to pay a very sincere tribute to somebody who is no longer in this House, but who played a major part in putting forward the attitude of the United Party in regard to Bantu education. I want publicly to pay tribute to Mr. Philip Moore, the ex-M.P. for Kensington who, for years, highlighted the effect of the erosion of the rand in relation to its effect on Bantu education regarding the statutory pegging of the amount allocated to Bantu education. Then I think it is fair to make reference, too, to the Department of Bantu Education and the officials who administer the department. I believe that for years they have been involved in a two-way stretch; they have tried to reconcile a growing enrolment (together with a terrific pupil fall-out) with the diminishing value of money. Their task has been an unenviable one. But I feel that they have fulfilled it with dedication and I believe that it is fair to pay tribute to them for their efforts under difficult circumstances with limited means.</p>

<p>We must be realistic about this Bill and I want to say here and now that this Bill will not create a multi-national educational fairy land because the poorest race economically is still being called upon to subscribe directly by taxation towards its education. Bantu education will still be dependent on the tax payments of the Bantu themselves. My hon. colleague from the Transkei has indicated that the Government has found it necessary to adopt expediency and devices to tide it over this financial hiatus which existed in so far as Bantu education is concerned. He mentioned the fact that outstanding loans and advances were being set aside by this very Bill to the extent of R32 million, but we on this side of the House have realized for some considerable time that this system of financing could not continue.</p>

<p>I think it is fitting at this period of transition that we should assess briefly what has happened. On the one hand we have the enrolment, as the Minister has said, of approximately a quarter million per annum. When we bear in mind that by Std. II at least half of the children who enrolled at the sub-standard classes, have already fallen away, we realize one of the difficulties. The other problem facing the department and the Minister is that he has been limited to the expenditure of a <i>per capita</i> amount of R20 per pupil per annum. What do we have at the other end of the scale&#x003F; We have higher education and we have the position today where in the three Bantu ethnic universities the education per student per annum amounts to R2 400. That is an amount 200 times in excess of the overall average amount allocated to children attending primary and secondary schools. I think we should make it clear that the United Party does not begrudge or criticize any money allocated towards education, but it reserves the right to criticize the method of the allocation. For years the number of Bantu students reaching Form V&#x2014;that is, the matriculation form&#x2014;has represented a pitifully low figure of 0,11 per cent of the total enrolment. The latest figures, the figures for 1970, indicate that approximately 3 000 Bantu were enrolled in the fifth form, the matriculation form, and that 1 009 passed <span class="col_2879-2880" refersTo="page_1457"/>with matriculation exemption. This means that this small number of 1 009, some of whom fall away and do not go to university, provide the intake for three ethnic universities. Under the old system substantial amounts in relation to the overall amount allocated by statute, were specifically allowed for higher education. This amount is R1&#x00BD; million and it was allocated mainly for the establishment and the administration of these three Bantu universities. I come back to the remark made by the hon. member for Koedoespoort. He obviously has not read, or he has forgotten, the recommendations of the Holloway Commission of 1954/1955.</p>

<p>I wonder whether the Government has over the past years paid attention to the findings of that commission, because the commission indicated and advised a gradual extension of university development. I am sure they did not envisage the present situation where we have three ethnic universities with a very limited intake of students. I am sure too that their recommendations were based on the fact of what it would cost the taxpayers of South Africa. In this Bill 12 out of the 28 clauses refer in some way or another to the University of Fort Hare, the University of Zululand and the University of the North. I believe it is just and fitting that on that basis one is entitled to ask what has been happening in respect of higher education in so far as these universities are concerned. We know now that, in terms of the Bill before the House, that there will be a new provision which I believe one could sum up by saying that the main provision will be that after consultation with the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Bantu Education, will agree upon the amount to be allocated to Bantu universities in respect of capital and normal recurrent expenditure. I have mentioned that in the past the universities received an amount of R1&#x00BD; million, of the overall statutory allocation of R14&#x00BD; million. I believe that as long as we have the present situation, with three universities for Bantu, a total enrolment of approximately 2 500 students, and the intake limited by the small number of Bantu matriculants&#x2014; because not all of them proceed to university&#x2014;we have a situation which is causing a waste of manpower and to a certain extent an incorrect allocation in the funds devoted to Bantu education. What do we find in these universities&#x003F; We find that they are more than adequately staffed with lecturers, most of whom are White. We find that they have the lowest student to lecturer ratio in the Republic. But with this ideal situation, are we not entitled to ask what results have been achieved&#x003F; I can give these results very briefly. In the 12 years after the establishment of the universities&#x2014;in this instance I do not include Fort Hare because members of the House know that Fort Hare has been in existence for much longer than that&#x2014;we find that in the University of the North there have been approximately 5 300 enrolments, in the University of Zululand, approximately 3 400 and in the University of Fort Hare, for the same period, 4 659 excluding the Coloured and Asiatics who used to be enrolled there. This gives us a total of 13 450 enrolments, which in 12 years has produced a number of 2 433 diplomas and degrees&#x2014;13 500 enrolments producing 2 500 degrees and diplomas! This was done at an expenditure of R2 400 per student per annum. We believe that the Government has an important lesson to learn as regards this matter of higher education. We believe that it is our duty to warn the Government that they cannot expect better results in higher education until they adopt a more realistic attitude in regard to the financing of primary, and particularly secondary Bantu education.</p>
