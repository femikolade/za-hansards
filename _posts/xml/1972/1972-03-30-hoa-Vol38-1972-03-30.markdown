<p>Clause 2:</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_public_works">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendment standing in my name on page 215 of the Order Paper, namely&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit subsection (4) and to substitute the following subsection:</block>

<block name="quote">(4) The Minister may withhold or grant his approval referred to in subsection (1) only after he has obtained and considered the written advice of the City Council and after he has consulted a committee, appointed by the Minister, consisting of an officer in the Department of Public Works who shall act as chairman, a representative of the Capital Planning Committee, the Town Clerk of Pretoria, the Director of Architectural Services in the Department of Public Works, the Director of Buildings in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the Director of Works in the Transvaal Provincial Administration, the Director of Cultural Affairs in the Department of National Education, an officer in the Department of Planning and two practising architects in Pretoria nominated by the South African Council for Architects : Provided that the Minister may act without <span class="col_4453-4454" refersTo="page_0689"/>such advice having been obtained from the City Council if it is not submitted to him within ninety days after the City Council was asked therefore.</block>

<p>I may just mention that when this Bill was dealt with in the Other Place for the first time, Senator Getz asked whether we could not give the Church Square Committee statutory powers. I then undertook to investigate the position. That is why I have moved this amendment. The amendment now gives the Church Square Committee statutory powers.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s amendment is a matter of words without meaning. He suggests that he is giving some statutory powers to this committee for Church Square, but that is not in fact so. If he were giving it some statutory powers, the Minister would have made his approval or disapproval of any plans subject to the concurrence of this committee, but that is not the case. That provision does not appear in his amendment. He is not bound by any decision this committee takes. He might be foolish not to follow their advice, but he is certainly not legally bound to follow their advice. What the hon. the Minister has done is to create another form of bureaucracy, because the committee consists of ten members and eight of them are not elected representatives of the people; eight of them are officials of the various departments. As far as the City Council is concerned, their representative will be the Town Clerk; the City Council cannot even designate a city councillor to serve on this committee. Only two members of the committee are not purely <i>ex officio</i> State officials or provincial officials or municipal officials, and they are the two nominees of the Council for Architects. How can this be the creation of a statutory body which is answerable to anybody&#x003F; The principle in this Bill to which we basically object is that the control of the very heart of the city of Pretoria, over which the State President, by virtue of servitude, had certain powers, is being altered. Those powers of the State President are removed and the power of the City Council to control the heart of that city is removed. All the power is vested in the Minister, who merely has to consult a body of officials. This amendment does not remove from this Bill that objectionable aspect. We cannot support the amendment of the hon. the Minister, nor do we support the details of this particular clause, and we shall vote against it.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Green Point is talking absolute nonsense (<i>nonsens</i>)<i>.</i> Take the case of the board for the Foreshore of Cape Town, for example. Who has the final say there&#x003F; It used to be the Minister of Lands, and it is now the Minister of Agriculture. He has the final say. If I am not to have the final say in respect of this board, who is to have it&#x003F; The Pretoria City Council&#x003F; Of course not. The Administrator of the Transvaal has the final say. Now the hon. member says that this committee on Church Square, Pretoria, is just a committee of officials. I repeat: The hon. member is talking the purest nonsense.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Yeoville is suffering from a sense of inferiority. He is not only talking &#x201C;onsin&#x201D;; he is also talking &#x201C;nonsens&#x201D;. It is now being suggested that something is being done which has never been done in South Africa. It is the purest &#x2026; &#x201C;onsin&#x201D; in the world. [Interjections.] I do not know why the hon. member for Green Point is so upset about this matter. He now says that I am taking the powers out of the hands of the Pretoria City Council, but the one body which raises no objection whatsoever is the Pretoria City Council. No one has objected. The town clerk serves on this board which has been established by the Bill. The hon. member for Green Point can vote against this amendment if he so wishes: I have no objection to the Bill&#x2019;s remaining as it is. I have no objection whatsoever. If the hon. member is opposed to this amendment to such an extent, he should vote against it. If he wants to do that, I have no objection; then we can keep the Bill exactly as it is. I have no objection to that either. It will only contribute to the positive development of Church Square, Pretoria.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when the hon. the Minister explodes in the way he has just exploded, he realizes that he is talking &#x201C;nonsens&#x201D; or &#x201C;onsin&#x201D;.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Sir, it is typical of the hon. the Minister to go off at a tangent, and then he gets himself into even deeper waters than he was before he started replying to me. He tried to indicate that the fact that there is a Foreshore Board in Cape Town is synonymous with the situation in this case, and that therefore he must be in sole control of the heart of the city of Pretoria. The hon. the Minister was told yesterday, but apparently he was not listening, that in terms of the Seashore Act, the control of the Foreshore of Cape Town, an area reclaimed from the sea, vested in the State. It has never vested in the municipality. Under section 6 of the Seashore Act, that area, when it was reclaimed, became State-owned land, and the Minister of Lands then appointed a board to deal with that inheritance which had been reclaimed from the sea. Sir, the position in Pretoria is the direct opposite. Here you have the heart of the city, controlled by the municipality, and now he says that the municipality shall have no say. Sir, his answer is not an answer; his &#x201C;ontploffing&#x201D; has done nothing to clear the air and his disregard for the principles of local government just become more apparent from what he has said.</p>

There I have a committee which is called the State Committee, and that State Committee advises me before I take the final decision. The same applies in South End in Port Elizabeth; the same applies in Riverside in Durban, in Cato Manor in Durban and in Jeppes in Johannesburg.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, there is a deathly hush from the Pretoria representatives in this House. If the minister had such tremendous support from Pretoria, one would have expected the members of Parliament representing Pretoria to be standing up in a queue to support the hon. the Minister, but they are not. They are leaving it to the hon. the Minister to support this clause. What have we before us&#x003F; We have a clause here which gives the Minister total dictatorial powers. The clause as it stands makes a complete dictator of the Minister. The amendment which he has moved makes him an apparently benevolent dictator, because he has somebody who may advise him, but the fact remains that he remains a dictator. I am surprised that the hon. the Minister is surprised that we on this side of the House do not for a moment contemplate giving powers to that hon. Minister who, by the handling of other powers vested in his department, has shown to <span class="col_4457-4458" refersTo="page_0691"/>South Africa that he does not deserve to have these powers. When he has powers, he does not know how to use them, and this is quite clear when we think what he has done with his powers in Durban in Block K, with all the land that he holds which he is withholding from occupation. The hon. the Minister is the biggest estate agent in South Africa and now, in addition, he wants to be the dictator of the heart of Pretoria. If the hon. members representing Pretoria cannot stand up here to fight for Pretoria, somebody must do it. [Interjection.] I want the Pretoria members to get up and support the hon. the Minister and say: &#x201C;We are prepared to take out our heart and put it on the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s plate and say to him carve it up as you wish.&#x201D;</p>

<p>We object to the power in the original clause and to the shadow of consultation which the amendment offers. Of course the amendment is better than the original clause; it was asked for by the United Party.</p>

<p>In opposing this clause and the whole measure they are really telling the Pretoria City Council: &#x201C;You are not competent to decide about your own affairs.&#x201D; The hon. the Minister has said over and over again that the City Council did not object to this measure or to the legislation as such. But now the hon. members are concerned about the Pretoria City Council. By acting in this way the hon. members are really moving a motion of no confidence in the Pretoria City Council, because they are implying that the city council is unable to handle its own affairs. That is what it amounts to.</p>

<p>I welcome this amendment concerning the statutory committee&#x2014;the committee which used to be known as the Church Square Committee. The hon. member for Durban Point has just said here that that committee is really just a shadow body, because the Minister still has the final say. But somewhere, after all, there has to be a body or person who has the final say in the matter. That is the case with all other legislation, after all. There has to be such a person and in this case it is the Minister who is taking the powers.</p>

<p>I want to repeat what I said in my Second Reading speech, namely that I have in my constituency five important, very prominent members of the city council, of whom two are members of the management committee, one is a former member of the management committee and one is the deputy mayor of Pretoria. I have had on objection from those hon. councillors. What gives the Opposition the right to talk on behalf of Pretoria and to tell us what Pretoria wants&#x003F;</p>

<p>Clause 1 :</p>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>I asked the hon. the Minister a question yesterday during the Second Reading debate under this clause and he was kind enough to say that he would reply to me in the Committee Stage. May I remind him of it&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_national_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>I have specifically stood up to answer the question, and I am glad the hon. member for Wynberg is granting me this opportunity. She asked two questions in respect of clause 1 (2) which I should now like to reply to. I think these questions must be seen against the background of the fact that vocational education has been transferred to the provinces. Certain schools have passed to the provinces. The examinations conducted in certain of those vocational fields were and still are conducted by my department, at least partially. Some have already been transferred to the provinces; others still belong to my department. Therefore, against this background I should like to answer these two questions. In the first place the hon. member asked whether this clause also affects ordinary schools. She said &#x201C;Does it in any way refer to ordinary schools&#x003F;&#x201D; I take it that by ordinary schools the hon. member means the ordinary provincial schools. If that is the case, these schools are not affected by this clause. This clause only relates to schools and subsidized schools established and controlled in terms of section 1 of the principal Act.</p>

<p>A second question was asked about this clause, i.e. what the circumstances are under which the Minister can refuse enrolment for an examination. I shall explain the position. In terms of clause 1 (b) the Minister is being empowered to lay down conditions or requirements a candidate must comply with to enrol for a specific examination. In the second part of that clause he obtains the right to determine the circumstances under which he can refuse to accept or cancel that enrolment. The reason for that is that it is essential for the Minister to have a measure of discretion because circumstances that can develop, to the detriment of a candidate, can exclude him from participation in such an examination. He can become ill, for example. If he now fixes the requirements that must be met and such a person, for reasons over which he has no control, does not comply, it means he is excluded from participation in that examination. It is now thought necessary to give the Minister a measure of discretion so that candidates who are excluded by the technical provision, for reasons beyond their control, can in fact participate in the examination.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>Since the circumstances are under discussion I am quite <span class="col_4461-4462" refersTo="page_0693"/>satisfied with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s explanation in this regard. He will appreciate that we have no suspicions. It was merely that the word &#x201C;circumstances&#x201D; is so wide in this context. We were not quite sure as to what he had in mind. I am quite satisfied with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s explanation.</p>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have only had a very quick look at this. It only appeared on the Order Paper today. As far as I can make out it is a technical matter. We have no objection to the hon. the Minister exercising his power with regard to the establishment of subsidized schools and so on. Obviously he must have some flexibility in this matter. As far as this side of the House is concerned, we have no objection.</p>

<p>New clause put and agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 2:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, during the Second Reading debate yesterday I asked the hon. the Minister, with regard to the proviso contained in this clause, whether certain options could not be left open for teachers under certain circumstances. I asked him also whether the provision was mandatory or not. What would be the position for instance of a married teacher whose husband was already covered for medical aid purposes by membership of the Civil Service Medical Benefit Association&#x003F; This might create the problem that they would have to pay twice, which would seem to be unnecessary. Could the hon. the Minister give us the assurance that the word &#x201C;may&#x201D; in this clause leaves the options open in this case&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_national_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the real state of affairs is as follows. The only thing that is made mandatory is that an official is required to become a member of the medical aid scheme or society. The word &#x201C;may&#x201D; leaves open the possibility that, for example, married teachers whose husbands have already become members of a medical aid society, will not be obliged to join it as well. By way of regulation it will therefore be made possible for her not to have to join it. It goes without saying that men who have already become members of the medical aid society, are already complying with this provision of the Act. In other words, it is not mandatory for them again to become members of a medical aid society if they have already done so.</p>

<p>Clause put and agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 3 :</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, yesterday I also had a query with regard to clause 3. In terms of section 42 of the original Act, the governing body of a subsidized private school has the right to decide upon the appointment of staff and the ratio of pupils per staff. I asked the Minister to be kind enough to give us some assurances at this stage that he does not see the likelihood of any conflict since he is now going to delegate his powers to the Secretary or any member of the department, that he does not see any possible ground of conflict between the rights of the governing body of a subsidized private school and the right of the department itself with regard to the appointment of staff. I would be very glad to have the Minister&#x2019;s assurance on that point.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_national_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the hon. member is proceeding from the wrong standpoint. The controlling bodies&#x2019; decisions are still subject to those of the Minister. The hon. member asked why the two subsections, i.e. subsection (16) (1) and (18) (1) were originally omitted, and in that respect let me just refer to the introductory paragraph of my Second Reading speech. I said that the implementation of this Act has gradually brought us the experience that certain additions are necessary to realize the original object of the Act. I can tell the hon. member, for example, that virtually every day submissions are forthcoming from schools that want, to appoint <span class="col_4463-4464" refersTo="page_0694"/>one more Bantu servant, for example, or that want to change certain posts that have already been created, and that I have to approve all those changes, additions and omissions. If these two subsections, subsection (16) (1) and subsection (18) (1) grant me the powers to delegate the basis on which this must take place, it can take place in a manner agreed upon without there being any danger of the abuse of this system.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when in the past a school committee requested applications for teaching posts the principal or the committee was empowered to notify the applicant telegraphically that he had been recommended for an appointment subject to the approval of the department. As far as my knowledge goes this is still the custom in the provincial schools; in fact, I spoke to the Cape Director of Education and he said that in the Cape it is the custom that when a school committee makes a recommendation it has the right to notify that applicant that he has been recommended for appointment subject to the approval of the department. I also have it here in writing as it appeared in the <i>Education Gazette</i> that is regularly given to teachers. Now there is a problem, however, i.e. that this cannot be done in schools that fall under the Minister&#x2019;s department. When a governing body recommends someone for an appointment, they do not have the right to notify that person that he has in fact been recommended but that this still has to be approved by the Minister. Since the provincial schools have that right, I wondered whether the Minister could not give that right to his schools as well. I wondered whether he could not also allow the executive committee to inform the successful applicant that he is being recommended for appointment, subject to the Minister&#x2019;s approval. If that is not done the following problem can crop up: A teacher applies for two or three posts, and because he himself is anxious to know what has happened, he would willingly accept the first post allocated to him. Since many of these schools&#x2014;and I am thinking particularly of the School for the Blind and the School for the Deaf at Worcester&#x2014;frequently struggle to get staff, particularly for promotion posts, these schools will perhaps be placed in a disadvantageous position. I wondered whether the hon. the Minister could perhaps give me some clarity in that connection.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think that fundamentally there is quite a lot in what the hon. member for Worcester said. But the hon. member must take into account the various procedures that are still valid under various departments. Not even all the provincial departments function in this way. There are some of the provincial education departments that have so-called selection committees. These selection committees select certain applicants for a post and leave it to the controlling body to appoint any of those approved. In that case there are no problems if one informs the applicant directly that he has been appointed. In my department&#x2019;s circumstances this unfortunately does not apply and we stick to the arrangement that it is more sensible to make sure that such an applicant will in fact obtain the post before the controlling body notifies him that he is being recommended. The hon. member will understand that this is a practical consideration. It creates a great deal of embarrassment for the controlling body, and also for the applicant, if the latter is notified that he has been recommended for appointment to the post and then does not obtain the appointment for some or other reason. That is why we have this difference.</p>

<heading>AGE OF MAJORITY BILL</heading>

<summary>(Committee Stage)</summary>

<p>Clause 2 :</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, during the Second Reading debate the hon. the Minister indicated that he was going to <span class="col_4465-4466" refersTo="page_0695"/>elaborate on this clause in the Committee Stage because, on account of time, he could not do so during the Second Reading. I should just like to pose a few questions in brief to the hon. the Minister. The first one is: What does the hon. the Minister have in mind as to the basis or the grounds upon which a court should decide that somebody of 18 years of age or more is entitled to be declared a major&#x003F;</p>

<p>That brings me to the second point, namely whether it is necessary to have the lengthy and complicated procedure laid down for an application to court. I cannot deal with this in detail, but clause 2 of this Bill lays down that there can be an application to court for an order declaring the applicant to be a major. Parents can apply to have their child declared to be a major. What is the yardstick&#x003F; I can imagine that if the parents themselves or the guardians of the minor were agreeable that that child should be declared a major, it would in fact be sufficient reason for the courts to grant the application. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister could tell me whether this procedure and matters incidental to the procedure laid down in connection with that application have in fact been laid before the Association of Law Societies and before the Bar Councils for their comments&#x003F;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am sorry I did not have the opportunity of giving a more detailed explanation of the provisions of this very interesting Bill to this House yesterday. As hon. members know, that was at a stage when time unfortunately did not permit me to do so, and consequently I promised the hon. members that, I would if necessary, mention certain matters in the Committee Stage. The hon. member for Green Point has given me the opportunity of mentioning a few of these matters under clause 2. I think I must first give a brief explanation of the procedure&#x2014;this is one of the things I completely omitted from my speech yesterday&#x2014;which will be followed in the case of an application to declare a minor to be a major at the age of 18 years. I think I should read out to hon. members the section which relates to this and which I would have read out had I had the opportunity. This will cover the position generally. The procedure is actually laid down in clause 3, but it is also relevant in respect of clause 2. The procedure lays down that the application shall be in the form of a notice of motion addressed to the registrar of the department concerned of the Supreme Court of South Africa. Clause 3 also lays down what particulars will be stated in the application. In this respect I should like to draw attention to the fact that the applicant must indicate whether his application is supported by his parents. If so, he must submit an affidavit by his parents or his guardian to that effect. The applicant must also furnish particulars of immovable property of which he is or probably will become the owner. This is an important point which, to a certain extent, also covers one of the questions put yesterday by the hon. member for Green Point. In terms of the Bill, if the applicant is the owner of movable or immovable property which is subject to the provisions for the Administration of Estates Act of 1965, he must send a copy of his application to the Master of the Supreme Court, who has jurisdiction. The Master of the Supreme Court must then report to the court on the application. After the court has considered the application and the report of the Master of the Supreme Court and any objections which there may be to the application, it may grant or refuse the application or give a decision in its discretion. For example, the court may direct that further evidence be submitted to it. In a later section of the Bill another part of the procedure is dealt with, and that section provides that any person to whom an order declaring him to be a major is granted&#x2014;and this is an important point&#x2014;shall for all purposes be deemed to have attained the age of majority. Such a person has full legal competence. I think this will cover one of the important questions put by the hon. member under another clause. This in itself covers the two questions put by the hon. member.</p>

<p>&#x2020;He mentioned the possibility of a father who has two sons, the one being 19 years of age and the other 18 and that he wants to give them part of his business at an early stage. These two boys are then made majors in terms of this Bill and the hon. member said that this in itself could open a way to obtain, as he put it, income tax benefits. He quoted the case of these three businessmen and said that the fees could then be divided amongst the three of them and that their taxable income would then naturally be reduced considerably.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the only reply I can give in this particular instance is that I think one must accept that the courts, who will have the full jurisdiction in these matters <span class="col_4467-4468" refersTo="page_0696"/>in future, will be in the position to analyse the situation as it will have to be put to them in these three different documents which are mentioned in the Bill itself. The hon. member will remember that I mentioned two of these documents. Today I mentioned a third, namely a procedural document, which will have to be submitted to the court and into which the court will then have insight before passing judgment, it would be most unusual, to put it mildly, if a court were to decide, in spite of the particulars submitted to it, to grant majority, for example, to these two boys of eighteen and nineteen years; in other words, to enable them to share in the dividends which accrue to the particular business. I may say that in the 63 years that courts in the Free State have been in the position to deal with these cases, there were only 21 cases in which a request was made for a minor to become a major at the age of 18. We do not therefore envisage a large number of cases being brought before the four courts in South Africa after this Bill has been, placed on the Statute Book.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point asked what effect this legislation would have on trusts and testamentary dispositions executed prior to the granting of the order of the court, in which a trustee did not take the precaution of saying that it would be at the age of 18 &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; or rather 21 years. In other words, where he did not mention the age of the beneficiary at all. Here again F can only repeat the general reply which I gave to the hon member: I believe a court will be in a position, after the documents have been submitted to it&#x2014;documents with all the relevant particulars concerning the testament and the movable and immovable property over which the child has control&#x2014;to judge whether the &#x201C;majority&#x201D; ruling should be given in respect of the age of 18. The reply is simply, as far as I can see, that the court will not be easily satisfied. I cannot see any of our four courts being satisfied by a submission to them in which these details are not set out in such a way that they can come to a conclusion which is not based on fact. Somebody said to me this morning that it would be quite easy to succeed if you were to try to falsify a document submitted to the court; but I do not think that this will be the case. It should be possible, with the three documents that have to be submitted to the court, for it to deal with the matter effectively.</p>

<p>One point which the hon. member for Green Point mentioned remains, namely the question of whether the matter has been or will be submitted to the law societies in the various provinces. This is a matter which can be looked into. I have no definite opinion about this, and would not like to give a final reply to the question today. If we do find that it is necessary, and provided there are matters of procedure that have not been investigated sufficiently, and that the law societies would like to have a look at them, I personally see no reason why it should not be done. It is so, however, that the provincial divisions of the courts all have had an opportunity of studying this Bill. It was referred to all the Judges President in the four provinces and to the Appeal Court, and they have all agreed to the provisions of the Bill. I hope I have dealt with the various points raised by hon. members.</p>

<heading>COLOURED PERSONS IN SOUTHWEST AFRICA EDUCATION BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_coloured_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>It is the object of the Government to afford the people of South-West Africa full opportunities for development. An obvious way of doing this is to create opportunities for meeting the educational requirements of the different population groups.</p>

<p>As you know, Sir, my department controls the education of the Coloured persons, the Rehoboth Basters and the Namas in South-West Africa. Up to the present, control over the education of these three groups has been exercised by means of the Education Ordinance of South-West Africa, 1962, in terms of the provisions of the South-West Africa Affairs Act, 1969. The education authority of South-West Africa <span class="col_4469-4470" refersTo="page_0697"/>has had the difficult task of formulating, within the scope of one ordinance, a system of education which had to meet the needs of the different population groups. In order to meet the educational needs of the aforesaid population groups, each according to its own needs and with a view to the cultural-anthropological features of each ethnic group, it is now my intention to introduce separate Bills, of which this is the first, one for each population group. You will find that for the most part the general principles in the three Bills agree, but that there are differences aimed at meeting the particular needs of each group.</p>

<p>As far as the general aspects of policy are concerned, these principles will consequently apply to the Basters of Rehoboth and to the Namas as well. Such matters which relate more specifically to the latter population groups will be dealt with when the Bills in questions are introduced.</p>

<p>To be successful education methods have to be adapted to serve the pupil and the community, and as we all know, the population of South-West Africa consists not of one community only, but of different communities, which differ each from the other. These circumstances inevitably exclude the possibility of a uniform system of education. Consequently the policy being adopted is to provide each community with its own schools. Experience has shown that the education of an ethnic group only comes into its own when it develops within the framework of a distinctive educational system.</p>

<p>Since this is the first opportunity the House has been afforded of considering the matter of education in South-West Africa, I think that it is necessary to refer to the origins and development of education in this territory.</p>

<p><i>Historical background&#x2014;The first mission schools</i></p>

<p>I come now to the historical background, and the first mission schools. In the vast majority of cases mission societies were responsible for the first educational facilities in the developing countries of Africa. In South-West Africa this process began in the year 1805, when the first missionaries settled at Warmbad, north of the Orange River. The Wesleyan and Rhenish Societies opened the first schools there. In the initial stages these organizations concentrated for the, most part on spreading the gospel. However, literacy was essential to enable their converts to read the Bible and the hymn book. In this way the first White missionaries also emerged as the first teachers in the territory. In 1866 the Rhenish Mission Society established the first special school for the elementary training of teachers at Otjimbingwe, to the north-west of Windhoek, and in 1870 a school for Baster children was established in Rehoboth.</p>

<p>With the take-over of the territory in 1915 by the South African military authorities there was a total of 115 schools for all population groups within the territory. In 1921, after the commencement of the mandate, a department of education was established. However, the local administration of mission schools was still under the authority of the mission societies and at that stage they received subsidies from the State. For the first time the State acquired a measure of control over schools in regard to the syllabi, the school year, school hours and the right to inspect schools.</p>

<p>In 1923 delegates of the State and Mission Societies held talks on the future development of non-White education. Since then educational services for the latter have developed rapidly. Between the years 1920 and 1926 more mission societies concentrated on education. The South-West Africa Constitution Act of 1925 entrusted education services to the South-West Africa Administration, which were regulated by proclamation No. 16 of 1926. The Proclamation classified mission schools into two groups&#x2014;for Coloureds and Natives respectively. During the period of the administration of education under the authority of the South African Government, consistent progress was made with the establishment of education facilities. Various factors retarded progress, factors such as the disruption caused by prolonged droughts, the 1930 depression and Second World War. Nevertheless, a sound foundation was laid which made the rapid progress in more recent years possible. Since 1950 the entire matter of education in the Territory has been thoroughly investigated by various commissions of inquiry, among which the 1958 commission deserves particular mention, and the recommendations of which led to considerable development.</p>

<p>Allow me to convey to the Administration of South-West Africa great appreciation for the exceptional contribution they have made in the field of education, and to thank them for it. I should also like to <span class="col_4471-4472" refersTo="page_0698"/>convey gratitude and appreciation to the different church societies for their contributions. I can refer only with the highest praise to all the parties concerned for what has been done in the interests of the non-White communities. I hope that they will in future, too, display the same interest in this major and important task and that there will, as is at present the case, be the most cordial co-operation between them and my department.</p>

<p><i>The present position as against the previous position, according to certain statistical data</i></p>

<p>That the Coloureds, i.e. the Coloured persons and Basters, have become educationconscious, is true. In 1931 there were seven schools for this group, with a total pupil attendance of 445. Between the years 1955, when there were 3 240 pupils at school, and 1966, the attendance figures increased to 9 402. In the same period the number of teachers increased from 142 to 346. According to this there were in the years 1931, 1955 and 1966, respectively, an average of 66, 90 and 177 pupils per school. The number of schools had increased in the meantime to 53 in 1966. Five years later there were, for the groups under discussion, 13 062 pupils attending schools. The total pupil attendance for all three of these population groups under the dispensation of my department amounted to 20 174 in 1971.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The majority are, of course, Coloured teachers, because we have a quite considerable shortage of teachers from the Nama and Baster ethnic groups. We use Coloured teachers there as well. But I shall obtain the figures for 1971, and furnish them to the hon. member during the Committee Stage whilst dealing with a suitable clause, or even prior to that.</p>

<p>As far as the expenditure during the above-mentioned periods is concerned, I can inform the House that in 1931 it was R18, in 1966 R72 and in 1971 R81 per pupil. This figure comprises only the current expenditure, since capital expenditure for the erection of buildings is paid out of funds from the Department of Public Works.</p>

<p><i>The establishment of State Educational Institutions</i></p>

<p>The Bill which is now before the House provides the necessary machinery for the expansion in due course of all the facets of a developed and full-fledged system of education. Apart from the ordinary schools from Sub A up to Std. 10 provision is being made for the establishment of vocational schools, special schools and homes, and even nursery schools. For post-school training the establishment of training institutions is being made possible, and for adults, opportunities for self-development by means of part-time training. The generally tried and accepted educational principles are embodied in the Bill. The only aim is the furtherance of the interests of the child and, through the child, the community as a whole.</p>

<p><i>State-aided schools</i></p>

<p>The Bill makes provision for the continued existence of church schools on the same conditions as apply at present. The principle of control over State-aided institutions by managers is being retained. When the State recognizes the establishment or continuation of such institutions, the State may render financial assistance by way of grants-in-aid and loans. If, owing to specific circumstances, the take-over of a State-aided educational institution by the State becomes necessary, this will happen after consultation with the management of the institution in question so that an agreement may be reached in regard to the conditions according to which the take-over occurs.</p>

<p><i>Compulsory school attendance</i></p>

<p>Provision is being made for the introduction of compulsory school attendance. This, however, will only be possible if it is deemed that the need for it exists, and that <span class="col_4473-4474" refersTo="page_0699"/>the time for it is ripe. It must be realized that there will have to be adequate facilities and teachers to make the introduction of compulsory school attendance possible.</p>

<p><i>Financial assistance to pupils and students</i></p>

<p>Depending upon the general or individual requirements, financial and material assistance may be made available to the pupils, as well as to the students attending colleges and universities in the Republic. Those attending hostels who are unable to pay boarding fees in full or in part may receive support from the State, depending upon the financial position.</p>

<p><i>Establishment of boards and committees</i></p>

<p>Not only is the furtherance of the best interests of the child being sought, but the Bill also recognizes the legitimate say and share of parents in the education of their children. It is the intention of my department, after the commencement of this Act, to establish school committees so that a parental say in the school system may be effected. In addition to this, parents will also be involved in other boards and committees which are intended to exercise control over educational institutions. Provision is also being made for the establishment of a regional education council. In broad outline the functions of such a council are the same as those of a school board. The intention is not to establish it at an early stage, but to afford the community an opportunity of adapting to the responsibilities of the management of education first.</p>

<p><i>Academic standards and inspectorate</i></p>

<p>The training of pupils in South-West Africa is already being measured by the standards of the Matriculation Board, so that the quality of training should keep pace with the requirements which apply to all other population groups. The syllabi are therefore geared to meeting the ordinary examination requirements. The department has at its disposal an inspectorate which provides the necessary information and generally keeps watch over the application of the syllabi.</p>

<p><i>Conditions of service of teachers and other staff</i></p>

<p>The salaries of all teachers, attached to State as well as State-aided schools, are paid by the department. This position is being specified in the Bill so that it ensures the safeguarding of the position of the teachers. All actions for the benefit of, or steps taken against teachers, are being specified, and the rights of teachers as well as the powers of the authority are being set out. In clause 11 provision is being expressly made for the transitional stage from retention of service in terms of the Education Ordinance 1962, to employment in terms of the envisaged Act. As far as staff pension privileges are concerned, the position is already being regulated in terms of the Provincial and the Territory Service Pension Act, 1969. Clause 14 of the Bill provides for the retention of the pension privileges of persons, as exercised with reference to the provisions of the aforesaid Pensions Act, so that in this connection as well no person will be prejudiced in any way.</p>

<p><i>Staff Associations</i></p>

<p>My department already accords recognition to the Coloured Persons Education Association in South-West Africa. The establishment cf such associations is now being accorded statutory recognition on ministerial authority. I am of the opinion that this method of recognition will ensure the continuation of fruitful negotiations between my department and the aforesaid association.</p>

<p><i>Membership of teachers on bodies and organizations</i></p>

<p>As is understandable, teachers play a leading part in the affairs of the community as a whole, and it is expected that appeals will from time to time be made on teachers to serve in some or other capacity on bodies such as local authorities, hospital boards or statutory committees. It is being provided in the Bill that such membership shall be subject to ministerial approval. The object here is to protect the interests of education, as well as those of the individual teacher. If it should appear that a teacher&#x2019;s involvement with such an organization has a prejudicial effect on his duties, or that this organization is coming into conflict with the interests of the authorities, the Department will be forced to direct him to relinquish his membership, or to refrain from allowing himself to be drawn into the dispute.</p>

<p>Membership of party-political organizations is not being prohibited, although active <span class="col_4475-4476" refersTo="page_0700"/>participation which could have a prejudicial effect on education will not be allowed. The Minister is being given the authority to prohibit membership of organizations which have subversive activities as their object.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to assure the House that the importance of education is fully realized and that an attempt will be made to maintain the existing high standards of education, and to continue to build on those foundations. The main object will at all times be to further the interests of the child. I trust that the various provisions of the Bill will contribute to this.</p>

<p>I wish to speak on the motion, Sir. The hon. the Leader of the House has spoken on the motion. I wish to follow and speak on the motion in regard to the adjournment of the House. The hon. the Leader of the House said that this was a matter of co-operation. He said he made an agreement with the Chief Whip on this side in a spirit of co-operation and that this side of the House now was not prepared to carry on in that spirit of co-operation. That is an accusation which comes very badly in his mouth. These agreements between the Government side and the Opposition are agreements which are binding in honour as between party and party. They are not in accordance with the rules of the House or the rules of Parliament. There are no rules dealing with these matters. It is a matter of good faith. The hon. the Leader of the House is aware of the fact that the Chief Whip with whom he made the agreement on this side, had left the precincts of Parliament when he phoned the hon. member for North Rand at 2.10 p.m. When he told him that in order to stop the business of the House before we reach Order No. 7, it would be necessary to take the previous Bills in items 4, 5 and 6 through all their stages, he knew that that could not be referred to the man who made the agreement with him, the Chief Whip on this side of the House, Mr. Hopewell. He knew he was not here. When the hon. member for North Rand spoke to him on the telephone in reply to his statement : I will refer the matter to the Chief Whip at once, the hon. the Leader of the House said that the Chief Whip was not here and that he had already left. He was therefore aware of the fact that Mr. Hopewell had gone. He therefore came with this suggestion after he knew that the Chief Whip on this side of the House had already left. The hon. member for North Rand then said he would refer to the Whip on duty, which he did at 10 past two just before the bells were going. The hon. the Minister talks about co-operation, but is that the kind of co-operation we are to expect from the Leader of the House and <span class="col_4477-4478" refersTo="page_0701"/>the Government side in matters of this kind&#x003F; In matters of this kind a man&#x2019;s word is his pledge and it is the bond which binds him.</p>

<p>I am very well informed indeed on what I am talking about and if the Leader of the House will say that it was not 10 past two when he spoke to the member for North Rand, and that he was not aware that Mr. Hopewell had already left, I want that denial to come from him because he made the agreement with the Chief Whip on this side of the House, Mr. Hopewell, and he knew when he phoned the member for North Rand that Mr. Hopewell had already left. If it was in terms of the agreement with Mr. Hopewell, why did he phone the member for North Rand at 10 past two&#x003F; There was no need for him to phone anybody if it was in terms of the agreement he has made with Mr. Hopewell. He phoned the member for North Rand at 10 past two when he knew Mr. Hopewell had gone, because he knew it was not in terms of the agreement with them. That is why he phoned, and that is why he tried to get the arrangements changed at that late hour. I say this is a shocking thing and it stands ill against the name of the hon. Leader of the House that he at this late hour should come with an attempt to try and vary the agreement which he arrived at with Mr. Hopewell as soon as Mr. Hopewell has left the precincts of Parliament. I hope, therefore, that the House will accept the motion of the hon. member for Pinelands and that the debate will stand adjourned.</p>

<p>One of the difficulties we have is that the hon. member for Pinetown, who is the Chief Whip on this side of the House, is at the moment on an aeroplane &#x2026; Actually I think he is no longer on an aeroplane; he is probably in Durban at the moment. If there was an <span class="col_4479-4480" refersTo="page_0702"/>agreement, and it is now suggested that there was an agreement in relation to the adjournment of this House and the business to be discussed here and the manner in which it would be discussed, and if the hon. Leader of the House had perhaps misunderstood what the hon. member for Pinetown had said, I am sure the hon. Leader of the House would be prepared to honour that if that was the agreement. I am sure the hon. Leader of the House would agree that he would if there was in fact such an agreement. Obviously there has been confusion about the agreement on the part of the hon. Leader of the House, to put it at its highest or lowest, whichever way he likes it.</p>

<p>I am sure that the hon. Leader of the House, more than anyone else, would, in the interest of the House, not want this matter to be the subject of debate across the floor of this House if there is the possibility, only the possibility, that there was an agreement and the hon. Leader of the House has misunderstood it. I am not a party to this agreement, or to whatever arrangements had been made; I do not know what the arrangement was. But quite apart from that, we here have a Bill which, as you will see, Mr. Speaker, is 37 pages long. The purport of the Bill is a very important one. We received this Bill last Monday. I do not know anything about this agreement, but it does seem to me that someone else does know something about an agreement. I will now resume my seat so that this matter can be resumed by someone who has more information about the agreement than I have.</p>

<p>It does not matter to whom the hon. the Minister spoke about the Order Paper. The hon. the Minister told this House just now that he had made no arrangements with Mr. Hopewell with regard to today&#x2019;s Order Paper. Here I have a letter in his own handwriting to the hon. member for Pinelands in which the Minister says that he did arrange with Hopewell. Mr. Hopewell in fact reported to the Leader of the Opposition and to us that he had arranged with the hon. the Leader of the House that we would go as far as Order No. 6. That is what he reported to us. This is confirmation of the arrangement. I submit that the hon. the Leader of the House had not been fair with us on this side of the House, in trying to pretend that he has made no such agreement. I suggest that he did make an agreement and that he has gone back on that agreement. I appeal to him now to stand by that agreement because, unless we can get agreement between</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, on a point of explanation, may I point out that the agreement I made with Mr. Hopewell yesterday was in regard to yesterday&#x2019;s Order Paper, namely that if we deal with those matters and get them off the Order Paper, I will allow these particular Bills to stand over until after the recess. I phoned Mr. Bronkhorst at 2 o&#x2019;clock this afternoon and told him that if we could take all the stages and get these matters off the Order Paper, I was prepared to leave these Bills over. That is what I told Bronkhorst. I told him that if we could take all these stages of the Bills from one to six today, I was prepared to leave them over. That is what I told him. He said that he would discuss it with Mr. Hopewell. I then told him that Mr. Hopewell had told me that he was leaving and that he would not be here. That was the arrangement this afternoon. Mr. Bronkhorst came to me and told me that they would object to the taking of the Third Reading of one particular Bill, namely the Rents Amendment Bill. Instead of objecting to the Third Reading of the Rents Amendment Bill, hon. members opposite all objected to the Third Reading of the next Bill on the Order Paper. Therefore, if hon. members opposite cannot co-operate, I am not prepared to cooperate and we must carry on with the business.</p>

We dealt with the Report Stage and the Third Reading. The hon. the Leader of the House has just stated that we breached the agreement by objecting to the Third reading of the Rents Amendment Bill. I submit that we did not object to the Third Reading of the Rents Amendment Bill, that in fact the Third reading was taken and passed. Similarly, we took the next Order.

<p>The hon. the Leader of the House gave us as reason for his refusal to accept the adjournment that we had breached the agreement, in that we opposed the Rents Amendment Bill and the Church Square, Pretoria, Development Bill, when in fact we did not oppose them. May I then ask what we are arguing about&#x003F; The reason just given by the Leader of the House a moment ago was that we had opposed these two Bills. We did not in fact oppose the Bills which the hon. the Leader of the House says we opposed. I submit that there has been no breach of agreement.

<p>Mr. Speaker, I submit that the hon. member for Durban North is quite right. This is a decision for the House to take. I wish to point out to the House that the explanation of the hon. the Leader of the House is quite unsatisfactory. The hon. member for Transkei drew to the attention of the hon. the Leader of the House the fact that there had been an agreement between him and the Chief Whip on this side of the House and he produced a note in the handwriting of the Leader of the House to substantiate this. The hon. the Leader of the House then got up allegedly to reply and did not even refer to this note. He did not dispute the fact that he had given this note, and the note is quite clear as to what the agreement was. In view of this I would again like to appeal to the Leader of the House to reconsider his attitude in the interests of the smooth working of this House, because if one cannot rely on agreements made between the Chief Whip and the Leader of the House, then it is impossible to see how this House can function properly.</p>

<p>On the motion before the House. I want to refer to the fact that the hon. Leader of the House is a parliamentarian of considerable experience in this House. He has been here for many years and he is the Leader of the House. In fact he was well aware&#x2014;if one looks at the merits of the matter which is before the House at the present moment &#x2014;that we on this side of the House had moved an amendment to the Second Reading of the Bill under item 4 on the Order Paper, &#x201C;that this Bill be read today six months&#x201D;. Sir, I am sure that you, with your vast experience, as well, would have regarded it as extremely unlikely, in fact as an unreasonable request to make to the Opposition which has moved such an amendment at the Second Reading, that they should concede a stage of that Bill. I wish to say to the hon. the Minister&#x2014; unfortunately he is busy at the moment &#x2014;that I can only assume that there must have been some grave misunderstanding if he believes that we would concede a Third Reading of a Bill, to the Second Reading of which we moved an amendment that it be read this day six months.

<summary>(Second Reading resumed)</summary>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there was a keynote to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Budget speech&#x2014;to give direction and impetus to the national drive for a more prosperous South Africa. I believe that for this objective to have significance, there are a number of prerequisites&#x2014;the removal of uncertainty from the economy, the restoration of confidence and the closing of the psychological barrier that is stultifying economic growth. But when considered, Press comment on the Budget&#x2014;I am not talking about first-flush comment&#x2014;centres around such headlines as &#x201C;the &#x2018;Yes, but&#x2019; Budget&#x201D;, &#x201C;the &#x2018;No-event&#x2019; Budget&#x201D;, &#x201C;much ado about nothing&#x201D;, &#x201C;the &#x2018;Camouflage&#x2019; Budget&#x201D;, the Budget that offers hope but without conviction&#x201D;, &#x201C;Labour concessions little more than a myth&#x201D;, &#x201C;Dr. D.&#x2019;s gamble&#x201D;, then clearly these prerequisites have not been met. And when yesterday, Sir, we read &#x201C;Bring Jan Haak terug&#x201D; &#x2026; [Interjections.] If what <i>Rapport</i> says is correct, then one of the most influential sectors of our business community has told the Government exactly what it thinks of the Budget. It uses King Henry VIII&#x2019;s &#x201C;words, no deeds&#x201D;. The grand design that we were told by the hon. the Minister to wait for in the Budget, has just not materialized. The Budget speech contributes little that is clear-cut and explicit to a properly motivated forward economic surge. Of course, there is much that it acknowledges: It acknowledges that the economic, monetary and fiscal policies of the Government have been wrong; it acknowledges that Government policies have been the basic cause of the down-turn in the economy; it acknowledges that the policies of the Opposition have been right; it acknowledges that the economy can no longer tolerate the illusions of this Government; and it acknowledges a need for a retreat from apartheid.</p>

<p>There are indications in the Budget that at long last the Government is coming in from out of the dark, but only by a few faltering steps. Proposed modifications to policy are so hedged in by &#x201C;ifs&#x201D; and &#x201C;buts&#x201D; that they fail to give the direction and impetus for a more prosperous South Africa that the hon. the Minister is looking for. All one sees is that the Government, economically tightly caught in its own whirlpool, is ineffectively splashing around, achieving attention more than giving stimulus. I therefore move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House declines to pass the Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill because the Government has failed, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) adequately to reduce the high tax burden;</li>

<li>(b) to remove the numerous Government controls retarding economic growth or to provide South Africa with a bold, dynamic, clear-cut plan for sustained optimum economic development; and</li>

<li>(c) to make adequate provision for the welfare, prosperity and security of our people.&#x201D;.</li></ol>

<p>If you study the Budget, and particularly the figures, and you study the statistical survey that accompanies the Budget, the urgent need for a comprehensive blue print for the economy is very obvious, because what do these figures indicate&#x003F; The average annual growth rate in real terms increased during 1971 by only 3,7 per cent, compared with 4,8 per cent for 1970 and 5,3 per cent for the five years from 1966 to 1971. This figure is even less than the 4 per cent given by the hon. the Minister and far less than the target figure for the average development wanted by the economic development programme. The real gross domestic product on a <i>per capita</i> basis, which some gentlemen on the other side had quite a lot to say about when we discussed this matter previously, rose by only 1 per cent. This compares with an increase of 2,1 per cent for 1970 and 2,6 per cent for the five years from 1966 to 1971. The seasonally adjusted consumer price index rose by 7 per cent during 1971, compared with an increase of 4,2 per cent the previous year. These are the figures that are given on page 24 of the statistical statement. They indicate the changes which took place between December, 1970, and December, 1971. During that period the increase was 7 per cent. The hon. the Minister in this somewhat smoke <span class="col_4487-4488" refersTo="page_0707"/>screen of a Budget gave a figure of 5,7 per cent for this increase. This, of course, is the average increase for 1971 over the average increase for 1970. It is a lower figure, but not of much interest to anybody.</p>

<p>The balance of payments account sustained a record deficit of R1 005 million, compared with R843 million during the previous year, and, as we all know, there was a sharp drop in our gold and foreign exchange reserves. For the tax year 1971-&#x2019;72 there is a deficit of R130,7 million compared with the original estimate. I gave the figure of R91 million when I last spoke on this matter, but to that figure I have to add R39,7 million, transferred back from Loan Account to Revenue Account. What is interesting, Sir, is that the deficit took place despite the imposition of additional taxes last year, amounting to no less than R152 million&#x2014;not loan levies, but taxes. If the hon. the Minister had drawn up his 1972-&#x2019;73 Budget on a comparable basis to that on which he drew up his 1971-&#x2019;72 Budget, he would have budgeted for a revenue deficit not of R137,3 million, but for a deficit of R242,9 million, because we have to add to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s figure the transfer of transfer duties of R45 million, loan levies which have been done away with, and the income tax which is substituted to the extent of 2&#x00BD; per cent on company tax, amounting to R14,5 million, and 5 per cent on individual taxes, amounting to R46,1 million. These amounts last year went to the credit of the Loan Account; they will now go to Revenue Account, because the hon. the Minister has to bolster up his revenue. What is significant is that this deficit budgeting is not being done as a result of a reduction in taxation or of a larger than usual increase in the rate of Government spending. In fact, it is just the contrary; there is an overall increase in taxation and a substantial decrease in the rate of Government spending, and we still have this enormous deficit. Here you have the picture of the state of the economy; here are the real reasons for the tighter import control and for devaluation, and it is no good hon. gentlemen on the other side blaming all this on events overseas. These events might have been contributory, but certainly nothing more than that. Sir, the hon. the Minister admitted in the Other Place that the past year had been one of the most difficult years in recent times. This is certainly borne out by the Budget, where he has had to rely heavily on his reserves. He has reduced his 1971-&#x2019;72 deficit on Revenue Account by using the full balance of accumulated surpluses on this account amounting to R72,5 million, and by then transferring R39,7 million back from Loan Account to Revenue Account. To balance his 1972-73 Revenue Account he has transferred income that previously went to Loan Account, as I said, over to Revenue Account, to the extent of R105,6 million, and he has taken R140 million from the balance of R 160,1 million that he still has in his Stabilization Account. Where do we end up, Mr. Speaker&#x003F; He will have a small balance of R2,7 million on his Revenue Account, but his Stabilization Account will have been reduced to R21,5 million. Our cupboard is almost bare. What is interesting is that these moves from Loan Account to Revenue Account are a complete reversal of what we have had in previous budgets, a complete change in policy. Before we used to transfer from revenue to capital, and now we are transferring from capital to revenue.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister obviously misread the economic signs. He was not prepared to accept that there was going to be, or was, a down-turn in the economy and he would not accept that his income would as a result be less than his estimates. He castigated, with bell, book and candle, everybody who differed from him, but it took his own Budget to bring home to the Minister the real state of the economy, because it is there in the Budget for all to see. His strategy for 1972-73 has got to be within the framework of what happened in 1971-72. One would have thought that the hon. the Minister was in the best position to assess the financial implications for 1972-73 and what 1972-73 was going to bring. After all, he has the full machinery of the State at his disposal; he has close contacts with informed opinion abroad, but he tells us that he does not know what the position is going to be for 1972-73. He tells us that he finds it difficult to estimate revenue because of the uncertainties involved. He has difficulty in estimating customs, excise and sales duties, so he pitches his Estimates the same as in 1971-72. He tells us that inland revenue is equally difficult to estimate, so he plans an increase of 7 per cent above the 1971-72 figure, but because he is completely unsure of his own figure, he immediately covers himself and says, &#x201C;Perhaps I am erring slightly on the conservative side.&#x201D; Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister misjudged the economic events of 1971-72. He is uncertain of the pattern of events for <span class="col_4489-4490" refersTo="page_0708"/>1972-73, so he has decided on a gamble, and he is aided and abetted by the hon. the Minister of Transport and the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. He, like the hon. the Minister of Railways, has committed all his reserves in the hope that he can bring about an upturn in the economy. He has got a good base to work from; we grant him that; he has tightened import control and he has devalued, but it is his subsequent moves which are all-important. Any real hope of a vigorous programme to promote the growth of the economy faded immediately with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s preamble to his own Budget speech, because what did he say&#x003F; He wanted the highest growth rate compatible with our available resources&#x2014;and the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s ideas of available resources and ours are entirely different&#x2014;and &#x201C;within the particular social and economic structure of the South African community&#x201D;. Mr. Speaker, it is this very restrictive Nationalist thinking that has held back our industrial development over the years. It is the point of view that provides the background to what the hon. the Minister calls his programme of action. Let us take a look at this programme of action. The credit ceilings of the banks have been raised by some R140 million. This, I am told, merely gives legal recognition to the existing position. Most of the banks are already so much above ceiling that the R140 million really means very little. We want to see, as does the hon. the Minister, as quickly as possible the change-over to the use of variable liquid assets and cash reserve requirements. On interest rates the hon. the Minister has panicked. This return to the controls that we had in 1955-&#x2019;56 and during the gentlemen&#x2019;s agreement, so-called, between the banks and the building societies and the Reserve Bank during 1969 and 1970 is again going to cause distortions in the capital market. It will be the death-knell of participation bonds and will give a fillip to the grey market.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. the Minister has also left a number of important questions unanswered. If there is a serious decline in funds flowing to participation bonds, what will be the position of existing bonds if the present participants seek more remunerative investments for their funds, which in the main are for a three-year term, and withdraw them from these participation bonds&#x003F; What will happen to the existing bonds&#x003F; Where will the funds come from in future to finance industrial and flat building&#x003F; Thirdly, in the over-all context of the Budget, does the hon. the Minister believe that the re-imposition of fixed interest rates is a good thing&#x003F; Surely the stimulation of the economy and the pegging of interest rates are a very strange mix. We share the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s concern that adequate funds should be available for the building societies so that homes can be built for our people, but we have said before, and I say again, that we believe that the correct way to deal with the matter is to allow interest paid on mortgage bonds on homes to be tax-deductible. If that should happen, then perhaps we could even tolerate a slight increase in building society rates, because at least the interest will come off tax.</p>

<p>Foreign borrowing by private firms has been eased, but it is still subject to control, and in any case the hon. the Minister knows that the recommendations he has made have actually been in operation since August of last year.</p>

<p>The home owners&#x2019; saving scheme we welcome, particularly since I recommended it to the hon. the Minister of Community Development on the 16th August, 1970. To refresh his memory, I refer him to Hansard, Volume 30, col. 4318. Hon. gentlemen opposite will remember the challenge I made to them to point out one single good thing in this Budget that has not been asked for by this side of the House. We are going to listen very carefully to hear what they say. With regard to this home ownership scheme, we would, however, like to see it wider-based so as to include higher income groups and somewhat more costly homes.</p>

<p>On wages and price control and import control the hon. the Minister really contributes very little. He is as elusive as ever. We still have no clarity on these issues, but we canvassed them very fully in earlier debates, and no doubt other members will again deal with them in this debate.</p>

<p>Then we have the suspension of building control and we welcome this. Of course, Sir, the shortage of building work on offer at present has just about suspended building control itself, and this is an indication of the economic state of the country. Nevertheless, we welcome it, because the formal suspension of building control will remove certain uncertainties that exist at present. We would, of course, have liked to see the control not suspended but abolished. This Government has a fixation about control. It believes that only the Government, and <span class="col_4491-4492" refersTo="page_0709"/>certainly not the private sector, should make the decisions; with what results we know only too well.</p>

<p>I now come to those major economic areas where the private sector hoped for sufficiently forceful action by the Government to show beyond any shadow of doubt that the Government was determined to stimulate the economy, subject to one very important condition: at the same time containing inflation within acceptable limits. Let us make it quite clear, Mr. Speaker; it is no good stimulating the economy unless you are going to be able to control inflation. Existing policies have led to a contraction in the economy developing, coupled with a steady rise in the rate of inflation. The targets of the economic development programme are not being met. Serious structural imbalances appear from time to time in the economy and the policy of curtailing consumption instead of increasing production has inhibited growth, has failed to provide maximum job opportunities and has brought about uncertainty and loss of confidence.</p>

<p>There were a number of essential issues which required to be changed. We needed, first of all, a sharp cut in Government expenditure. In this connection the hon. the Minister has done well. His cut-back is not only substantial but, equally important, he has learnt that a cut-back can be achieved. We needed a more realistic approach to industrial decentralization. The government believed that it could follow a policy of the big stick and of the carrot, and legislate to make things difficult for the industrialist in the existing complexes and at the same time offer him substantial inducements to move to the border areas or to the homelands. But what the Government failed to see was that unless you had a thriving and expanding economy in the established metropolitan areas, the private sector did not have the means nor did it have the will to venture into new industrial undertakings in the border areas or in the homelands. The Government also forgot, and it has to learn, that a slow-down in the economy means a drop in the income of the fiscus itself, and that in turn means the curtailment in homeland development.</p>

<p>Our policy has always been quite simple, i.e. develop the fast growing metropolitan economy and then, as the F.C.I. put it, use the spin-off from the urban areas to establish industries in the decentralized areas, and with it use White capital and White know-how and get away from all these clich&#x00E9;s with which we have lived during the past few years.</p>

<p>The major essential policy change that is required if we want to avoid excessive inflation, is an acceptable policy of greater labour utilization. You have to couple it with a vigorous training and re-training programme and you have to have a maximum intake of immigrants. The hon. the Minister has now included a labour policy in his programme of action. He offered concessions in the use of additional Bantu labour to permit, he said, greater use of unutilized productive capacity. He will consider an increase in the labour ratio of Bantu to Whites of 2,5 to one in Pretoria and the Witwatersrand-Vereeniging complex on the following basis: It would apply only to existing industries; it would be on a selective basis; it would apply only to multiple shifts; among other factos&#x2014;and he does not specify the other factors&#x2014;the availability of housing and transport would be taken into consideration. Sir, these so-called concessions in regard to labour mean very little to urban industry. There is still to be control at every turn. The Physical Planning Act is to remain unchanged. Job reservation stays. It is hardly a dynamic policy to give encouragement to the private sector; and there still remains the statement of the hon. the Minister of Transport, and I quote what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Section 77 of the Industrial Conciliation Act, even if it does not apply to a lot of industries at the moment, always hangs above the heads of the employers like a sword.</block>

<p>Sir, no employer is going into business with a sword hanging over his head, and this is the crisp point in the whole policy. The sword will still remain over the heads of employers. There is also the fact that a multiple shift requires more White supervisory labour. Where is this labour going to come from&#x003F; If any existing unused capacity is taken up, the White labour shortage is going to be worse than it ever was before. So, where are we going to get the labour to supervise multi-shifts&#x003F; Is it going to come from immigration&#x003F; It is true that the hon. the Minister did say that extracting the maximum benefit from <span class="col_4493-4494" refersTo="page_0710"/>immigration to strengthen our skilled labour force is called for. It is quite right; we go along with the hon. the Minister. What does my friend the hon. the Minister of Immigration say on this issue&#x003F; This is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He is ensuring that the language and religious pattern of the country are not disturbed by immigration.</block>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Maybe &#x201C;hear, hear&#x201D;, but if you want immigrants these are two seriously impeding factors towards immigration. We would like to know what the policy of the Government is. Is it the policy of the hon. the Minister of Finance or is it the policy of the hon. the Minister of Immigration&#x003F; They differed before; we know that. There is a difference of approach. We believe that we should encourage the maximum number of suitable immigrants that we can get. And &#x201C;suitable&#x201D; has very little to do with religion or language&#x2014;as long as they are honest and decent, hard-working people.</p>

<p>If the hon. the Minister had really known what his labour policy was going to do to the economy, then he could have been certain about his own Budget, but he did not know, and nobody knows. Everybody interprets it in a different way. The hon. the Minister himself does not know where this policy is going to take him.</p>

<p>A further need is the active development of an export policy based on an expanding home market and meaningful exporting incentives. The hon. the Minister has increased the exporting incentives quite considerably. But I find that they are complicated and that they are not generally understood by the business community. I think the hon. the Minister will agree that in the past they have not had a great impact on stimulating our exports. We would prefer to see a simple and easily-understood straight tax concessions on export profits, perhaps something along the lines of the American DISC (Domestic International Sales Corporation). There 50 per cent of export profits that are retained by an export company&#x2014;that is if they are not distributed&#x2014;can be free of tax. This is a meaningful something to a man who wants to export: knowing that he is going to save 50 per cent on his tax.</p>

<p>One of the main issues requiring change, of course, is the pattern of taxation. We have said it <i>ad nauseam</i> from this side of the House and the business community has done the same. We believe that the objective has got to be to reward work and investment and not to penalize it. The small additional concession given by the hon. the Minister to married working women accepts this principle but unfortunately it does too little to implement it. We would have liked to have seen a much more positive approach to the working married women. Unfortunately the hon. the Minister has evidently been influenced by his reading of Shakespeare. He has therefore now decided &#x201C;neither a borrower nor a lender be&#x201D;. This, of course, only applies to the taxpayer. Instead of borrowing from the taxpayers as he did in the past, he is now going to take it from them. This is the sum total of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s tax recommendations. Of course, he does not follow the philosophy of neither borrower nor lender be when it comes to his overall Budget. There he prefers to follow the philosophy of one Artimus Ward, who said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Let us all be happy and live within our means,</block>

<block name="quote">even if we have to borrow the money to do it with.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister is trying to induce the public to believe that a change from the loan levy to income tax surcharges will leave everybody better off. Everybody is going to be better off. But the hon. the Minister knows that this is not the case. In future, instead of an investment in an interest-bearing, tax-free, repayable loan, all the taxpayer will have for his money is an income tax receipt. That is the difference. The marginal rate of tax and loan levy comes down from 78 per cent to 72 per cent. But what has happened to the marginal rate of tax, forgetting the loan levy&#x003F; The marginal rate of taxation has now gone up from 66 per cent to 72 per cent. That is the tax rate. What did the Franzsen Commission say&#x003F; They said that the maximum should be 60 per cent. The hon. the Minister does strange things; he listens to a commission one day, but he changes his mind and does the opposite the next day. We are now not paying a marginal rate of 66 per cent, but a marginal rate of 72 per cent. The changes that the hon. the Minister has suggested are not going to help productivity very much, nor are they going to increase the incentive for people to work. The barrier to <span class="col_4495-4496" refersTo="page_0711"/>production still remains. We believe that we can plan for growth with limited inflation. We would have done away with loan levies but would not have increased taxation. We have faith in our ability to run the economy of this country.</p>

<p>I have now dealt in some detail with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s programme of action, trying to analyse it in order to see what it really means and trying to see what it might do for the economy. The hon. the Minister does not tell us what his Budget is going to do for the economy. He describes it as a growth Budget, but what are his growth targets&#x003F; Nowhere in this Budget does the hon. the Minister indicate what his growth targets in either real terms or in monetary terms are going to be. Nowhere in this Budget does he tell us what he thinks the rate of inflation for 1972 is going to be. It is all part of the concept of real growth. He is going to pump anything from R400 million and more into the economy by using his reserves, by raising the bank ceilings and by heavy foreign borrowing, but his Budget concessions do not provide much stimulus. There is a small flow-back to individuals of R33 million, companies get an injection of R12 million, married women are better off by R300 000, but there is nothing this year from the export allowance.</p>

<p>The investment allowance is merely a continuation of the position as it exists at the moment. The new deal for building society shares is confirmation of what is already taking place. The change in the hire-purchase conditions does not represent an injection into the economy of any kind. Social and civil concessions amount to a mere R13,3 million, and from sales tax to a low R4,5 million&#x2014;at last we have got rid of soap and some other things. These are far too little. There is little encouragement to saving. When you lower interest rates and fix them, what inducement is this for people to save&#x003F; The policies of labour, import control, prices, etc., are not specific enough to remove the uncertainty that exists and are all inflationary; so that all in all there is a general call for growth in this Budget, but it is hopelessly insufficiently backed with specifics.</p>

<p>We go along with Assocom that the underlying aims of the Budget are welcome, but the Budget consists of aims and aims only. There are no effective deeds. Nevertheless, because of the impact of tighter import control and of devaluation, we shall probably see an improvement in the balance of payments during this year. We might even better the low 3,7 per cent growth rate we had in 1971. If the United States and United Kingdom stock exchanges continue to boom, we may find the spillover in our Stock Exchange, which might also improve, but because the major barriers to productivity remain, we are likely to have an unsatisfactory high rate of inflation for the year. There is one thing we cannot ignore. We cannot ignore the three Budgets presented by the three hon. Ministers, because their estimates of income were pessimistic enough.</p>

<p>The three hon. Ministers concerned, in terms of their Budgets, saw minimal growth for South Africa for 1972-&#x2019;73 because they saw large deficits. The interesting thing is, of course, that at the Third Reading of the Railway debate the hon. the Minister, apparently under instruction, decided to change his tone. He then talked about the improvement in the economy, and was followed by the other Ministers. However, the factual figures are there before us. There have been three deficits in the three Budgets for 1972-&#x2019;73. The year 1972-&#x2019;73 will go down in our economic history as the year of the gamble, the gamble on growth, the gamble based on shifting sands. The end result of this Budget is likely to be inadequate growth, a high rate of inflation, more burdens for the people and a return to the disastrous square one. The philosophy of that side of the House is very clear and the hon. the Minister expounded it. He said that he believed that &#x201C;sweet are the uses of adversity&#x201D;. We do not. We believe in planning to avoid adversity. To avoid a tragedy of errors.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. C. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have listened to many speeches by the hon. member for Parktown during past years, but never before did I have reason to pity him in my heart so much as this afternoon. Never before did he speak to such an unresponsive gallery on his side of the House as was the case this afternoon. Only once did he succeed in getting any reaction and that was when he mentioned the name of Mr. Jan Haak in connection with a very unfortunate report that appeared in a Sunday newspaper yesterday. I grant him that this was indeed a blow far below the belt. Mr. Speaker, hon. members on that side of the House also have their troubles from time to time with their Press. The <i>Sunday Times,</i> for instance, <span class="col_4497-4498" refersTo="page_0712"/> seems to have sensed what the hon. member for Parktown was going to say. As a matter of fact, I have the impression that they had insight into his amendment because they replied in advance to what he was going to say. In an article by Prof. Silke, the well-known speaker on Budgets, I read the following. I refer to the first part of the hon. member&#x2019;s motion which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Adequately to reduce the high tax burden &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is what Prof. Silke had to say on this point&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Referring to company tax, Prof. Silke said that South Africa&#x2019;s direct tax of 41 per cent was still low in comparison with West Germany, 55,5 per cent, the United States and France, 50 per cent each, and Britain, 40 per cent plus a 38,75 per cent tax on dividends distributed. In most countries, other than South Africa, there is a capital gains tax as well, he said. The adjoining table gives approximately comparative taxes in rand payable in South Africa and Britain for a married man with no children.</block>

<p>Then he goes on to give this comparison&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A married man without children, with an income of R2 500, pays in Britain R288 if that income is earned or R504 if unearned, to South Africa&#x2019;s moderate R142.</block>

<p>Now compare our tax of R142 with Great Britain&#x2019;s R288. The next figure he gives is for an income of R4 000. In South Africa the tax is R329 and in Great Britain R740. In spite of this the hon. member talks about the high tax burden in South Africa. I do not blame his side of the House for giving him so little support and showing so little reaction, because in all the years I have been sitting in this House, I have listened to fifteen Budget speeches by Ministers of Finance on this side of the House. Many of these speeches were indeed great speeches&#x2014;but perhaps the greatest of them all is the one delivered by the hon. the Minister of Finance 12 days ago. I tried to figure out for myself why this was so and I could come only to one conclusion, namely that the Minister did so extremely well because he remained true to himself and true to his financial and economic philosophy. Most of all, he remained true to the solid National political philosophy of striving to promote the greatest good for the most of our people in line with the time-honoured slogan of the National Party &#x201C;South Africa first.&#x201D; In essence the Minister heeded the advice given to Shakespeare&#x2019;s Hamlet &#x201C;To thine own self be true, for it must follow as the night the day thou canst not then be false to any man.&#x201D; Of course, the Minister could not satisfy everybody; as a matter of fact, nobody could have done that. Even I have some doubts about the wisdom of certain aspects of this otherwise admirable Budget. As a doctrinaire economist I feel it a pity, for example, that the Minister has found it necessary to impose interest rate control again. I believe that this sort of control usually turns out to be self-defeating. I sincerely hope that the Minister will find it possible to lift this control soon. But who am I to criticize&#x003F; Hardly ever before has a Budget been greeted with so much popular acclaim than this one. Spokesmen for commerce, industry, labour, the financial Press, the banking community, and others&#x2014;all acclaim this Budget as a wise and sound one. Have I said &#x201C;all&#x201D;&#x003F; No, there is one exception, namely the body of men and women opposite. They have not acclaimed it as a sound Budget. But if I look into their eyes I seem to detect there the wish &#x201C;that we were in a position rather to defend this excellent Budget than to criticize it&#x201D;. It is no wonder, therefore, that the hon. member for Parktown made it the object of a challenge 12 days ago and repeated it again this afternoon, when he said the following: &#x201C;Let any member on that side of the House, when he enters this debate show me one single thing the Minister has done this afternoon which is beneficial and which has not been offered by this side of the House, by industry, commerce and by every knowledgeable economist in this country. Now that is a challenge. We shall wait for the answer.&#x201D; Mr. Speaker, I take up that challenge. How perfectly naive a man can become ! Numerous hon. members on that side of the House have from time to time asked just about everything under the sun. The hon. member for Parktown is perfectly correct. Those beneficial things done by the hon. the Minister in this Budget have been asked somewhere by someone in the Opposition.</p>

<p>But let us consider what would have been the state of our finances had the hon. the <span class="col_4499-4500" refersTo="page_0713"/>Minister acceded to all their requests. First of all, let us look at their hardy annual: to curtail official spending. Let us forget about what they have been asking during previous sessions and let us look only at what they have been asking during the current session. The hon. member for South Coast asked this year that a new Ministry be instituted. We know quite well that it would cost a few million rand. I think it was the hon. member for Albany who asked for the appointment of many more agricultural extension officers, which would also cost quite a lot of money.</p>

<p>Of course I am not against it. But let me come to the point I want to make. Members opposite continually want the Government to curtail State expenditure, but at the same time they indulge in the politically popular pastime of asking for new services. When these are granted, they claim for themselves the credit for those beneficial things. Mr. Speaker, does this not remind you of Shakespeare&#x2019;s words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But do not, as ungracious pastors do, show us the steep and thorny way to Heaven, while they themselves the primrose path of dalliance tread &#x2026; &#x003F;</block>

<p>Let us turn to another popular request of theirs, namely increasing social pensions. But never did they dream, in the days when they were in power, to increase pensions to such an extent as in this Budget. In their time they paid only R10 social pension a month. Their R10 of 1948 inflated by applicable price indices would be worth R21 today. But I will be generous. I will add another R4 for good measure, in consideration of the high standard of living we all have today under this Government. Their R10 of 1948 is therefore worth R25 today. Now compare this R25 with our pension, which has been increased in this Budget to R41 per month. If the applicant deferred his application for five years, it will be R51 per month, compared with their R25. The hon. member for Parktown claims the credit for this good thing for his party. This just shows how ridiculous a man can become when he is blinded by the desert sands of 24 years in Opposition.</p>

<p>But answer the challenge.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. C. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Let us consider another popular theme of hon. members opposite, a very special theme of the hon. member for Parktown himself. For many years, when the economy was booming, the Opposition accused the Government of overtaxing the taxpayer. Only last year the hon. member for Parktown criticized the Government for overtaxing the taxpayers to the tune of R400 million. He furthermore censured the Government for using R180 million of our Stabilization Account to finance the Loan Account. This afternoon he censured the Government for using another R140 million out of the Stabilization Fund to balance its books. Mr. Speaker, if the hon. the Minister had heeded the advice of the hon. member for Parktown, he would have left that R180 million in the Stabilization Account and he would have found the money by means of loans. If he had done so, if he had found that R180 million through loans at 8&#x00BD; per cent, the current rate of interest, the additional interest burden which we would have had to pay this year, would have been R15,3 million, and this would have had to be defrayed from revenue. If this Government had done what the Opposition had asked for all these years, namely, if it had not during the years of economic prosperity financed part of the Loan Account by surpluses on the Revenue Account, the interest burden would have been excessive now&#x2014;perhaps double the amount of R209 million which we have to find this year.</p>

<p>*This, Sir, brings me to the conclusion that we would have been in a very critical situation if we had taken the advice of that side. Now I ask you, Sir: How hollow does that challenge by the hon. member for Parktown not sound now&#x003F; I have a further charge, Sir, and it is a charge against the hon. member for Parktown and against the Opposition in general. I have frequently referred to the political responsibility we desire from the Opposition. Prior to 1969 they advocated, in season and out, the elimination of the so-called tax bulge. I did not find any fault with that; on occasion I advocated it myself. But in 1969 when the hon. the Minister did in fact proceed to eliminate this tax bulge, what was the reaction of the hon. member for Parktown&#x003F; He then called it a &#x201C;champagne budget for the upper income groups&#x201D; (Hansard, Vol. 26, col. 3550). For years they had been advocating the elimination <span class="col_4501-4502" refersTo="page_0714"/>of that bulge, but the moment the Minister did that, they called it a &#x201C;champagne budget&#x201D; for the rich. Two years later, when the hon. the Minister was again obliged to make greater demands on the upper income groups, the hon. member for Parktown commented as follows (Hansard. Vol. 33, col 4229)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Generally, we believe that the sharp increases in the surcharge and in the loan levy are ill-advised. In so far as the individual taxpayer is concerned, they operate most harshly against the middle and upper income groups &#x2026; So we cannot support these increases.</block>

<p>Where have you ever seen a better example of a dualistic onslaught, Sir&#x003F; Would the Opposition not, for a change, tell us unequivocally where we stand with them in respect of higher taxation for the upper income groups&#x003F; Last year and this year it has asked for a drastic decrease of the taxation on these upper income groups. If the hon. the Minister should heed that request next year, are they not going to speak again of a &#x201C;champagne budget for the upper income groups&#x201D;&#x003F; Please, let us for a change have a little responsibility from hon. members opposite.</p>

<p>Let us consider another popular, well-known and irresponsible assertion which the Opposition has with a considerable degree of success inflated to tremendous proportions, i.e. the steadily increasing cost of living which is supposedly bearing down so heavily on the poor man. I concede, Sir, that we are ourselves concerned about this considerable increase in the cost of living index, for it is a considerable one. But why does the Opposition always omit to mention the fact that the income of our people is increasing far more rapidly than the cost of living&#x003F; I know the hon. member has often spoken of the expectation which a man has that his standard of living must rise, but just look at what happened during the past two years. According to the latest quarterly report of the Reserve Bank, which we have just received, we see that the average level of salaries and wages during the first nine months of 1971 was 10,1 per cent higher than during the same period in 1970. During 1970 salaries and wages increased by 9,9 per cent. Now compare this with the increase in the cost of living. In 1970 the cost of living increased by 4,2 per cent, while salaries and wages increased by 9,9 per cent. In 1971 the cost of living increased by 5,7 per cent, and salaries and wages by 10,1 per cent. What do hon. members opposite want to achieve with such a distorted, incomplete statement of the economic situation&#x003F; Do they want to catch a few votes in that way&#x003F; Possibly, although I doubt whether Oudtshoorn would acknowledge that they are right. Look how irresponsible this is. A dissatisfied worker is most certainly not an effective and productive worker. Throughout the business world the complaint these days is in fact that labour has become unproductive. Therefore I now want to make a serious appeal to hon. members of the Opposition, namely: Have done with this creation of a dissatisfaction psychosis among the workers of our country; for the sake of a few grievance votes you are destroying the prosperity of us all.</p>

<p>Sir, unfortunately my time is running out and I still have quite good deal to say; I must therefore make haste. I have already said frequently that there is only one effective remedy against this rapid increase in the cost living and against inflation, and it is that we should all examine our own conscience, that we should all work a little harder without demanding higher salaries. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has often challenged me to indicate who those people are who are not working hard enough. Of course he wants to use this again, or misuse it, but I want to repeat: All of us, including he and I, can do no better than to examine our own conscience and work a little harder for the same salary. If we did that, we would keep this excessive increase in the cost of living index in check.</p>

<p>In the last few minutes at my disposal I should like to address myself to the hon. the Minister of Finance. During the past two years one unalterable economic fact has emerged very clearly again during the world-wide economic recession, which is that countries whose exports consist chiefly of agricultural produce and raw materials are hit the hardest in such a recession. With our predominant exports of agricultural produce and raw materials, metals and minerals, we cannot escape such a situation. Consider how the prices of these products &#x2014;wool, fruit, diamonds, platinum, copper, antimony, etc.&#x2014;have dropped during the past two years. Not only did this have a very prejudicial effect on our balance of payments, it also had a very prejudicial effect on our internal liquidity; it also <span class="col_4503-4504" refersTo="page_0715"/>made the task of the Minister of Finance an impossible one; it caused State revenue to drop sharply and forced the hon. the Minister to levy higher taxes at precisely the same time that tax relief was imperative to breath new life into a flagging economy. And now, Mr. Speaker, what of the future&#x003F; Let us learn from this lesson which we have learnt during the past two years&#x2014; and this has to a large extent been applied by this Government during the past two years and in previous years, despite the onslaughts which have continually been made on us by the other side&#x2014;and this is that when our economy is flourishing, we must put away far more for the evil days to come. We did in fact build up a Stabilization Fund of more than R300 million&#x2014;almost R400 Million&#x2014;during those years, but let us learn from this experience of the past two years and let us build up our Stabilization Fund in the good years which again lie ahead&#x2014;and please note, Mr. Speaker, there are good years ahead again for this country&#x2014;to a much higher level than before so that when we again experience a time of recession in the world trade, as we have experienced during the past two years, we will not need to levy higher taxes when our internal liquidity drops and when the State revenue decreases. Sir, this is one of the points on which the Opposition have criticized us the most during the past few years. It has become a refrain from that side that we are taxing our people too heavily, but I find nothing wrong in our imposing heavy taxes at a time when the economy is flourishing. Let us, when everything is going well, put away enough for the evil day when we will need it.</p>

<p>Therefore I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister of Finance very sincerely this afternoon on this brilliant Budget which he introduced here 12 days ago. At the same time I want to congratulate him for having, in spite of the insistence of the other side that we should not overtax our people, continued in those prosperous years to put away this nest egg for the evil day. I just want to advocate to him that he should in future, in the prosperous years which lie ahead for us, put away an even greater nest egg. I have no doubt that a prosperous period lies ahead for us. When that prosperous period arrives&#x2014;and it is imminent&#x2014;will hon. members of the Opposition then give us the credit for it, as they are now blaming us for the worldwide recession which has had an effect on our country as well&#x003F; Mr. Speaker, as far as I am concerned, I am convinced that there is nothing fundamentally wrong with the economy of this country and that the economy of this country, in spite of what the hon. member for Parktown suggested with reference to that report in yesterday&#x2019;s <i>Rapport,</i> is in extremely capable hands.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I doubt whether the hon. member for Paarl knew, when he rose and complained about a blow below the belt, whether he had been struck by a left hook or a right hook. Be it as it may, the hon. member was obviously nervous because he devoted most of his speech to critizing all the things the Opposition was supposed to have said in the past. As a matter of fact, I want to congratulate the hon. member on the amount of homework he did during the Easter week-end, because it seems to me that the hon. member made a careful study of the speeches of the Opposition. I do not want to deal with the hon. member&#x2019;s speech any further, because there are quite a number of things I want to say to the hon. the Minister of Finance.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I believe that the hon. the Minister of Finance did succeed to some extent in putting his critics in a quandary. His Budget has drawn various reactions from the pundits who write for the various financial journals, and it seemed at one stage that opinion between them was evenly divided. There were those who damned him with faint praise and there was the other school which praised him with faint damns.</p>

<p>We agreed very much with many things which the hon. the Minister of Finance said in his Budget speech. Many of his sentiments were unexceptionable from the financial and budgetary point of view. We admired the manner in which he has steadily drawn closer to the United Party and the advice and policies which it has advocated. In particular the hon. the Minister of Finance correctly identified three main weaknesses in the economy. These, he said, were the balance of payments, the low growth rate, and inflation. These are indeed the three features which this side of the House has stressed repeatedly in past years. He says, and we give him credit for his intentions, that it is the principal aim of the Government to remedy these three weaknesses. This also we welcome, but what we do not welcome is the timidity <span class="col_4505-4506" refersTo="page_0716"/>of action which is evinced when one reads his Budget carefully.</p>

<p>Of these three weaknesses low growth is without question the fundamental weakness in the South African economy. The other two, the deficit on a balance of payments and inflation, are to a large extent consequential on the low growth which we have experienced in recent years.</p>

<p>Let us take the balance of payments. This, surely, is in its simplest terms an insufficiency of exports and an excessive reliance on imports. Our merchandise imports went up by over R300 million last year, to R2 888 million. They went up by R300 million! Our exports, on the other hand, went up by only R60 million, to R1 481 million. This is a ratio of five to one a ratio in the figures of increase of trade of five times as many imports as of exports. This has produced a trade gap of R1 400 million. We have a balance of payments gap of over R1 000 million, yet it is in this situation, which has been growing and which has been identified by this side of the House for several years, that the Government has deliberately inhibited growth. I say it has deliberately inhibited growth because the hon. the Minister of Finance has in fact stood up in this House on various occasions and told us that that was his policy.</p>

<p>Let us take the other factor of the three, inflation. Fundamentally inflation is caused by a rising demand for scarce resources. Now it can be argued that inflation is mainly attributable to a cost-push situation or a demand-pull situation. But these things are irrelevant to the main cause. Cost-push and demand-pull are reciprocating mechanisms. The one feeds the other. The fact is that the growth of our gross domestic product has been only four per cent in the past year, while inflation has been 5,7 per cent. If it is argued, as has been argued from that side of the House, that it is growth which causes inflation, then how is it that we have now got to the stage where growth has dropped down to 4 per cent and inflation is still at 5,7 per cent&#x003F; Sir, this contradiction proves two main things. It proves, firstly, that a high growth rate is not the real cause of inflation. A high growth rate is often accompanied by inflation, but it is not the high rate which causes inflation. In fact a high growth rate may conquer inflation. Sir, we have produced, deliberately, a state of stagnation, but still inflation continues. It now looks, and I think the Minister must begin to believe us, that the alleged cure of throttling back growth has been disastrously expensive.</p>

<p>This is a cure which we cannot afford. He has done grievous harm to the economy of the country. In spite of the punishment we have taken, deliberately imposed, the fever still continues to rage. Inflation is still current. Is there not something wrong in the reasoning, in the policy, in the philosophy which this hon. Minister has applied&#x003F; Reliance on the wrong remedy has in fact compelled us to use many other undesirable medicines, undesirable suppressive drugs. We have import control; we have credit control; interest control; price control and we have had building control; fiscal control, through steadily rising taxes I may add. And we have had devaluation; that is a special magical medicine with very bad side-effects especially for pensioners and other people on fixed incomes. We have had all these controls, Government control after Government control, to remedy a situation which it has itself, by its own admission, created.</p>

<p>I said that devaluation and the gap in balance of payments are two of the weaknesses in our economy which the hon. the Minister has correctly identified. I have said though that these are side-effects of the main weakness, namely lack of growth. I should like to pause at the question of growth. I believe that the growth question is fundamental to the weakness in this economy and that we will not put the economy right until we have managed to put the growth right.</p>

<p>It is now acknowledged by the hon. the Minister that more growth is indeed necessary. He said that we originally found ourselves in the shallows and miseries&#x2014; using a Shakespearean quotation&#x2014;but he now suddenly declares very bravely that we should take the tide at the flood. Indeed, Sir, we should take the tide at the flood. But does the hon. the Minister take the tide at the flood&#x003F; It seems to me that, if one analyses his Budget carefully, he has only paid lip service to the concept of taking the tide at the flood. In fact, very little has been done. The hon. the Minister has, I think, the best of intentions but I believe that he is crippled by the policies of the Government and that until the policies of the Government are changed it will be impossible for the Minister to escape from the strait jacket in which he finds himself.</p>

<p><span class="col_4507-4508" refersTo="page_0717"/>Let us examine the growth needs of this country. We have in South Africa four main manufacturing areas. These areas are Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging, Durban-Pinetown, Port Elizabeth-Uitenhage and the Cape. These are the four main areas in which growth and especially manufacturing growth in South Africa take place and can take place. These four areas alone are responsible for 80 per cent of all manufacturing output in South Africa, that is, 80 per cent of the total. This means in effect that they are responsible for 75 per cent of all secondary industries in South Africa. It is on secondary industry that we must rely for escape from our economic quandary in the next 20 years. Now, I have said 80 per cent. In 1967-&#x2019;68 these four areas produced R2 000 million out of a total of R2 400 million of manufactured production. The economic development plan requires that manufacturing should grow at 6,6 per cent per annum if we are to achieve the necessary, the essential target rate of 5,5 per cent growth rate per annum. If we pursue the present policy of this Government, which is to cause growth in these four areas to stagnate, or even just to proceed at their present rate of 3 per cent or 4 per cent per annum, this means that in order to achieve that 5,5 per cent over the next 22 years, these four areas will at a growth rate of 3 to 4 per cent per annum, only double their production in the next 22 years. It means then that if we are to achieve the objective of the economic development plan, which is to push up our manufacturing production to R12 000 million, the other areas namely the nonmetropolitan areas or the rural areas, will have to do all the rest. This means that they will have to double, double again, double again and double again their production. They will have to double their production four times in algebraic terms or produce sixteen times as much in arithmetic terms. It means that they will have to produce 16 times as much in the next 22 years as they are now producing. For these rural areas, which as yet have little infrastructure, this represents a growth rate of 14 per cent per annum. This is clearly an absurdity and yet it is upon this basis that the Government&#x2019;s economic policy rests. This is how it plans to defeat the trade gap and how it plans to defeat inflation. It is an absurdity.</p>

<p>What will the cost and the consequences for South Africa be if we have to go on like this&#x003F; In South Africa we have a rapidly rising population. Not only do we have a rapidly rising population, one of the higher population growth rates in the world, but combined with it we have rising expectations and rising needs. We have a population of approximately 22 million, of whom only about 4 million, or maybe 5 million, are at this moment satisfying their basic needs to the extent that they are enjoying some measure of the pleasures and the luxuries of the more advanced 20th century society in which we live. The remaining 17 million are not enjoying this and they will not rest content until their expectations in at least some degree are also fulfilled. How will we satisfy these expectations&#x003F; If we maintain growth on the present basis which I have described and on the present levels as described, we can only satisfy them by rising imports. If we are not producing the commodities in South Africa, we must import them. The alternative is to slip steadily backwards to degradation and poverty.</p>

<p>How will we accommodate the new Black labour which is coming on the market&#x003F; It is now rising to the figure of something like 100 000 new jobs per annum to be satisfied. I believe that the current figure of new jobs which have to be created per annum are 85 000, but soon 100 000 new jobs per annum will have to be created. How can we do this in a stagnant economy&#x003F; How can we do this if we rely on growth in rural areas where there is no adequate infrastructure and depend on those areas for a 14 per cent growth rate per annum&#x003F;</p>

<p>How will we preserve peace and buy time for South Africa. We need time more than anything. We need a growing economy and economic strength. If we follow our present policies, if we continue with this stagnant form of growth, how will we buy time&#x003F; How will we achieve constructive change if we have insufficient time&#x003F;</p>

<p>How will we maintain internal strength and deterrence against subversion if the cost of the deterrents rises every day&#x003F; When I was in France a few months ago I was told that the cost of maintaining their deterrents, their defence forces, at the present level will Increase by 7 per cent per annum. Now, Sir, if we import weapons, and munitions from France or other parts of Europe, and to this cost is added the differences brought about by devaluation, the cost of transport, the cost of brokerage, the cost of loans and whatever else goes <span class="col_4509-4510" refersTo="page_0718"/>into the final sum, it means that the cost of armaments, maintained at the same level in France, will double every ten years. If, instead, we have an increase in the cost of deterrents rising at, shall we say, conservatively, 10 per cent per annum, it means that the cost will double every seven years. How can we pay for our safety in this situation if we have a non-productive economy, a stagnant economy, a growth factor based on 3 per cent in our metropolitan growth areas, the four areas I have mentioned, and a fictitious 14 per cent somewhere in the bundu&#x003F; How will the hon. the Minister find the necessary revenue to meet Government expenditure&#x003F; Already taxes, as between 1971 and 1972, show an increase of 27 per cent in personal income tax. We paid 27 per cent more in personal income tax in 1972 than we did in 1971. Against this, the revenue from company tax rose by only 3,3 per cent. I ask the House to look at this discrepancy where rising revenue is urgently needed: 27 per cent additional is coming from private sources, from individual personal tax and 3,3 per cent from company tax. Why is this happening&#x003F; It is because we are killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. That is quite simply the reason. That is the problem.</p>

<p>What has the Budget done for us, and especially, what has the Budget done about those twin pillars of growth, namely labour and capital&#x003F; Let us examine its nine main features, as identified by the hon. the Minister of Finance himself. He mentioned nine points in his summary at the end of his speech. Firstly, he says he has relaxed credit restrictions to promote production and exports. What has actually happened&#x003F; Banks have been allowed to increase their ceilings by 5 per cent for discounts and advances and by 10 per cent for investments. This is not a massive injection of capital. The hon. member for Parktown pointed out that banks have already been exercising this right to some extent. It will make very little appreciable difference on the capital market. The hon. the Minister has expressed the hope that some of this increased credit will be applied to base mineral development. This is a cause which is very dear to my heart and I have pleaded in this House before for precisely such development. But where was the hon. the Minister when the St. Croix decision was taken, when the Saldanha decision was taken&#x003F; Is the hon. the Minister aware that we will soon have no export port for iron ore, no adequate export port for manganese, and that Saldanha cannot be brought into effect until about 1980&#x003F; Is the hon. the Minister entirely nonchalant about the fact that we may have to do without additional iron ore exports between now and 1980, with a potential loss of R400 million in foreign revenue and a further loss of R100 million in Railway revenue&#x003F; This is the cost of this wrong set of priorities which is being applied. The hon. the Minister knows that we have nothing against Saldanha, but we believe that his priorities are entirely wrong and that we cannot wait from 1972 to 1980 for something to happen which we need now.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>The second point or remedy raised by the hon. the Minister was the promotion of savings. Home-ownership is a good idea and nobody is going to quarrel with it. One could take a petty view of this and say that it takes too long and produces too little money, but essentially it is a good and a constructive idea. It does not meet the objective of saving, however. If we are to save, we must have the means with which to save. High taxes frustrate saving. We have various examples. As I have said, we have an increase of 27 per cent in revenue from private individuals. We also have the conversion of levies into direct tax. If levies have any virtue at all, which I doubt, it is that they do contribute to savings and that they put money out of harm&#x2019;s way. These savings are now, by the Minister&#x2019;s own action, to be converted into higher tax. We are asked to be content with a little more take-home pay. I think the tax aspect of this matter is perhaps the most important one and this has been lost sight of.</p>

<p>The third point is that we are now promised a more flexible labour policy. The Minister talked about multiple shifts on a selective basis. We do not know what &#x201C;selective&#x201D; means, but we think we know. He also said that quotas in the metropolitan areas may be maintained if a doubling-up takes place in rural areas. All these adjustments are to take place within the basic framework of our society and I think that when the Minister speaks of &#x201C;within the basic framework of our society&#x201D;, he is talking about keeping within the basic <span class="col_4511-4512" refersTo="page_0719"/>framework of the Physical Planning Act. That is not our society; it is their society.</p>

<p>The fourth point is that we have curbed State expenditure. This is good old United Party policy. We have begged the hon. the Minister for years to do this, but he has told us for years that it is impossible to do it and challenged us to show where it could be done. He has succeeded and we congratulate him on curbing the rate of increase on State expenditure.</p>

<p>He has increased social pensions, admittedly by on infinitesimal amount, but it is a step in the right direction. It is a good step, but as I will show, it has little or nothing to do with growth.</p>

<p>There are also increased tax incentives for exporters. This is again good, but ineffectual without a steady growth of the domestic base. One cannot produce exports out of a vacuum and exports are based on a broad domestic base. Until such a base is established and the cost of production is brought down in order to export competitively abroad, one has in fact achieved nothing. We have not reached the stage where we are satisfying the essential needs of our own people. We cannot fulfil the needs of our own people and we are importing from abroad very heavily to do it. How, in this situation, can a massive export programme be achieved&#x003F; We must first broaden our base and supply our peoples&#x2019; basic wants. On that basis we can then begin to think seriously of a massive export programme.</p>

<p>There has been a reduction in sales duties, but if I may say so, that was only a little bit of soft-soap.</p>

<p>There is an improvement in the companies&#x2019; cash position. The loan levy o-f 7&#x00BD; per cent on dividends has been reduced to 3 per cent and there has also been the abolition of the loan levy on individuals. A 10 per cent surcharge now goes on top of the existing surchage and the levy is to be taken away. We have here the imposition of a direct tax or a surcharge on a tax in the place of a levy, whereas a levy, if it has any merit at all, at least contains some saving content.</p>

<p>This, then, in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own words, is what he has done for growth in South Africa. Let us examine these nine major points of his Budget and ask ourselves where, if anywhere, there is any major impetus given to growth or any major contribution given to the growth concept or any major break-away from then stagnation concept which has been built into Government policies, into the Physical Planning Act and into the whole system over the past few years. We cannot get out of this situation unless we change the basic policies. In his Budget speech the hon. the Minister used the word &#x201C;growth&#x201D; no less than 18 times. Eighteen times he paid homage to &#x201C;growth&#x201D;. He has done honour to &#x201C;growth&#x201D;. He has said that this is what we need and what we should have. But, in fact, he has done very little about it. If I in reply, may quote Hamlet, I would say that his precepts &#x201C;are more honoured in the breach than in the observance&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when he began speaking, the hon. member for Paarl expressed sympathy with the hon. member for Parktown after having listened to him. I must to a larger extent sympathize with the hon. member for Von Brandis. The fact is that in this Budget as a whole the Opposition did not get what they were actually expecting. They allowed the country to believe that we would have an immense deficit at the end of the past financial year. They allowed the country to believe that this would inevitably lead to our having a greater amount of tax levied this year. I think they particularly looked forward to this because in their political history a key election awaits them in the Oudtshoorn constituency. The fact of the matter is that in this Budget they got what they were not expecting. Instead of an immense deficit, the shortfall on the Revenue Account was only about R4,5 million. Instead of considerable new taxes that were to have been levied on individuals and companies, and an increase in the sales duty, no new taxes were announced. It seems to me that hon. members on that side of the House have actually been prepared by the Budget for the second blow they are going to receive in Oudtshoorn in a week&#x2019;s time.</p>

<p>I do not think they expected the hon. the Minister of Finance to still be able to announce pension and other concessions, particularly to the lowest income groups, in spite of the fact that we are going through a difficult time in which no reasonable person can expect tax concessions to be made. I consequently want to say that this Budget was the last thing that hon. members on that side of the House expected at this time. This also explains why there is no vehement criticism against the hon. the Minister of Finance <span class="col_4513-4514" refersTo="page_0720"/>today. The criticism expressed by the hon. member for Von Brandis is criticism we have been listening to for some years past, i.e. that South Africa must have a much higher growth rate than the target rate of the economic development programme. In the modern world, with all the problems we have in this country with respect to size, the composition of our population and the fact that we do not have a bulk market in South Africa itself, in spite of the fact that industrial production has not yet reached the level that it has in older, established industrial countries, the fact is that South Africa can be glad it has maintained a real, net growth of 5,8 per cent per annum over a period of ten years. Although this growth rate has levelled off slightly to 5,3 per cent in the past five years, I think we can nevertheless feel satisfied that throughout this decade we could still achieve a rate slightly higher than the rate aspired to as the optimum rate in the economic development programme.</p>

<p>I want to state that this Budget is an extremely important one because it comes at a time when our economy must take a new course. Our country as a whole has for some time now, particularly since July, 1969 when share prices decreased considerably, been waiting to see in what direction our economy would move in the future. Therefore not only the general population and the man in the street, but also industrialists, shopkeepers and everyone have been waiting the announcements that were to be made in this Budget by the hon. the Minister of Finance. I think that if one looks back after a year at the effect this Budget is going to have on our economy, hon. members on the opposite side of the House will also have to agree with me that our economy has entered a new phase of growth. This Budget&#x2019;s entire set-up contradicts the criticism the hon. member for Von Brandis directed against it. The whole emphasis of this Budget is on balanced growth. As the hon. the Minister of Finance indicated, there are chiefly three tasks he sets himself, firstly the balance of payments must be straightened out and placed on a sound footing, so that our reserves can again be sufficient for safety&#x2019;s sake. Secondly we must maintain a greater real growth per annum and thirdly we in South Africa must be able to maintain the necessary economic and price stability.</p>

<p>The measures announced by the hon. the Minister must also be seen against this background. If our total endeavour were solely to facilitate a greater degree of growth, greater even than the aim the Government has set itself in recent years, it would be of no use to us unless we could maintain the necessary price stability in South Africa. When the careers of various Ministers of Finance in South Africa are one day reviewed, and when the career of the present Minister of Finance is one day taken stock of, it will be possible to say that at a stage vitally important to South Africa he withstood that temptation to strive for maximum growth. If this had been his only endeavour, and if he had not applied restrictive measures in the past few years, particularly to combat private consumer spending, the inflation rate in South Africa would have been much higher and we would have been much worse off than we are today in respect of our biggest export product, i.e. gold. By specifically adopting this policy he made it possible for our gold-mines to have a much longer life, so that we can draw much more for South Africa from this vital source.</p>

<p>I just want to point to a few general aspects of this Budget. In the first place I want to point out that as far as our poor section of the population is concerned, our social pensioners, the old-age pensioners and others, the Minister has very thoroughly taken their position into account in this Budget. We realize that they cannot augment their income by hard work. Since we have in the past year, 1971, had an increase in the consumer price index of 5,7 per cent as against the previous year, the Minister has this year granted a R3 million increase in respect of old-age pensions. By doing this he granted them an increase of almost 8 per cent, which is considerably more than the increase in the cost of living. In this respect he has consequently eased the position for that sector of the population which cannot improve its own financial position by earnings, and he has given them more than they lost through the increase in the consumer price index.</p>

<speech by="#meyer">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. H. MEYER</person>:</from>

<p>The Budget also emphasizes for us the most important aim in our national economy. In the first place, <span class="col_4515-4516" refersTo="page_0721"/>the balance of payments must be set right. If we look at the White Paper published in conjunction with the Budget, we notice that in the past three years alone the exchange standard has dropped as never before in recent history.</p>

<p>In 1969 it was still 96 per cent, as against 100 per cent in 1964. In the year 1970 it had dropped to 94 per cent, if one includes gold, but in the year 1971 the exchange standard dropped to 89 per cent. This emphasizes the particular fix South Africa has been in the past year, i.e. that the price of its products, particularly minerals, on the one hand decreased considerably on the world market, and that at the same time the price of goods that have to be imported evidenced a large increase, so that South Africa, since it has to import in order to grow, was in the unenviable position, with this adverse standard of exchange, of having had the biggest trade balance deficit in its history. But I think the situation can be corrected by this Budget. One must not see the Budget proposals in isolation; one must also look at the steps the Government took in the preceding months&#x2014;in the first place the introduction of import control and then devaluation in December of last year.</p>

<p>The combined effect of all these measures will inevitably be such that in the coming year less will be imported and that our balance of payments and the standard of exchange will have a chance to recover so that we will have a more balanced development in our foreign trade in the coming years. But, Sir, this Budget also aims at achieving the optimum growth rate for South Africa and at the same time, as I said, maintaining economic and price stability in South Africa. For the achievement of this optimum growth rate and for the maintenance of the necessary economic and price stability, one must lay down two prerequisites; one is that our entrepreneurs must have a greater degree of confidence in the general trend of the economy, and the second is that a greater sense of thrift must be developed, particularly amongst our younger generation that still has to purchase goods on a large scale. This house ownership savings plan the Minister of Finance has announced must consequently be seen against this background, i.e. the necessity of developing a sense of thrift amongst our young people. I read the criticism issued by certain bodies to the effect that the price limit of R16 000 for a house is allegedly unrealistically low.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to accept that the position here in the Cape is more or less the same as in the rest of the country. I can take you to my own constituency where a hundred houses are being built now on plots that are much bigger than those on which houses were built in the past in the Northern Suburbs of Cape Town, and the selling prices of very good houses will be less than R14 000, not only this year, but hopefully in the year 1973 as well. I therefore want to reject the criticism that the limit of R16 000 per house is too low. But at the same time I want to make this statement: Since this plan is now being announced for the first time and since it takes into consideration the conditions existing at this stage, I believe that the Minister of Finance will also show himself to be compliant in this respect, just as he has shown himself to be compliant in respect of the utilization of labour and in respect of the question of foreign loans by the private sector. If it should appear that this limit of R16 000 under this savings plan is an unrealistically low one, I simply do not doubt that the necessary adjustment will be made in the years ahead.</p>

<p>Sir, I think the most important objective we must pursue in South Africa at this stage is to facilitate greater production, and to do this we must strengthen the confidence in our economy of our businessmen in general. I think the best criterion one can apply to determine whether the necessary confidence in our economy has been activated is not what financial editors write in newspapers; it is not what the so-called shadow Minister of Finance on the opposition side says; it is that general criterion, i.e. the Stock Exchange of South Africa. The Stock Exchange reflects the feeling of banking institutions, of investment bodies and even of the ordinary citizen in South Africa, and the fact is that in the past two weeks the hon. member for Von Brandis also received a good reply in that respect, because not only have we seen an increase on the Stock Exchange&#x2014;perhaps a little more rapid than we expected and perhaps too rapid to be sound in the long run&#x2014;but there are also signs that this growth on our Exchange can be maintained. What happened on the Exchange in the past two weeks is a mirror for the whole of South Africa; it is <span class="col_4517-4518" refersTo="page_0722"/>proof of general confidence in our economy. I believe this upward trend we have just seen is in fact only the beginning of a new phase of general confidence in our economy that will be cultivated throughout South Africa in the coming year.</p>

<p>Sir, I should like to point to a few steps the hon. the Minister announced to strengthen this spirit of confidence amongst our industrialists. In the first place I want to emphasize the tremendous saving in State expenditure that the Minister was able to announce. At the same time he could also assure us that he believes that there is still the necessary reserve capacity in our infrastructure to carry the necessary expansion in our economy, in spite of the relative decrease in State expenditure. But what is also of importance is that the hon. the Minister is confident that next year and in the years ahead he will be able to balance his Budget without levying new taxes. He could even go further and make certain concessions, particularly to companies. He was able to almost completely abolish the loan levy on dividends that companies receive. The fact that the Minister could reduce, from 78 per cent to 72 per cent, the rate at which the very richest taxpayer paid tax and the loan levy is an indication that he is confident that in the coming year the trend of the economy will be a favourable one. I believe that this confidence of his will also engender confidence in our merchants and industrialists.</p>

<p>The fact that the Minister could somewhat reduce the sales duty on certain items&#x2014;perhaps not on a spectacular scale &#x2014;and that he saw his way clear to abolishing the sales duty on certain items, indicates that he has the necessary confidence in our economy, and I think this will filter through to our country&#x2019;s entrepreneurs in general. But what is also important in this connection is that he made certain concessions to the banks as far as their credit ceilings are concerned and that he simultaneously took the brave step of instituting interest rate control on participation bonds and deposits. If I myself, as someone in the business world, must express my opinion. I would say that there was no single factor that contributed more in recent years to our growth rate dropping than specifically the high interest rates and the relative shortage of capital.</p>

<p>Although these concessions, as far as the credit ceiling of banks is concerned, may perhaps not appear to be extensive enough in the long run, I believe that the fact that there will be greater credit available for industries, and that we can simultaneously expect a downward trend in interest rate patterns, will create new confidence in the business sector. In this connection I also want to welcome the fact that the hon. the Minister announced that the Treasury would adopt a more lenient attitude towards applicants in the private sector in respect of foreign loans. On tours I myself undertook recently it struck me how much interest there is in South Africa; what also struck me is the little confidence that industrialists have in their own country. I therefore believe that in future we shall not only obtain greater investments in South Africa from abroad, particularly after devaluation, but also that the bodies abroad will be prepared to loan money to private undertakings in South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, all these measures, and others I could also mention, indicate that the green light has been given for the industrialists of South Africa to show some daring. I believe these steps, which at this stage should only be seen as pointers and which will be followed up as the necessity for further action arises in future, will create the necessary confidence in the industrial life in South Africa and that in the present year we will not only have a growth rate of 4 per cent in our economy, but also move closer to the target rate. That is why I sympathize with hon. speakers on that side of the House who have to criticize this Budget. It is particularly significant, as far as I am concerned, that the message of this Budget, i.e. one of harder work in South Africa, is virtually the same message that came from one of the greatest men ever born in Oudtshoorn, i.e. Lagenhoven, who said that dying is not an art; even the worst of people can manage that. To live properly is an art that even the best of people cannot manage every day. We on this side believe that we must live and work for South Africa and not that we should create a spirit of pessimism in South Africa as hon. members on that side of the House are doing.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Other speakers on this side of the House have already commented on the aims of the economic policy which the hon. the Minister of Finance enunciated in his Budget speech, namely, firstly, to improve the balance of payments position; secondly, to achieve a more rapid rate of real growth in the economy, and, thirdly, to curb inflation. We have indicated from this side of the House that we agreed with that diagnosis of the problems of our economy, but we would stress, and stress very strongly, that the primary problem of the economy, the primary problem of the three identified by the hon. the Minister, is the lack of real growth. Until real growth is accelerated, there will be no answer to the other two problems identified by him, namely inflation and the balance of payments. I would suggest going even further. I feel that the need for real growth is even greater and more urgent this year than it was last year, because two new elements have appeared on the economic scene in South Africa. The first of these is the situation arising from the devaluation of the rand. If we do not grow, and if we do not grow in the right way and in the right places&#x2014;and the right place is in the export industries&#x2014;we will be dissipating the advantages of devaluation and we will be left only with the disadvantages, the main one of which will be a high rate of inflation and the danger of further devaluation later on.</p>

<p>The second new factor which has appeared on the economic scene this year is the factor of deficit budgeting. Deficit budgeting is something which we experienced in the year 1971-&#x2019;72 and we are going to have it again in 1972-&#x2019;73. It will therefore cover a two-year span. It does not only cover the finances of the Treasury, but it also covers the finances of the Railways and to a lesser extent those of the Post Office. I suggest that deficit budgeting in itself is highly inflationary, because it means that we are living off our savings&#x2014;in other words, we are not financing our current expenditure out of our current income and the Government is living beyond its means. When added to deficit budgeting you have the considerable injection of new money into the economy by way of a heavy overseas borrowing programme, then the whole fiscal position becomes highly inflationary.</p>

<p>I would suggest that it is quite clear that the need for real growth is absolutely vital if we are not to be caught up in a vicious circle of deficit budgeting followed by inflation, causing further deficits which ultimately can only result in further inflation, or the need for higher taxes, or the need to cut expenditure further, or a combination of all three. It seems to me that all three hon. Ministers, namely the Ministers of Finance, of Transport and of Posts and Telegraphs, are relying very heavily, or are even gambling, on sufficient growth taking place in order to break this vicious circle. I therefore believe that it is more than pertinent to examine whether the programme of action of the hon. the Minister of Finance is likely to achieve the aim of growth and likely to achieve it in sufficient measure.</p>

<p>I suggest that it is axiomatic that economic growth depends on the greater use and the better directed use of our resources. That means that greater use should be made of our labour resources, including greater productivity, and that greater use should be made of our natural and raw material resources, our capital resources and our entrepreneural resources. I intend dealing, during the time at my disposal, primarily with these measures contained in the Budget which will affect the supply of labour and the supply of capital.</p>

<p><span class="col_4521-4522" refersTo="page_0724"/>First of all I want to say a few words on the subject of business confidence. In a private enterprise society or a capitalist society such as we have in South Africa, business leaders will only proceed with their expansion programmes or undertake new projects if they are confident that they will succeed in making profits by doing so. To have such confidence, they must feel assured that they will have available to them the necessary capital, the necessary labour, the necessary plant and the necessary material, and that they will have an expanding market for their products.</p>

<p>At the moment, as during the last few months, business confidence is at a low ebb. I think we only have to read the latest survey of the Bureau of Economic Research of the University of Stellenbosch to have that confirmed. I suggest that business confidence has been at this low ebb because businessmen have not been certain about certain important factors. They have not been sure of certain overseas factors that effect them, such as currencies; they have not been certain about prices for exports; they have not been certain about what is going to happen when Britain joins the Common Market, but they have also not been certain in respect of some homegrown uncertainties. In that regard I refer specifically to the uncertainties surrounding the supply of labour. I hope that the Government does appreciate the importance of it, so that when it applies the measures announced in the Budget to affect the supply of labour, it will do so with certainty and clarity so that businessmen will know exactly where they are going to stand. I regard this as being particularly important because the overall fiscal picture of the Budget can hardly be described as one which is going to encourage expansionist ideas. We have higher company tax, we have higher individual income tax, we have sales taxes and excise taxes at historically high levels, and we still have hire-purchase restrictions on a severe basis. To me the whole Budget conveys the impression of being a damping-down Budget and if it were not for the fact that there is a slight glimmer of change in direction in regard to non-fiscal measures, such as labour measures, and that there is a slight new emphasis on the supply side of the demand &#x2014;supply equation, I would find the whole position very depressing.</p>

<p>Now I would like to make a few comments on the measures taken in regard to the labour supply. We on this side of the House welcome any measure that is going to lead to greater employment opportunities for non-Whites, particularly the Bantu, in the urban areas. I hope that these measures which have been announced will be meaningful enough to result in some measure of real growth. But I find it regrettable, in fact highly regrettable, that these concessions have been granted so late, that they have been granted so reluctantly, that they have been granted so negatively and that they have been granted in such small measure. To me it is a pity that positive steps were not taken three or four years ago when the shortage of labour really started to become acute, because had they been taken then, many of the problems with which we are faced now, particularly inflation, would not be nearly so severe. I have serious doubts as to whether the reluctant and timid steps which have been taken in regard to the labour position, are going to provide the assurances needed by businessmen before they make their plans to expand, or even whether the steps that have been taken will be sufficient to provide a significant increase in the labour force in order to ensure increased growth. How much better would it not have been had the Government come forward with a bold, comprehensive, imaginative plan to deal with the labour situation&#x003F; I have in mind a plan such as advocated by this side of the House, a practical plan which would have included such measures as housing and allied social measures, a plan which would have included training measures, a plan which, in consultation with the trade unions, would have included increased opportunities for non-Whites to use the skills they have and the skills they are capable of acquiring with proper training. But no; for the time being we must be satisfied with a slight loosening up of the ideological strait jacket which surrounds the Government&#x2019;s labour policies and I must express grave doubts whether this will be sufficient to meet the situation.</p>

<p>I should now like to comment on some of the steps included in the Budget which will affect capital, savings and investment. Here I must again say that I have grave doubts whether they will be effective. It would seem to me that the lifting of the credit ceiling on banks&#x2019; lendings, is really doing little more than making honest men of the bankers&#x2014;in other words legalizing an existing <i>de facto</i> position. It seems to me to be unlikely that these measures will provide any considerable additional amount <span class="col_4523-4524" refersTo="page_0725"/>of finance to the economy. As far as the plans contained in the Budget for savings are concerned, I join in welcoming the home-owners savings scheme. I hope that as far as those categories of the population are concerned who can benefit from it, it will succeed in, on the one hand, encouraging thrift and, on the other hand, increasing home ownership. In particular I hope that the Coloureds and the Indians who, I think, are well place to benefit from this scheme, will take full advantage of it, because I regard home ownership amongst those sections of the population as being a force for good and a force for stability.</p>

<p>I also welcome the new series of national savings certificates, although past experience has shown that this is not a very exciting form of investment. The total figure of national savings certificates and Union Loan Certificates outstanding on 31st March, 1971, the latest figures that are available to me, indicated that this was 70 million, which was a reduction of R6 million over the past year. In other words, there had been a dis-saving on this type of investment over those twelve months.</p>

<p>Against these measures that have been taken to stimulate savings, we have to balance the fact that personal income tax and company tax have both been raised. Raising personal income tax, particularly at the higher levels of income, will do more harm to the ability to save than, I think, will be done good by the other measures contained in the Budget. I think that the hon. the Minister will probably agree with me that the overall effect of the Budget, i.e. higher rates of taxation on individuals, particularly individuals in the higher income groups, plus higher rates of company tax, balanced against these particular incentives, the home-ownership scheme and the new series of national savings certificates, will on balance not be any incentive to increased savings. I regard this as a serious deficiency of the Budget. The fall in savings which we have been experiencing in South Africa for the past few years, has become a very serious problem. In 1967, 12,8 per cent of the gross national product was saved, whereas five years later, in 1971, that figure had fallen to 10,4 per cent. Had the 1967 figure applied in 1971, an additional R325 million would have been saved, which is the equivalent of roughly three-quarters of what was invested in 1971 in private residential buildings.</p>

<p>The matter which I find most disturbing so far as measures taken which will affect capital are concerned, in fact I find it deplorable, is the re-introduction of control over interest rates. I think it is well to recall what the hon. the Minister had to say when he released the banks in August 1970 of their obligation to limit their deposit rates, which was applying at that time. This is what he said in Hansard (Vol. 29, Col. 1538) of 12th August, 1970:</p>

<block name="quote">Controls on deposit rates, in so far as they are effective, prevent interest rates from fulfilling their function, which is to bring the demand for and supply of loan funds into equilibrium through, where necessary, stimulating savings and discouraging investment. They distort the flow of funds in the money and capital markets so that funds tend to flow into uncontrolled investment channels or in directions where the income on investment takes a form other than interest. They stimulate the growth of the so-called &#x201C;grey market&#x201D; where substantially higher interest rates are offered. Experience in the past, and at present, furthermore shows that effective control even of the deposit rates of financial institutions, is very difficult, since the control is often evaded by the payment of commissions and other devices. Because of these many practical difficulties, and because there is a real danger that the continuation of control may add fuel to the fires of inflation, the Reserve Bank after the usual consultation with the Treasury, decided to relieve the banks and building societies of their undertaking &#x2026;</block>

<p>I suggest that what applied in 1970 applies with even more force today. The control which the hon. the Minister of Finance has announced is being imposed at a time when there are definite prospects of improved liquidity in the economy as a result of an improvement in the balance of payments and there are therefore indications that market forces will lead interest rates down to a lower level in any case. But the Minister not satisfied with control over deposit rates has extended this control now to participation mortgage bonds. After his abortive attempt last year to damage participation mortgage bonds schemes by attempting to force them to invest a portion of their funds in Government stocks he now seems intent on destroying them altogether by making them comply with an unrealistically low interest rate. I would <span class="col_4525-4526" refersTo="page_0726"/>suggest that participation mortgage bonds are not an evil but that they fulfil a real need in our economy. They provide a good investment channel for certain types of investor, such as widows, orphans and trusts and charitable institutions who are not bothered by high marginal rates of taxation and they provide a very important source of finance for construction projects such as flats, commercial and industrial buildings. I hope, and I appeal to the hon. the Minister, that even if he decides to proceed with the control of interest rates on participation mortgage bonds for future schemes, he does not tamper with existing schemes. To impose an unrealistic rate of 8&#x00BD; per cent on participation mortgage bonds could well lead to wholesale calling up of the funds invested in them, which in turn would lead to completely chaotic and dangerous conditions developing in the mortgage and property markets. Even though I believe that the financial institutions which have to deal with clients&#x2019; funds and investing clients&#x2019; funds in mortgage bonds, will find other means of investing in mortgage bonds than through participation mortgage bond schemes, those other means are going to be less efficient, more costly and also more costly to administer.</p>

<p>All in all, I am convinced, as the hon. the Minister obviously was convinced himself in 1970, that control of interest rates is likely to be ineffective. But if it is effective, it is going to interfere drastically with the free flow of investment funds into their most productive uses. As such, it is going to be a serious impediment to the proper and healthy growth of the economy. It is therefore a step that I cannot deplore too much. It must lead to uncertainty in the capital and property markets. What sort of development can you expect in flats when flat developers know that the Minister is killing an important source of their finance&#x003F; I say again that the uncertainty resulting from steps of this nature is a real impediment to the economic growth of our country.</p>

<p>To recapitulate on the Budget as a whole, I would suggest that fiscally it continues to be a damping-down Budget, monetarily it is an inflationary Budget, but not a reflationary Budget, and that it does too little to stimulate real growth, savings and business confidence. Therefore, it does too little to fight inflation.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have been listening now to three Opposition speakers on financial matters, and I thought that these three hon. gentlemen would analyse the Budget on an economic-scientific basis, but, apart from the hon. member for Constantia, who mentioned a few things which he welcomed, I am afraid that the hon. members merely dealt haphazardly with a few random points, dragged in a few political issues, and did not analyse the matter on an economic basis. I just want to quote something the hon. member for Parktown, which his Leader said on 27th January, 1959. In the No-confidence Debate of that year, he said (Hansard, column 17)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The third point is the interference by this Government with normal economic stimuli in pursuance of a Native policy which prevents us progressing economically and making the best use of our resources to the full, endangering the future of South Africa, and which may result in South Africa becoming a poor man&#x2019;s country.</block>

<p>This Government has since 1958 given direction and guidance to our economy. It has throughout taken steps when it had to. The hon. member has moved an amendment this afternoon which clashes with the statement his hon. Leader made. Now they are objecting to certain matters. Today they want more action from the Government, while the Leader of the hon. member said at the time that we may not interfere. Over the course of years the hon. members must now make out a case for themselves and decide where they want to be. No, Sir, I can convey to the hon. the Minister my sincere thanks, appreciation and congratulations for having brought us, with the smallest Government Department, what is most certainly the best Budget of his career in this sixth Budget of his. It is being generally well-received and sincerely praised.</p>

<p>Let us see who are praising it. The hon. member for Parktown made quite a number of quotations this afternoon. I just want to mention to the hon. member a few parties that have praised it. <i>Inter alia,</i> the editor of the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Considering the restrictions under which he had to work, Dr. Diederichs performed a meritorious task with his sixth Budget.</block>

<p><span class="col_4527-4528" refersTo="page_0727"/>That is what the <i>Rand Daily Mail,</i> which is most certainly not a friend of ours, had to say. The political correspondent of the <i>Star</i> said for example&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In what is perhaps the most important Budget of his career the Minister of Finance has paved the way for increasing economic activity in South Africa.</block>

<p>Neither is this newspaper a friend of the National Party. The <i>Star</i> concedes reluctantly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Budget shows promise of his being able to achieve his objectives if everything goes well for him.</block>

<p>Sir, this is what they are saying. Let us consider what the other businessmen are saying. The hon. member also referred this afternoon to the businessmen. Firstly I want to take the banking sector. I am going to take the general banking sector. We see first what Mr. D. P. S. van Huyssteen of Volkskas has to say. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The fixing of interest rates is a welcome step, otherwise we will have another interest rate war.</block>

<p>He welcomes it, and Volkskas most certainly has a say in the economy today, a far greater say than hon. members have who objected to it here. What does the Standard Bank say&#x003F; Mr. Gordon Oxford, the General Manager, says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The emphasis now is on growth, as against restrictions in the past. The decreased spending by the State affords industrialists an opportunity of expanding. What is most important of all, however, is that Dr. Diederichs has further stimulated the attitude of businessmen, which was already improving.</block>

<p>It is the Standard Bank which has this to say. It also in this way praises the Budget. Let us consider what a certain Dr. F. J. Cronj&#x00E9;, of Nedbank, had to say. He was a former member of that party; he sat in this House and was one of their main speakers. He said that the lifted credit ceilings was a step in the right direction. He thought it was the right thing to do; things were going well. Let us see what the Association of Chambers of Commerce has to say. Sir, we know that these are their friends, and that these people control 86 per cent of the economy. The President, Mr. M. L. Scher, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister is to be congratulated &#x2026;</block>

<p>Not only I, but he, too, congratulates the Minister&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; on his success in curbing State spending, as well as on his positive action in regard to the abolition of control, such as import control, price control and that on the building industry.</block>

<p>Let us look even further. Let us consider opinions from across the length and breadth of South Africa. Let us see what the Chamber of Mines has to say. The president, Mr. J. W. Schilling, says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa&#x2019;s mineral industry is going to support Dr. Diederichs in increasing exports.</block>

<p>This is a positive attitude. They want to contribute their share for South Africa. That is more thon I can say about this Opposition. Even the Federation of Trade Unions welcomes this Budget. This is the labourer of South Africa, the friend of the National Party, and they know where they should seek their salvation. Let us glance at the newspapers. The hon. member quoted what the newspapers had allegedly said. I take the <i>Cape Times</i> of 30th March. I read there : &#x201C;S.A. Budget welcomed in London&#x201D;. It is welcomed even in London, not only here in South Africa. Let us look at the &#x201C;Business Report&#x201D; of the <i>Cape Times</i> &#x2014;&#x201C;A shrewd Budget all round&#x201D;. There it stands in large print. The people are jubilant about it. Let us consider the newspaper headlines in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> of 30th March : &#x201C;Industry and Commerce, two cheers&#x201D;. There is jubilation. <i>Die Burger</i> says : &#x201C;It could be the turning point.&#x201D; Things are going very well. So we can go through all of them. Here is one report which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To the point: The initial general reaction of commerce, industry and investment circles was one of moderate praise for the economic stimulus which they saw in the Budget.</block>

<p>In this way we could quote them all.</p>

<p>But I want to go further. The hon. the Minister told us that he had three objectives&#x2014;the improvement of the balance of <span class="col_4529-4530" refersTo="page_0728"/>payments, a more rapid growth rate and the curbing of inflation. I think it would be the right thing to do if we tested the Budget against these three objectives. Let us not approach it from a political but from a financial-economic point of view. Throughout my speech I want to point out to hon. members how consistently this Budget answers to these objectives of the hon. the Minister. It is admitted by all economists that it is difficult to achieve a balance between economic growth and stability. That is what the hon. the Minister told us in his speech. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In present circumstances and in the short run, there is inevitably some conflict between these objectives&#x2014;for example, between maximum growth on the one hand, and price stability and balance of payments equilibrium on the other.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister knew that it was very difficult, but he tackled the problem and gave us the right medicine.</p>

<p>If we consult authorities from the U.S.A., like P. A. Samuelson, Hains and Zawadzki, we find that their definition of this aspect is as follows : To achieve a balance between the annual addition to the available supply, goods and services, i.e. economic growth, and a situation where the supply (i.e. the production) and the demand (i.e. the amount of money and credit available), is sufficient to make the desirable economic growth of the national economy possible without unleashing inflatory or deflatory forces, is definitely a very difficult task. This the authorities will tell you, and this is what the hon. the Minister said, but with this Budget the hon. the Minister has succeeded in accomplishing this. For that we are very grateful.</p>

<p>This inflasionistic pressure which could develop, may come from two sides, i.e. from the supply side as well as from the demand side. It is therefore situated in the financial as well as in the real sphere. Let us in the first place consider the demand side. The four most important inflasionistic factors in regard to demand are the following: The monetary supply, the available monetary income, consumer spending and the overseas demand. I am going to deal with each of these four factors, and on this basis find to what extent this Budget meets the requirements set by the Minister. Let us first consider the monetary supply. The monetary supply consists for the most part of two elements. Firstly there are the excessive deposits on call which are the result of Government expenditure, and secondly there is the excessive granting of credit by the banking sector in the form of loans and overdraft banking facilities. These are the two elements, and in this respect the Budget succeeds handsomely. Government expenditure has definitely been reduced. The hon. members know this. This is in fact a matter which they kicked up a great fuss about in the past, but when it suits them, then the State is not doing enough.</p>

<p>Let us consider what happens in the case of the available monetary income. I referred to this during the discussion of the Part Appropriation Bill, and I pointed out in full detail how wages have increased far more rapidly than the cost of living. The facts which I stated in February during the Part Appropriation debate, are underlined by a Mercabank publication of March, 1972, on page 5. In other words, a month later they underlined precisely what I had said. The hon. member for Parktown admits that this is the case, and I am pleased that he is doing so. To this can still be added that the Minister has, in this delicate situation, taken the interests of John Citizen to heart, and he has placed this first by abolishing the compulsory tax levy, which in effect means that John Citizen will have more money at his disposal to meet his needs. That is what the hon. the Minister wanted, and that is what he did.</p>

<p>Thirdly, we may also consider consumer spending. What happened in this sphere&#x003F; We know that the gross internal spending rate decreased in 1971, and that it was 11,2 per cent in comparison with 14,3 per cent in 1970. The real rate of increase in the gross internal spending of 9 per cent in 1970 was forced down by the anti-inflasionistic measures of this Government to approximately 4 per cent in 1971, which indicates that an equilibrium has been achieved between spending and the gross internal product. What more can we expect of a Government than to achieve this, in a period of overseas problems which have had an effect on our economy&#x003F; I think that what has been accomplished here is a miracle. These facts are known to the Opposition. They know that the Government has not only succeeded in combating inflation, but also in creating the necessary climate for the next round of economic growth. Now they are talking about the economic growth. This Government has already created that climate.</p>

<p>Let us consider the position in respect of <span class="col_4531-4532" refersTo="page_0729"/>overseas demand. The overseas demand in respect of goods and services which have South Africa as the country of origin does not produce problems in so far as it increases the inflasionistic pressure, but there are other problems which have an effect on this. This situation is reflected further in the balance of payments which has since 1964, shown a deficit, and to which I shall return at a later stage.</p>

<p>In addition, I want to consider the supply side. As I have said, there are two sides, i.e. the demand side and the supply side. The supply side is situated for the most part in the real sphere, and the influencing of the real sphere occurs for the most part through the fiscal instruments. Here, too, the Budget has succeeded in stimulating the stream of goods and services in order to bring about stability. This is true, and we cannot get away from it. The emphasis in this Budget did not fall only on fiscal measures, this Budget meets the need to establish a mixture of fiscal and monetary measures. Mr. Speaker, an excessive application of monetary measures without the support of fiscal policy can, under inflationistic conditions, unleash expectations which lead to excessive increases in interest rates, and here, too, the Government has taken the necessary steps which will prevent such a situation. Not only is it the purpose of the timeous announcement of deposit rate control to prevent an interest rate war, but also to protect John Citizen, and particularly in that sector which is sensitive to interest rates, i.e. housing.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to express my thanks for the house ownership savings scheme envisaged for the middle and lower income groups. Here I want to add that this National Party will always look after the interests of the worker, not only as far as his salary is concerned, but also as far as his housing is concerned.</p>

<p>Sir, let us consider public debt. If this Government is as bad as is being made out, then the position as far as our public debt is concerned, should also be a bad one. In South Africa we cannot finance all our expenditure from revenue; we must, in part, finance our State expenditure from loans, and in this way our public debt, originates. It is important that we should consider the structure of our public debt. The State must, as with all other lenders on the money and capital market, compete to finance its loan programmes. Marketable Government stock forms the most important loan instrument in this regard. To impart suppleness to the monetary and capital market it is essential that the market should have adequate securities at their disposal, i.e. instruments of debt which are easily marketable. Public debt as a percentage of the gross national product has decreased during the past decade, as is clearly indicated in the statistical survey on page 35, from 45,6 per cent in 1961, to 41,5 per cent in 1971. As against this the gross national product has increased from R5 277 million to R13 141 million over the same period, i.e. by 59,9 per cent. Mr. Speaker, these figures are self-evident. While the gross national product has increased, the total public debt, as a percentage, has decreased. This underlines irrefutably the sound method of financing by this Government.</p>

<p>In addition, it is important to take a further look at the method of financing, and the best comparable criterion here is the marketable internal public debt as against the non-marketable internal public debt. I want to put it to you that in the year 1960-&#x2019;61 the marketable internal public debt was 78,6 per cent as against a non-marketable internal public debt of 21,4 per cent. For the years 1970-&#x2019;71 the marketable portion increased from 78,6 per cent to 83,1 per cent, while the non-marketable portion decreased from 21,4 per cent to 16,9 per cent. This development indicates that the Government itself is striving for a suppleness in respect of our negotiable instruments of debt. If you are able to do this you bring suppleness to the capital market and you find that the money will flow and in that way stimulate the economy.</p>

<p>Let us take a further look at our loan levies and at the effect which this Budget will have in this respect. What has the hon. the Minister done here&#x003F; This is a very important component of our public debt, to which this Budget is giving attention. Between 1962, when this component was first introduced, and last year these increased from 14 per cent to 43,7 per cent. As hon. members know, loan levies are not marketable and while in 1962 they amounted to only 2 per cent of the total marketable internal debt, they amounted to 7,7 per cent in 1972, which is a tremendous percentage. The fact that this increased so tremendously shows us that the monetary market must have been negatively affected, as the hon. member will agree. This element is now being eliminated from public debt, and is it not a good thing&#x003F; I want to <span class="col_4533-4534" refersTo="page_0730"/>know whether the Opposition does not agree with this&#x003F; This compulsory form of savings levy, together with the 5 per cent which will now be paid back, is in accordance with our objective with this Budget, and it results in tremendous economic growth. The hon. the Minister announced that it would put R30 million into the pockets of John Citizen, but according to the Secretary for Internal Revenue I see it as R35 million.</p>

<p>Another important aspect which we may consider is the short and long-term public debt. It is very significant that in respect of the marketable securities debt, the short-term debt for the years 1961-&#x2019;71 increased from 11,4 per cent to 22,1 per cent in 1971, while the long-term debt over the same period decreased from 88,6 per cent to 77,9 per cent. This trend is in its essence structurally unsound. It is distorted, and we cannot allow it, but in this case as well the hon. the Minister has come along and rectified it. Now we must also note that it is primarily the banking sector and the building societies which are interested in the short-term Government stock and that their portfolio of long-term Government stock is diminishing progressively, as also appears from the statistical survey. The short-term stock is a liquid means; it is a good substitute for money. That is why these two sectors, the banking sector and the building societies, pay special attention to this, for they can very easily convert it into money without any risk of capital loss. A too great increase in the liquid means is potentially inflationistic and undesirable from the point of view of monetary control, and for that reason it was essential that the hon. the Minister give consideration to this matter, which he subsequently did. In addition, I should just like to say that the holders of the short-term Government stock, the banking sector and the building societies, went too far here. These two groups are the two groups which are absolutely dependent on monetary stability in South Africa to ensure their progress and their planning. Therefore I want to advocate here today that this unfavourable trend should be revised and that as far as the compulsory prescribed investments by these institutions are concerned, consideration should be given to a possible increase of the percentage which has to be invested on a long-term basis. If the hon. the Minister could pay attention to that I foresee that even our public debt could in future be better maintained.</p>

<p>I also want to refer to another matter today, and this is in connection with something contained in the majority finding of the Franzsen Commission, in its report on the monetary and physical policy of South Africa. I want to put it that land is one of our most important production factors, and I want to put it further that land is scarce in South Africa. By virtue of this fact, land fulfils a dual purpose today. In the first place it provides space on which production can take place, and it provides living space. The second point is that it serves as a means of entrenchment against the erosion of money in times of inflation. Let me also put it to you that capital gains tax is not a strange phenomenon in the United States of America, England, France, Germany and Sweden. Unfortunately land has become a speculative element within the South African national economy, to such an extent that it has an influence on the cost structure of everyone, from the householder to the farmer. Over-capitalization has become an accomplished fact in this country, and I want to put it to you, Sir, that this is something we cannot allow. Since land is a relatively scarce commodity, I can see no objection in principle to the elimination of speculation concerning it. I want to put it that capital gains tax on a discriminatory basis and only in respect of land will, in my humble opinion, be able to contribute to land no longer being utilized as a means of entrenchment in South Africa. When I advocate this, I want to say that it should be discriminatory in respect of the surface area as far as our agricultural land and the land in our residential areas is concerned; our people must be able to obtain land inexpensively so that our young people can build houses, and the young people who want to make a career of farming are able to obtain agricultural land more cheaply. I am excluding mineral rights and any other rights attached from this subterranean rights, water rights, to it, but I am advocating that consideration should be given to the surface area and that we should no longer allow this to be a speculative commodity in our national economy. On the day we are once again able to provide our people with inexpensive land, I shall be a very happy man, and thousands of young married couples, and also hundreds and thousands of young men who want to make a career of farming will join me in rejoicing if this were to happen. Once we have succeeded in doing that, we would have made a great <span class="col_4535-4536" refersTo="page_0731"/>deal of progress. But it is not only the Government, but also the private sector which will have to make a contribution to this end.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister also told us quite a good deal in the Budget about the promotion of exports. South Africa is to a certain extent dependent upon capital inflow to carry out our financing programme. As a result of political pressure a vast capital outflow developed in South Africa in the past between the years 1959 and 1964. Capital inflow is unfortunately not the safest remedy for financing an unfavourable balance of trade, something which South Africa has been experiencing since the second quarter of 1964. Nor can gold be relied upon in future as an item for bringing about a favourable balance of trade. It is essential therefore that certain priorities will have to be set today in order to determine which sectors of the economy constitute the greatest possibilities for proceeding with export promotion. As the hon. the Minister put it in his Budget speech, it does in fact appear as if the refinement of our base metals presents exceptional possibilities. I want to allege that the sector which presents the greatest possibilities for the expansion of exports is the mining sector. It so happens that the world prices for primary commodities are low, and considering the possibility of Britain&#x2019;s entry to the European Common Market, there is the prospect of only marginal increases in the export of agricultural produce. Therefore we cannot expect a considerable income from that sector, in spite of any large harvests which we may have. By virtue of the foregoing it is therefore of fundamental importance that very serious attention should be paid to the marketing of refined and semi-refined minerals and metals. I think it is in the national interest that the refinement of minerals and metals should receive an absolute priority, particularly since we have during the past two decades been virtually giving away our minerals and metals abroad. The refinement industry offers two tentative possibilities which could have a beneficial effect on the economy. It could contribute to a sound growth level of our national product, and as earner of foreign exchange it could also contribute towards eliminating the deficit on our balance of payments. In addition it constitutes the possibility of saving on foreign exchange, and could make us internally self-sufficient. It will also be able to assist us in other spheres. It is general knowledge that South Africa has the largest chrome and manganese reserves in the entire world. This competitive ability which we have we should exploit to its maximum extent as quickly as possible. Other minerals which could be mentioned in this regard are for example fluospar and antimony. This situation indicates clearly that the longer the delay in obtaining the maximum value from these mineral resources, the more the overseas buyer will become conditioned and equipped to processing their own minerals, and our unprocessed raw materials. We shall have to act very quickly, and seen as a whole an attempt to process ore to a maximum extent will also contribute to alleviating the pressure on our infrastructure, for in the case of the Railways for example it would improve the position in regard to railway lines and rolling stock, since it would not then be necessary to transport all the raw materials to the harbours. Only a portion thereof will be transported to the harbours in the form of refined minerals. If we take a further look at our contracts for the supply of raw materials in the long-term, it is also clear that it is very essential that priority be given to this matter, for many minerals are linked to the business cycle fluctuations overseas, which is very detrimental to us. Time does not allow me to go into all these aspects in full, but I do want to point out that the Government has in this respect as well taken timeous steps, by appointing the Reynders Commission for example. I think that we should in this respect as well convey our praise and our gratitude to the Government. The hon. members of the Opposition, however, have overlooked this development.</p>

<p>I therefore advocate the refinement of our raw materials, and ask that urgent attention should be paid to this matter. I request that a positive climate should be created by means of the following four aspects : Railway transportation rates, power supply tariffs, financing of exports, and import protection for the refinement of these minerals and metals. It is very clear to us that freight and harbour facilities is one of the most important elements in this export promotion attempt. It is of the utmost importance that we should give consideration to this matter. I put it that if these facilities are provided, the annual estimated value of the exports, as furnished by the Department of Mines, could amount to R1 334 million by 1988&#x2014;equal to approximately <span class="col_4537-4538" refersTo="page_0732"/>one and a half times our annual gold production. The steps announced by the hon. the Minister to promote our exports are in general very, very welcome. This is now a team effort, in which the private sector can no longer point a finger at the Government, but will have to contribute its own share. I would urge the hon. the Opposition rather to ask their people to look into this matter.</p>

<p>In conclusion just the following: Thank you for this wonderful Budget. [Interjections.] Let us go to meet the future with faith, hope and confidence. Let everyone do his duty, apply his services productively and work to live in our beautiful country,</p>

<speech by="#van_hoogstraten">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. A. VAN HOOGSTRATEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Sunnyside relied heavily in his opening comments upon quotations as to the early reaction to the Budget, but he did not tell this hon. House what the background climate was which preceded the thinking of the hon. the Minister of finance in preparing the Budget, the climate in which we had seen the economy of South Africa reduced to an almost all-time low, the man in the street suffering, the harsh implementation of a tax policy, a high and almost uncontrollable cost of living and a rate of inflation which was certainly unhealthy for South Africa. It was against this background that possibly the finance houses and the financial Press have breathed a sigh of relief that at least something was done to stabilize the economy in its disastrous state. Initially I want to thank the hon. the Minister of Finance for one concession he has made, namely the reduction of the sales tax by almost 50 per cent in its application to the boat building industry when, last March, he authorized the reduction of the tax from 30 per cent to 15 per cent. Thereby he saved the industry from annihilation and he revitalized that industry which is playing a tremendous part in the growth factor in this country. I think as a result of this concession which he made after he had been approached by the yachting industry and sportsmen throughout South Africa, we can now look forward to the 1973 International Atlantic Rio Race attracting some 100 entries from overseas. The boost to South African tourism and publicity and goodwill as a result of this gesture is almost immeasurable.</p>

<p>I want to follow the various images which the hon. the Minister of Finance has endeavoured to create during past years in his steering of our economic policies. He has on occasion endeavoured to reveal himself as a doctor administering to the needs of the economy, as a gardener in pruning the economy, as an engine driver in keeping the economy along the twin rails of parallel development, and in this year&#x2019;s Budget has endeavoured to create the image of the benevolent Bard prescribing for the revitalization of what is obviously a flagging economy. The hon. the Minister has waxed poet and drawn heavily on quotations from Shakespeare, but one almost hoped that he would have been slightly more patriotic in his fervour by quoting from South Africa&#x2019;s own Leonard Flemming who exposed so brilliantly and so incisively our own South African way of living, our philosophies and our shortcomings in his &#x201C;Fool on the Veld&#x201D;. This House will long rate the Trinity of the 1972 Budget speeches, that of the hon. the Minister of Transport, the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs and that of the hon. the Minister of Finance, as the most revealing in the whole history of the Nationalist Government. For South Africa the moment of truth has arrived. We are experiencing stagflation, that is stagnation and inflation. A once wealthy country with a vibrant economy, massive reserves and international recognition, we are now faced with these facts and with rejection in the way of growing hostility of the word at large. We have in fact reached the stage where we must review the hon. the Minister of Finance in his role of Old Mother Hubbard, who &#x201C;went to the cupboard to fetch her poor dog a bone; when she got there, the cupboard was bare and so the poor dog had none&#x201D;. The hon. the Minister will forgive me when I say that we on this side of the House see him rather in the role of a pilot on a salvage tug making a desperate effort to escort a badly crippled ship of State from stormy waters into relatively calmer seas. For all too long the hon. the Minister, together with the hon. the Prime Minister, has been playing the role of the hopeless optimist. They have not only been misleading themselves, but they have been misleading the public of South Africa as to our economic welfare. They have misrepresented the course the economy is taking and they have ignored the storm warnings which have been sent out so clearly by financial speakers throughout the country&#x2019;s economy.</p>

This Government cannot escape the responsibility for the present state of the economy.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. A. VAN HOOGSTRATEN</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; his misfortunes here, his inability to have his children educated and to bring up his family under the present circumstances. He is not concerned with the economy of France, Belgium, Britain or America. The Nationalist Government has built up a top-heavy civil service and the Government has drained our economic resources in order to build up uneconomic border industries. The Government has discouraged immigration at a time when our manpower resources are taxed to breaking point. We have hamstrung our economy with the physical planning legislation, job reservation and other restrictive labour legislation. But the real tragedy of the present Budget as presented by the hon. the Minister of Finance, lies in the stark fact that once again he has budgeted for an economy hide-bound by past prejudices and circumscribed by present Nationalist inwardthinking attitudes. He has ignored the wider horizons and the exciting challenges of a South Africa which accepts the truth that we are a country of some 21 million persons, that we have the economic potential to cater for the wants of such a population, that we have untapped labour resources with which we can justify the fullest use of our vast mineral reserves. To this extent the hon. the Minister of Finance has presented only a half Budget. He has again ignored the real potential of our great country.</p>

<p>But there are signs that the Cabinet&#x2019;s blinkers are coming down. Last year the hon. the Minister indicated that he was prepared to have a dialogue with the industrialists. It is known that this year an excellent brochure prepared by the Federated Chamber of Industries was presented to the Government and was discussed with parties on both sides of the House. There are clear indications that in that brochure it was made clear to the Minister of Economic Affairs, the Minister of Finance and other Cabinet Ministers that our problems are in no way short-term and that they cannot be conquered by stop-go policies. They are long-term problems. Our labour situation is desperate; our balance of payments position is serious; inflation remains an illness which will not be conqured overnight. The Government is at last taking some steps to recognize that commerce and industry know no politics; they talk in the interests of South Africa, unlike the philosophy of the Nationalist Government itself.</p>

<p>We have a significant change of direction in the Government&#x2019;s economic policies. It was only last year that the &#x201C;demp&#x201D; schools&#x2019; philosophy was being propounded across the floor of this House and that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and we on this side of the House, propounded a &#x201C;growth&#x201D; philosophy that pleaded for a higher growth rate. It was supported by such men as Mr. Jan Haak who said: &#x201C;Give us 6 per cent; give us increased immigration.&#x201D; We have had our economy damped down until we experienced the situation just prior to this Budget, where we had reached a stage of chaos and crisis. As a result of this, we are now not even holding the 5,5 per cent growth rate which the Economic Advisory Committee in its economic development programme for South Africa, propounded. The chairman of the Economic Advisory Committee, Dr. Riekert, has made one startling statement, namely that the 5&#x00BD; per cent which has been suggested as the optimum growth rate, is based on the acceptance of the situation as is, ignoring the fact that we have no statistics indicating the proportion of our non-European population that is either unemployed or under-employed. What a scientific basis on which to project a programme up till 1975! The Government continues to ignore the fact that the silent majority, which has no vote in this country&#x2019;s destiny, will inevitably dictate our economic well-being. It is to the hon. the Minister of Finance&#x2019;s credit that he has at last paid some attention to the appeals by the private sector in reducing in some small <span class="col_4541-4542" refersTo="page_0734"/>measure the incidence of a marginal rate of personal tax plus the loan levy. But he would have done much better had he reduced this rate to the Franszen Commission&#x2019;s 60 per cent limit and thereby given a real incentive to industrialists to use their entrepreneuring ability and restore our country to the growth path we are seeking. For all too long the Government has been suspicious of the business sector and it has seen them as being anti-Government, which of course is stupid and irrelevant. Perhaps the viewpoint of commerce and industry is best expressed and most concisely stated in the annual report of Rand Mines when the chairman, Mr. C. S. Barlow stated, <i>inter alia :</i></p>

<block name="quote">More than ever in the difficult times which this country is facing will it be necessary for Government and industry to work more closely together and for the Government to understand and not to view with suspicion the importance of making profits.</block>

<p>Without profits we cannot possibly go forward, nor can the economy expand. Methods other than the increased taxation of profits and the removal of management incentive through over-taxation must be found to finance the country&#x2019;s needs if growth is to be encouraged. During the No-confidence Debate the Prime Minister pooh-poohed the idea that the economy was running into difficulties, but the facts speak for themselves. The building industry is in dire straits and cannot see a revival of constructional activity until 1973 according to the Bureau of Economic Research at Stellenbosch. The motor industry, on the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own acceptance, is struggling for profits, and is in the doldrums. The hotel industry is in a mess and is heading for lean times during the next few years. The clothing industry has reached the point almost of collapse. The fishing industry is almost on its knees. In the Cape alone some 46 trading companies whose debts may eventually exceed R10 million went into provisional or final liquidation during the month of February. It is assumed that if businesses continue to crash at the present rate as many as 750 could be wiped out during this year. This is surely not a prosperous state of affairs with which the National Government can preen itself. It is against this background that we on this side of the House make our plea to the Government not to underestimate the profit motive in the need for the motivation of our economy, for nothing can be more damaging than the excessive Government controls and bureaucratic interference which the business machine has been experiencing. It was Dr. Anton Rupert who highlighted the impact on the Treasury of profit curbs when he drew attention to the fact that a 15 per cent drop in turnover could result in a 45 per cent drop in profit with disastrous results for the tax collector.</p>

<p>The Budget of 1972 will remain a stop-go budget. Despite all the token assurances and gestures by the hon. the Minister of Finance, nothing that has been done is likely to restore the long-term confidence of business or create overseas investment in this country on a long-term basis. I do want to remind the hon. the Minister that if he pays heed to the profound statement made by his colleague, the hon. the Minister of the Interior that time is running out for South Africa and that we only have this decade in which to make or break our great country, then he must be more urgent and more perceptive in his approaches to our fiscal and monetary problems. I want to quote from the Chamber of Industries who stated in their report:&#x201C;If we want to promote actively the implementation of a meaningful export programme,&#x201D; and we must export or explode in South Africa, &#x201C;then we must pay heed to the necessity that South Africa today cannot afford to mount costly programmes of disproportionately rapid decentralization&#x201D; at this moment. This was stated for the very valid reason that experience already gained as clearly demonstrated two real cost limitations on such ideological decentralization. The first is the high cost of creating adequate industrial infrastructures when and where these are required, and the second is the high cost of compensating industrial firms for moving to remote areas against economic trends.</p>

<p>I do want to place on record one blunder which the hon. the Minister of Finance made in his speech and one which should not be repeated in the future Budget speeches of Ministers. I refer to his announcement of further minor concessions to the motor trade, made at five minutes past three on the day of his speech. The hon. the Minister of Finance overlooked the fact that the Johannesburg Stock Exchange remains open until 3.30 p.m. and the indication that certain concessions would be made to the housing industry <span class="col_4543-4544" refersTo="page_0735"/>and to the motor industry was immediately interpreted into action, and profitable action, by persons who knew which companies on the Stock Exchange stood to benefit from the benefits bestowed on them by these tax concessions. After all the trouble the Minister takes to have his Budget remain secret until it is presented in the House, this I think he will agree, was a severe error of judgment.</p>

<p>I now want to come to a less satisfactory aspect of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Budget proposals. I refer to the minor concessions which were made to the motor industry. The hon. the Minister stated that the motor industry has been going through a difficult period as a result of his previous taxation and H.P. restrictions and that sales were at a comparatively low level just at a time when the Government&#x2019;s desire to force phase three of its local content programme requirements through, was calling for considerable capital investment by the industry itself. He stated that he felt that this sad state of affairs justified some small concessions to the industry. I believe that the Minister has hopelessly underrated and underestimated the impact of the motor industry as an inflationary influence on our South African way of living, and he has also underestimated the effect which the high costs of motor cars, motor servicing, tractors, and general sales is having on the man in the street. We do not regard the concessions made by the hon. the Minister as significant at all. In fact, they will have almost no bearing on the sales of motor vehicles. It is a fact that cars in South Africa are probably of the highest price range in the world, and in this regard I want to take three examples. The Volkswagen Beetle, as manufactured in South Africa, is 43 per cent more expensive than in Germany; the Toyota Corona is 100 per cent more expensive than in Japan, and the Ford Capri is 35 per cent more expensive than in Britain. I will come to the argument that we must pay for the luxury of a motor industry, but one cannot at this moment in time when the country is struggling under such economic disabilities, justify these high prices in the light of the Government&#x2019;s present policies. I make no apology for a restatement of some of the facts of the matter, because I believe that it is today only economic reality which is making the Government face the facts of the situation. Just as they have in the last three Budgets made concessions in the field of labour restrictions, in the field of Bantu restrictions, I know that they may now do so in the field of the motor industry, if it is to be restored to a healthy state and if the man in the street&#x2019;s interests are to be given due regard as well. If the hon. the Minister is sincere in his desire to use his budgetary armoury of fiscal and monetary weapons in order to curb inflation as one of his three primary objectives which he has stated himself, then his treatment of the motor industry lacks direction and lacks responsibility. In fact, the Government&#x2019;s handling of the motor industry in South Africa, which is the third largest industry after mining and farming, has been inept in the extreme. It is the Government that is responsible for the industry&#x2019;s trouble and which is also the cause that the taxpayer is paying artificially high prices for private cars that these cars are not of a standard which is enjoyed by persons overseas where quality is given regard to, and that our repair costs are also disproportionately and inordinately high. This hits at the farming industry, the distributive industry, the transport industry and at the man in the street, and has become a point which is a burning issue in South Africa and one for which the Government should have due regard.</p>

<p>I want to refer briefly to the initial implementation of phase three of the motor industry, which calls for a total local content by 1976 of some 66 per cent. This policy was announced in 1970 and implemented in January, 1971. The hon. the Minister knows full well that the Franzsen report has questioned the Government&#x2019;s wisdom in implementing a policy which calls for an investment of R160 million at a time when our country is experiencing the pangs of inflation. The Franzsen report recognized that way back in 1962, at the time of Sharpeville, the implementation of phase two as a gesture to revitalize the industry and the South African economy was acceptable. That took place at a time when we had a surplus of labour, raw material and capital; but to force phase three on an industry at a time when we were short in both managerial skill and manpower, was absolute folly and has had as a result this tremendous upsurge in the inflationary trend. The Government has come back and said that it must stand by the industry. But in the very same breath the hon. the Minister, in addressing an international meeting of the Motor Trade, made headlines when he told the world at <span class="col_4545-4546" refersTo="page_0736"/>large that the public was being made to pay for the high cost of phase three by the motor industry. In everything the Government has done about phase three, it has been wrong. It has assumed that there would be a reduction in models in order to bring about a larger scale of manufacturing production, and so lessen unit costs. But the bald facts are that in this country, like in any other country in the world, we have 15 manufacturers producing some 41 or 43 different models. Nothing the Government has done since 1960 has stimulated the tendency to reduce the number of models. The hon. the Minister of Finance, and possibly the Minister of Economic Affairs, have overlooked the fact that many of the overseas countries have placed in South Africa their plant and equipment for the manufacture of vehicles, which have been thoroughly amortized and stand in their books at almost zero. In order to maintain face we will have all the Japanese, American, Continental and British vehicles manufactured in South Africa at an average of 5 000 vehicles per year per manufacturer&#x2014;a ridiculous state of affairs, which can only drive up the costs of motoring to South Africans at large. In the same degree we are paying up to 50 per cent and 100 per cent more for our local replacement components than we would have paid had these been produced overseas. In addition, none of the Government&#x2019;s policies in promoting the growth of the motor industry to this vast and unnecessary extent, have resulted in the saving of foreign exchange. What we are not paying for the import of vehicles, we are paying for the import of capital equipment and those parts which cannot be made here. To make it worse, we had the incident last year when, because of the high taxation on motor vehicles through sales tax, the hon. the Minister of Finance did not realize that the motorist would use his privilege and start using the light commercial vehicle as an alternative, a vehicle on which he paid neither import duty nor sales tax. So today we have a fantastic growth in the light commercial vehicle business, which is not helping the country. They are brought in either unassembled or fully assembled on their wheels, and the country is lapping them up. We have not only expended unnecessary foreign exchange, but we have done a disservice to the motor manufacturing industry. Until the Government gives some indication that it will impose its local content programme on the light commercial vehicle as such, it is no good merely endeavouring to impose a further H.P. responsibility on the purchaser of light commercial vehicles if he is not a legitimate user or a farmer. These vehicles sales are increasing and the motor manufacturers are struggling against the fact that they have invested fantastic rates of capital.</p>

<p>In conclusion I do want to say one word about the quality of the vehicles that we are having to use in this country. Because of the tremendous rate of development in the motor industry in America, Europe and Britain, almost every year models are coming out with new safety devices and new and improved technical devices. Because of our intention that we will force an uneconomic phase three content policy on the industry, we are going to be left with obsolete vehicles with all their inherent dangers, which in many cases are resulting in the sort of death rate which we are experiencing on our roads at the moment. It is unforgiveable that we should deny to the South African public the right, if they so desire and are prepared to pay the legimate taxes, to have the best the world can offer in this country.</p>

<p>In addition, because of the Government&#x2019;s labour policies, the man in the street is finding it exorbitantly expensive to run a motor vehicle&#x2014;not because of the basic price, which is heavy enough, but because of the high costs of repairs. It is known today that the ordinary mechanic is earning as much as R400 per month. The current rate for repairs is some R6-50 per hour, and the ordinary man in the street just cannot face a break-down of his vehicle. This Government must face up to the fact that it is necessary, in consultation with the trade unions, to see to it that the number of mechanics who are available to service the tractor fleet of our farmers and our industrial and private motor vehicle fleet is increased almost threefold. In order to do that, we will have to train the non-European further, and he is capable of being trained. To deny him the right to be trained will merely mean that the present motor-owning population will run the risk that through badly serviced cars the danger element on the roads will not decrease but increase.</p>

[Laughter.] No, there is no need to laugh about that. The hon. member must stop his cackling and listen carefully now.

<p>Until November we had an inflation rate of just over 7 per cent per year, but the breakthrough came in November, and here are the figures to prove it. How, then, can a man like the hon. member for Gardens say that we are living in a state of uncontrolled cost of living&#x003F; Surely the increase in the cost of living has been brought under control; in the past few months the situation has changed. The hon. member went on to say: &#x201C;Nothing will restore business confidence in South Africa.&#x201D; I want to say to him that, under the present circumstances more business confidence is prevailing in South Africa than ever before. If he does not know this, he is a stranger in Jerusalem; then he does not move in business circles. No, the hon. member should not come here with such wild statements. The hon. member then went further and attacked the Minister about a &#x201C;blunder&#x201D; he had allegedly made by broadcasting his Budget speech while the Stock Exchange was not closed. Why does he not propose that we should have a general public holiday on the day the Budget Speech is delivered; that everything should be closed on that day; that nobody may do business on that day&#x003F; Is this what he wants&#x003F; It was a childish statement. It is a statement which he had read somewhere in a newspaper and he then repeated His Master&#x2019;s Voice here.</p>

<p>Sir, at the beginning of this session the Opposition Press and hon. members opposite made swaggering statements every day about the terrible &#x201C;economic mess&#x201D; in which we had allegedly landed. In addition, their newspapers said how hon. members opposite would attack us in the no-confidence debate. One of their newspapers&#x2014; I think it was the <i>Sunday Times,</i> but I am not sure&#x2014;spoke of the eight financial stars they have on that side who would supposedly demolish us on this side.

All that remained for us on this side of the House to do, were some mopping-up operations. That is all we had to do. I think that Press reporter is still squirming in embarrassment because, as the hon. the Minister of Community Development said on occasion, he did not even see candelights which he regarded as stars; he only saw fireflies. Never in my life have I seen such confusion as we got from the financial speakers opposite who have participated in the debate thus far. They reminded me of a lot of wild mules jumping over the paddock gate one by one and each following his own direction. Each of them had his own policy, to such an extent that the hon. member for Parktown, the main speaker of the Opposition on financial matters, became so despondent and frustrated that in the Third Reading Debate on the Part Appropriation Bill he said to the Minister &#x2014;I think you will find it in column 1550: &#x201C;It does not matter what the hon. member for Constantia said.

<p>The hon. member should just wait a little. Sir, as far as their arguments about this Budget are concerned, they are as lost and forlorn as they were in the debate on the Part Appropriation Bill. We have heard absolutely nothing from them about the central theme of this Budget. I sat here listening to the hon. member for Gardens. He spoke for minutes about the motor car industry; he did not speak about the central theme of the Budget. Hon. members opposite sought arguments about secondary things which are not important. The Hon. member for Parktown issued a wild challenge to us. Let us take a look at what he in fact said.</p>

<block name="quote">Let any single member on that side of the House, when he enters this debate, tell me one single thing the hon. the Minister has done this afternoon which is beneficial and which has not been offered from this side of the House, from industry, commerce and from every knowledgeable economist in the country. That is the challenge; we wait for the answer.</block>

<p>Sir, this Budget is a good one; last year&#x2019;s Budget was also a good one, and the one the year before that was also a good one. These Budgets were designed to meet the requirements prevailing at the time. Sir, the requirements of the time determine whether one should apply popular or unpopular measures. It is typical of the United Party that they want to go along with the stream when measures are introduced which are popular among the voters and the taxpayers and beneficial to them, and want to pretend that it is their policy which is being followed by the Government. I want to accuse the United Party of not having a long-term or even a short-term economic policy at all. They have never given it to us, although they continually ask the hon. the Minister for a blue print. But what do they do&#x003F; They have a purely negative approach to the economy; it is based on exploiting the bottleneck of the moment, and in this way they want to stir up grievances.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. S. D. ERASMUS</person>:</from>

<p>They run with the hares and hunt with the hounds. Sir, surely they know very well that in the economy you can move in only two directions. On the one hand you can move in the direction of restrictive, unpopular measures; on the other hand you can move in a direction of growth or expansion, in which case you introduce popular measures. But this Government moves the economy in one single direction, namely the direction which is in the national interest. It moves the economy in the direction which ensures price stability as well as labour stability, regardless of whether it has to introduce popular or unpopular measures. After all, it is very easy for the Opposition to clamour for popular measures during the unpopular period. It is no secret what measures the Government is going to introduce; they know what steps it is going to take. Then they clamour for the popular measures because they know that the economy is going to swing some or other time, and when it does, those members make the claim that it is as a result of their policy being applied. The reply to that hon. member&#x2019;s statement is that it is not a matter of whether one does something popular or not. That is not what matters. What really matters and what is important, is at what stage one applies that measure. That is the crux of the matter. And in this, the stage at which one decides to do this, the Opposition has no say. It is for the Government to decide in its discretion, when it should be done. Let us take the example of the raising of the credit ceiling, the 5 per cent and the 10 per cent granted in the Budget. After all, the bankers in South Africa have been agitating for many years for the total removal of all controls. I should like to see the bankers take some note of what the hon. member for Constantia said here today. I do not blame the bankers and the banks for agitating for the removal of those controls. They want to make as much profit and do as much business as possible; they do not want to be restricted. But the only responsibility they carry is that they must ensure that their shareholders receive dividends. The economic welfare of the country, however, <span class="col_4551-4552" refersTo="page_0739"/> is the responsibility of the political economist, the one who governs. The bankers are not people who need go to the polls to account for their deeds. No, but we have to do so, we whom the nation has called upon to govern. Therefore we and the Minister see the interests of the nation in perspective and if he then decides that there should be controls, they are introduced. What has the opposition done now&#x003F; All these years, the Opposition, together with the banks, has clamoured for the suspension of the controls because they want to be popular with the banks. When the prevailing circumstances allow it, it may be done. They have requested this for three or four years now and at present the prevailing circumstances justify the suspension of a percentage of those restrictions. It was done, not as a result of the appeals made by the United Party or the banks, but because of the circumstances in the country, and in spite of this the United Party jumps on to the wagon and says everything that is popular is what they asked for and is their policy. To me it is honestly one of the most unoriginal and most ridiculous challenges the hon. member could have issued to anybody. There is no time to deal with example upon example. I merely want to say the hon. member surprised me by coming with such a challenge and saying that everything in the Budget which is good and which is beneficial to the taxpayers is their policy which they suggested. It is so na&#x00EF;ve that it really cannot be true.</p>

<p>I want to illustrate further how the United Party talks in all directions. In this way they can rest on their laurels and say that they had the wisdom to tell us. In the Third Reading of the Part Appropriation Bill the hon. member for Parktown made a strange statement. In column 1555 he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">1972 may be a good year for South Africa economically. There are prospects of good crops. There may be a reasonable amount of spare capacity to take up some of the lags created by devaluation and import control.</block>

<p>Up to that point he predicted a good year for 1972 and then he added that he hoped there would be an improved balance of payments as well. Then he went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But unless the fundamental problems which have brought us to the position where we were before devaluation, are solved, the benefits of devaluation are going to erode and after 1972 we are going to be heading straight for a recession.</block>

<p>Now the hon. member says that we will be heading for a recession after 1972, but in 1972 we will have a good year. But he does not tell us what the fundamental problems are of which he spoke. He does not tell us what the fundamental problems before devaluation were. According to his argument, however, those fundamental problems will disappear in 1972, only to reappear suddenly after 1972. He says this because if there is no recession in 1972, he can say there were no fundamental problems. If there is a recession, he will say he predicted it. That is the sort of argument they use. If this is their economic theory and insight and if this is the sort of economic statement these people make, I have a dreadful fear that a catastrophe would strike us if they should ever govern.</p>

<p>I should now like to associate myself with the other hon. members here and congratulate the hon. the Minister on what I regard as a masterly Budget, based on absolutely sound and recognized scientific and economic principles. We appreciate the fact that it was a very difficult Budget and that incisive decisions had to be made, and well-founded decisions were in fact made.</p>

<p>The hon. member will have an opportunity to speak. If any risk was involved in this, it really was a calculated one. But I want to tell you once again, Sir, that these decisions were well-founded and were not chancy guesswork as the hon. member for Parktown wanted to give out here this afternoon when he spoke of a &#x201C;gamble&#x201D;. Some press reports also stated that the hon. the Minister could be compared with a tight-rope walker who could lose his balance at any moment and plunge to the ground. I want to reject these reports with the contempt they deserve, because they are mere wishful thinking and, as far as I am concerned, absolutely uninformed and very superficial comment. The hon. the Minister and the Government are at all times fully aware <span class="col_4553-4554" refersTo="page_0740"/>of the circumstances and they had full control over the situation. They knew exactly what had to be done and in what direction the economy should be steered.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. S. D. ERASMUS</person>:</from>

<p>No, we are not in a mess. Every Budget arises from the consequences of the previous one, with the result that this Budget must be seen in conjunction with the previous one if one really wants to understand it. [Laughter.] It is so clear to me that that brains trust at the back there really understands nothing of this whole matter. [Interjections.] Throughout last year&#x2019;s Budget and this Budget there runs a golden thread which achieves the objective of stability. In a capitalist democracy such as that in which we are living, the Government cannot do everything. The Government can merely guide the economy in the direction in which it thinks it should go, and then take the necessary measures to that end. The problem, and it is a problem which exists throughout the world, is that the time which the measure takes to infiltrate into the economy and the time which the powers and laws take to show their effect, cannot be determined with certainty. The other item which cannot be determined with certainty either, is the grade or the effect or the intensity of the economic activity which that measure will cause. These variable factors are not known to anybody, in whatever part of the world he may be. I want to say to those hon. members opposite that they are the last people who should come and pretend that they possess any superior knowledge of these matters. In actual fact they have no conception of them. Although these variables are unknown, although it is not known when the reaction to measures taken will come, it is nevertheless very clear that the Government knows, and knows exactly, in what direction the economy is going to move. There was no gamble involved in that. It was done on the basis of scientific principles. I want to say briefly that the objectives in this Budget, as indicated by other hon. members as well, were perhaps conflicting priorities to a certain extent. They will be capable of being realized by the ten points of action mentioned by the hon. the Minister in the Budget. One can in fact describe this Budget as an expansionary-deflationary Budget. Over the past two years the economic stream has moved in a direction of very high economic activity and very high inflation. What has happened now&#x003F; That stream had to be stopped. The previous Budget was designed to do this and in fact did so. That stream was reversed so that it became a stream of low economic activity, which led to a cooling-off in the economy. We have reached the stage now where the economy wants to cool off too much. For that reason this Budget must reverse that stream again and guide it in the direction of higher activity once more. In spite of this, the hon. member for Parktown says of the hon. the Minister that &#x201C;he misread the economic signs&#x201D;. The hon. the Minister knew exactly what went on. I want to say that maintaining the balance between the economic streams so that the one or the other does not get out of hand and does not harm the citizen of South Africa is an art, and it is because of the competence of the hon. the Minister of Finance that he has controlled them so beautifully. This matter is in fact a very difficult one which must be manipulated carefully. The art in modern political and economic process is to be able to do this today. When one has a government such as this one, one, can look ahead with confidence. When one has a Minister of the calibre of the present hon. Minister of Finance to hold the financial steering wheel, one need not be concerned that one&#x2019;s economy will be managed badly. Then one can proceed with confidence in the knowledge that it does not matter what the problems are abroad&#x2014;as we have had in the past&#x2014;and one can carry on in the knowledge that they will be handled with absolute dignity, competence and confidence.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Pietersburg has waxed very enthusiastic about this Budget. He talks as an experienced businessman but I wonder how he would deal with any business where he has three branches each of which has made substantial losses and then try to tell the shareholders that they have managed very well in the past year&#x003F; That is the kind of argument he used this afternoon.</p>

<p>The Government is not concerned with making profit, nor with making losses, but it is concerned with balancing its budget. This Budget has not been balanced, and this is a hard fact. In the way the hon. member for Pietersburg has been talking, he has almost convinced himself that the Minister has shown a surplus. Earlier in his remarks he suggested to us that businessmen were satisfied with this Budget. But can I draw his attention to the latest edition of the <i>Financial Mail,</i> in which an article appears under the heading &#x201C;Much Ado About Nothing&#x201D;. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A second look at Dr. Diederich&#x2019;s Budget reveals a yawning gulf between words and deeds. Now that the dust has settled, businessmen are taking a closer look at what the Budget really offers. They are coming to the conclusion that it was a masterly display of window-dressing. All the right words were there, but as for real incentives, there is precious little merchandise on the counter. The tax concessions boil down to an infinitesimal cut in the total personal income tax rate, including loan levies. Joint incomes will attract a little less tax. The corporate loan levy on dividends was retained, albeit it at a lower rate.</block>

<p>That is the comment of business, and yet the hon. member tries &#x2026;</p>

<p>Before I deal with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech in detail, I should like to raise one or two queries with the hon. the Minister on one or two matters. The first is connected with the grey market. I support the remarks made by the hon. members for Parktown and Constantia in this regard. I suggest to the hon. the Minister that he takes to heart particularly the remarks made by the hon. member for Constantia. The position with regard to the development of the grey market can become very serious indeed. I particularly want to draw his attention to the discipline which he has introduced with regard to participation bonds which are generally dealt with by trust companies. The interest rates on these participation bonds are going to be restricted. Many millions of rands are invested in participation bonds. When a portion of a bond becomes due, you will find the position that one of the participants may have, shall we say, a R4 000 stake in a R100 000 bond. What is the position when that person wants to draw his money&#x003F; He is in that syndicate for R4 000 at an interest rate of 10 per cent per annum. But now the new rate will be 8 per cent, I believe. Therefore, you will have under the same bond two rates of interest running. Has the hon. the Minister considered that&#x003F; What will he do when there is a general run on the part of people interested in these bonds asking to withdraw their money&#x003F; Has the hon. the Minister made any enquiries in regard to the extent of these bonds&#x003F; Does the Minister know how much is invested in participation bonds in this country and what the time period for these bonds is, Most of them are for three years, and in some cases for five years, and they virtually amount to revolving credit. They are very seldom called up. The interest rate is the market rate. When the hon. the Minister depresses the rate below the market rate, he knows as well as I do that the people will go to the market to invest wherever they get the best security. These participation bonds are secure. They are generally very well managed by trust companies, who see to it that they are first-class mortgages and that the mortgages are well managed.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London North suggests that they are already going to the trust companies asking for their money to be withdrawn. I should like to know from the hon. the Minister whether he has the position under control, whether he knows what the position is, whether he knows the extent to which money is invested in these participation bonds. If he does not know, he may get a very severe shock later in the year if he does not get one sooner. There is another matter to which I should like to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention. That is the question of the realignment of currencies. <span class="col_4557-4558" refersTo="page_0742"/> The hon. the Minister said very little on that. He was strangely silent on the realignment of currencies. Does he regard the present position as fixed, or does he think that the realignment of currencies is temporary&#x003F; Does he anticipate another international monetary conference similar to the Bretten Woods Conference&#x003F; I submit that the recent realignment of currency arrangements was a temporary feature and essentially a political arrangement. I suggest to the hon. the Minister that possibly a more permanent agreement will be obtained and that the present rates may or may not hold, depending upon the attitude of the American Government when it passes legislation in this regard. I should like to know from the hon. the Minister whether he anticipates that the present rates will hold or whether he anticipates any difference in the near future.</p>

<p>There is another matter which I should like to raise. I see that the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs is present and I should like to raise the matter of price control The <i>Sunday Express</i> has two reports &#x2014;&#x201C;Prices pegged on radios, cameras, fridges, cars; new list backdates to November the 1st&#x201D; and on the same page&#x2014;&#x201C;Top-level talks on relaxation of price control&#x201D;. Which of the two is correct. Are prices to be pegged as they were on the 1st November or are we going to have relaxation&#x003F; I hope that the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs will indicate sometime during the debate or during the session what he intends doing about this recent statement by the Secretary of his department in regard to price control.</p>

<p>I his opening remarks the hon. the Minister said that this Budget was designed to give direction and impetus to the national drive for a more prosperous South Africa. On the contrary, it is a Budget of the conjurer who creates the illusion when in fact the true scene is different. The ordinary taxpayer may pay the same amount this year as he did last year, but the difference is that whereas last year he received the promise that he would get something back after probably seven years, this year the whole amount is taken as tax. Last year a portion was taken by way of a loan levy, but this year there is no loan levy. Although the man in the street appears to be indifferent to the Budget, he will realize in time&#x2014;it is our duty to tell him that&#x2014;that it entails in fact an increase in taxation, because this year there is no prospect of any return.</p>

<p>On the evening of the Budget one of our newspapers carried the headline &#x201C;A R30 million bonanza&#x201D;. However, there was no bonanza at all, because it was the return of our money which we had lent the Government. We were compelled to lend that to the Government seven years ago and we received 5 per cent interest thereon. It is no bonanza at all; it is a quite misleading headline. In fact, too many of the headlines on this Budget have been written too soon and when they had studied the matter carefully, they had to revise their opinion, as the <i>Financial Mail</i> has had to do.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister would have done much better if he had told the country frankly what the position was. He should have told the country that its financial position was serious and that he did not only have to increase taxation but also to use reserves. In essence that is what this Budget is about. This Budget virtually tells us that taxation is increased, because there are no more loan levies. Despite that and despite using the reserves there is still a deficit for the current year, and he cannot give us any assurance what the future will bring; he is hoping that things will become right. In fact, he is the inveterate optimist although there are many who have proved him wrong. The hon. members accuse us of being pessimists but we have from time to time been proved right. In fact, we are in the dangerous position of high inflation and slow growth. Yet we must increase our productivity if we are to overcome our balance of payments difficulties. To get the economy going, requires an all-out effort on the part of every section of the community and I propose to analyse the Budget from the point of view of the various groups who are affected by this Budget. I shall start with the overseas investor.</p>

<p>The Minister subscribes to the private enterprise system, but I suggest that he should make a study of all the obstacles which the overseas investor must circumvent when he invests in this country. The Minister holds out a sop to industry by saying that the authorities will be prepared to consider allowing industry in the Pretoria, Witwatersrand and other areas to employ additional Bantu labour in order to work multiple shifts even where the ratio of Bantu labour exceeds 2,5 to 1. Naturally this concession can only be granted on a selective basis. I wonder how the Minister or his overseas office is going to explain what the selective basis is going to be to <span class="col_4559-4560" refersTo="page_0743"/>an overseas investor, how he is going to apply it, which firms are going to get it, and so on. This change of direction and easing of policy requires further investigation. Will the Minister tell us whether this is a temporary or a permanent relief&#x003F; Is it to be the temporary or the permanent position&#x003F; If the latter, how permanent&#x003F; The Minister knows that the cost factor is basic to the building of an export market and in order to have an adequate spread of costs there must be an adequate local market to provide the basis for an export market. You do not build up an export market in isolation. You build an export market on the basis of the local market, because only on the basis of a local market can you get a spread of costs. Your administrative and technical charges, and your high cost factors which are spread over the production as a whole must be taken into account and must be spread over the local and the export markets. You use your local market to test out the efficiency of your product and its acceptability, and from there on you go to your export market, whether it is in a neighbouring territory or overseas. Your fixed charges and semi-fixed charges are spread over the production as a whole and we would like to know from the hon. the Minister whether he will take the local market into account. Or will he only allow the formula to be applied to the export market&#x003F; Can the Minister help in reducing the amount of red tape involved in employing the amount of labour required&#x003F; Has the Minister ever tried to get a Bantu employee&#x003F; Does he realize the amount of red tape that is involved&#x003F; Does he know about the hours of waiting, the number of manhours wasted in trying to get suitable labour&#x003F; I had the experience this week-end of making a personal inspection to see what is involved in trying to get Bantu labour. When a Bantu employee gives notice and wants to work elsewhere and the employer wants to employ another Bantu from the same district he calls on the registration office. In this case the registration office inspected the Bantu&#x2019;s passbook, still called a &#x201C;dompas&#x201D; by Bantu, and entered the particulars on a form. Thereafter the boy had to be taken to Pinetown, to the Magistrate&#x2019;s office. After a delay of about half an hour the contract was completed and the Bantu taken back to the neighbouring village where he had to be registered. The whole process took three hours, and it only took three hours because I was in a privileged position. I was with the Bantu. It is an all-time record that we got through in three hours. Some Bantu standing in those queues had been there for three days They go there every day. I also know of an earlier case of a Bantu who worked for an engineer. He worked for this firm for ten years and had become an expert in field work for the surveyor and at the end of one particular year he took his annual leave. He decided to take his annual leave at home in the Umbumbulu Reserve. After his annual leave, instead of the Bantu returning, his brother turned up at the firm. The employer asked him what he was doing there and he told them that he had come to take his brother&#x2019;s place. He told him that his chief had sent him and that his brother had to stay in the Reserve until he came back. In this way ten years&#x2019; efficiency was thrown in the gutter. Fortunately, steps were taken and after two days in which the employer chased around, and after a lot of red tape, the first Bantu was returned to his work and the other sent back to the Reserve. The unqualified Bantu who had not worked for a year was sent back. You can go on in this way. I am quite sure that everybody on this side of the House and everybody who is prepared to be equally frank on the other side of the House, would illustrate the red tape, the waste of labour hours and the complete frustration which follows most attempts to get new Bantu staff in the urban areas.</p>

<p>As the hon. member for South Coast said, even if you want your old workers to return. This is so, despite the fact that we in Natal have Bantu Reserves very close to our towns. In fact, I do not believe there is a single town in Natal which does not have a Bantu Reserve area within five miles of the town boundaries. When the Minister talks in his Budget speech of finding a new formula, we just wonder if he realizes what is involved. I wonder whether the Minister has any influence over the Minister of Bantu Administration, whose systems demand many man-hours to ensure that the labour unit is correctly allocated. At the present moment, the Minister of Bantu Administration&#x2019;s organization is busy with the Kwa Zulu Organization. They have taken various units from various Bantu commissioners&#x2019; offices all over Natal to look after the new Zulu office. In the meantime the administration <span class="col_4561-4562" refersTo="page_0744"/>work in the other offices is falling behind. Perhaps the Minister will indicate to the Minister of Bantu Administration that it is time the red tape is cut and that it is time for a bit more realism to be introduced into the organization. I raise these queries with the Minister as he is anxious to encourage overseas investment in this country, and while the involved processes of labour employment tax the wits of the South African industrialists, they are a mysterious maze to the overseas investor. I would like to know whether the Minister is intending to encourage overseas investors to invest their funds in this country on a more permanent basis. Does the Minister know how many overseas companies have a relatively small capital account and a large loan account&#x003F; Has he considered encouraging such firms to convert their long-term loan accounts to share capital and so provide a more permanent investment&#x003F;</p>

<p>I have dealt briefly with the overseas investors. I now come to the South African industrialist. I commend to the Minister a programme for sustained industrial expansion in South Africa prepared by the South African Federated Chamber of Industries, which was handed to the Minister of Economic Affairs on the 23rd February of this year. I do not propose to examine this document in detail. Copies have been made available to both sides of the House. Many of the suggestions offered have been made in the House in earlier debates by hon. members on this side, but the ideas are summarized in a single document and we will be interested to learn of the extent to which the Government is prepared to accept the sound advice offered. The Federated Chamber of Industries believe that official policies have not been effective in promoting economic development nor in containing price inflation. In the time available it is not possible to analyse the whole of this programme. I would, however, join issue with the Minister when he says, &#x201C;To a large extent the improvement of productivity is a task for private enterprise.&#x201D; If he holds this view, there should be the minimum of Government interference in the handling of labour. It is in the interests of private enterprise that there should be very little interference. So far very little opportunity is given for training labour in the urban areas, it being principally confined to the border areas and the homelands. It should not be necessary to remind the Minister that decentralization which is uneconomic is a drag on the economy as a whole. I would emphasize the importance of encouraging the industrialist to train his labour in the cities and in the townships. Many an industrialist would be quite prepared to provide night training classes on his own factory premises. The Minister will know that overseas it is common practice in many factories to have training classes in the factories during working hours. When I was in Japan a couple of years ago I found that in one section of one of the big motor industries there men were taken off the production line from time to time in order to give them a week&#x2019;s or a fortnight&#x2019;s special training. As part of the routine, members of the staff were given in-service-training from time to time. Some years ago when I was in Manchester I found in the textile industry that arrangements had been made with the Manchester Polytechnics to hold extension classes in the factories so that the workers could be made more efficient. I suggest that far too often in our industries today where we employ African labour, we give them a crash course of training for six weeks, as the hon. the Minister of Transport told us the other day is done in the case of shunters, and then we leave the employees to get on as best they can. If they have a certain amount of resourcefulness, they make progress, and if they have no resourcefulness they are fired. In this way manpower is being wasted, whereas a lot of this waste could be avoided if you had a proper training scheme. If you had these employees properly trained so that they could become more efficient, they would increase their productivity. I suggest, Sir, that this Budget is lacking in imagination, because I see no provision in the Estimates for increasing the training of employees, particularly in the urban areas, because our industries in the urban areas will remain, despite all the talk about decentralization and despite all the talk about industries in the homelands. The hon. member for Von Brandis indicated earlier this afternoon what the position is in regard to the development of industry in the urban areas. Industrial development will continue in the four principal metropolitan areas, and it is essential to have training and re-training programmes if we are to get higher productivity and greater efficiency out of the workers in those areas. Sir, we are inclined to fail to realize that South Africa does not have very much mass production. I would remind the Minister that South Africa has a White population of approximately <span class="col_4563-4564" refersTo="page_0745"/> 3&#x00BD; to 4 million, whereas the city of Sydney in Australia has a population of <i>3</i>&#x00BD; million, which is almost equivalent to the total White population of this country. Many&#x2014;in fact, the majority&#x2014;of our factories are on a single-shift basis. Neither our towns nor our border areas have a sophisticated transport system capable of transporting workers to and from factories on shift basis. Virtually none of our towns provides transport on a shift basis, and yet we are using modern machinery. But modern machinery only earns money when it works. Whenever the machine is idle, it is earning no money, and if you can work on a shift basis, as they do in most modern industrial countries, you can cut down your overhead charges and place yourself in a position where you can compete in the export market. So long as we have our factories on a single-shift basis, we will find ourselves in danger of being excluded from the export market.</p>

<p>We can only get export markets by running our factories on a shift basis. A visit to any highly industrialized country in the world will confirm that industrial efficiency is measured by the horse-power used per man hour, and labour-intensive factories have difficulty in competing in the mechanized world. We concentrate all our efforts on labour-intensive industries, whereas the rest of the world is concentrating on machine-intensive industries. When the tendency in the world is towards automation and when nations are combining to form a common market, we in South Africa are urged to establish labour-intensive industries and to break up our country with independent self-governing states. It is little wonder that the FCI shows signs of growing impatient with this Government. Another class of person affected by this Budget is the managerial and professional class. There is no incentive for them in this Budget. The tax adjustments which are being made in this Budget in their favour are very meagre indeed. As far as the White worker is concerned, he is told by the Minister that it is expected that organized labour will exercise moderation and responsibility in wage negotiations, yet in this Budget he gives virtually no relief except the remission of duty on soap. The Minister enjoins industries to keep prices down by cutting their profit margins, and he enjoins labour to keep down their demands for increased wages.</p>

<p>When we come to the Indian and Coloured workers, we find that they are earning bigger incomes as the result of the shortage of White workers. They are demonstrating that given the opportunity they can provide the work and the services. If they can maintain the quality and establish a reputation for reliability, it is only a matter of time before the cottage building trade and the motor repair business will fall into their hands. The economic laws will prove themselves in time to be stronger than the political obstacles placed in the way of the ambitious. We are already finding today that backyard factories are starting in Coloured and Indian townships and that they are getting their custom from the White areas. This proves that so far as the ordinary man is concerned, whether he is Coloured or Indian, he is determined to get to the top and to ensure a better standard of living for himself.</p>

<p>I come now to the final class of persons, namely the Bantu, who finds little for his comfort in this Budget except that soap may be cheaper. I draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to a phrase in his Budget speech when he said there was a slight rise in registered unemployment, which still remains, however, at a very low level. Reading that phrase in its context to the other remarks, indicates that the Minister was not including Bantu unemployment. I would like the Minister to tell the House in the course of his reply whether the Government has any idea of the number of Bantu unemployed in the White areas or in the homelands, including the transit areas, because despite all the talk in this House, until the public knows the extent of Bantu unemployment in the country, we will not know the extent of the possible explosion about which the Minister of the Interior warned us. Every unemployed Bantu militates against the possibility of increasing the productivity of this country.</p>

<p>We have said in previous Budget debates, and we will go on saying in this Budget debate, that we will not be able to increase productivity unless we improve training and face up to our responsibilities as the bearers of Western civilization and prove to the outside world that we are prepared to accept our responsibility to ensure that as far as possible all sections can make their contribution through proper training to the economic development of the country as a whole. Social welfare for all the peoples of this country depends on their economic welfare. Their economic <span class="col_4565-4566" refersTo="page_0746"/>welfare depends on the incentive given to private enterprise and to the worker to produce goods and services to the maximum capacity. Our security rests not on guns but on full stomachs, adequate clothing and housing. This Budget has demonstrated how the Government has failed in this ideal. One financial paper has described this Budget as &#x201C;much ado about nothing&#x201D;. I would describe it as &#x201C;a comedy of errors&#x201D;, if it were not so tragic.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. S. PANSEGROUW</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, according to a certain newspaper, a very important newspaper, the Opposition is proud of the fact that they have no fewer than eight, possibly ten, financial stars on that side of the House. According to this newspaper, these men will be able to speak with authority on financial matters, and according to this newspaper they are well qualified to make an aggressive attack on the Budget speech. Sir, I have listened this afternoon to the first five of these stars. If what we heard here this afternoon from hon. members on that side was an aggressive attack, then I would be very glad to be described as a man with a very timid temperament. If the first five speakers on that side are financial stars, then I pray that this side of the House will be spared the embarrassment of being described as a &#x201C;star-studded&#x201D; side as far as financial matters are concerned.</p>

<p>*Mr. Speaker, you will allow me to leave the hon. stars at that. I want to react to one single statement made by the hon. member for Parktown, i.e. his statement that the policy and the activities of this Minister and of this Government in respect of financial matters, were based on guess-work. I want to tell the hon. member for Parktown that this is not the case, and since hon. members on that side are taking a delight in making a fuss and raising a dust because the South African economy is experiencing somewhat difficult days, I want to take them back six or seven or eight years into the past. I want to take the hon. member for Parktown and his fellow stars back to the Budget we had in this House in 1965. Sir, seeing that they say that everything this Minister has done, is based on guess-work, you will allow me to quote fairly extensively from the Budget speech delivered by Dr. D&#x00F6;nges in 1965. And what one Minister of Finance does, the next one does too, because we are, after all, a party which has a direction and a course we follow. It is not a case, as the hon. member said, of our going one moment and stopping the next. You must simply listen to what Dr. D&#x00F6;nges said in 1965, because it is based on sound financial foundations. Dr. D&#x00F6;nges said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In every Budget speech I have delivered, I have emphasized the need for a flexible fiscal policy; in other words, the Budget has to be geared to prevailing economic conditions.</block>

<p>This is what the hon. the Minister has done once again this year. Dr. D&#x00F6;nges continued&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This does not mean that fiscal policy should simply aim at either rapid expansion, or a complete standstill.</block>

<p>Of the policy to which the then hon. member for Constantia referred as the stop-go policy, Dr. D&#x00F6;nges said: &#x201C;We of the National Party do not set about it in this way.&#x201D; He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On the contrary, the Budget can be a delicate instrument, influencing the various sectors of the economy in different degrees according to individual needs&#x2014; in one direction a strong incentive might be given, in another over-rapid development might have to be slightly restrained, while, in a third, the economy&#x2019;s infrastructure might be strengthened somewhat. In South Africa we do not have at our disposal the full range of fiscal instruments available in some other countries to regulate the course of the economy. We do not have, for example, a general sales tax, which may be employed as a very strong, and in certain circumstances as a very useful weapon for containing excessive consumption. We might have to consider supplementing our instruments at some future stage. For the present, however, we shall have to employ the tax and other fiscal measures which are at our disposal to the best of our ability.</block>

<p>In 1965 the Minister of Finance said that seen against the background of the economy as it was at that time, he would adapt these measures at his disposal to the best of his ability, but that it was doubtful whether that would be sufficient; and when it became necessary to do so later on, the present Minister of Finance and <span class="col_4567-4568" refersTo="page_0747"/>this Government brought in that other instrument in order to bring about the effect on our economy which we do have today. Now, however, hon. members opposite must pay very close attention. It was in 1965 when the Minister of Finance said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Before considering the appropriate fiscal measures, it is necessary first to analyse the prevailing economic conditions. But before doing so &#x2026;</block>

<p>And now I want the hon. members to listen&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; I wish to emphasize a proposition which, in my view, is too plain to need argument.</block>

<p>I want to tell the hon. member for Durban Point that I am coming to the point now&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is, namely, this, that in our country we cannot afford to gamble with inflation.</block>

<p>I repeat&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is, namely, this, that in our country we cannot afford to gamble with inflation.</block>

<p>He continued by saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The importance of our gold-mining industry, and the dependence of our economy on foreign trade, make it imperative that we should maintain price stability.</block>

<p>And then Dr. D&#x00F6;nges said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I shall, therefore, turn a deaf ear to the siren voices trying to lure us into believing that action against threatening inflation is not really necessary, that rising production will inevitably overtake monetary demand, and that, above all, we should refrain from measures which might even slightly slow down the growth rate of the economy.</block>

<p>At that time the hon. member for Hillbrow was not a member of this House yet. At that time the hon. members on that side of the House followed the same pattern. When we said that we would not gamble with inflation, or might not gamble with inflation, those hon. members said that we should simply allow things to follow their own course, because that was not so bad. [Interjections.] It is recorded here. Dr. D&#x00F6;nges said: &#x201C;They turn at the siren voices.&#x201D; What did our then Minister of Finance say&#x003F;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">However unpopular it may be, we in South Africa shall not travel that road.</block>

<p>By means of this new measure he has brought in, i.e. the sales duty, the present Minister has succeeded in cooling down the South African economy, and in doing so, he has been faithful to the statement made by Dr. D&#x00F6;nges at that time. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Some temporary retirement of our rate of growth is after all, a small price to pay for averting the disaster of a prolonged recession in our economy.</block>

<p>That is the National Party Government for you. As far back as 1965 they saw these things hon. members on that side of the House see only now, and about which they want to make a big fuss. As far back as 1965 our Minister of Finance saw the existence of danger signals. At that time hon. members on that side of the House said we simply had to live with this inflation, because it was the fashion in the modern world and it had to be done in that way. They must listen to us. I say there is continuity in the things we do. The hon. members must listen once again to what we said in 1965. These conditions we are experiencing today, are not so very strange to us, and I say this because as far back as 1965 we said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There are, however, certain developments which cause concern. Last year already &#x2026;</block>

<p>That was in 1964&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; there were signs of cost inflation &#x2026;</block>

<p>The hon. member for Hillbrow must listen now&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; as reflected in bottle-necks such as, for example, a shortage of skilled labour</block>

<p>We foresaw that as far back as 1965. Now that the hon. member for Hillbrow is able to make some political capital out of this, he emphasizes this thing day and night &#x2026;</p>

<p>In 1965 there was not yet any question of the rate of inflation we have today, but already at that time this Government saw that it could come about. I want to tell the hon. member for Hillbrow that at that time we did not even have a Physical Planning Act. In consequence of local circumstances and circumstances elsewhere in the world, signs were clearly visible that dangerous tendencies were developing. I want to say in passing that we now want to emphasize the fact for once and all that the Physical Planning Act was introduced in order to serve a purpose. That purpose was to assist this Government in its policy of decentralization. It was said here, as it was said over the length and breadth of the country, that this Act would not be employed to strangle the South African economy to death. Now that different circumstances have set in, the Minister of Finance is able to come forward wisely and, without tampering with the principle of this Act, promulgate certain proposals and regulations which will be for the good of the South African economy. This means, in other words, that this Budget has also been adapted to the circumstances of the day.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London City should rather keep quiet; I do not know whether the hon. member is also among those eight or perhaps ten stars. I hope not.</p>

<p>There is something else I want to add, and for that reason I want to make haste. Hon. members on that side of the House were not all that clever. In 1965 Dr. D&#x00F6;nges said in his Budget Speech that it had been found that an annual growth rate of 6 per cent would probably give rise to serious bottle-necks as far as the balance of payments as well as skilled labour was concerned. He went on to say that it was improbable that it would be possible to achieve this growth rate of 6 per cent per annum over a full period of five years. In those days we realized that what had come, could not remain forever.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do want to draw attention to some comments on this Budget. Because the time at my disposal is limited, however, I just want to refer to a single South African personality. Every statement of this very person is put forward here and elsewhere, in season and out of season, by the hon. the Opposition. I am referring to Dr. Jan S. Marais of the Trust Bank. I am making use of his point of view for the reason I have just mentioned here. Dr. Jan S. Marais said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is a shrewd Budget, pitched in the right direction which acknowledges the realities of business.</block>

<p>Those were his words. No one has quoted him here today. How come&#x003F; Those hon. members may check their Hansard reports and they will find that Dr. Jan S. Marais is quoted in season and out of season. But when he describes this as a shrewd Budget, they say nothing about that. Because the time at my disposal is short, I want to sum up, also for the edification of the hon. member for Parktown. The same Dr. Marais says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For the Trust Bank group itself &#x2026;</block>

<p>Not only for the Trust Bank, but also for its subsidiaries&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the Budget holds only plus points. Our building society will benefit greatly, as will the unit trust movement.</block>

<p>These are the sectors in our economy which are in difficulty today, i.e. the unit trust movement and the building society; now they will prosper. He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I can only see the market being favourably influenced. Another bull point for the banks, although limited in scope, was the new higher ceilings on lending which will enable us to entertain a bigger volume of business in certain categories.</block>

<p>Now this is the person quoted by hon. members opposite in season and out of season. Already the light of five of the stars has faded today, and this person has never been called to the fore. No, if this were to have been an aggressive attack on the Budget of the hon. the Minister of Finance, it had not come off. We want to tell the hon. the Minister of Finance that he may proceed with confidence; that, on the basis of the one point of view I have mentioned here, he has the support of the country, and that this side of the House and, I believe, most of the people outside as well, will support him in this.</p>

<p><span class="col_4571-4572" refersTo="page_0749"/>Allow me now to bring one very important aspect of our national Budget to the attention of the hon. the Minister. The Land Bank Act was placed on the Statute Book in, I think, 1912. Since that time circumstances, including social circumstances, have changed altogether. I want to mention one example and content myself with that in this regard. A person inherits 200 morgen of land without a house on that property. He is a hardworking farmer who has acquired a house for himself in town, with the aid of a building society loan. In other words, he does not use agricultural financing to obtain for himself a roof over his head. With the aid of a building society loan, he buys a house for himself in town. He sleeps in town and farms on the farm. Sometimes it happens, as it did in my case when I was still farming actively and entered politics, that such a person sleeps on the farm and farms in town. [Interjections.] This person has succeeded on his own to purchase another 300 morgen of land for himself, for which he himself paid. However, he still lives in town. This person then purchases a further 300 morgen of land so that he has now acquired, say, in a high rainfall area, a unit of approximately 900 morgen without a house on it. For the financing of that, he needs R7 000. This amount is granted to him by the Land Bank. However, in terms of section 25 of the Act that person must occupy that security. Therefore this person is able to get hold of this amount of R7 000 but now he has to have a house built for himself on that property for an approximate amount of at least R14 000. So hon. members can understand that the loan of R7 000 is useless to him. Consequently we ask the hon. the Minister to give his attention to this matter and to amend the Land Bank Act, if necessary. Every case ought to be given the opportunity of being treated on its own merits so that assistance may be offered to people in deserving cases. The principle I want to bring home here, is that funds for agricultural financing are very limited in South Africa today. With the new developments in the field of transport we may have the position of a person living in town and being able, nevertheless, of managing his farming operations successfully. Therefore, what we are advocating is that residential facilities in towns should rather be provided by means of other financing so that the Land Bank will make provision for agricultural financing exclusively.</p>

<p>I want to conclude just by telling the hon. the Minister of Finance that we were a little concerned about this so-called &#x201C;aggressive assault&#x201D; on our return to Cape Town. But I think any fear of that is something of the past now.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Smithfield referred to two matters to which I would like to react. Firstly, he referred to the question of financial stars. My feeling is that he chose a very unfortunate topic in talking about financial stars. After reading the week-end Afrikaans newspapers, one is very surprised indeed to hear anyone on that side of the House talking about financial stars. I want to say that I have listened very carefully to speakers on this side of the House, and that each and every one of them has put up a very sound economic case, a case which we want that side of the House to answer. In every case up to now they have completely begged the question.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Smithfield also touched on the matter of the manpower shortage. I am very pleased indeed that he did this, because in my speech I want to deal specifically with the question of the manpower shortage. I believe that this National Party Government has let South Africa down shockingly through their lack of planning for South Africa&#x2019;s future manpower needs. During the recess I made a point of reading through a number of speeches made by some of South Africa&#x2019;s top experts in economics and labour. I want to say that without exception I found that the underlying theme of each and every one of these speeches dealt with the question of the manpower shortage in South Africa and the consequences that this lack of manpower will have on the future development of South Africa. I think it is very interesting indeed to listen to just a few extracts from some of the speeches which these people made. I refer <span class="col_4573-4574" refersTo="page_0750"/>firstly to a speech made by Mr. Melville Pels, president of the Johannesburg Chamber of Commerce. He said the following: &#x201C;The labour shortage in South Africa has become so serious that it is affecting the whole basis of competitive enterprises and grave consequences, stretching far beyond a slower economic growth rate, are likely unless more effective use is made of non-White labour.&#x201D; Then we had a very short comment from the vice-president of the South African Federated Chamber of Industries, who said : &#x201C;We do not have the White manpower to fuel the economic advance of this country.&#x201D; I go on to quote the president of the Transvaal Chamber of Industries, who said : &#x201C;No time should be lost in building a well-planned labour force of all races on a country-wide basis.&#x201D; These comments do not only come from commerce and industry. I also found a comment made by the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education, who said : &#x201C;South Africa&#x2019;s White population is totally inadequate for the country&#x2019;s skilled labour needs.&#x201D; Finally, I come to a comment by the hon. the Minister of Finance, who was reported as follows : &#x201C;Dr. Diederichs, the Minister of Finance, has listed trained manpower as one of the two critical resources that are particularly scarce in South Africa.&#x201D; My point in raising this particular matter is to show that despite all these warnings from experts in the various fields, this National Party Government for almost 25 years now has in its usual dogmatic and stubborn way refused to face up to the fact that a White population of 4 million people, however skilled, talented or even dedicated, simply cannot provide the skills that are needed for a country with a population of 22 million people. This is very obvious to everyone except the National Party Government. I want to say that the Government finds now that the inevitable has happened and that it is faced with the true facts of life, with the real labour problem in South Africa. But fortunately, in the process the Government has learnt two very important lessons : Firstly, it has learnt that immigration is not the panacea, or that wonderful cure-all that they believe it to be and that, at its very best, it can only ease the labour problem, without providing a solution to it. Secondly, the Government has learnt, I believe the hard way, that the other comfortable alternative of trimming our growth rate to fit the White manpower potential of South Africa, is also not feasible. So we find that at this very, very late hour, the Government is faced with the fact that it has to bow to the inevitable by allowing non-Whites into posts that have been traditionally filled by Whites. We on this side of the House are thankful for small mercies; and so we welcome the fact that the Government, faced with the situation where a combination of devaluation and import control will create even greater demands on our already limited domestic labour force, has now agreed to allow more non-Whites to do Whites jobs.</p>

<p>I believe that we must see this so-called &#x201C;concession&#x201D; in its true perspective; because when you examine it a little closer, you find that it really is no concession at all. What has happened in effect is that the Government has given recognition now to something which has been happening for a long time and something which will continue to happen in future despite the provisions of the Physical Planning Act, job reservation and influx control. Although the Government, facing the reality of the economic situation, is now prepared to allow available non-Whites to replace non-available Whites, it is not enough. I believe that the Government, having been forced into this position, must now also have the courage to see to it that this new labour force is adequately trained. Not the present wasteful on-the-job-training, but planned, organized and effective training is necessary. Above all, this new non-White labour force must be recognized by the Government as a stable, responsible and permanent labour force. You see, Sir, there is very little point in allowing non-Whites to fill White jobs unless they are trained to do the job properly. If any benefit is to be derived from the relaxation of job restrictions, that relaxation must be part of a comprehensive, overall training programme. This training programme must embrace better education and better in-service training for the non-Whites. It would be quite useless to make any concession unless the concession is hacked by some form of planned training.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when this debate was adjourned last night, I was dealing with the necessity of providing adequate training for the new non-White labour force that would have to be taken into the South African economy, I made the point that if there was to be any value in the concessions in regard to job restriction, the concessions must be a part of an over-all comprehensive labour training programme and this programme must embrace better education and better technical and vocational training for the non-Whites. One only has to look at the factual position of South Africa&#x2019;s future manpower requirements to realize how very important and how very urgent the introduction of such a training programme is. It is anticipated that by the year 1980 there may be only 1&#x00BE; million economically active Whites in South Africa. If projections prove to be correct, the racial composition of the total labour force in South Africa by 1980 will be 9&#x00BC; million, of whom no less than 81 per cent will be non-Whites. The Government&#x2019;s own projection shows that by 1980 South Africa will need at least 3&#x00BD; million skilled workers. Even if we discount immigration, it means that at least 1&#x00BD; million of the skilled workers will have to come from the ranks of the non-Whites, whether we like it or not, if the South African economy is to expand as planned. If these projections are correct, it becomes quite obvious that many more barriers and many more deep-seated prejudices against the employment of non-Whites in skilled White jobs will have to be overcome, besides those of job reservation. The labour problem in South Africa goes far deeper than the relaxation of a few job restrictions, because we find that we are in a position today that we have to include non-Whites in the economy if we are to have any growth at all. I believe, too, that one of the very first things that the Government will have to do, if it is serious in regard to finding a solution to South Africa&#x2019;s labour problem, is to change its attitude in regard to the whole question of Bantu education in South Africa. The fact that we have 3 million Bantu children at school might look very impressive on paper, but when you analyse and when you break this figure down, you will find that the position is extremely serious. We know, firstly, that the drop-out rate is still enormously high. We know that 70 per cent of these pupils are in Std. 2 or even lower. We know that only 4 per cent are in secondary schools and, believe it or not, only 1/3 per cent ever reach teacher training, vocational training or technical school. What is more disturbing, however, is the fact that only about 1 800 of these pupils matriculate annually. Quite obviously this situation has caused a very serious teacher shortage in South Africa, so much so that the actual shortage is in excess of 20 000. However, what to me is the most disturbing factor of all, is that the available teachers, the people who are charged with the future education of the Bantu, no less than 87 per cent have not matriculated themselves.</p>

<p>What is even more important from the immediate economic point of view, is the chronic shortage of technical and vocational schools in South Africa. The latest figures show quite clearly that there are only 17 departmental trade schools and only nine technical secondary schools for the Bantu throughout South Africa. What is even more serious is the fact that the total enrolment at these institutions is below 2 500. When you relate this enrolment figure of 2 500 with a Bantu population of 12 million people who are living in a country which is crying out and hungering for skills, you realize how badly the Government has fallen down on the job of planning for South Africa&#x2019;s future.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>There are two other major problems which have to be faced if we are ever to solve the labour problem in South Africa. Firstly, there is the inherent and deep-seated fear of the White worker that he may&#x2014;I say &#x201C;may&#x201D; advisedly&#x2014;lose his job to a lower paid worker. Secondly, there is the position that the White worker is not being trained and retrained to take up better and higher paid jobs in South Africa. The Government, in its usual illogical way, tried to solve the first problem by maintaining that we have to do with fewer and fewer non-White workers in White industries to assist in teaching the ideal of apartheid. The Government tells us&#x2014;I believe that the Government believes it too&#x2014;that it will remove the White workers from the White industries in South Africa as far as possible and in other cases it will reserve certain jobs for Whites only in those industries. This, of course, is the theory of Government policy. However, the facts are there for everyone to see. We know that economic integration has increased in every sphere of employment and this is the case despite the frustrating and annoying regulations on the employment of Bantu labour. When one considers the facts, not the theory of job reservation, one finds that there are just not enough White bodies to fill the posts and thus non-White is taken on anyway despite the provisions of job reservation. Of course, it is no secret that in the White border areas there is no such thing as job reservation. There one finds that employers are encouraged to employ more non-Whites than Whites, even in skilled positions.</p>

<p>In the short time left to me, I want to deal with another matter, namely the enormous wage gap which exists between White and non-White wages in South Africa. I want to say here in all sincerity that I believe that the hon. the Minister for the Interior did South Africa a distinct service when he had the courage of his convictions to address a very timely and stern warning to his own Government that the failure to close the wage gap between White and non-White races, could lead to dissatisfaction amongst the Bantu, which might have explosive proportions. We now know that this warning given in good faith was not well received by the Government. The only thanks the hon. the Minister got for his pains was to draw a very sharp rebuke from the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions, followed by a somewhat milder one from the hon. the Prime Minister. Why in heaven&#x2019;s name the Government had to react in this way is beyond me, because every thinking intelligent person knows that what the hon. the Minister said was only too true. Sociologists and political thinkers know it is true, as do those local authorities that are in daily contact with the urban Bantu. The only body that remains to be convinced is of course the National Government. In the light of this one wonders what the Government&#x2019;s reaction is going to be to the latest warnings that have come from a very senior and well respected trade union leader, Mr. J. H. Liebenberg, He tells us in very blunt language that there will be industrial unrest unless lines of communication are opened with the non-White workers and the wage gap narrowed. This warning coming from a man of the calibre of Mr. Liebenberg, who obviously has no political axe to grind, is also a very timely one and one can only hope that this warning does not also fall on deaf ears. Mr. Liebenberg speaks with the authority of a trade union leader with many years experience and as such his opinion should be respected by this Government. It is very interesting to note that Mr. Liebenberg also said, quite correctly, that the wage gap at the turn of the century was enormously large. He mentioned that the ratio was seven to one. He qualified this by saying that at least at that particular time the Bantu had a choice between a rural or an urban life, whereas today he needs fixed employment desperately and will travel long distances to obtain it. Then he added these very significant words : &#x201C;Despite the importance of the Bantu&#x2019;s wage and despite his importance to the economy, it has made very little difference because the wage gap still stands at five to one.&#x201D; There can certainly be no economic justification for a wage gap of five to one. There are some very sound reasons why this gap must be closed in the shortest possible time. One does not have to be an economist to realize that this wage gap indicates low productivity, while at the same time it is the greatest barrier to increased productivity.</p>

<p>May I put a question to the hon. member&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>No. When you ask yourself the question why the South African economy must have this huge wage <span class="col_4579-4580" refersTo="page_0753"/>gap between top and bottom, the answer is not very difficult to find. In the final analysis it boils down to the absence of opportunity and the lack of economic power for the Bantu. In the light of this how strange is it to find that of all people the hon. the Prime Minister complaining that while the non-White labour force has grown to 70 per cent of the total labour force there has been no corresponding increase in productivity! How na&#x00EF;ve can one be&#x003F; Surely, the hon. the Prime Minister must know that the reason for this lack of productivity among the non-Whites can be placed squarely at the door of his own Government&#x2019;s unrealistic and restrictive labour policy.</p>

<p>The facts which I have given here are the real reason why Bantu wages stay low. Productivity is not inherent in the problem, because it becomes relevant only to the extent to which the factors I mentioned, keep the Bantu artificially unproductive. Any expert in the field of economics and labour will tell you without any hesitation that there is only one solution to the problem of the wage gap in South Africa, and that is increased growth and a genera] movement of unskilled and semiskilled labour up the skilled labour ladder. This, of course, is inherent in the realistic policy of the United Party. But unfortunately for South Africa, under the policy of the National Party Government this type of development and increased productivity for which the country is crying out, is not allowed in the urban areas. It has, for purely ideological reasons, to be diverted to the homelands and the border areas.</p>

<p>We know that because there is very little prospect of the rapid growth which is required to take place in these areas in the foreseeable future, the prospects for the closing of the gap between White and non-White wages remains very bleak indeed. You see, Sir, for any progress to be made under the policy of the National Party Government, a massive stimulus to economic development in these areas will be needed. We well know that development in the homelands today is only token. One would think that, until such time as there was meaningful development in the homelands, the Government for economic and humane reasons, would be less restrictive on development in the White industrial areas of South Africa where it is needed. But we know the answer here, too. The Government, by some strange logic, has come to the conclusion that conditions in the urban areas are already too attractive for the urban Bantu, whom is regarded purely as a temporary labour unit to be dispensed with when he has fulfilled his purpose. When you take note of all these facts, you can only ask yourself, is it any wonder that South Africa finds itself in the economic mess in which it is after 24 years of the National Party Government.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this debate is taking place at a very important juncture in our political history. Apart from the fact that this debate is taking place prior to the parliamentary by-election in Oudtshoorn, it is taking place at a time when the United Party has become convinced that it will win the next general election. The nature and the spirit of the Opposition&#x2019;s criticism in this debate, as well as in the preceding two debates on the Railway Budget and the Post Office Budget, have indicated that the United Party really wants to use this Session as a first, major parliamentary rush towards assuming the reins of government. Because this is the attitude of the United Party, I think we ought to take them seriously in this regard. Yesterday the hon. member for Parktown, the chief critic on the opposite side, referred, <i>inter alia,</i> to certain advantages in this Budget.</p>

<p>At the time he claimed credit for the United Party for them as the United Party had allegedly asked for them in the past. This proceeded from the previous Budget debates, to which I have referred, when we had to hear from United Party members here and in the Other Place, especially in pursuance of the hon. the Minister of Transport&#x2019;s and my own announcements regarding steps taken by us in our respective departments for making more use of non-White labour, that we were in fact taking over the United Party&#x2019;s policy. In the course of this Session we also had to hear from the Opposition what enthusiastic fighters of communism they were. In its zeal to come as close as possible to the National Party&#x2019;s policy, the United Party is leaning over backwards to such an extent that even its English-language Press describes some of the United Party Members of Parliament as being &#x201C;verkramp&#x201D;. [Interjections.] Yes, &#x201C;verkramp&#x201D;; this description is employed with some <span class="col_4581-4582" refersTo="page_0754"/>satisfaction as it suits the occasion and serves their purpose.</p>

<p>For that reason the very first question I want to pose today is this. What is behind this story that we on this side have taken over certain aspects of policy from the United Party&#x003F; After the crashing election defeat suffered by the United Party in 1966, they decided that they either had to accept such a trend as being unstoppable or would have to devise ways and means of re-establishing the United Party as a factor in politics in South Africa. What has been occuring to an increasing extent since that time up to this day, shows conclusively to what a large degree the United Party is allowing itself to be led by the American way of conducting politics. [Interjections.] The two maxims determining the United Party&#x2019;s whole line of action are the following : Firstly, there is the need, according to the American pattern, for the party that does not have the presidential power, to come as close as possible to the govering party&#x2019;s popularly accepted policies and to pursue those policies, irrespective of whether these are its anti-communistic actions or aspects of its labour policy.</p>

<p>The second maxim of which we have lately had abundant proof, I can describe in no better way to this House than to refer to what happened in recent years in that country from whose book the United Party now wants to take a leaf, and that is the appearance of a placard in America after the car accident of the young Ted Kennedy in 1969 in which his travelling companion, Miss Kopechne, was drowned. His political opponents immediately published a life-sized photo of Ted Kennedy with the shock caption &#x201C;Wanted for Murder&#x201D;. This placard was displayed throughout America by his political opponents. This illustrates the type of disparagement of persons and character assassination, especially of people and organizations, which, unfortunately, is the order of the day in American public life. It is something of which even Mr. Nixon himself has experience. When, as candidate for the vice-presidency, he stood with President Eisenhower, his honour was impugned to such an extent because of political contributions which had been made to his election fund that there was a strong likelihood that Mr. Nixon would withdraw from that campaign. It is with these two techniques in particular, which are foreign to South Africa, that the United Party and the English Press in their joint onslaught are striking at Nationalist Afrikanerhood in these times.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Today you will still have far more reason for calling &#x201C;disgraceful&#x201D; before I am through with you. However much the disparagement of persons in positions of authority, whether Ministers or persons in executive positions, must pollute and debase our public life is of little concern to these chargers towards assuming the reins of government in their attitude of &#x201C;now, now&#x201D;. To me this phenomenon probably is one of the most shocking in our South African public life, as we in South Africa have always been proud of our high moral and ethical standards in our politics and in our public life. [Interjections.] But now such a valued cultural possession has to be crushed under the feet of the United Party in its impatient urge towards assuming the reins of government. What is definitely assisting the Opposition for the present, is the economic problems of the world, which have hit South Africa too. But what is of vital importance to South Africa&#x2014;much more important than the question of how long it is going to take the world economy to become stable once again&#x2014;is the question of what will be in store for South Africa if a grievances vote and an abstention vote, manipulated by foreign techniques, were to place the United Party in a position of governing South Africa once again.</p>

<p>This question has become the most topical in South Africa&#x2019;s politics at the present time, and it penetrates right through the smokescreen the United Party wants to put up. This question, i.e. the question of what South Africa would be like under a United Party r&#x00E9;gime, penetrates through any smokescreen in which the United Party wants to envelop its so-called anti-communistic policy or its labour policy, which has been taken over, and at the present time it has become the most topical question in South Africa&#x2019;s politics, because apart from the integration which will run riot in the fields of economy and labour under a United Party r&#x00E9;gime, South Africa will, on the basis of the United Party&#x2019;s stated colour policy, come under &#x201C;one authority&#x201D;, as the United Party likes to call it. That &#x201C;one authority&#x201D; will consist of one central body of authority, Parliament, which will initially have 25 non-White <span class="col_4583-4584" refersTo="page_0755"/>representatives, 16 in the House of Assembly and nine in the Senate. That the nature of this representation would change, we were given to understand by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout at the beginning of this Session. When our hon. the Prime Minister questioned him on this cardinal issue he said (Hansard, 1972, col. 407)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Is the hon. the Prime Minister aware of the fact that the Leader of the Opposition stated clearly that the eight Whites which are being proposed are an interim measure&#x003F;</block>

<p>This was followed up by the hon. member for Yeoville, and during the discourse in which he and the Pime Minister and the hon. member for Bezuidenhout participated he said, &#x201C;Of course&#x201D;; and in order to remove any obscurity, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout then said, &#x201C;That is not according to me; it is official policy&#x201D;. In other words, we must not think that this is a &#x201C;Japie idea&#x201D; only; he told us it was official United Party policy now.</p>

<p>Sir, I do not have any time to reply to questions. I still want to cover various matters and time does not permit me to reply to any questions. [Interjections.] Sir, hon. members on that side will have to devote all the energy they want to spend now to replying to the questions I am now going to proceed to put to them. Now this interim policy has actually replaced the earlier sixpence policy, but it has gained a new meaning to its name. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition, who was present when this discourse took place between the hon. the Prime Minister and the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, did not deny this at the time nor has he done so since. He has confirmed that this interim policy now is the official policy of the United Party. How the United Party is going to fit its renowned referendum into this interim policy is still as obscure today as it was before; as a matter of fact, it is more obscure than ever before. What we do know is what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said in the recess, i.e. that it would be folly to think that the non-Whites would remain satisfied to be represented by Whites in this House. What he said at the time, is, of course, nothing but common sense, and the fact that the United Party did not kick the hon. member for Bezuidenhout out of the party but actually gave him a senior position in the new shadow Cabinet simply confirms that the United Party is subscribing publicly to this standpoint now. It is on the basis of this series of policy statements, Sir, that South Africa will henceforth have to occupy itself in all seriousness with the question of what the United Party envisages for South Africa, and as regards this question of what the United Party envisages for South Africa, I want to state it as my conviction today that South Africa, in the light of the United Party&#x2019;s stated policy and in the light of its history and in the light of the line of action it followed when it was in power, will not be able to say that we have not been prepared for the unfolding of the United Party&#x2019;s colour policy. Sir, it is a very serious matter to say this, but I say that we shall not be able to say in future that we have not been prepared, because South Africa ought to know by this time in what way the United Party leadership will act with regard to the granting of political rights to non-Whites in this House if it were to come into power; we ought to know this, or have we already forgotten the experience of 1946&#x003F; No, Mr. Speaker, this House has not forgotten that. In 1946, then the United Party was in power and gave representation in this House to the half a million Indians&#x2014;three members of the House of Assembly and two Senators&#x2014;did they do so on the instruction of the electorate&#x003F; Did the United Party have a mandate from the electorate to do that&#x003F; Did they consult the electorate, the people, beforehand in that regard&#x003F; No, Mr. Speaker, without a mandate, without the electorate having been consulted and without all the members of the United Party in their caucus at that time knowing about it, Gen. Smuts came to this House and rushed that Bill through this House. If there is any hon. member on the opposite side of this House who doubts this, I want to advise him to read those debates, as I again did in the past few days. Sir, it is on the basis of such action when the United Party is in power that I want to say today that South Africa will not be able to say that we do not know what is in store for us if we are to get another United Party r&#x00E9;gime. But unlike 1946, we at least know today that the United Party will put 25 representatives in this Parliament initially&#x2014;16 <span class="col_4585-4586" refersTo="page_0756"/>here and 9 in the Other Place; initially we know what the colour of the representatives will be, but what we do not know is, firstly, how long that interim period will last before the Black electorate is allowed to replace White members by Black members in this House; this we do not know. And the second thing we do not know is for how long the number will remain at 25. [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Pinelands who is so rowdy at the moment, is welcome to read the 1946 debates; that would help him, if he were to conduct another correspondence with <i>Die Burger</i> with regard to giving an enunciation of the United Party&#x2019;s colour policy, to give an enunciation which would be more in agreement with their own line of conduct when they are in power. Bearing in mind that line of action of 1946, when, without a mandate, they gave the Indians representation in this House, I want to say that South Africa will have to be prepared for far more than is contained in this &#x201C;Do you want it, we have it&#x201D; of the United Party. But what is of immediate interest to all, is the matter to which Dr. Malan and Advocate Strydom referred in 1946, when this Indian Legislation was piloted through this House. At that time when that statutory number of representatives in this House of Assembly would have amounted to six only, and not to 16, Dr. Malan asked this House on that occasion what the position would be if Indian representation became reality, and according to the Hansard of 1946, column 4195, Dr. Malan used the following words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In this Assembly there will be sitting a bloc of six non-European representatives. I say it is a bloc &#x2026; and now with a bloc of six, and especially as the parties in this House stand more or less at equal strength, what is going to happen then&#x003F; You will be calling in the representatives of the non-European population in South Africa to be the arbiters as between European and European.</block>

<p>And on that occasion Advocate Strydom saw the size of this bloc as exceeding the then proposed statutory bloc of six. Advocate Strydom put it as follows in column 449&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What will be the position of the White man in South Africa &#x2026; if there are ultimately 18 or more non-European representatives in this House who will have the balance in their hands&#x003F; What will be the position of the White man in South Africa&#x003F; Any party in this House which may be in power will, in order to maintain its position, have to dance to the tune of that bloc of 18 or 20 from one day to the next. Virtually they will be the rulers of South Africa. I say that to carry out such a policy is nothing else but an attempt to kill the White man in South Africa. It is nothing but suicide.

<p>Henceforth South Africa will have to occupy itself with precisely what will be awaiting us if there were to be another United Party r&#x00E9;gime. In South Africa Nationalist Afrikanerhood, to be specific, will have to occupy itself with these matters. [Interjections.] I say this because from the United Party&#x2019;s own official documents it appeared how the United Party Government wanted to use this non-White bloc against Nationalism as far back as 1946 and 1947. With the coming of those three Indian representatives to this House of Assembly, the United Party&#x2019;s official newsletter of June, 1947, summarized their chances of remaining in power in 1948. I have it here if any of the members of the United Party are still interested in having a look at it. It reads as follows&#x2014; i.e. the United Party&#x2019;s official newsletter of June, 1947, (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Add to the 80 seats the three seats of the Native Representatives in the House of Assembly and the three seats which will be allocated to the Indian representatives, who after all, will certainly not be supporters of the National Party, and we get a solid anti-Nationalist bloc of 86 members.</block>

<p>It is on the basis of such an attitude and such a line of action that I want to say <span class="col_4587-4588" refersTo="page_0757"/>here today in all seriousness that if this Parliament is to be loaded with such a non-White bloc I do not know whether Nationalist Afrikanerhood will ever again come into its own. [Interjections.] Therefore what will be at stake is everything which is dear to the Whites and everything for which the Nationalist Afrikaner has fought all his life long. It is for these things that South Africa will have to wage the struggle in future.</p>

<p>In this debate, Mr. Speaker, it was my intention to discuss with the hon. the Minister important matters affecting the labour position in South Africa. But it is perfectly clear that what we have come up against here today is an attempt at evasion by the Minister. He realizes, in the first place, that the economic policy of the Government cannot withstand the onslaughts of the Opposition and of the businessmen of South Africa. So he has searched for something to distract the attention from the hopeless failure the Government has made of the economic situation in South Africa. In the second place, it is clear that after the statement made by this hon. Minister in the Other Place earlier on in this Session, he is not prepared to address the Opposition in the House of Assembly point-blank on his labour policy, especially after he was so clearly repudiated and rejected by my hon. friend, the hon. the Minister of Transport, in his reply to the Second Reading of the Railway Appropriation Bill. He is afraid <i>Rapport</i> may propose next week that someone who has knowledge of labour matters should be recruited. After I have listened to the hon. the Minister, especially with an eye to the nature, quality, venom and the archaic, useless slogans, one must understand, Mr. Speaker, not only that Mr. Haak is on his way back to the Cabinet, but also that Albert Hertzog has won his battle &#x2026; [Interjections.]</p>

<p>On the one hand, however, I am glad that the hon. the Minister entered the debate on this level, on this unfortunate level. A by-election such as that in Oudtshoorn has a good effect in so far as the public debate in South Africa can have an effect on public opinion. It forces the Government to adopt a standpoint and makes it impossible for the chief information officer, my counterpart in the National Party, to make a speech without revealing the true colours and the actual incompetence of the National Party Government.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister started off by saying that the United Party was launching an attack on the Afrikaner in South Africa. I call any impartial person&#x2014;unfortunately this excludes the opposite side &#x2014;as a witness, to the fact that he was unable to prove or motivate that allegation in a single word of his 25 minutes&#x2019; speech. It was a vague allegation devoid of any substance or truth; he cannot confirm it. Subsequently the hon. the Minister immediately went back to the days of 1948. Mr. Speaker, a few of us here remember the 1948 election. We remember the question: Do you want your daughter to marry a Kaffir&#x003F; Do you want your children to sit with Kaffirs on the same school benches&#x003F; They were not called Bantu at that time. [Interjections.] Hon. members believe that that recipe which worked in 1948, must work once again in Oudtshoorn tomorrow week.</p>

<p>I say it started in 1929 when Gen. Smuts made a speech in the Phoenix Hotel in Ermelo and announced an outward policy for South Africa. Then the leaders of the National Party at the time, met and issued a &#x201C;Black manifesto&#x201D;. Because Gen. Smuts had said we were to seek points of contact with the African states, they accused him of wanting us to be engulfed by a Black tidal wave from North Africa. Now, 40 years later, the hon. the Prime Minister has come forward with the same policy. We praise him for that, but if it takes them 40 years to find out that the United Party policy and the Smuts policy is the right one for South Africa, then how is one to understand the hon. the Minister of Labour wanting to take us back this afternoon to the days before the National Party realized that the United Party&#x2019;s standpoint in regard to international matters, was the right one for South Africa&#x003F; Like the propaganda organs of the National Party, the hon. the Minister tried to build up an enormous case on the fact that the second interim stage of the United Party&#x2019;s policy &#x2026; [Interjections.] &#x2026; makes provision for 16 representatives of the Bantu, the Coloureds and the Indians to be in Parliament.</p>

They do not know what the written policy of the United Party is. Since 16 years ago, when we published our handbook on race relations, it has been our policy. At that time members of the Cabinet came to me and offered me 10/-in order to obtain one copy of that pamphlet. They paid it and I accepted the money.

<p>In that policy which we published, we stated that there would be a period in the implementation of our policy in which all the races would have fixed representation on separate voters&#x2019; rolls in this Parliament so that we in this Parliament would be able, as is the case outside, to consult with the non-Whites on all levels for the creation of a federal political organization for South Africa. This has been known since the early sixties when our National Congress accepted this standpoint for the implementation of the ideas of Gen. Smuts. In May, 1948, Gen. Smuts told the then Native Representative Council that he was planning something like that for the future and that they should work it out. Now the National Party is scared to death. The words of the hon. the Minister were that the presence of these representatives in Parliament would mean the end of the National Party. Of what worth is it then to us if we have to hear from speakers on the opposite side in debate after debate that the non-Whites in South Africa reject the United Party and accept the governing party&#x2019;s policy of multi-nationalism&#x003F; In this very session the hon. member for Potchefstroom devoted an entire speech to it. He claimed that the non-Whites in South Africa supported them and rejected the United Party. He defied and challenged us to prove the contrary. The difference is, however, that the United Party has the courage to say that if we want to determine the destinies of peoples we have to consult those peoples on all levels and if, in those consultations, it appears that they oppose us, we must accept it, but &#x2026;</p>

Anybody who disputes that, is alleging that one cannot trust the White man with the Government of South Africa. We say openly there is only one policy in South Africa which can succeed, and that is a federal policy. We differ from our friends opposite. Years have passed in which our friends opposite&#x2014;the Chief Whip of the National Party was a big man to do so&#x2014;have maintained that there is only one of two alternatives open to South Africa : Either complete separation or territorial separation or multi-national development or apartheid, or whatever they call their policy, on the one hand, or total integration&#x2014;equally.

<p>My friend says &#x201C;of course&#x201D;. I knew somebody would say so. Then why is that not the standpoint of the Cape National Party&#x003F; Why does that alternative exist only in the case of the White man and the Bantu in the Eastern Cape, the Transvaal and Natal, but not in the case of the White man and the Coloured in the Western Cape&#x003F; Where is the logic for a policy which suggests that there is only one of two alternatives : Either separate nations with their own areas and independence, with self-government in the homelands&#x2014;because, after all, according to my hon. friends opposite, one does not begrude them anything one does not begrudge oneself&#x2014;or integration. But when it comes to the Cape Coloureds, the question arises whether, in terms of Government policy, they are a separate people under the multi-national concept or not.</p>

<p>Of course they are not, because there is no separate area for them. The policy does not exist for them. For them there is only vagueness, uncertainty and doubt in the heart of the National Party. The policy which <i>Die Burger</i> advocates, which the Cape National Party advocates and which the majority of the Cabinet advocates, but which the hon. the Minister of Information does not advocate, if he speaks the truth&#x2014;I beg your pardon, I mean when he does speak frankly for a change&#x2014;is that there is only one of two alternatives, i.e. either their policy of separation, of multi-nationalism, or the policy of equality, of biological integration. But what about the Coloureds of the Cape Province&#x003F;</p>

<p>How could <i>Die Burger</i> write this leading article last Friday of which I have a copy in my hand and in which Mr. Jooste of Sabra is attacked about a speech he denies he made, and in which he is reported to have said that there should be a separate area for the Coloureds&#x003F; I do not want to waste time by reading the article; it is not worthwhile reading it, but it is very interesting. <i>Die Burger</i> says that it is impossible politically, because if such a policy were to be implemented, the United Party would win all the seats in the Cape Province. Therefore, politically, this is impossible. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The question is not whether it is correct or not, not whether it is logical or not, not whether it is consistent or not, but whether the United Party is going to win seats. It is purely a political, selfish, Party consideration, and the interests of South Africa do not count. Secondly, they complain that it would cause the disruption of labour in the Western <span class="col_4593-4594" refersTo="page_0760"/>Cape and that for that reason, it would be impossible. How can the National Party say that the policy which is indispensable for the rest of South Africa, for the Bantu, does not apply to the Western Cape and to the Coloureds&#x003F; How does the statement of the two alternatives fit in here&#x003F; There must be other alternatives; but the National Party does not know what they are. The Prime Minister himself said that our children would have to decide about it and that he could merely indicate the direction, namely separation. But separation towards what&#x003F; How can one separate people when one cannot give them places where they may be separate&#x003F;</p>

<p>There we have it; he does not want to separate; he must integrate. When the National Party says it cannot separate the Coloureds in the Cape Province, then the Chief Whip of the National Party says they must be integrated. Here we have the relentless logic of the lack of policy and the lack of direction of the National Party. The trouble with the National Party is that their policy has collapsed. It was a wonderful policy and politically we suffered under it. It consisted only of vague concepts. Our former Prime Minister, Dr. Malan, said: &#x201C;Do not ask me what apartheid is; see how the policy develops in our legislative and administrative measures&#x201D;. Subsequently Mr. Strydom said the policy of apartheid was supremacy (<i>baasskap</i>). Any member on this side of the House who denies that it is supremacy will know in future that he is lying. Those were Mr. Strydom&#x2019;s words. Then the late Dr. Verwoerd came, and because he was an honest man, he realized that he could not proceed with these vague concepts and he then tried to give body, scope, a meaning and a reality to the word &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D;. Then he came forward with the idea of separate states. He is the man who repeatedly said with great emphasis that nowhere in the world could a multi-racial state exist peacefully. Every member who was in this House at the time, applauded him. Does the National Party still believe that a multi-racial state cannot exist peacefully&#x003F; What, then, is their policy for the Indians and the Coloureds&#x003F; How are they going to prevent us from becoming a multi-racial state of which the Indians and the Coloureds will form part&#x003F; And then, what is their policy for the urban Bantu, the majority of our Bantu&#x003F; Is the National Party going to continue with the fabrication, the fiction, that people can live in Johannesburg and Port Elizabeth and must enjoy their political and social self-realization in the Transkei, in Vendaland, or in Tswanaland&#x003F; What would the hon. the Prime Minister say if we said that the Vorster family did not have political rights in South Africa, but that if they went back to Holland, they would be able to enjoy the rights there which the Steyns and the Graaffs enjoyed in South Africa&#x003F; Where is the logic, the meaning and the content of such a policy&#x003F; [Interjections.] I wish somebody would ask something to which I &#x2026;</p>

We do not have the obligations towards the Botswanas we have towards our own Bantu. However, that is not the point. The Botswanas of Botswanaland are not the majority of the workers in South Africa. The Bantu from our own areas, however, form the majority of the labour force of South Africa. Then they come forward with the story that this is similar to what happens in the case of the Mexicans working in Texas or in the case of the Italians working in Switzerland. Not in any of these examples is there a case where the majority of the labour force are subjects of foreign states. However, I do not want to talk about this. This Bantustan concept is so ridiculous that nobody is taking it seriously any longer. Not even their own people. How many times have I personally not experienced followers of the National Party telling me that I should not become so serious about Bantustans; that they would never come about; and that they said so merely for foreign consumption. Only recently there was the case in Aliwal North where an attorney of the National Party said this in public. This is how the people feel about it. They cannot believe that a Government can be so foolish as actually to advocate a policy which it cannot implement.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I am talking as much about labour as the hon. the Minister of Labour did. There are some of us&#x2014; I am one of them&#x2014;who have already said and written in public that if it was possible for us to bring about a fair, complete separation between the races in South Africa, we would all have to think again; because in that case it would be a solution to our race problems which had a moral content, apart from other things which also had a moral content. Then we asked whether this policy of the National Party did in fact have a moral content. Can there be complete separation&#x003F; What did we find then&#x003F; The reply was&#x2014;&#x201C;Not immediately, but it is an ideal towards which we are working. By 1978 you will see that the stream of Bantu coming into the White areas would have been reversed and would be flowing back to the Bantu areas.&#x201D; Who says so today&#x003F; <i>Die Burger</i> said in 1978 was, a &#x201C;dead date&#x201D;. But what is happening now&#x003F; We have found that the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education has announced that where persons have certain established rights in the urban areas, they will be allowed to bring their wives and families to the cities. This is a direct contradiction of the basis of that policy; because the former chairman of the Bantu Affairs Commission has said that the danger we experience with a policy which does not establish the Bantu in their own areas, is the presence of Black women in South Africa. Now we find that nearly 14 days ago the Minister announced in his Budget speech that they were going to make further exceptions under their policy. They were going to make exceptions for people working shifts and for people who established branches of their factories at the borders of the reserves or inside the reserves. This is an admission that they cannot create the means to implement their own policy even in part, unless they allow Bantu labour into the White areas of South Africa to an ever increasing extent. With the attempt at implementing their policy, they are contradicting their own policy in its very essence. These are the matters I should like to discuss with the hon. the Minister, not this wild talk, this scare-mongering, these childish bogeys in which he indulged here, today.</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, on the Labour Vote I am allowed ten minutes to speak to the Minister, while he has unlimited time. Now is the opportunity when we can discuss the important matters. We shall indeed have other opportunities to discuss labour, but I think the attention of the people must be drawn, firstly, to the fact that the Government does not have an answer to the criticism of its financial and economic policy. That is why it has come forward with this scare-mongering, this attempt at diversion. Secondly, in this Budget debate the Minister of Labour is trying to evade his duty, which is to explain what the hon. the Minister of Finance meant last year and the year before when he said that new relaxations in the labour policy might be forthcoming from the Government towards the non-Whites in the White areas of South Africa. But he should remember that it is on record in more than one place in the Hansard of more than one House that he said that training of non-Whites in more skilled work may take place, but only in their own areas. Is it still his policy, or was his policy contradicted by the Minister of Transport or the hon. the Minister of Finance in his Budget speech&#x003F; This is what he is running away from. He cannot account for his own irresponsible statements&#x2014;irresponsible, but at least honest, because they are inseparably bound to the philosophy of separate development. He is right in that; he has confidence in his own policy, but officially, through the mouths of his Minister of Finance and his Minister of Transport, his Government is running away; they are derogating from the fundamental principles and pure thought, in as far as it can exist, of the apartheid policy. Just think of it, Sir: In the year 1972, under a Prime Minister who is trying to follow an outward policy and who is trying to find new points of contact for South Africa in the world and among the races of which South Africa is composed, we have a Minister of Labour who, obviously with the approval of the National Party and with the support of his Press, is trying to carry us back once more to the nastinesses and the shortsighted actions of 1948.

<p>No, I am not afraid of that; I welcome it. I welcome the speech of the Minister, because now the mask has been removed. Now we see a National Party which cannot govern South Africa, but which tries to bluff the people into voting for it, because apparently it alone can save the White man in his civilization. Sir, it astounds one that the Government, after what it has done to the people of South Africa and still is doing, really believes that it can say to the Afrikaans-speaking people&#x2014;to me and my people : &#x201C;Because you are Afrikaners, you have no option; you must vote for the National Party&#x201D;. What an under-estimation of the Afrikaners&#x2019; intelligence to say that because one is an Afrikaner, one must vote for a bad Government ! Is it the obligation of Afrikanerhood that one must allow one&#x2019;s country to go downhill and to be destroyed by a Government which has no policy, which is undecided and which has no direction&#x003F; Its own apartheid policy is collapsing before its eyes. On Friday, <i>Die Burger</i> had to write a leading article in order to contradict and to express loathing for apartheid for the Coloureds of the Cape Province. In spite of this, they have the audacity, the shameless audacity, to say: &#x201C;You are an Afrikaner. You must be satisfied with incompetence and a bad Government. You must close your eyes and vote; you have no right to choose, because you are an Afrikaner&#x201D;. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to the Minister. There was a time when we thought that our friends opposite had come to gain a new insight. We thought they were beginning to develop responsibility. We thought they were seeing the problems of South Africa in their magnitude, in their complexity and that they shared the concern of everyone who loves South Africa. We thought a new dispensation was forthcoming. Then the Minister of Labour came forward and showed us that what looked like progress, was nothing but a spectre, and that the Government still is where it was, and that it will continue making the same mistakes because ideologically it is so addicted that it cannot do anything.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I shall try to achieve the impossible; I shall try to remain calm. The hon. member for Yeoville accuses the hon. the Minister of Labour of having concerned himself with nastinesses of 1948. He did not concern himself with nastinesses of 1948; he concerned himself with the nastinesses of the U.P.&#x2019;s policy. That was the only element of nastiness in his speech, i.e. when he pointed to the consequences of the U.P.&#x2019;s r&#x00E9;gime. The hon. member for Yeoville makes me laugh. He is usually good in this House, but today he was anything but good. He says the National Party call themselves political experts, but go and hold meetings and then do not know what the United Party&#x2019;s policy is. Mr. Speaker, he himself does not know what the United Party&#x2019;s policy is. I want to prove this to him. Here is a letter of his, and he may tell me if I am quoting correctly; it is a letter he wrote in the <i>Argus</i> of 7th December, 1971, in which he stated this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Towards the end of the article I restated the three cardinal principles upon which the United Party race federation would be based.

<block name="quote">The words in brackets should not have appeared. They were taken from an unamended copy of our <i>Handbook for Better Race Relations</i> published in 1963.

The fact that this would result in <span class="col_4601-4602" refersTo="page_0764"/>large-scale White unemployment simply does not concern them. I go further; I say the United Party is in favour of the uncontrolled influx of Bantu labour into the urban areas&#x2014;totally uncontrolled. Not only are they in favour of the uncontrolled influx of the Bantu into the urban areas, but the Bantu must come here on a family basis, because the U.P. is opposed to migratory labour. The Bantu must come here on a family basis; their wives and children must accompany them. [Interjection.] I cannot hear what the hon. member for Green Point is saying there.

<p>The Bantu is allowed to sell his labour on the best market, or he is not allowed to do so. If one tells the Bantu they can sell their labour on the best market, it means the Bantu can choose what market is best for them and sell their labour there. There is no other alternative whatsoever. It is because they are in favour of the Bantu being able to sell their labour on the best market that I say they are opposed to any influx control in South Africa. They are in favour of the Bantu being allowed to stream into the urban areas on a family basis, and I ask you, Sir, what South Africa is going to look like after 5 or 10 years if that policy of theirs should be applied. I say it will lead to an unholy ploughing-under of the White man in South Africa and I level the accusation at the United Party that its labour policy will amount to the ploughing-under of the White labourer, the White worker in South Africa. I now ask this. When one has such unrestricted influx, when one&#x2019;s cities are 10 times Blacker than they are today and the whole of White South Africa is Blacker than it is today, what will the political consequences be&#x003F; Nothing in the world could stop them then having to get more and more political rights. This has never yet happened anywhere in the world. It has not happened in the rest of Africa, and it will certainly not happen in the Republic of South Africa. That is why I say that after five years of their rule under which they allow this influx, under which they allow the Bantu to sell his labour on the best market, under which they allow the Bantu to enter the White area on a family basis and give him proprietary rights, a situation will have been created in this country that must result in a bloody revolution in South Africa.</p>

<p>But let us pass on to their political policy. What is their political policy&#x003F; The hon. the Minister of Labour dealt with it fully. I want to go no further than the little they themselves admit to, i.e. that they want to give the non-Whites 16 representatives in this House of Assembly, 8 White members for the Bantu, whom the hon. member for Yeoville acknowledges can be changed for Black members, for Bantu members, for the Bantu.

<p>Sir, look at the position one is creating if one gives the non-Whites 16 non-White members. War was declared in South Africa with a majority of 13 members. In other words, one can leave such an important decision, i.e. whether one should engage in a war or not, to the representatives of the non-Whites. I now want to tell the hon. members of the United Party that this would unleash a furious hatred between English-speaking and Afrikaans-speaking people in this country, because one can argue as much as one likes but one cannot get away from the fact that the National Party consists chiefly of the Afrikaners and the United Party chiefly of the English-speaking people, and you are going to use those 16 to keep the Afrikaner out of power. I say that if you do that you will create a simply unprecedented situation of hatred in South Africa. I want to ask the United Party where one can get a more dangerous situation than this: If they should come into power and have the 16 representatives in this Parliament, and there is another election and the National Party wins by 10 seats, one will have the National Party&#x2019;s rule thwarted by the 16 non-White representatives in this House.</p>

<p> Those 16 would not even vote for the United Party. Those 16 would be extreme leftists. We know this from South Africa&#x2019;s history. It was proved by the representatives of the non-Whites in this House. That is why I say that this policy would bring about a state of bitterness between the White races in South Africa as we have never before witnessed.</p>

<p>But it would not end there. I make the accusation against the United Party that these 16 members are only the minimum number they want in this House, and I say in addition that they have no objection to the number increasing. In the initial interim there will be 16. In the second interim there will be 8 Whites that can be changed for 8 Blacks. The third interim is this referendum of theirs. I now want to ask the hon. members for Yeoville and Bezuidenhout a question. They say these people can only be increased by means of a referendum of the Whites in South Africa. I now want to ask those hon. members a very fair and reasonable question : If they should hold such a referendum, on what side would the United Party range itself&#x003F;</p>

<p>And what is the National Party&#x2019;s policy&#x003F; We are not indifferent to the political rights of the non-Whites. I acknowledge that as far as the Coloureds and Indians are concerned we have not yet finished thinking. The Prime Minister has in fact said so. [Interjections.] Do hon. members think they have finished thinking&#x003F; They have not yet started thinking As far as the overwhelming problem in regard to the Bantu is concerned, the National Party&#x2019;s attitude is very clear. We are not indifferent to the political rights of the Bantu in South Africa. But we state without a shadow of doubt that the Bantu will receive his political rights in his own homeland and nowhere else. There he will receive his political rights. Then we have to listen to the nonsense about a divided South Africa in which Communism would allegedly triumph and all that rubbish. Why does Communism not <span class="col_4605-4606" refersTo="page_0766"/>triumph in Lesotho, Botswana or Swaziland&#x003F; I shall tell hon. members when Communism will triumph in this country.

<p>No, there is no question of any panic on this side of the House. Any signs of panic are on that side of the House, panic for the consequences of their own policy. What I blame them for very much is that in this process of refusing to state their policy with all its consequences, they are doing two things to divert the attention of the people. I am now speaking of the United Party and its Press. One is by trying to exploit minor economic grievances, and the other is by besmirching the Republic of South Africa abroad as much as they can. The first member I accuse of besmirching this Republic abroad is the hon. member for Hillbrow. In the hon. member&#x2019;s speech during the non-confidence debate he said that South Africa has never been hated as much as it is hated today. I am inclined to agree with him. If I had to believe all his stories, those of the English Press and what the hon. member for Zululand said, I would not find it surprising that South Africa is the most hated country in the world. What did he say in the no-confidence debate&#x003F; In the no-confidence debate the hon. member for Hillbrow said that here in South Africa we have no single freedom left.

In addition they say that the Whites who disagree with the Government are just as recklessly suppressed in the Republic of South Africa. I say that this is a scandalous attitude the United Party is adopting! I say that in our politics we have already dropped to some low levels, but this low level the United Party has reached in our politics in the past six months is worse than anything even I have done in my political career, and I am not the softest man in politics.

<p>Mr. Speaker, having listened to the last spasm of a dying Government, I do not know why the hon. the Minister of Community Development bothered to make a speech. All he needed to do was to take his Hansard of the last three occasions he has taken part in a general debate and read it, because it would have been word for word identical. The trouble with the hon. the Minister and <span class="col_4609-4610" refersTo="page_0768"/>with this Government is that they think that because people stream for generation after generation to listen to a good opera, if they make the same speech over and over enough, people will also stream to hear it.

<p>While South Africa is debating a budget of R3 500 million, a budget designed to provide for the Administration which is going to run this country for the next year and which is to determine the direction which we take in the field of the economy, in the field of race relations and in the field of administration, we get the demonstration here of irresponsibility which we have just heard. This is not accidental and I want to put it on record that the hon. the Minister of Labour and the hon. the Minister of Community Development quite clearly have spoken here with the specific authority and approval of the hon. the Prime Minister and the Nationalist Party. They have clearly been put up to this, to take this line and, with the firmest, hardest nails I can find, I want to nail the speeches to which we have listened to the Nationalist Party, to the Government and to its policy.</p>

<p>There are those who have talked about a change in the Nationalist Party, a move towards becoming more &#x201C;verlig&#x201D;, but I want to put it on record that here we have not heard an isolated individual, not a personal opinion, but the official policy, with the official approval and stamp of the hon. the Prime Minister, and South Africa is told the Nationalist Party is back to 1948, exactly where we started. [Interjections.] These two speeches place on record more clearly than anything else could have done that any hope whatsoever of getting a change from within the Nationalist Party is simply wishful thinking. The hon. the Minister of Community Development spoke of bloody revolution. Does he forget that one of his own colleagues warned on the 31st December of last year, only a few months ago, of race disaster&#x003F; He said that the nation faced disaster unless the challenge of improving race relations was met. He talked of bloodshed. He talked of dangers facing South Africa, not under a United Party Government, but under the Nationalist Government. But when a Nationalist Cabinet Minister, the hon. the Minister of the Interior, warns of bloodshed and disaster, his colleagues get up in this House and instead of dealing with the problems for which they are responsible, they try to sweep up feelings and they try to misrepresent United Party policy. They try to mislead the people of South Africa with half-truths, stories which give a false impression of what this side of the House stands for.</p>

We stand for communal councils for the different races, handling matters at their own level which affect their own race group. We stand for statutory standing committees linking them to this Parliament. We say that we will consult, through a determined number of representatives in this House, with the communal councils.

<p>Mr. Speaker, I said and I say again that it would make a liar of anybody who says that the National Party enjoys the support of the non-White race groups if we are to accept what these two hon. Ministers have said, because they have indicated that White representatives of non-Whites in this House would be opposed to that Government and to that party and would support this side in undermining the Afrikaner. But they have gone further. They are the puppets whose strings are being pulled by the hon. the Minister of Defence and by his newspaper, to whose strings he in turn is dancing. They are the <i>Burger&#x2019;s</i> puppets doing two things which are a disservice to South Africa. One is to sweep up feelings between English- and Afrikaans-speaking South Africans and the other is to sweep up feelings between White man and Black man in South Africa. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>*Mr. Speaker, I return to the hon. the Minister. I said that there are people in South Africa who hope that improvements can be brought about from within the National Party. There are people who hope for an improvement in the image of the Government today, through change of policy and of staff within the Government. I do not want to read out long quotations. I just want to say that this group does exist. Everyone knows about it. There is also a growing group which realizes that such a renewal, such a change from within is impossible. We have the odd situation that we have a party and a Government here with supporters whose hope to remain in power lies in having to take over our policy, the Opposition&#x2019;s policy. Where can another situation like this be found, where the supporters of the Government hope that their own Government will accept the Opposition&#x2019;s policy&#x003F; There is, for example, an article in <i>Volkshandel,</i> under the title &#x201C;Herdenke ten opsigte van Ekonomie nou nodig&#x201D;. I have an article from <i>Rapport</i> under the title &#x201C;Vlug sal nie help nie&#x201D;. One can go on in this way. &#x201C;N.P. antwoord op kiesers se griewe&#x201D;. The position is that there are complaints within the National Party. In <i>Rapport</i> of 5th March the complaints are set out. The answer to virtually every complaint is the answer advocated by this side of the House.</p>

<p>It happens.</p>

<p>&#x2020;So we have this strange idea that you can brighten up the Cabinet from inside. Some think it is not necessary. The hon. the Minister of Transport, of course, says &#x201C;Ondersoek onnodig&#x201D;. He does not think it is necessary. But others seem positive that it is necessary. Now we have the hon. the Minister of Transport who is chairman of a company owning newspapers, saying: &#x201C;Ondersoek is onnodig&#x201D;. But his newspaper, the day before yesterday, said : &#x201C;Bring Jan Haak terug&#x201D;. We have <i>Volkshandel</i> calling for &#x201C;herdenke ten opsigte van die ekonomie&#x201D; and we have <i>Rapport</i> <span class="col_4613-4614" refersTo="page_0770"/>with &#x201C;Bring Jan Haak terug&#x201D;. It is interesting to find, for instance, that according to the hon. the Minister of Transport&#x2019;s newspaper all the hon. members who spoke yesterday do not amount to a row of beans &#x2014;not one of them! The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs is too busy making statements; there is nobody here to take his place. It is interesting to note that, according to their newspapers, there was a party. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dit beteken waarskynlik niks nie, maar dit is interessant dat twee van die gaste op &#x2019;n onlangse party van Bolandse Volksraadslede in die Paarl juis mnr. Haak en dr. Jan Marais van die Trust-bank was.</block>

<p>I wonder if that party was at the house of the hon. member for Paarl. But this is not just newspaper speculation. It is an organ of the National Party which says that its own Minister of Economic Affairs, the whole of the economic affairs group and the whole of the finance group, are useless; they should be chucked out and somebody from outside should be brought in. It is an interesting situation that, to try to save themselves from their economic shambles, they turn to ex-Minister Haak, a person who resigned as a Minister after having received a R118 000 loan from the Land Bank and having been asked by the Prime Minister to repay it, did so and then resigned before the election to attend to his own business affairs, a resignation which was kept secret until after the election and then accepted so that he could attend to his own affairs, be put on the board of Iscor and guide his own vast economic empire. Now we are told we must bring him back to rejuvenate the Cabinet. There are some interesting possibilities in this idea of putting life and vitality and virility into the Cabinet. We could easily inject some more virility. Let us have an Old Boys&#x2019; Club. Let us bring back Willie Maree. I am sure the hon. the Minister of Community Development will know. He has appointed him to one of his boards. He has had a lot of business experience, and I am sure that he could make a contribution in the economic field, from his experience of handling land, development, and so on. He is another person whose economic knowledge could help the Government.</p>

<p>I heard he was the bestdressed man in the Cabinet. If we want an Old Boys&#x2019; Club, what about bringing back the ex-Minister of the Interior, Mr. P. K. le Roux&#x003F; It would save the National Party from the complete panic they are having at the moment over the by-election.</p>

<p>I want to quote from the <i>Daily News</i> of the 15th September, 1971, what the Prime Minister said last year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Prime Minister, Mr. Vorster, likened the National Party to a rugby team when he addressed the Free State Congress here last night.</block>

<p>I thought about this rugby team on Sunday, but all I could hear was &#x201C;Haak, k&#x00EA;rels, Haak&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The hon. Minister of Community Development, to whom I am still replying, introduced a Renewals Bill. I suggest he should try to apply that Renewals Bill to the Cabinet. I disagree with my colleague from Hillbrow, who thought the Prime Minister might be able to patch up the Cabinet. I think that what we need here is not a Renewals Bill. You cannot renovate or patch up; you would have to have a complete urban redevelopment. You would have to get right down to the foundation.</p>

<p>Slum clearance.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>A very apt description. I called it urban renewal, although one could perhaps also call it slum clearance. I did a little study to see where we could have some renewal and where we would have to have complete demolition and replacement. I started off with the hon. the Minister of Labour who, as Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, seemed to show a little light here and there. He opened the door just a fraction, peeped through and poked his finger at some of the labour problems which he faced as Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. I thought: Well, here is a chance; we may polish this one up a bit; we may get a little shine and vitality out of this if we could open the door wider. What happened, Mr. Speaker&#x003F; The Jekyll and Hyde personality keeps cropping up. The Minister of Labour came along and slammed the door right in his face. So there we can get no renewal or polishing up because we have two personalities in one Minister, the one realizing the problems and knowing what has to be done <span class="col_4615-4616" refersTo="page_0771"/>about it and the other making sure that it cannot be done.</p>

<p>Then we have the Minister of Defence, the person responsible for the security of South Africa, the person whom we support when it comes to the security of our country, and when it comes to the military forces which he controls, the Defence Force as a whole. There one would say that you perhaps have some material to work on, but again you have a Jekyll and Hyde, because the Minister is also the leader of the National Party in the Cape Province. As soon as you get this clash of personalities, you find that the Minister of Defence disappears and an explosive political leader appears, unstable and unreliable, dragging South Africa back into the lowest level of politics we have seen since about 20 years ago. We find the Minister of Defence, instead of trying to build up patriotism and love for South Africa, trying to break it down by instilling racialism into a political debate. We find a Minister of Defence who accepts that in his Forces the 40-odd per cent who are United Party supporters are loyal South Africans.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Because at least that percentage of the electorate supports the United Party. In fact, these are the young South Africans, and in their case the figure is over 50 per cent, because amongst the young South Africans we are drawing more and more support.</p>

<p>We have a Minister of Police who acts impeccably on the border. But on the home front he cannot handle a simple fraud case; it takes two years to solve. In a simple investigation like that into the Agliotti case, he cannot give us an answer; it is too complicated an investigation for him to reach finality while Parliament is still sitting. We find the same Minister supporting his men on the border and then issuing statements in South Africa which I believe are not worthy of the hon. the Minister of Police.</p>

<p>We have a Minister of Agriculture with no policy. We have a Minister of Sport. He was appointed as a rugby hero. Do you know, Sir, the supermarkets do this sort of thing. They have what they call a &#x201C;loss leader&#x201D;. They want a line which they can put on the market at a known loss. This one. Mr. Speaker, was a &#x201C;loss leader&#x201D; <i>par excellence.</i></p>

<p>Then we have a Minister of Bantu Administration who is &#x201C;the greatest&#x201D;. We find that his own department, his own officials whom he controls, say this about him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nog nooit is daar in die w&#x00EA;reld soveel deur een Minister en almal wat hom bystaan op een tydstip gedoen om soveel vordering ten opsigte van woongebiede en op staatkundige en ekonomiese gebied te maak nie</block>

<p>&#x201C;Nog nooit in die w&#x00EA;reld nie&#x201D;! You see, Sir, the theory of the Bantu homelands was there&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; maar ons het net gewag op &#x2019;n Regering en &#x2019;n Minister wat die moed en die geloof sou h&#x00EA; om die teorie in die praktyk toe te pas. Daar was &#x2019;n Minister nodig met verbeelding en dryfkrag.</block>

<p>Obviously, Mr. Speaker, you cannot renew a Minister with all those qualifications. His own department says that the late Dr. Verwoerd was useless; that there has never been a Minister of Bantu Administration like the present Minister; that Oom Daan, who used to float around in orbit in this House, was no good as a Minister of Bantu Administration; the only good Minister they have had is this Minister&#x2014;the only one in the world. Then we have the Minister of Planning, who tells the voters of Oudtshoorn: &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry; we know you have problems; we know you are having a difficult time of it, but we shall do something.&#x201D;</p>

<p><span class="col_4617-4618" refersTo="page_0772"/>*Mr. Speaker, I want to conclude by saying that over all these Ministers we have a Prime Minister who is like a person who is learning to drive in a car with two steering wheels. When the instructor sees that the position is dangerous, he switches off the one sterring wheel; if he thinks the road is straight enough, he switches on the spare steering wheel.</p>

<p>&#x2020;We see the Prime Minister at some stages turning the steering wheel all the time, but most of the time the instructor, the Broederbond instructor, has switched off the dual control and the Prime Minister is simply spinning the wheel around while the car goes plodding along the Broederbond road. Sir, the evidence of this was the two speeches that we heard here this afternoon; here we had the evidence that the Prime Minister is no longer driving the motor-car of State; the Prime Minister is not controlling it. The Broederbond, the hatred, the bitterness of 1948, the bitterness of the past, is today driving the care of State. The Prime Minister should stick to making statements on pop festivals.</p>

<p>This is the sort of thing that we find in every department: We find that a public servant is allocated a farm by his own department and that he makes a profit of R35 000 on it. We have this happening all the time, and then these Ministers try to take us back 25 years into history. They try to take us back 72 years into the bitterness of the Anglo-Boer War. Sir, I want to say to this National Party that the best service that they can do the United Party is to carry on doing what they are doing now, because the young people of South Africa are sick of the divisions of our grandfathers. The young people of South Africa want a party in control of South Africa which lives in the twentieth century, which looks ahead beyond 1972 and not back to 1902. The young people of South Africa want a party in power which will root out corruption and inefficiency, which will root out all the things that harm the good name of South Africa and, Sir, hon. members opposite cannot frighten the young people of South Africa any more. People are no longer bluffed by this sort of talking. They will vote for this side of the House for decent government.</p>

<p>As usual the hon. member for Durban Point was true to himself. I think he said nothing to which I need reply, except when he referred towards the end of his speech to the young people, to the youth of South Africa. Sir, the United Party are waxing lyrical about the youth, but I want to tell them something about the history of the youth. This National Party granted the young people the franchise in 1958, when the United Party opposed it. I want to remind them that those very same young people helped to secure a Republic for South Africa, also against the wishes of the United Party. Furthermore I want to tell them that those young people will never entrust this Republic, which they themselves helped to gain, to people like those in the United Party, to people like the hon. member for Durban Point, the arch-jingo.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. VAN STADEN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but he was wearing the pot-lid. I am going to discuss economic matters on the relevant Votes, but now I wish to talk to the United Party. I wish to talk about the United Party&#x2019;s past, and I wish to talk about its present and about its future, precisely with a view to these claims they are laying to having the support of the youth. I level the accusation at the United Party today that they were responsible in the past for the terrorists who are fighting on our borders at the moment. In 1952 they established a fund and founded the United Front&#x2014;a fund of R2 million for the purpose of defeating the National Party Government at the elections of 1953. Sir, a jackal, a two-face and a skunk all flocked to that source, the R2 million.</p>

<p>The United Front subsequently originated from that source, the R2 million fund was the contributory factor. U.P. supporters, communists, jingoes and the Antichrist were assembled in that front. The whole caboodle were assembled in that United Front, and then for the first time, in 1952, South Africa made acquaintance with demonstrators and terrorists. Never before in its history had South Africa been subject to a more extensive onslaught of jingoism than was in fact the case in 1952 and 1953. And what was the point at issue&#x003F; The only point at issue was the retention of the non-White franchise. That is all.</p>

<p>The first time in my life that I made <span class="col_4619-4620" refersTo="page_0773"/>acquaintance with a demonstration was here in front of these Houses of Parliament, where bearers of tin torches had congregated under the leadership of &#x201C;Oom&#x201D; Dolf of beard fame. I have the photographs here; but that was a peaceful rally, for it consisted of Whites. But the very next evening they addressed the non-Whites here on the Parade. It was on that occasion that I made acquaintance with such a demonstration for the second time. The members of the United Front addressed them, and there were communists, such as Fred Carneson, who were members of that United Front. On the Parade they incited the non-Whites to such an extent that they stormed these Houses of Parliament, and here, outside these Houses of Parliament, I saw how the first demonstrators clashed with the Police. The third thing I experienced&#x2014;I did not see it personally, but I read about it&#x2014;was a real attack by demonstrators.</p>

<p>On 26th May, 1952&#x2014;this is a rather important date, for on 26th May, 1952, the National Party won the election&#x2014;a listed communist, Solly Sacks, held a meeting on the steps of the City Hall of Johannesburg. That was not a meeting of Solly Sacks or of trade unions, but a meeting of the United Front, and he held it with the approval of the United Party, although his presence there was illegal, and when the Police wanted to arrest him, 15 policemen were injured in that clash. I say the first terrorist onslaught on South Africa&#x2019;s Police took place under the leadership of the United Party. [Interjections.] I have here <i>Die Burger</i> of 27th May (translation): &#x201C;Dr. Malan discloses contents of Police report. U.P. a many-coloured front with red, yellow and black.&#x201D; In 1952 Dr. Malan put this question to the United Party in this House. At the time Adv. Strauss was still the Leader of the United Party, and Dr. Malan put this question to the United Party. His question was : &#x201C;Where is your leader leading you&#x003F;&#x201D; On 27th May, 1953, he asked this question: &#x201C;Where has the Leader of the Opposition landed you already&#x003F;&#x201D; At that time they had already been lead into this mess.</p>

<p>Now I want to say that at present the United Party are terribly touchy whenever communism is mentioned; they run to court whenever a pamphlet is issued. Here in my hand I have a pamphlet issued by the National Party at the time of the 1949 provincial elections. At that stage communism had not yet been prohibited under the Act. Today they are hiding behind the Act, the Act by means of which the National Government safeguarded them. These words were printed here: &#x201C;United Party and communists join forces against National Party.&#x201D; It was during that election campaign that their slogan was &#x201C;Wipe out Nationalism&#x201D;. In 1948 we had the Springbok Legion, which at that stage was an out and out communist organization under the leadership of a man by the name of Hodgson.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. VAN STADEN</person>:</from>

<p>No, that Springbok Legion kicked out Waring because he was too much of a gentleman. I just want to outline the history in order to come to the present and to the future. That Hodgson led the Springbok Legion, and at night, on behalf of the United Party, they posted up pamphlets, even on the churches of the Afrikaner; they did not even respect them. Sir, it was my privilege to give that Hodgson a hiding with a sjambok in the street, a hiding which I believe he will still remember in the hereafter. [Interjections.] I say that I accuse them of being responsible for the terrorists, and now I want to prove it.</p>

<p>Hodgson and Duncan&#x2014;I only want to mention a few names; there are numerous names we could mention&#x2014;were members of the United Front which helped the United Party to fight in 1948 and again in 1953. Of course, after the great victory of the National Party at the election of 1953, when that R2 million had been exhausted, that front disintegrated and crumbled like an old broom. Those two people whose names I mentioned, Hodgson and Duncan, fled from South Africa together with many others and established these depots in countries abroad, and they collected the money for training these terrorists, those people who are fighting on our borders today. These people for whom the United Party is responsible, are active on our borders today, and today our children and their children have to sacrifice their lives to the border; and that is not all&#x2014;it also costs South Africa millions of rands to combat these terrorists, but the <span class="col_4621-4622" refersTo="page_0774"/>United Party is responsible for the leaders of those people.</p>

<p>I want to take them to the present. They have formed a shadow Cabinet. That shadow Cabinet are sitting in the front benches. We can take them from the top down. Not so very long ago everybody in the front benches, with the exception of two, were members of the United Front. The one exception is the horn, member for Umbilo. That was before his political birth. The other exception is the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, who was labouring under a political delusion during those years, i.e. 1952-&#x2019;53. At that stake he was wandering about as a member of the National Party.</p>

<p>Now I ask how we can believe these people. A leopard cannot change its spots. They are simply the same old U.P. jingoes we have known all these years. In regard to matters of policy and principle they are still exactly where they stood in 1948. They have not moved forward one single inch. In the forties they turned over the workers to the communists. Those trade union leaders, such as Sacks and others, were the masters of the workers in South Africa under United Party policy. Some of their Ministers were patrons of The Friends of the Soviet Union. Today this United Party is still where it stood in the forties. This question of the rate for the job is nothing new. They learnt it from the communist trade union leaders. It was the slogan of Solly Sacks and others which they took over. And then they want to pretend today that this is something new.</p>

<p>What was achieved under communist trade union leaders through the rate for the job&#x003F; The White workers were turned over to the communists and kicked out of their jobs, because under the policy of the rate for the job, the majority of the trade union members were non-Whites. That was why the National Government, when it came into power in 1948, inherited such a tremendously large number of unemployed from the United Party. In looking at those hon. members today when they are boasting so much of how they are going to take over the reins of government one of these days and how they want to make an appeal to the youth, I am reminded of the 1950 election in South-West Africa. At the time I was holding meetings there and paying house-to-house visits in the daytime. On a certain occasion I called on a gentleman at Bethanien and told him that I was on my way to Maltah&#x00F6;he. I told him that I would address a meeting there that evening, and asked him on whom I could make house-to-house calls that day. He gave me certain names, as well as that of a man who lived in a house with a green roof. Then he said: &#x201C;No, you had better leave him out. Don&#x2019;t call on him, for he will only tell you that he is a Christian. He would be lying all the time, because he is a U.P. supporter.&#x201D;</p>

<p>But, what about the future&#x003F; Through the United Party&#x2019;s policy for the future, they want to take us back a hundred years. It took a hundred years, and it was a terrible struggle, to make this Parliament a purely White Parliament. We experienced the greatest constitutional crisis in this century. There was bitterness, there was bitterness between English and Afrikaansspeaking people; there was bitterness between Whites and non-Whites, and I can tell hon. members that this has not yet been forgotten. Now those hon. members want to take us back to where we started under an English r&#x00E9;gime a century ago. After the National Government had come into power in 1948, its first Act was the repeal of the Indian Representation Act. Those hon. members want to reinstate it now. They are not coming forward with a new proposal; they are still the same old jingoes we once knew.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Community Development mentioned here that we had been plunged into the War by a majority of 13, and that majority included three Bantu representatives. Now they want 16 representatives here in order to plunge us into another war. The people will never accept them, for if they came into power with this non-White policy of theirs, I want to tell hon. members today what would happen in South Africa. We would have another Anglo-Boer War. These Whites will never allow that, not after we struggled for a hundred years to find our own feet and to stand on our own political feet. I repeat: The same youth who voted for the Republic, against the wishes of those hon. members, will at all future elections return to power the National Party, which they trust.</p>

<speech by="#le_roux_brakpan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. J. LE ROUX (Brakpan)</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, allow me to assure you at the very first opportunity I have that I am deeply impressed by everything I have experienced up to now in the short time it <span class="col_4623-4624" refersTo="page_0775"/>has been my privilege to be in this traditional atmosphere. I am grateful for the pleasant and comforting way in which I have been received by you, your officials in the highest as well as in the junior posts, by members of my party and others in this House. I have come to make my contribution, and I trust that a spirit will always prevail in this House, one which will ensure that our beloved Republic will not falter through the instrumentality of enemies from outside or from inside.</p>

<p>At this stage it is desirable and fitting for me to pay tribute to my predecessor, Mr. Gert Bezuidenhout, who represented Brakpan in such a brilliant way in this House from 1961 to 1971. He came here, proud of his constituency and his people, and he soon became, and remained the pride of his constituency and his people.</p>

<p>As he did, I, too, should like to kick off by delivering a plea for Brakpan and its people. I want to give hon. members the assurance that our people earn their bread by the sweat of their brows, in all respects and in the fullest sense of the term. As hon. members know, three very strong mines which constituted the basis of the economy of Brakpan for a very long time, closed down during the past seven years. Characteristic of the flexibility of the Brakpan economy, we succeeded in overcoming these disasters, as it were. Moreover, it is expected that S.A. Lands and Vlakfontein will also close down in the course of 1973. The number of White employees in these three mines I have mentioned, was 330 at the date of closing down. At the moment there are approximately 900 White mine-workers in Sallies mine and in Vlakfontein. All of these workers do not live in Brakpan, but most of them do live in Brakpan and in the immediate vicinity. Consequently you will agree with me, Sir, that the devaluation of the rand has given an enormous impetus to the old mines on the East Rand and that it has made it worthwhile in all respects to render all possible assistance to mines such as S.A. Lands with regard to the pumping out of water during the recent floods. That is why we are grateful to the Government for granting such liberal assistance to the dying mines, particularly on the East Rand, in terms of the provisions of the Gold Mines Assistance Act, No. 82 of 1968.</p>

<p>It is estimated that an amount of R2,6 million will be spent next year in the form of subsidies for the pumping out of water.</p>

<p>The major part of this amount will be used for the East Rand. For this year the amount came to R1,8 million. This money is also used for the addition of lime to the water. I should like to recommend that consideration be given to having this addition of lime taking place automatically. This may result in a considerable saving.</p>

<p>As far as gold and gold mines are concerned, it will be remembered that even before the arrival of Jan van Riebeeck at the Cape in 1652, people in Europe firmly believed that gold could be found in most parts of Africa. This belief probably was the chief factor inspiring the voyages of exploration to these regions. We have come a long way since Jan van Riebeeck started looking for the empire of Monomotapa in 1660, and Sir John Barrow noted on his map in 1801 and 1802 the existence of &#x201C;High mountains supposed to contain gold mines&#x201D; in the vicinity of the Magaliesberg or the Witwatersrand.</p>

<p>In the course of the 100 years since the discovery of the first profitable South African goldfields, new discoveries and improved mining methods have increased the yield to such an extent that approximately 77 per cent of the free world&#x2019;s annual gold production comes from our mines. In this process 80 million tons of ore are crushed annually so as to yield R780 million&#x2019;s worth of gold per annum. Therefore the gold mining industry is and remains one of the cornerstones of our economic structure, as was said by the hon. the Minister of Finance when he was still Minister of Mines. I refer to Hansard, colum 6601 of 1962.</p>

<p>For this reason we note with appreciation that since 1910 amendments and adjustments have been effected to legislation approximately 20 times in respect of the compensation payable to people who contract lung and related diseases. This legislation is described as of the most modern in the world, and is based on the best which science can offer. Furthermore, I have read with appreciation in the 14th Annual Report (1969) of the Pneumoconiosis Research Unit, with reference to the international conference mainly sponsored by the Department of Mines and assisted by the asbestos mining industry, the South African Chamber of Mines and the Federated Miners&#x2019; Union, that the co-ordinator, Ian Webster, said that the pneumoconiosis research programme of South Africa was of the same standard as those <span class="col_4625-4626" refersTo="page_0776"/>of overseas organizations and that some projects were ahead of those of similar organizations. With regard to our mine hospitals, Dr. Marcus J. Stewart, Associate Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery at the University of Tennessee and orthopaedic consultant to the Surgeon-General of the U.S. Army, states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The mining industry system of hospitals was by far the best and most unique I have seen anywhere in the world.</block>

<p>We are grateful that the laws relating to pneumoconiosis compensation and industrial diseases are being revised in general at the present time.</p>

<p>As far as mining is concerned, I am proud to say that in the period from 1st March, 1967, to 29th February, 1972, no White person has lost his life as a result of a mining accident in the mines in the vicinity of Brakpan. Truly an excellent record.</p>

<p>While so much has been accomplished and so much is still being done to render assistance to our mines and to improve the state of health and the working conditions of our mine-workers, I want to address a further appeal to the Government at this stage, an appeal in connection with the uprooting and unsettlement of our people which arise both in the case of their leaving the mine on account of ill-health and of mines closing down. However, I shall deal with the case of ill-health first. It must be remembered that only the fittest person physically will get the necessary certificate to work underground. They have rightly been called Springbok material. Physically they are the cream of the crop. After that, they struggle for most of their lives in circumstances involving tremendous physical effort, enormous strain and long exhausting hours full of hardship and anxiety. Perhaps this contributes to the impression which our miners often give a person, actually erroneously, of possibly being suspicious of the good intentions of the State and the entrepreneurs. It is also true that our mineworkers who are forced by circumstances to leave the mines, have difficulty in adjusting to new spheres of employment, but they are merely looking for a place in the sun. Nevertheless, they have difficulty in being absorbed into the industrial sector. I plead for special attention to be given not only to the teaching of trades in which it will subsequently be possible for the ex-miner to remain productive above ground, but also to the psychological preparation for the changeover. I want to appeal to entrepreneurs in industry to employ our ex-miners. They are not work-shy; they just find the adjustment particularly difficult for understandable reasons.</p>

<p>As regards the mines which are closing down, I have indicated earlier on how many Whites are and have been employed on the mines in the vicinity of Brakpan. In coming years these people will have to be fitted in elsewhere. They are integrated members of our community and when the time comes they will have to leave their places of residence where they have put down their roots. In addition their lives are going to be affected by the following radical changes: Their children will have to adjust themselves to new schools and new environments; they themselves will have to become integrated in new environments, new societies and new communities. Where they have lived, every undertaking, every school, yes, every ramification of the community and of the community life will suffer as a result. Time does not permit me to spell out all the disadvantages&#x2014;psychologically, socially and economically&#x2014;for those who remain. However, I want to content myself with emphasizing how important it is that the Government should enjoy every support to assist and to subsidize the declining mines. If there is no other way, let us create new and more employment opportunities, and let us create them in the immediate vicinity of these mines where our people live and have put down their roots. Let us consider a systematic system of decentralization in this regard. Here on the East Rand in general, and in Brakpan in particular, the organizations of several mines with their office space, their residential areas and their recreational facilities, are available. It is a particularly suitable area for Railway extension or for Defence. There is so much space available.</p>

<p>In conclusion I wonder whether it is not possible to give encouragement to concerns which endeavour to manufacture building bricks from the tailings they use as raw material for this purpose.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasant duty to extend to the hon. member for Brakpan my sincere congratulations on his maiden speech. He addressed the House in a calm and dispassionate manner and made an excellent plea for his <span class="col_4627-4628" refersTo="page_0777"/>constituency. I am sure that we can expect a great deal from the hon. member in the future. I am sorry to have to say to him that according to the indications in Brakpan, and elsewhere, it seems to me as though his sojourn here may be of short duration, which will perhaps be a loss to this House.</p>

<p>As far as the hon. member for Malmesbury is concerned, I can only tell him with a shrug of the shoulders that it seems to me as though he has become too old to be influenced for the good. I want to remind him that this side of the House has never had a communist in its ranks. The National Party took Senator Petersen into its ranks. Senator Petersen stated before the commission of inquiry that he had said on a certain occasion that he was only living for the day when the Red Flag would fly above the City Hall of Durban. He was Senator of that side of the House. As far as communists and saboteurs are concerned, this side of the House furnished ample proof during the war years of how they dealt with people of that kind. I just want to remind hon. members that trains that were blown up at that time, conveyed Whites and not non-Whites. That was done by fellow South Africans. In conclusion I should like to refer the hon. member for Malmesbury to the article in today&#x2019;s <i>Argus</i> under the heading &#x201C;Swartz calls on Nats to prove their <i>bona fides&#x201D;.</i> In that article the following is said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Tom Swartz, chairman of the Coloured Representative Council Executive, said here today that the time was fast running out for the Nationalist Government to prove its sincerity in the implementation of its policy of separate development.</block>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. VAN Z. CILLI&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>I withdraw the word &#x201C;hypocrisy&#x201D;. The hon. member for Pietersburg said, amongst other things, the following in his speech yesterday: &#x201C;Every Budget arises from the consequences of the previous one, with the result that this Budget must be seen in conjunction with the previous one &#x2026; Throughout last year&#x2019;s Budget and this Budget there runs a golden thread &#x2026;&#x201D; The hon. member is quite correct. Last year&#x2019;s Budget had a very distinct effect on the economy of South Africa. It forced this Government to resort to a massive devaluation in December, 1971. That was the consequence of the maladministration of our economy. What is shocking, was that the rand had to be devalued by an even greater margin than was the case with the dollar. The countries with sound economies, such as Japan and West Germany, were not obliged to devalue. In fact, they revalued <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> all the other monetary units. It was countries whose economies had been weakened by Government actions that were obliged to devalue their monetary units as against the other monetary units. What is tragic, is that South Africa is the very country which is equipped for maintaining rapid growth along with relative price stability.</p>

<p>&#x2020;South Africa is richly endowed with most minerals and raw materials. We have abundant labour resources and we are not plagued with trade union problems as the United States and the United Kingdom are. Business leaders in South Africa are men of enterprise and initiative. We have the world&#x2019;s greatest gold-mining industry which has traditionally played a decisive role in stabilizing our balance of payments. Relative to our national income, our export trade is less vital to our economy than that of many other developed countries. Yet in spite of all these favourable factors the Government was forced to devalue the rand. Surely this conclusively proves that the economic policies thus far pursued by this Government have harmed South Africa&#x2019;s economy. The next eighteen months or few years are going to be crucial for our economy. What is of paramount importance is that devaluation has not changed our main problem in any respect. It avails us nothing to have a theoretical opportunity to increase production if the required labour is not made available, if inflation continues to raise our cost structure, if Government spending stifles the private sector and high taxation weakens incentive. Failure by the Government to appreciate these facts, as was again reflected in this year&#x2019;s Budget, and to act on this knowledge, will only land us into deeper economic troubles, and in the end we would not have benefited from this devaluation. Before long, our economy could again be forced on the down grade and the <span class="col_4629-4630" refersTo="page_0778"/>Government once again to devalue the rand.</p>

<p>*Never before in the history of South Africa have the Whites as well as the non-Whites of this country laboured under such a heavy burden of both direct and indirect taxes. Members opposite should not compare South Africa&#x2019;s taxes with those of other countries without also mentioning the benefits which the taxpayers receive from the State. A fair comparison will bring to light that the Whites of South Africa are bearing a tremendously high tax burden, and what did they get out of this Budget&#x003F; Never before have the wage and salary earners found their money depreciating so rapidly as a result of inflation. Never before have the lower income groups, as well as the pensioners, had to suffer such tremendous financial hardships. To put it briefly and in plain terms : the average South African finds it impossible and tremendously expensive to fend for himself financially speaking. The twin Frankensteins to which this Government&#x2019;s economic policy has given birth, i.e. rapidly increasing inflation and rapidly increasing taxation, are wreaking economic havoc in our country. All these things are happening in our rich, developed South Africa under this &#x201C;vigorous&#x201D; National Party Government. The hon. the Minister of Finance, even the hon. the Prime Minister, may try time and again to explain to the people outside why the Government cannot check the almost galloping inflation, but the voters are no longer interested in ideological folly. They are no longer interested in the incitement of white man against white man; they are no longer interested in &#x201C;Black peril&#x201D;. What they demand from the Government, is that a correct economic policy be implemented in this country to curb inflation, to alleviate the tax burden, to stimulate the growth rate adequately, to make opportunities for work available to everybody and to ensure peace and calm in South Africa, so that we may be in a strong position economically and in a military sense.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The economy of a modern industrial state such as South Africa is a finely balanced mechanism in which the law of supply and demand plays a fundamental role. Inflation is accepted as a by-product of prosperity, but&#x2014;and this is vital&#x2014;unless inflation is contained within tolerable limits, it will destroy the very prosperity from whence it springs. Inflation is best contained when the demand for goods and services is in equilibrium with the supply of goods and services. Due to various factors such as wage and salary increases, increasing numbers of economically active persons, the demand for goods and services is rapidly increasing. To satisfy this growing demand, it is imperative that the supply of goods and services be proportionately increased. If this does not happen, then too much money chases too few goods, resulting in price increases; in other words, we have inflation. Of course, if the supply is not proportionately increased to satisfy the growing demand, demand could be curtailed by increasing taxation and imports could be stepped up. The danger is that these measures introduced to combat inflation may in the long run very well have serious side-effects. Increased taxes are simply amounts of money which the public sector spends instead of the private sector. We know that the State&#x2019;s spending is often unproductive &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; which means that money comes into circulation without a <i>quid pro quo</i> in production. That is the sort of situation which we have in South Africa today. On the other hand, if imports are stepped up without a proportionate increase in exports, we immediately experience a balance of payments difficulty, and consequently suffer internal liquidity problems. This is exactly the position that we have in South Africa. Due to the Government&#x2019;s ideological approach to our economy, the growth of supply in South Africa has been inhibited by a spate of restraining legislation, especially in the sphere of labour, and hence supply in South Africa has, under this Government, been unable to keep pace with the escalating demand. In a desperate attempt to restore the equilibrium in the economy, the Government elected not to expand supply as was indicated, but to curtail demand by introducing progressively increased taxation. During the mid-&#x2019;sixties the Government introduced various fiscal and monetary measures. They were termed temporary measures, but are still being applied to combat inflation. At the same time greater imports were encouraged, while exports lagged behind. Each Budget contains new fiscal and monetary restraints, and this Budget once again has been no exception. Why does the Government not have the <span class="col_4631-4632" refersTo="page_0779"/>courage to say, &#x201C;We have been wrong all this time; we have created an artificial labour bottle-neck in South Africa; henceforth we shall activate supply to keep pace with escalating demand by repealing the totally unnecessary and inhibiting legislation restricting the full use of labour&#x201D;&#x003F; Why, in heaven&#x2019;s name, Mr. Speaker, did this Government think it wise to hitch South Africa&#x2019;s prosperity to a mythical ratio of one White to two or two and a half non-Whites industrial employees in the so-called metropolitan areas&#x003F; My hon. leader has given the Government the key to an improved economic climate, but the Government&#x2014;this &#x201C;kragdadige&#x201D; Government&#x2014;has refused to turn the key because it is fearful of introducing an increasing number of non-White skilled and semi-skilled labourers into our economy. My hon. leader laid down the guide-lines: Crash training programmes for non-Whites; safeguards for White workers; consultation with White trade unions and their co-operation in introducing non-Whites into our economy on the same basis as the hon. the Minister of Transport has done in the Railways. Why can the Government apply United Party labour policy with rousing success in one department and not do so in the rest of our economy&#x003F; If this labour bottle-neck were removed, the South African entrepreneur would regain confidence; the wheels of industry would start humming again; commerce and all ancillary economic enterprises would benefit; overseas investors would channel increasing funds to the Republic; revenue would flow more freely to the State coffers; as more and more persons became economically active, the tax burden would be spread and the individual&#x2019;s contribution would be lowered. In <i>Opinion Survey</i> No. 73 of the Bureau of Economic Research of the University of Stellenbosch it is stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Considering the ordered circumstances, we believe it essential for the Government policy to be examined carefully to determine whether it complies with the demands made upon it. In our previous survey we pointed out that as long as there exists a disequilibrium between the demand and the supply of production factors like labour and capital &#x2026;</block>

<speech by="#cilli&#x00E9;">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. VAN Z. CILLI&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I am quoting from the <i>Survey.</i> It goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For that reason we also emphasize the necessity of increasing the effective supply of labour, particularly in the light of expected greater demand. It is generally agreed that we are on the threshold of the new inflationary phase. Through various circumstances the anti-inflationary policy pursued in the past was less successful than hoped for. Therefore care should be taken to minimize the inflationary forces which are bound to accompany a new expansionary phase.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, over-touchy National Party spokesmen are quick to say that we are unpatriotic if we criticize the Nat. Party&#x2019;s maladministration of our economy, but let me spell out in the clearest possible terms what I consider an unpatriotic act of the gravest and greatest magnitude, and that is the prolongation of the maladministration of our economy which may lead to economic and political disaster in this country, if it continues. Sir, is history going to repeat itself&#x003F; Is a Nat. Government in the early 1970s going to lead South Africa to the brink of financial disaster as a Nat. Government led South Africa to disaster in the early 1930s&#x003F; Just as an S.A.P. Party had to come and guide South Africa back to sanity and financial security in the 1930s, it is becoming apparent that the United Party of the 1970s will have to lead South Africa back from the brink of disaster to which this Government has led the country.</p>

<p>*I am convinced that the National Party&#x2019;s inflexible ideological approach makes it impossible for that party to implement the only sound economic policy in South Africa. It is only a United Party Government that can provide everybody in South Africa with prosperity, ensuring peace and calm and the reinforcement of our Western civilization and making it possible for justice to be done to everybody. It is fortunate that these truths are beginning to find acceptance with a progressively wider circle of the voting public. The voters are beginning to show the classic signs auguring the fall of a Government that has had its day, and it is clear that the next genera] election must come soon, so that they may get done with that party government which so unnecessarily tortured them financially for so many years.</p>

<speech by="#du_plessis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. T. C. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>Before this debate we heard a lot about the smashing attack by the United Party on the Government <span class="col_4633-4634" refersTo="page_0780"/>in this debate and the <i>Sunday Times</i> especially boosted them up considerably.</p>

<p>I read here that the Minister of Finance, Dr. Diederichs, is amply marked by his opposition counterpart, Mr. Sonny Emdin, M.P, for Parktown. Furthermore I want to quote from the <i>Sunday Times</i> where it says : &#x201C;After him the United Party has a string of at least eight top-line financial and economic spokesmen, while Mrs. Helen Suzman, Progressive Party M.P. for Houghton, is also ranked as a formidable speaker on economic matters.&#x201D;</p>

<p>*I really think it is an injustice the <i>Sunday Times</i> is doing the hon. member for Parktown by comparing him to our Minister of Finance, for surely it is unfair to try to compare two things which are not in the same class. If we contrast these two people, we see that South Africa is in the fortunate position that she has a Minister of Finance who is internationally recognized and who compels international regard and respect. I want to tell you that the name &#x201C;Diederichs&#x201D; is a well-known name in international financial circles. I want to say further than when we think of the part he played in the gold agreement, we cannot but have respect for such a Minister of Finance. What is more, we saw in this House that the Minister of Finance is equally proficient in both Afrikaans and English. I can also tell you that our Minister of Finance, when he finds himself in Germany, is capable of negotiating with the Germans in their own language.</p>

In the first place, if I may quote the hon. the Prime Minister, he said &#x201C;We extended the hand of friendship to the English-speaking people in South Africa&#x201D;.

I challenge the Leader of the Opposition, and I challenge the hon. member for Parktown, that he and I should to Oudtshoorn, and I shall speak English and he Afrikaans. Sir, it is a question of horses for courses. The United Party cannot afford to have the Nationalist Afrikaner in Oudtshoorn see what it really looks like, for they will not vote for it. They cannot afford to send the hon. member for Musgrave to Oudtshoorn. They cannot send the hon. member for South Coast to Oudtshoorn and there are many others of their ilk sitting on that side of the House. Why do they not send the chief spokesman on Finance to Oudtshoorn so that Oudtshoorn can hear what the alternative policy of the United Party is in regard to the economy&#x003F; Why does the shadow Minister of Finance not state it there&#x003F;</p>

<p>I can just tell the hon. member that I was in Tara just before the election when I was there, looking for the hon. member, who was a patient. We have now had the admission from the United Party that those Coloured representatives are going to receive the full rights in this Parliament which other members of the House of Assembly also have. That means, in other words, that the United Party cannot refuse those people the right to go and live in Acacia Park, because they will be full-fledged members of the House of Assembly. They cannot refuse them this privilege, if they did they would be dishonest.</p>

<p>The United Party says that they will be full-fledged members of the House of Assembly. I now come to the next point. I cannot see how one could discriminate against any of the members of this House of Assembly, who are supposed to be on an equal footing. After all, those hon. members do not believe in discrimination. How will houses be allocated then&#x003F; Hon. members know that the houses there are allocated on the basis of the number of children a member has. Now I just want to know whether the hon. members of the United Party are going to refuse those children admission to the Acacia Park Primary School&#x003F; After all, they are children of a member of the House of Assembly. Can the hon. member for Yeoville tell me that&#x003F; The hon. member for Yeoville uses eloquent language; let him tell us. The difficulty with the United Party is that they advocate a policy and discuss the theory of it here. They are up in the air. However, when we come to the hard reality of the implementation of that policy in practice, they cannot reply to us. Then they are afraid to reply, for, after all, there is an election taking place in Oudtshoorn.</p>

What did the hon. member say&#x003F; He referred to my hon. friend from Durban Central as a &#x201C;detribalized Afrikaner&#x201D;. It is because of this very attitude that that side of the House cannot talk about national unity. One only has to look at this side of the House to see the admixture we have of the two main language groups in this country, to see that this is not only national unity but furthermore a living example of national unity. What was the position in the 1970 general election&#x003F; How many English-speaking candidates did the National Party have then apart from that scion of the English language, the hon. the Minister of Sport and Recreation&#x003F; You do not even need the fingers of two hands to count them on. How many English-speaking members have they got on that side today&#x003F; They have one, and he cannot speak Afrikaans. That is the sum total on their side. One only has to look on our side where 60 per cent of our members are Afrikaans-speaking. Is this not the living symbol of national unity in this country&#x003F; I want to go further and say to the hon. member for Lydenburg that after the speech he made here this afternoon, I would rather live next to certain Coloured people that I know than next to him. I want my children to grow up in a spirit of amity and of loving one&#x2019;s neighbour. One cannot love a neighbour like that. I am certain that my children will never love his children. You cannot love a bloke like him.</p>

<p>He asked whether we will accept Coloureds to represent Coloureds in this House and whether we will eat with them in the dining room. That is the individual choice of every member of this House. I choose today with whom I will have dinner in this House but I know of one member with whom I will not have dinner. This is the most vicious and nasty speech I have heard here. This hatred which he is trying to sow, and this campaign of hate which was started by the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, the Minister of Defence and the Minister of Labour earlier, is nothing but a campaign between White and White. It is bad enough when it is between White and non-White, but here you have them spreading it between White and White. I think my hon. friend for Yeoville was right when he said that we are not back to 1948, but back to 1938.</p>

<p>But we are dealing here with a Budget and it was my intention to talk about the effects of it on the man in the street, and of what is happening to the man in the street today.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietersburg&#x2014;I am glad to see he is here&#x2014;spoke yesterday and took one of my colleagues to task for saying that we are living in a state of uncontrolled cost of living at the moment. I want to say that this is quite right. You only have to ask the housewives of South Africa. Are they happy with the cost of living&#x003F; Are the wives of members on the other side happy with the cost of living&#x003F; Are they satisfied that they are not paying more than they should be paying if the country had been run correctly and if the economy of the country had been so handled that they could live cheaper&#x003F; Why has the cost of living increased&#x003F; We have the word of the hon. the Minister of Finance himself, who last year on the 23rd November said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_4647-4648" refersTo="page_0787"/>It is true that our consumer price index is still rising at an annual rate of some 6 per cent.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Pietersburg tried to say yesterday it was only 3 per cent, but the hon. Minister for Finance says it is rising by 6 per cent, which is high by our standards, and certainly not satisfactory. This is the most important part, that the Minister of Finance makes the following admission&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But firstly, about one-third of this increase is attributable to the increases in indirect taxes and Government administered prices, such as Railway and postal rates, which had to be introduced earlier this year.</block>

<p>Government policy and Government action &#x2014;this is what is causing the rise in the cost of living. Every housewife who walked into a supermarket in the last few months has found she has had to pay more for every commodity.</p>

<p>The hon. member asks me, &#x201C;Such as&#x003F;&#x201D; I want to give a specific example. We have heard quite a lot about the projected reintroduction of an ex-Minister Mr. Haak, to the Cabinet, to come and take over the portfolio of Economic Affairs. We have at the moment the Minister of Economic Affairs who is being hailed as one who is doing a good job of work. He is particularly being praised for what he has done in the way of price control. The last commodity on which he placed price control, was yellow margarine. He controlled the retail price at 18 cents and 20 cents per 250 gr. pack, depending on the type of pack. Unfortunately he is not here, but I would like to put a question to anybody on that side with some economic brain, somebody who might be able to answer it.</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Did the Minister of Economic Affairs investigate the price structure of that yellow margarine first before he placed that price control on it&#x003F; I believe that that price has been fixed too high. I believe that that industry is being protected by this very price control, that the Minister of Economic Affairs is achieving the exact opposite of what he hoped to achieve. He is maintaining the price at a high level, while it should come down. The price of yellow margarine should never be as high as this. There is another aspect to the whole margarine story which this Minister of Economic Affairs seems to have missed. What about the cheap products which were available to the housewife before the introduction of yellow margarine&#x003F; What happened to the white margarine the housewife was buying at between eight cents and ten cents per 250 gr. pack&#x003F; That is gone. What is this Government doing to see that the housewife should still be able to get that pack at between eight and ten cents&#x003F; Sir, do you know what has happened since the introduction of this price control&#x003F; The one brand of white margarine which was being sold at ten cents, is today being sold at 12 to 13 cents. The one that was being sold at 8 cents has disappeared altogether. The white margarine which was being sold at 13 cents and 14 cents is today being sold at 16 cents and 17 cents. This is the effect of the price control which the Government has introduced. I do not believe that there should be any price control on yellow margarine at all; I believe that it should be left to find its own price level. I do not believe that it needs any protection. The Minister of Agriculture is not here unfortunately, but I wonder how much the nut farmers and the oilseed farmers are being exploited by the margarine manufacturers. Sir, that is one answer to hon. members opposite who asked me what commodities have gone up in price.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Finance has introduced a Budget which I would like to describe as a &#x201C;skelm&#x201D; Budget because of the way in which he had to duck and dive to balance it, and the way in which he has made concessions with the one hand and taken them back with the other hand.</p>

<p>Sir, it is a little bit more than &#x201C;slim&#x201D;. The hon. the Minister of Finance, when he announced the removal of the loan levy on income tax, said that the worker is now going to find that he will have a slightly larger take-home pay packet. I do not know to whom the hon. the Minister of Finance was referring. Was he referring to the higher income group, or to the man in the street&#x003F; Because I have had a look at some tax tables which were issued with the authority of his department and I find that a married man with no children earning R3 000 &#x2014;this is not a wealthy person at all; it is the average married man&#x2014;is now going to take home R232-50, whereas last month he would have taken home R232-25 after the deduction of tax. He is going to take home a whole 25 cents more. I suppose the hon. the Minister of Finance was quite right in saying that the worker was going to have a bigger take-home pay packet, but really, Sir, does this signify anything, especially when that same man realizes that taking home this extra 25 cents a month is going to cost him, over the next seven years, R21 per year which he is not going to get back&#x003F; He is taking home an extra 25 cents a month, but he is losing R21 per year which he would have got back before, plus 5 per cent interest until the loan levy is repaid. A married man with three children earning R4 500 a year, or R375 a month, will take home 22 cents a month more than he took home before the Budget, and for that extra 22 cents a month he is going to lose R22, which is not going to be paid back to him in the form of a loan levy refund. This is why I referred to this Budget in the way I did, because he is making concessions with one hand and taking them back with the other hand. I really do not know whether the man in the street is better off or is not better off as a result of this Budget.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has announced certain concessions in the sales tax. At last we can be a clean society in South Africa, because we are not going to pay any tax on soaps and soap powers, but I wonder why the hon. the Minister has not gone further. As you know, there are many societies in this country which deal with less fortunate people than ourselves, with people who are handicapped in one way or another. I refer particularly to societies for the blind which assist these unfortunate people to produce something; to be useful in some way. I refer particularly to blind societies which are producing basket work and things of that kind. This sales tax is being applied to the products of those organizations. I wonder whether the Minister of Finance cannot take a look at this and at least give them the benefit of the concessions which he has granted. He has indicated that where they are paying the sales tax on commodities which they are using they will be exempt from the sales tax. What about the sales tax on the goods which they are producing and which are being sold to the public for the benefit of these people.</p>

<p>Sir, the Budget debate is going on, and I am sorry that the Minister of Defence and the Minister of Labour are not here because they are the people who have started this campaign of hate between the different language groups in South Africa. I was sorry to have to speak as I did when I started my speech this afternoon, to the hon. member for Lydenburg. I am afraid it has upset me, and I sincerely hope this will be the end of that sort of talk in this House, because it is not doing this House or South Africa justice at all. I believe that we have to work together; that only with national unity are we going to get anywhere in this country, and by &#x201C;national unity&#x201D; I do not mean only unity between the English-speaking and the Afrikaansspeaking people of this country; I am not only referring to unity between the White people in this country. I am referring to the sort of unity that is being encouraged today by the hon. the Minister of Defence and the hon. the Minister of Police, both of whom unfortunately are not here at the moment, in the fight that is going on on our borders today. I believe that this is a true display of unity in this country, because there are English-speaking and Afrikaans-speaking South Africans up there; there are non-White South Africans up there, all fighting together. They are fighting because of their love for one country, their love for South Africa. I sincerely hope that the speech of the hon. member for Lydenburg is the last that we are going to hear of this sort of talk.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not know whether you could follow what the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District wanted to communicate to the House. What was the theme of his speech&#x003F; What was the message he wanted to convey to the electorate in Pietermaritzburg or in Natal, or to the electorate of <span class="col_4651-4652" refersTo="page_0789"/>the country&#x003F; Sir, we know that hon. member; in his case it is a question of more sound than sense. It is a case of the mountain that conceived and brought forth a mouse. In fact, on the part of the Opposition, that has so far been the characteristic of the entire debate. They made a great fuss and kicked up a lot of dust here, but what have they actually achieved&#x003F; The hon. member attacked us for allegedly having failed in connection with the promotion of national unity. Why does he not tell us of the United Party&#x2019;s ideal of greater national unity in this multinational country of ours that must have one Parliament for all the various national groups that inherently differ from each other but will owe loyalty only to one South Africa&#x003F; Why does the hon. member not tell us how he wants to bring about that type of unity in South Africa&#x003F; Sir, that is what we get from the Opposition when we are dealing with the most delicate relationship questions. When it comes to the important questions about which we must exchange ideas in a debate such as this, then they fail; then we get the kind of dust the hon. member was kicking up here.</p>

<p>The hon. member eventually came back to the Budget and therefore I also want to express a few ideas about the Budget here.</p>

<p>As far as the Budget is concerned, the remarks he made, the so-called plea he delivered for certain consumer groups and for the man in the street will make no impression on them. I can assure him of that. Why not&#x003F; Because the electorate of South Africa has, in the space of almost a quarter of a century, become sufficiently familiar with the manner in which a responsible Government has looked after their welfare and their prosperity and salvation, the prosperity of the poor as well as the rich. Therefore they will not want to entrust their interests to a Government such as that. The tension that always precedes a Budget has passed, and there is no trace of a destructive storm as predicted by the United Party and as expected and hoped for by them. All the enemies of the Government, themselves included, were bereft of words; they were at a loss for words with which to predict how this Budget speech would actually prove itself to be the swan song of the National Party. It was to have been the end of the National Party and of the country&#x2019;s economy, and it must therefore have been a tremendous disappointment to them. It must have been a tremendous disappointment to all the prophets of doom that there was no ominous storm after the calm, but a calm silence after the storm kicked up by them, and that it bore the stamp of a mild Budget, of a soft rain, refreshing and full of promise for the economy of South Africa. In a masterly fashion that inflated balloon was pricked by the hon. the Minister of Finance, and instead of mordant criticizm on his Budget speech there was an overwhelmingly favourable reaction, and the poor attack, particularly that of yesterday, left the impression of the Opposition&#x2019;s helplessness when it comes to attacking that Budget. It was the attack of a toothless old lion on a wild buck. The sting was missing. There was a faint kind of buzzing, the buzz of a bee that wants to attack without a sting. You know, a bee that really attacks with the object of stinging makes a hissing sound and one ducks out of its way, but that noise made here yesterday by the Opposition was really that of a small bee without a sting. This Budget fills one with wonder for the way in which the hon. the Minister carried out this difficult task. A long list of the names of prominent economists, financiers, businessmen, political columnists and the editors of magazines have already been mentioned by hon. members on this side of the House, a list of people who unequivocally aired their views over the radio, in the daily Press and in financial journals, and all were agreed that the hon. the Minister acquitted himself well of a difficult task as few Ministers of Finance have ever before been able to do in such circumstances. The only element on which this made no impression was the Opposition, and this is understandable because a mild and favourable Budget would not have suited their purpose. The increase of inflation and of interest rates, the extension of sales duty, increased personal and indirect taxation, new price increases and the decrease of exports as against additional restrictions on imports, with no consideration for the needs of the low-paid groups and the pensioners, would have created a climate in which the Opposition could have fought Oudtshoorn and in which they could have thrived in the few years up to 1975. It is tragic to have such an Opposition in the benches opposite. They are negative in their very essence. It is characteristic of them that their eyes do not open to the fatal results their party&#x2019;s negativism has on themselves <span class="col_4653-4654" refersTo="page_0790"/>and South Africa, because a Government ought to have a strong and dynamic Opposition to stimulate it. We do not get that from the other side. They are negative in their conduct. They shy away from questions; they shrink from actualities and they conduct themselves irresponsibly in every speech outside and inside the House. Negativism embodies the germ of fragmentation, degeneration and death. That much we know; we learnt that when we were still at university. Negativism influences the spirit and the thoughts of man and creates an attitude of helplessness, of surrender, and leads to total powerlessness when it comes to tackling a difficult task or a ticklish problem calmly, purposefully and positively. Political negativism is the overriding characteristic of the United Party. That is why they engender no confidence, and that is why in future they will not engender any confidence either. For that reason they have already been sitting in the desert for 25 years. It is also for that reason that they want to try to rub in the bit of encouragement they received after the Brakpan issue. It is, however, small relief in the desert. Someone who lives in the desert or has lost his way there, will tell us that when a small cloud appears and a few droplets fall it is really refreshing as far as he is concerned. It is in reality a temporary, passing phenomenon and we can assure them that in 1975 there will be even fewer members sitting opposite, on the Opposition side. When the United Party is confronted with policy principles, with cultural and spiritual values, with ticklish questions of colour and relationships, with security measures of a delicate nature that sometimes have to be drastically implemented, these negativistic characteristics come perfectly clearly to the fore. Then they become soft, defenceless and powerless. There is only one member amongst them, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, who sometimes depicts them accurately and correctly. He notices their weaknesses and displays much greater political understanding than the existing United Party leadership corps as a whole. Possibly this is attributable to the fact that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout spent quite a few years in the National Party school-benches.</p>

<p>In particular I want to quote two statements of his to prove that he has a correct view of the United Party and that he put them in their place. I want to give him credit for a pure and realistic vision. It seldom happens that I agree with their policy-makers, or rather, it has never happened yet. In this connection, in connection with what he said in that notorious speech of his before the United Party&#x2019;s Transvaal congress, I want to mention two truths that will give an even better characterization of the United Party. In connection with the colour relationship and the representation of non-Whites in Parliament, in comparison with the National Party&#x2019;s policy, he said the following before the congress&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The situation in South Africa is changing radically. Anybody who continues to believe that Black and Brown people will be satisfied with the few paternalistic crumbs from the White man&#x2019;s table, is living in a fool&#x2019;s paradise.</block>

<p>It is a great truth and a correct view advanced by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The time is past that a White man can say to a non-White: &#x201C;I am prepared to work with you, but you must talk to me through a White man and choose a White man to represent you.&#x201D;</block>

<p>I want to repeat what I have just said. I have never joined the political company of the United Party&#x2019;s policy-makers, but I can find no fault with these statements of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. Upon a closer analysis of this statement by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, an interesting question arises. He says: &#x201C;Anybody who believed &#x2026; is living in a fool&#x2019;s paradise.&#x201D; Who is that &#x201C;anybody&#x201D; he is speaking about&#x003F; If we now subject this sentence to exegetic analysis, the &#x201C;anybody&#x201D; embraces those people sitting there on the opposite side. And they, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout says, are living in a &#x201C;fool&#x2019;s paradise&#x201D;. In other words, that is what a front bencher of the United Party says in respect of this representation of non-Whites by Whites in this House. &#x201C;Anyone who believes &#x2026; is living in a fool&#x2019;s paradise,&#x201D; he says, and who is that &#x201C;anybody&#x201D;&#x003F; It is the Opposition in its totality. It is the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, Sir de Villiers Graaff, if we may mention him by name. It is the Leader of Natal, the man who said: &#x201C;March against the Republic.&#x201D; They are all living in a &#x201C;fool&#x2019;s paradise&#x201D; as far as that is concerned. We read the considered opinion of someone <span class="col_4655-4656" refersTo="page_0791"/>who is an authority in the inner circles of the United Party, a person who is a member of their caucus, and according to him they are people living in a fool&#x2019;s paradise.</p>

<p>I am sorry the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is not present, because I wanted to ask him whether he is not unhappy in such company. Can he be happy and identify himself with those people in that fool&#x2019;s paradise&#x003F; Does he not feel inclined to break away again, as in the past, and to establish a new party with the help of the <i>Sunday Times</i> and other periodicals&#x003F; He already has quite a few friends. I see that the <i>Economist,</i> an influential London newspaper, writes in the same vein about the U.P. They also state that those people are living in a fool&#x2019;s paradise and that they do not have the ability to advocate an alternative policy to that of the National Party in such a way that in practice it is acceptable to the public. The <i>Economist</i> states that they must not be jubilant about this small setback to the National Party on the Rand. They say that from time to time over the years, since 1948, the English-speaking and the Afrikkaans-speaking people have expressed their opposition to that policy, and the United Party cannot understand this. They remain unable to state their policy in such a way that it becomes acceptable. That is why it hides that weakness which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout mentioned, i.e. the people Who can believe that the non-Whites will be satisfied to be represented by Whites are living in a fool&#x2019;s paradise. Sir, the question is : Why does the hon. member paint such a picture of his party&#x003F; If one analyses his statement further one comes upon these words of his : &#x201C;One of the first things that they will learn is that the time is past when a White man can say to a non-White man I am prepared to work with you, but you must talk to me through a White man&#x2019;.&#x201D; He says that time is past, because that would mean that the non-Whites must only receive the political crumbs from the political table, this Parliament, and they will not be satisfied with that. He states : &#x201C;Anybody who continues to believe that the Black and Brown people will be satisfied with a few crumbs from the White man&#x2019;s table &#x2026;&#x201D; What are those &#x201C;crumbs&#x201D;&#x003F; They are made up of that initial representation by six Whites. Those are the crumbs, and that is what his colleagues cannot understand. They do not realize that they will not be able to satisfy the Zulu, the Xhosa, the Sotho and all the various population groups with that policy and that they will not be able to take those people back to where they were when they had this representation. That is why Mr. Basson, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, says that the crumbs that fall from the &#x201C;White mans&#x2019; table,&#x201D; Parliament, are unacceptable to the non-Whites in South Africa. This is also impracticable as far as we are concerned. And even if it were to be for an interim period, as he puts it, when the Whites have to be represented by a Black man in the future, this will still only be crumbs they are receiving, because the Bantu will always be numerically superior to the Whites. There will be millions of them. We shall be in the minority and shall never be able to give the non-Whites proportionate non-White representation in this House. They will consequently always still be getting the crumbs.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if we look further at the statement of the hon. member, and if we analyse the United Party&#x2019;s policy, it is very clear to us that in contrast the National Party&#x2019;s policy is a strong and positive one. After years of reflection and study this policy was formulated, and the National Party is in the process of implementing it. The National Party wants to regard every population group as a national unit with a national consciousness of its own and as an entity. This party wants to lead them to full and equal status in accordance with their abilities. By the application of White leadership&#x2014;which is actually supremacy (baasskap)&#x2014;the United Party wants to feed those people with crumbs during an interim period. I want to ask them what they are going to do at a later stage. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has already said that it will depend on the pressure applied. Provisionally the Bantu will just be represented by Whites. Subsequently the non-Whites will be represented by non-Whites. What follows upon that, according to him, will depend on the amount of pressure applied to them.</p>

<p>I am reminded that in a debate here one of the hon. members said that they would exercize White leadership <i>ad infinitum</i>, even though they have to do so with force. They will always feed the Bantu crumbs. In other words, the Bantu will always be kept in a subordinate position. He also said they would apply White leadership, which is a form of supremacy. What does Mr. Japie Basson, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, <span class="col_4657-4658" refersTo="page_0792"/>say about that&#x003F; He sticks to the standpoint he expressed at the United Party Congress in the Transvaal. I quote from the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 9th April, 1972, in which a beautifully gilded article appeared. According to that article Mr. Basson stated:</p>

<block name="quote">I am not arguing against the right of a territory which has acquired the personality of a state, to become independent if it does not see happy future for itself in a federal structure: Quite the opposite. I hold that White &#x201C;baasskap&#x201D; has no future.</block>

<p>And that White supremacy is White leadership. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout stated that the supporters of that leadership and supremacy, whoever they may be, are living in a fool&#x2019;s paradise.</p>

<p>But there are also other aspects of the United Party&#x2019;s actions whereby they fail to make an impression and with which they still discredit South Africa&#x2019;s image. It is the way in which they sometimes present as suspect the custodians of the security of our country. If the case were not pending, I could have been able to refer to one outstanding example with reference to a report in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 31st October, 1971. Without going into the essentials of the Timol incident, because then I would be out of order, I just want to refer to the front-page report of the <i>Sunday Times,</i> in which the frontbenchers of the Opposition were guilty of sowing suspicion. The heading of the report reads: &#x201C;Public Suspect Torture, says Mike Mitchell&#x201D;. A large photograph of him accompanied it. The sub-title of the report stated: &#x201C;Vorster &#x2018;losing control of security operations&#x2019;.&#x201D; In the report the following is stated, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Rightly or wrongly, the man in the street has reached the state of mind where he strongly suspects that detainees are being tortured in dark little rooms &#x2026; and fears that methods of the Gestapo have been used by the Security Police, Mr. Mike Mitchell said.</block>

<p>So they continue. The Leader of the Opposition is quoted as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It causes one to wonder what leads people to take this step in a country like South Africa. The time has come for a judicial enquiry into the conditions under which detainees are held and the treatment meted out to them.</block>

<p>Their twin brother, the Leader of the Progressive Party, Mr. Eglin, states the following: &#x201C;The Security Police now rule South Africa. Mr. Vorster has lost control of the country and effective rule is passing into the hands of the Security Police.&#x201D; After Judge James&#x2019; decision was given in connection with the trial in Pietermaritzburg, a report again appeared in the <i>Sunday Times</i> in which he expressed his appreciation and acknowledged that it is encouraging that there was such a decision with respect to the accusations made by the accused against the Police concerning their treatment when they were still awaiting trial. My reason for mentioning this now is that while they made this statement, declaring&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It remains only to add that Mr. Justice James, the Judge-President, found as a fact that the claims of witnesses about Police brutality were unfounded, in view of the fact that Police brutality is an issue widely canvassed,</block>

<p>they were already guilty of having &#x201C;widely canvassed&#x201D; it. They state further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The finding of the judge in this instance is important. It must be accepted as such and there will be general relief that the ugly charges brought against the Police have turned out to be without foundation.</block>

<p>But let us look at what they state in this same article immediately prior to the portion I have just quoted. They state&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We can understand the impatience of Africans who seek reform. They feel that the process of change in South Africa is too slow. There is something to be said for that view, but they will nevertheless have to curb their impatience &#x2026;</block>

<p>I cannot read everything, because there is not sufficient time for that, but what it means is that the people have the right to fight and struggle; they will get what they want, but they must just do it in a different way. In other words, on the one hand they want to pacify them a little, but on the other hand they do want to tell the people that their cause <span class="col_4659-4660" refersTo="page_0793"/>is a valid one, that they must continue as long as they do not act on terrorist or subversive lines. But look at how this is neutralized by the <i>Sunday Times.</i> Those people always play the same game. Here you have the proof. There are so many other proofs, <i>inter alia,</i> those which I have just quoted, with the beautiful photographs of all the leaders of the U.P. who contributed towards discrediting the Police in connection with this incident. The heading of the same leader in the <i>Cape Times</i> of 9th April, 1972, reads: &#x201C;Unpleasant spectacle.&#x201D; They refer to the Minister of Police&#x2019;s reaction to these events in connection with the derailment between Potgietersrust and Nylstroom, and so on. They refer scornfully to the remarks of the Minister of Police as &#x201C;Unpleasant &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have had a very engaging afternoon in this Budget debate. I would like to say that, had I not known for certain that we were engaged on a Budget debate, I really would not have known because we were busy fighting the Oudtshoorn by-election here all afternoon. We have had hardly any discussion at all on any of the vitally important economic matters disturbing South Africa after the first speaker sat down. We had the interesting spectacle of the Minister of Labour devoting his entire half-hour to attacking the United Party on its colour policy. Of course, the official Opposition has responded in like manner. The hon. the Minister of Community Development, I think, enjoyed himself more this afternoon than he has done for many a session; because he was able to revert to type. He was able to become once again a political in-fighter.</p>

<p>Well, he is a good political in-fighter. I have always given him credit for that and I think that is really his <i>m&#x00E9;tier</i> rather more than the heavy responsibilities of Cabinet rank.</p>

<p>We have not really this afternoon discussed any of the pressing matters which are troubling the economy of South Africa. I must apologize for spoiling the fun of the House, but I propose to get back to economic affairs, and more particularly to the whole question of labour and its proper utilization in South Africa. What pleased me most of all this session was the fact that three Ministers in this House, namely the Minister of Transport, the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs and the Minister of Finance, have in fact now officially, one might say, given <i>de jure</i> recognition to a situation which has increasingly become <i>de facto</i> in South Africa. We had three Ministers inside the House and also one Minister, the Minister of Planning, outside the House, giving <i>de jure</i> recognition to a <i>de facto</i> situation. That is that in South Africa, what has always been known as the traditional labour pattern, in fact no longer exists. That is a pattern whereby all skilled and most of the semi-skilled work in South Africa was reserved for White workers, mostly by custom, but also by statute, and that only the unskilled work, and some semi-skilled work, was done by Black, Coloured and Indian workers. It has become increasingly obvious in South Africa that this is no longer the case, that more and more semi-skilled jobs and, indeed, some of the skilled jobs, are having to be done by non-White workers. I, for one, heartily welcome the fact that official recognition has now been given to this. The fact is that the Government has announced that there is to be a certain amount of flexibility. It is true that it was couched in cautious terms, no doubt again with an eye on the Oudtshoorn by-election, but the hon. Minister of Finance did announce that there is to be a certain amount of flexibility in the future labour utilization in South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, last night when the House adjourned, I was saying that I heartily welcomed the fact that the Government was at last apparently beginning to recognize the facts of life in South Africa and that certain important changes in labour policy had been announced by three Ministers inside the House and by one Minister outside this House. I want to say that it is lucky for South Africa that economics is stronger than politics, because I believe that this country would have been utterly sunk otherwise by the economic policies that have been followed by the Government, which have inhibited industrial growth in South Africa. I speak of factors such as colour-bar regulations, restrictions on the mobility of labour, both horizontally and vertically, and Acts such as the Physical Planning Act. Fortunately, as I have said, economics is stronger than politics, and because of the inherent strength of our economy, South Africa has survived despite this Government. The only thing indeed that has saved us has been this fact, plus the occasional windfall that we have had, such as new mineral discoveries, for example in the Free State and on the West Rand, and the rise in the price of gold. What would have happened to South Africa without the attempted stranglehold on economics, is of course another matter. The prosperity and boom conditions in this country almost defy one&#x2019;s imagination. But that is an academic matter, because we have not had an economy free from these strangleholds and therefore there is no point in pursuing that matter any further.</p>

<p>I want to say that job reservation, for instance, which was offered as the life raft for the White worker, as a protection against the competition of the Black worker, has largely fallen into disuse because of the pressure of economics and the demand for labour, and today less than 2,9 per cent of jobs are affected by job reservation. We have found that White shunters have quite miraculously become Black train assemblers, that engineering jobs have become deskilled as the colour of the operators changed, that postbags are toted on Black and Brown backs, that Coloured ladies serve White ladies across shop counters, and that Black voices answer White voices on the telephone. And believe it or not, Sir, the end of the world has not come; the South African economy has indeed flourished as a result of these changes.</p>

<p>It is clear from the recent Government commitment to growth without inflation, to the better utilization of non-White labour, and the exhortation to the private sector to follow the lead set by the Railways in making better use of non-White labour, that this must result in more and more Africans being drawn into the economy and into industry and commerce in all areas. The Government&#x2019;s willingness, as announced by the Minister of Defence, to permit firms to exceed the White/Black labour ratio in the Witwatersrand triangle and in other areas, and to retain their present African labour quota in the White metropolitan areas even if they set up industries in the border areas, also means, of course, that there will be more non-White, and particularly Black, labour in the urban areas.</p>

<p>It may well be that economic historians writing of this particular period will call it the commencement of South Africa&#x2019;s third industrial revolution, that is, providing the announcements made by the Ministers are followed in a positive way and that we are really going to make better use of our labour resources, and that we will have the resultant increased productivity which this must bring about. It follows also that any Government with any foresight would be taking a number of anticipatory steps in order to offset the obvious transitional difficulties that accompany any major socio-economic change.</p>

<p>What are the most important steps that a Government with foresight should be taking&#x003F; The hon. member for Johannesburg North mentioned some of them the other day, including the important one regarding education and training for African workers. This is quite obvious. It is also obvious, as he mentioned, that the lack of basic education is an enormous stumbling block for the future training of Black workers; so something has to be done now if we are in the immediate future, within the <span class="col_4663-4664" refersTo="page_0795"/>next 10 or 15 years, to take advantage of the additional use of trained Black labour. There are other factors too. The hon. member is correct when he says that White labour should be retrained and deployed into other paths in order to ease these transitional difficulties. There are other steps which he did not mention, and which I should now like to enlarge upon. First of all, there is the provision of adequate transport to and from work, &#x201C;adequate&#x201D; being the operative word. Then there is the question of adequate accommodation for workers, housing on a stable family basis. Hostel accommodation for migrant workers is no answer when one is trying to use stabilized, skilled, trained labour. It is impossible to train a man who is for ever on the move. The Government&#x2019;s attitude towards the provision of transport and housing, accommodation for workers, will obviously have to change completely.</p>

<p>Then I believe we shall have to have an entirely new deal in labour relations as far as non-White labour in South Africa is concerned. This entails decent minimum wages; it entails a reduction in the ever-widening gap between skilled and unskilled wages; it entails the rate for the job on the basis of proper scientific evaluation of the job, and not on the basis of the colour of the skin of the worker; and it entails&#x2014; this is most important of all&#x2014;collective bargaining rights for African workers, in other words, trade union rights and all that that implies.</p>

<p>What is the position of non-White workers in South Africa today, who constitute 80 per cent of our industrial working force&#x003F; What is the position in particular of African workers who, of course, form by far the largest proportion of that 80 per cent&#x003F; I may say it is a number which is going to increase and not decrease. This is quite obvious. First of all we must remember that there is no national minimum wage in South Africa. In 1963 I moved a private member&#x2019;s motion asking for this in this House. I got no support from any member of the House, with the exception of the late Mr. Barnett, the Coloured Representative, who seconded the motion.</p>

<p>What we have in South Africa is a situation where wages are fixed either by direct bargaining between employers and employees, or by the Industrial Councils where they exist for an industry, after negotiations have been concluded between the employers and employees, or we have the Wage Board which operates as a statutory body, mostly for the unskilled occupations which are, of course, largely filled by Blacks. The interesting thing is that African workers are excluded completely from all these negotiations. They take no part in industrial council negotiations because by virtue of the definition in the Industrial Conciliation Act, they are excluded as employees. They have no direct representation on the Wage Board which, as I say, deals with occupations almost entirely performed by Black workers. It is perfectly true that any interested party may give evidence before the Wage Board before a determination is made, but the vast majority of African workers never have any knowledge as to when the Wage Board is sitting for their particular industry; they are unorganized; they have language problems and they are often migratory workers. Labour officials, I may add, also have considerable difficulties.</p>

<p>They have to deal with an overwhelming burden of work. They have to deal with many work categories; they have to deal with all sorts of different industrial occupations, conditions of service and so on, and indeed in practice what it all boils down to is that African workers have to place complete and total reliance on the goodwill of employers, which fortunately does exist in some cases, and they have to place reliance on the efforts&#x2014;and some efforts are being made&#x2014;by the White trade unions on their behalf when negotiations are being conducted with employers in a particular industry. They also have to place complete reliance on the efforts of the White officials of the Bantu Labour Board which was set up in 1953 by virtue of the Bantu Settlement of Disputes Act. It is interesting to note, Sir, that section 7 of that Act also made provision for works committees which are supposed to provide machinery for discussions between African workers and employers in any factory or plant employing more than 20 workers. At the last count there were only 29 such committees, many of them not even functioning, although there were more non-statutory committees that were functioning. But in all, I would say that they serve less than 1 per cent of the total number of industrial establishments which would qualify for such committees under the Act. Sir, one has only got to look at prevailing wage rates to realize how hopelessly the Bantu Settlement of Disputes Act and the machinery <span class="col_4665-4666" refersTo="page_0796"/>which exists have in fact operated as far as Black workers are concerned. Even if one uses the miserable poverty datum line, which is not even a standard of living&#x2014;it is a standard of bare existence &#x2014;the majority of occupations do not reach this level. Most sociologists today have discarded the poverty datum line. They use the Effective Minimum Level, which is 1&#x00BD; times the poverty datum line, and that, I may say, brings up the necessary income for an urban African family of five, to something like R123 a month; that is the effective minimum level. The latest wages laid down for the major industrial occupations do not even reach the poverty datum line. In manufacturing it is roughly R53-30 per month, and in construction it is R49-90 a month. I might say that the average monthly wage paid to Africans by the Central Government, which is an enormous employer of African labour and which should be setting the lead to employers&#x2014; the Government is always telling us that there is no limit on wages and that there is nothing to stop employers from raising wages&#x2014;is a miserable R44-80, according to the latest figure that I could get; and only a couple of weeks ago, in reply to a question in this House, the Minister of Transport told us that more than 90 000 Black workers on the Railways were earning less than R2 per day. That is the situation as it stands at the moment. Sir, it seems to me to be abundantly clear that the hon. the Minister of Labour was talking nonsense the other day when he said, in reply to a question put by the hon. member for Wynberg, that African workers do not require collective bargaining rights &#x201C;in view of the protection enjoyed by Bantu workers under existing legislation&#x201D;. In fact, Sir, as I pointed out, according to the wage rates, African workers are hopelessly inadequately protected under the existing structure. This is quite obvious, not only from the low wages which they are paid, but also from the ever-widening gap between unskilled and skilled wages and the ever-widening gap between the remuneration of races that do enjoy the benefits of collective bargaining, more particularly the White workers, and the Africans.</p>

<p>Mr. Liebenberg, who was quoted by the hon. member for Johannesburg North, also said that the wage gap proved beyond doubt that the Act had failed completely. He said: &#x201C;We have within our metropolitan areas some 5 million Black workers, who are very conscious of the disparity in wage and service conditions and their inability to do anything about it.&#x201D; I say that there is only one way in which to redress this imbalance, and that is to grant collective bargaining rights for Africans. The Progressive Party has said since its inception that the right of collective bargaining is an elementary right in any modern industrial society, and we see no reason why African workers, just as White workers, Coloured workers and Indian workers, should not also enjoy the benefit of collective bargaining. Sir, can I take it that the hon. member for Wynberg was expressing official United Party policy the other day when she made a Press statement, following on a reply given by the hon. the Minister to a question, where she stated unequivocally that she also believed that collective bargaining rights should be extended to Africans&#x003F; I hope she was speaking for the United Party, because I have never clearly understood what their trade union policy for Africans is. The shadow Minister of Labour, in outlining the policy in 1970, said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One can foresee that for a long time the solution may lie in offering the Bantu a form of affiliated membership to existing and experienced trade unions already recognized under the Industrial Conciliation Act.</block>

<p>I think it would be very good, Sir, if we could get an unequivocal statement and some clarity on this very important question. It is especially important to know whether the right to strike is going to be conceded, because otherwise it is the old analogy of the watchdog without any teeth. One thing that I want to stress and that I think is not realized in South Africa is that the Act which prohibits Africans from striking does not in fact preclude strikes in South Africa. We are constantly hearing boasts from the Government side about our unbroken spell of industrial peace in South Africa. I would have thought that the recent example of the 13 000 Ovambo strikers might have given the lie to this claim, but just in case there are still people who are lulled into a sense of false security and believe that we enjoy only unbroken periods of industrial peace, I would like to point out that the real truth is that we do <span class="col_4667-4668" refersTo="page_0797"/>have strikes in South Africa, but that very little publicity is given to these strikes, because in most cases the police arrive on the scene and not the Press. [Interjections.] Sir, hon. members on that side never like hearing the truth. They like to live in their own euphoric world, but the truth of the matter is that it is the police who come in and not the Press, because Africans run serious risk of arrest if they strike. There is no such thing as a legal strike for Africans in South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Section 18 of the Bantu Settlement of Disputes Act lays down very heavy penalties for Africans who go on strike. There is no provision for legal strikes. The penalty for strikes is a fine of up to R1 000, or imprisonment up to three years, or both. Moreover, Africans run the risk of endorsement out of the urban areas if they are found to be undesirable, and they run the risk of losing their employment, because employers are always aware of the huge reservoir of unemployed Africans in the homelands. But, Sir, let me quote a few facts from official Department of Labour reports to show hon. members that they are wrong if they believe that we do not have any strikes. In fact, there were 702 strikes or work stoppages that involved African workers only, in the years between 1959 and 1969, and over 33 000 African workers actually went on strike. In 1970 there were 28 strikes involving more than 2 000 Africans; in 1961 643 Africans were prosecuted for striking, and in 1962, 277 Africans were prosecuted. It is significant that since 1962 there have been no official statistics about the number of Africans prosecuted for striking. Why, I wonder&#x003F; Have there been no prosecutions&#x003F; I doubt that very much indeed. One has only to recall a few of the strikes which did receive publicity. There was the Durban dockworkers&#x2019; strike in 1969 involving over 1 000 strikers.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Because I want that hon. member to learn the facts of life, of which he is singularly ignorant. There has been the coal industry strike; there has been the fish canning strike in South-West Africa in 1968, the abattoir strike in Durban in 1971 and, at the end of last year, the Ovambo strike. I wonder, Sir, whether, when Dr. Waldheim visited South Africa, anybody told him about Proclamation R17 of 1972 and the numbers of people who have been put in detention under that proclamation&#x003F; Quite recently the Secretary for Labour told the Assistant General Secretary of the National Metal Workers Federation that African workers were not mature enough to be included in trade union movements, but when asked to outline the conditions and sketch the steps to maturity, he refused to comment any further. We have had the same sentiments from successive Ministers of Labour, except a previous Minister, the present Minister of Transport, who made no bones about it when he introduced the Settlement of Disputes Act in 1953 and told us that he hoped it would prove the death knell of the African trade unions which then existed. I think it is cool cheek for the Government and Government officials to say that Africans are not mature enough to enjoy trade union rights when they have deliberately killed off the existing African trade union movement. As far back as 1919 African trade unions were functiontion. There was the ICU of Clements Kadale functioning, which had up to 50 000 workers at one stage. We have recognized trade union rights for Indian workers and for Coloured workers. I can see no reason why we cannot give these rights to African workers as well. I want to say that I do not underestimate the difficulties in providing proper collective bargaining rights for Africans and proper organizations for them.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Oh no, that entirely depends upon the unions, but for the benefit of the workers it is much better to have mixed unions so that their interests do not clash. But I would not force integration. Like any other major change, it cannot be accomplished overnight. But I believe that recognition as a deliberate policy should be set as the target and reached as soon as possible. There are many problems but White workers and other workers have overcome those problems, like lack of organization and lack of experience. I believe that the longer Africans are denied the experience of trade unionism, the more open will they be to extremism. I believe that the change in attitude of White trade I unions is going to be immensely helpful. It <span class="col_4669-4670" refersTo="page_0798"/>is very encouraging that the White trade union movement is increasingly in favour of the extension of collective bargaining rights to Black workers. Tucsa of course has long taken this line, and of course it has fallen foul of the hon. the Minister of Labour as a result. But other workers&#x2019; organizations are now advocating the same line. They realize that the vast unorganized, badly-paid Black labour force, consisting more and more of semi-skilled and skilled workers, can only in the long run jeopardize their own bargaining position, <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> the employers, and they call this &#x201C;enlightened self-interest&#x201D;. That is what the trade unions call it, &#x201C;enlightened self-interest&#x201D;, and no doubt they realize that if present trends continue, and there is nothing in the world to prevent them from continuing, the percentage of African skilled and semi-skilled workers will increase all the time. Even the more conservative unions are coming around to this point of view. Mr. Liebenberg, although he is not in favour of the full extension of legal rights to African trade unions at this stage, has also said that other channels of industrial communication and points of contact must be considered to fill the vacuum and he believes that industrial peace cannot be maintained if Black workers are given no say. Anna Scheepers of the Garment Workers&#x2019; Union has long been in favour of trade unions. The president of Tucsa has warned &#x2026; [Interjections.] The president of Tucsa, with over 200 000 workers, has warned that unless African workers were encouraged to identify themselves now with responsible trade unionism, the only alternative would be the emergence of an all-African trade union movement wedded to Black nationalism. Is that what hon. members want as an alternative&#x003F; Surely it is better to organize trade unionism which will in the end achieve decent wages and proper working conditions for Africans, which will in turn redound to the benefit of every single White person in South Africa. Every White person would benefit from the fact that we have a contented and stable force earning decent wages and able to purchase commodities. Even the 35 per cent farming members of this House ought to be grateful for an increase in the purchasing power of Africans and I might say that with an increase in wages and better working conditions would come an increase in the productivity of our African workers. If White workers are beginning to realize that the denial to Black workers of the right to organize for collective bargaining can only engender frustration, alienation and hostility and if they realize too that the polarization of Whites and Black workers can be a very real threat to their own interests, one wonders why it is that the Government does not take cognizance of these views, which are coming, as I say, not only from unions which have always held the view that the rights of collective bargaining should be extended to Blacks, but which are increasingly being held by other workers. Only the Government, it seems, is blissfully unaware of the facts. Only the Government is unaware of the fact that we should take warning from the Owambo strike, from the fact that there are strikes in South Africa, despite the fact that Africans are not given the legal right to strike. Sir, I believe that it is high time that with this new attitude to the utilization of labour there should also be an entire new deal in labour relations in South Africa as a whole.</p>

<p>I do not want to deal at length with the hon. member for Houghton. All I want to say is that she and her party always remind one of the story of the man who was afraid that somebody else would murder him and so committed suicide. This is what they ask of the White man. Because he is threatened, because his position is jeopardized, he must commit suicide now. And we know what that party is the forerunner of. If that party ever succeeded in coming into power in South Africa, they would be the forerunners of anarchy and of eventual communistic dictatorship. They are the ones who prepare the way. They are the intercessors for all the people who contravene the laws. They are the intercessors for all the people who commit sabotage. They are the intercessors for all the enemies of law and order and of democracy. We may leave her at that. Fortunately South Africa is patriotic enough not to place such people in a position of power.</p>

<p>But I want to refer more particularly to a few matters raised here in the debate, especially those specifically raised by the hon. member for Durban Point when, referring to me, he used these words yesterday: &#x201C;The Minister of Defence is dragging South Africa back into the lowest level of politics.&#x201D; By that, I assume, the hon. member was continuing the refrain of the commotion which has been going on in the <span class="col_4671-4672" refersTo="page_0799"/>ranks of the Opposition in recent weeks in consequence of two speeches I made.</p>

<p>The hon. member says they were scandalous. I made the first speech at Villiersdorp, and I said there, <i>inter alia,</i> that I should like to see a certain little group of the hon. members of the Opposition going to hold meetings in Oudtshoorn. This was apparently the thing with which I brought South African politics to its lowest level. I asked them to send the following hon. members there. They should send the hon. member for Berea, Mr. Wood, there. I said they should send Dr. Fisher there. The hon. member said a moment ago that it was a scandalous speech because I had said that Dr. Fisher should go there. I also asked them to send Mr. Timony there. Furthermore, I asked that they should send their Chief Whip, Mr. Arthur Hopewell, there. According to the hon. member for Durban Point, this was politics on the lowest level. [Interjections.] No, wait a moment; I shall tell you in a moment why I mentioned it. I asked them to send the hon. member for Musgrave. Look at that hon. member sitting and looking at me like a hare in the moonlight. I asked them to send him. Then I asked that they should send a frontbencher, the hon. member for Parktown, Mr. Emdin. Now, why did I ask for this&#x003F; I asked for it&#x2014; and this is the point I made at Villiersdorp &#x2014;because in its statement of policy this party says the following&#x2014;</p>

Now I ask whether, if they should come into power and these hon. gentlemen I have mentioned should land in positions on the Government side&#x2014;and I presume the hon. member, Mr. Emdin, would land there&#x2014;we would again have a situation in South Africa such as we had under them, where an interpreter would have to sit next to virtually every Minister in order to tell them what the Afrikaner in South Africa wanted&#x003F; [Interjections.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am going to prove it now. The party of the hon. members opposite is governing in Natal. Shortly before the election of provincial councillors, the hon. the Prime Minister made an appeal here to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. In addition, he made an appeal to the hon. member for South Coast. He told them it was his standpoint that everyone sitting in this House, serving on any other council, or occupying any other responsible position, should be bilingual.</p>

<p><span class="col_4675-4676" refersTo="page_0801"/>Before the provincial election he appealed to them to give the assurance that they also took up that standpoint. I have the Hansard here where the hon. the Prime Minister spoke to the Leader of the Opposition. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition did not reply to him on that point. He failed to reply to him. The hon. member for Durban North replied to him by way of an interjection. What did he say to him&#x003F; He said : &#x201C;We do not elect the people in the Executive Committee of Natal.&#x201D; The hon. the Prime Minister appealed to the hon. member for South Coast as the leader in Natal. The reply of the hon. member for Durban North was that the hon. member was not the leader, but the chairman. In this way they dispose of a matter of principle which appears in the programme they subscribe to. The provincial election took place and an Executive Committee was constituted in Natal. I now want to ask the hon. member for South Coast, he who loves the Afrikaner so much, what he did with the Executive Committee in Natal and how many unilingual persons are serving on that Committee today. I put it to the hon. member for South Coast that he not only ignored the plea made by the hon. the Prime Minister, but also treated it with contempt. Where he had the power, he had unilingual persons appointed to show the smaller number of Afrikaners what contempt he had for them. Those people cannot serve them in their own language. In spite of this, the hon. member has the audacity to say that his party stands for national unity. Then a frontbencher of his party has the audacity to say to me that I am dragging politics down to the lowest level. However, there are the people who, when they are called to apply in practice what they supposedly profess, fail to do so as they are sitting there today&#x2014;ridiculous, condemned, and miserable failures.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I start again. I say that I stand here as an Afrikaner who is at the same time proud to be a South African as well. Seldom in my life have I had to be as ashamed of a fellow-Afrikaner as today. I am certain that I speak on behalf of all right-minded South Africans and Afrikaners in South Africa when I say that, whether we belong to the United or to the National Party, we completely dissociate ourselves from the kind of racial hatred we heard today.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister got up here and said that if the United Party came into power, interpreters would have to sit next to certain of the Ministers. I challenge him to point out one person on our side who is unable to understand precisely everything that is said. [Interjections.] One finds the proof in the replies by our English-speaking members. Now I want to say this: I do not have the right to tell any member on that side of the House in which language to make his speech; any decent member on that side has as little right to tell any member on this side in which language to make his speech. Anyone in South Africa has the right to use the language in which he feels most at home and in which he is able to state his standpoint best. What we heard here today is an insult to English-speaking South Africa. Sir, I do not wish to elaborate on this any further, but I remember how, for at least 15 or 20 years, practically no word of English came from the back benches of that side.</p>

<p>It is said that there are elements in this House that hate the Afrikaner. Why&#x003F; I challenge them to produce proof that there is hatred of the Afrikaner on the part of any United Party members on this side of the House. I reject it with the greatest contempt with which I have ever rejected anything in this country. Sir, I am looking at a silent Minister over there on the opposite side, the Minister of the Interior.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what we are seeing here today is actually a return to political barbarism, which we had hoped to get rid of in South Africa. We have not been unsympathetic when there have been signs of an outward policy on the part of the Government itself. We have cheered the few little advances that they have made, but what have they done&#x003F; They have undermined and torpedoed all the good work that they have done in the past. What is the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs going to say when he goes to the United Nations and they show the Hansard of our Minister of Defence to him&#x003F; Sir, we are not only back to political barbarism; we are back to jungle politics.</p>

<p>Sir, what I said about the hon. the Minister of Defence, applies equally to the speeches that we had yesterday from the hon. the Minister of Labour and the hon. the Minister of Community Development. What struck me particularly in these speeches was this : We have come in this debate with attacks on the Government in regard to the finances and the economy of this country and the parlous state of living costs in South Africa. Not a word of defence have we heard from the Minister of Finance or from the Minister of Labour about the parlous position in regard to the use of labour in South Africa, or from the Minister of Community Development&#x2014; three of the Government&#x2019;s senior frontbenchers&#x2014;while the country is facing inflation, a 10 per cent increase in income tax, and some of the most Draconian measures this country has ever had, all they can say is : &#x201C;The United Party is against the <span class="col_4687-4688" refersTo="page_0807"/>Afrikaner; the United Party wants to plough the Afrikaner under; we are going to get a Black Government in South Africa if the United Party comes into power.&#x201D;</p>

<p>*Mr. Speaker, yesterday those two hon. Ministers made statements here bordering on either wilfulness or ignorance. Let us deal with them. The hon. the Minister of Community Development put a question to this side, and I shall gladly reply to it. I have the speech of the hon. the Minister here, and I want hon. members to listen to what the hon. the Minister said yesterday by way of introduction to his attack on us; he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I now intend to deal with two sections of their policy as recklessly as I can possibly deal with a policy.</block>

<p>He was going to be as reckless as be could possibly be.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister started talking about our Black labour policy, as he called it. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I say the United Party is in favour of the uncontrolled influx of Bantu labour into the urban areas&#x2014;totally uncontrolled.</block>

<p>I tell the hon. the Minister that this is untrue. I am now going to read out what our policy is, and if he or any of their agents in Oudtshoorn repeat that remark after my having read out our policy here, it may be said that that agent is telling a lie. Here it is clearly stated in the policy of the United Party&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is essential, in the interests of the population as a whole, but particularly in the interests of the Bantu themselves, that the movement to the towns should be regulated.</block>

<p>Now listen to this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Where Bantu communities become settled in the vicinity of White communities or Bantu enter the service of Europeans, regulation is necessary for the maintenance of the principle of residential separation and, where there are contracts between races differing so greatly from one another, for the purpose of checking both exploitation from the one side and undesirable intrusion from the other.</block>

<p>And then the hon. the Minister says it is our policy that the Bantu should be able to obtain proprietary rights anywhere in South Africa.</p>

To say that we are going to give proprietary rights to a Bantu anywhere in South Africa is downright, absolute nonsense. Of course, Sir, to the unsophisticated voter it sounds terrible to say that the Bantu are to get proprietary rights in the White areas, but tell that voter that it is only in the Bantu urban areas and then, of course, it is a horse of another colour. Sir, hon. members on that side do not know their own policy. Yesterday the hon. the Minister himself said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As far as the Coloureds and Indians are concerned, we have not finished thinking yet.</block>

<p>They have been in power for more than 20 years, and they have not yet finished thinking about their policy in respect of two million of South Agrica&#x2019;s citizens. Then we find that a certain Dr. C. Boshoff, a son-in-law of Dr. Verwoerd, comes to a Sabra youth congress &#x2026;</p>

It is the same report in which Dr. Boshoff also wrote that they do not like a policeman and a Prime Minister who are afraid. Do you recall the <span class="col_4689-4690" refersTo="page_0808"/>report now&#x003F; But, Sir, do you know that that Sabra Youth Congress was partly financed by the Government, by the Department of National Education and by the former Cultural Council, and do you know that a few days ago that Dr. Boshoff was put on the radio to deliver a plea for a separate state for the Coloured people in South Africa&#x003F;</p>

<p>They say that our policy will destroy White civilization in South Africa. They have passed 119 Acts on so-called apartheid since they came into power, and what do we find&#x003F; We find that there are still editorials and banner headlines across a full page in the <i>Vaderland</i> (translation): &#x201C;When are we going to get apartheid&#x003F;&#x201D; That is after they have passed 119 Acts. Their policy has resulted in complete and hopeless failure and they are too scared to admit it. Some of their own people, such as Prof. Rhoodie and Prof. Jan Moolman, are persons who today make speeches in which, in many respects, they speak in the direction of the United Party&#x2019;s federal idea of single control over South Africa, to some extent&#x2014;I do not say entirely. Even the General Manager of Nasionale Pers, Mr. Dawid de Villiers, said that he foresaw a body in which there would be consultation among the various race groups in South Africa. Our policy also makes provision for a body for consultation in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister asked us whether we believe in job reservation. I believe I will be right in asking him whether they believe in job reservation, since 97 per cent of the White workers do not fall under statutory job reservation in South Africa today. They do not believe in their own policy, just as many of them do not even believe in their Bantustan policy. Then the hon. the Minister has the political audacity to come forward and say that after six years of United Party government we would have created a situation which must result in a bloody revolution.</p>

<p>If that hon. Minister is genuinely in favour of national unity, I may assure him that I, too, am sincere in that regard, and I can do it much better than he or his party can. But you see, Sir, he has not replied. He has not expressed a repudiation, and I suppose we now have to accept that the Minister of the Interior has also given in and fallen in behind this spate of racial hatred, the spate of attacks on the Afrikaner, on the English-speaking people and on the <span class="col_4691-4692" refersTo="page_0809"/>Coloured people by the hon. member for Lydenburg, and that he has also fallen in with that attack on South Africa. Mr. Speaker, I cannot emphasize enough that the time has arrived for this kind of thing to cease. One will never be able to build up a united state in South Africa with speeches such as those. They will destroy South Africa by carrying on in this way. They will make an end to the existence of a decent White civilization in South Africa. I hope the whole of South Africa will see them in their true colours now, and that the thin veneer of pseudoenlightment they had in the past has been stripped off, yes, that they have been unmasked and that we now see them in their naked racial hatred and animosity towards the Afrikaners and the English and towards the Whites and non-Whites in South Africa.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>As long as you keep quiet one still thinks you know something. Oudtshoorn is once again the focal point of public and political interest, and I want to point out that the first person who captured Oudtshoorn for the National Party was a person by the name of Langenhoven. After listening to the speech made by that hon. member I want to quote what Langenhoven would have said if he had been here today. He would have said: Some people talk first and think afterwards; others think first and then say nothing. In addition to that he would perhaps have said : Learning in the mind of a fool is like a razor in the hand of an ape.</p>

<p>There rests a very great responsibility on me as Chief Whip today because I want to address a few words to you, Mr. Speaker, and also to the Chief Whip on the opposite side. I hope that you will grant me this opportunity. I have been in this House of Assembly for 29 years. I know the House of Assembly. It is unpredictable&#x2014;one minute mirror-calm and the next, like today, a little unsettled. Yesterday, when it was quite unsettled here &#x2014;although it was not my doing&#x2014;I, as Chief Whip interrupted the hon. member for Yeoville in the heat of the altercation. Afterwards Mr. Scott of the <i>Cape Times,</i> for whom I have regard, pointed out that Mr. Steyn, the member for Yeoville, had said to me:&#x201C;You are not trying to play the fool with Mr. Speaker&#x201D;. After I had floundered about in a rather emotional way here, for which I apologize, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, a person for whom I have an exceptional regard, rose to his feet. The article goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Then Sir De Villiers Graaff rose and asked : Is the Chief Whip of the National Party entitled to trifle with the Chair in this manner&#x003F;</block>

<p>I felt very badly about this. But you know what the other hon. members then did&#x003F; They shouted &#x201C;Chuck him out&#x201D;. I am calm now, but I did have a rather restless night, because I am sensitive as far as this is concerned. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I appreciate your actions, Sir, because instead of order hon. members are creating disorder. I want to tell the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that I appreciate his having said that. Other hon. members, however, shouted &#x201C;Chuck him out&#x201D;. One learns from the youngest child, and I abo learn from someone who is the leader of an Opposition, a strong party which claims that they are going to take over, and in future I as Chief Whip will behave myself in such a way, temperamentally, that I will not again have to be called to order. I shall be an example in this House. But &#x201C;Chuck him out&#x201D;! Oh, no, do hon. members know what is going to happen&#x003F; On 19th April we are going to chuck out the United Party at Oudtshoorn. That is what will happen. It is not necessary for me to speak English. I am true to English: I am perfectly bilingual. Hon. members cannot say that I am not, and they must therefore not accuse me of that. I am not one to boast, but I can also use pedantic <span class="col_4693-4694" refersTo="page_0810"/>language if I wish. I speak both languages fluently, as they will admit.</p>

<p>Now I want to speak to the Chief Whip on the opposite side. He is a person for whom I have exceptional esteem and respect. The hon. member for Lydenburg said yesterday that certain speakers should go to Oudtshoorn. I am not repudiating anyone, but I want to say that as far as the two Chief Whips are concerned, it is strange that when we get together we then speak English. But also, when I see him in turn, we speak Afrikaans. Is that correct&#x003F;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>You see, Mr. Speaker, that I am a truth-loving man. If there are two persons who are really seeking to achieve national unity, then those persons are the two Chief Whips in South Africa. Let me also say that if there is one party which is the cornerstone of nationalism, South African nationalism, which is indispensable for national unity, then that party is the National Party, [Interjections.] I have not repudiated anyone. That is not true at all. I also want to tell the Chief Whip on the opposite side that I never really bother with newspapers. No matter how innocent one is, one always loses out with a newspaper, but if one is innocent, one always wins in a court. That I know.</p>

<p>As far as <i>Die Burger</i> is concerned, I must now perform a pleasant or an unpleasant task concerning the Chief Whip on the opposite side. <i>Die Burger</i> is an outstanding newspaper, particularly if one thinks of the illuminating leading articles. These are of the best and of a very high quality. Unfortunately I found the following report in <i>Die Burger,</i> and I must read this out to the House. The following is said in <i>Die Burger</i> of 11th April, 1972 (translation): &#x201C;Readers of this column will know precisely how little punch there was in the Opposition&#x2019;s attack simply by mentioning their names.&#x201D; The names of a few very good members are then mentioned, as they always said in the time of Mr. Sauer, the then hon. member for Humansdorp, &#x201C;along the Wailing Wall&#x201D;. They are the speakers on economics. The report went on to read : &#x201C;A better team of cicadas one cannot hope to find.&#x201D; I have nothing to do with that, but among those names was that of my hon. friend, the Chief Whip. The report read further: &#x201C;It is difficult enough to hear what the four other soft-spoken members have to say, but in the case of Mr. Hopewell it is virtually impossible. I have been trying since 1958, with a short break, to follow what he has to say, but I have not yet succeeded in making any sense of it.&#x201D; [Interjections.] Hon. members are laughing now, but I want to say that I as Chief Whip on this side of the House have the greatest respect for the content of the speeches made by the hon. Chief Whip on that side. He is an economist; I am not. What I know about economics, and of the heavy demands with which a sound economy has to comply&#x2014;such as full employment, a high standard of living, a sound balance of payments, etc.&#x2014;I owe to a large extent to what I have heard from the hon. member and hon. members on this side. I therefore want to say to the Chief Whip on that side that this has been written about him in the newspaper, but that I on this side of the House appreciate his actions.</p>

<p>I now want to come to another matter. I want to address a few very friendly words to the hon. member for Yeoville. The hon. member for Yeoville is an excellent politician, and a scintillating speaker. When his party is in trouble, they always look to the hon. member for Yeoville. However, I read the following in <i>Rapport,</i> in a report under the caption &#x201C;Mr. Marais Steyn gets bogged down in Oudtshoorn&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This week-end in the Oudtshoorn constituency the chief propagandist and leader of the United Party, Mr. Marais Steyn, came up against boisterous country voters. On racial matters he said <i>inter alia</i> &#x2026;</block>

<p>[Interjections.] I do not want us to laugh about this, because it is a serious matter. The report goes on to read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Not only do we have the right; it is far more serious than that. It is our responsibility before God to maintain White leadership for all the people in South Africa.</block>

<speech by="#potgieter">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that Bastard placard in 1938. Then, however, the hon. member spoke of 1948. I do not approve of that placard, and I want to admit this candidly, but why did he then speak of 1948&#x003F; I shall tell hon. members why he did so. He did so because the date 1948 is indelibly engraved on the political mind of the United Party. This is so because never before in the political history of South Africa were the people of South Africa confronted with such a significant and such an important choice than they were in the year 1948. It was a crystal clear choice which was presented to them during a dramatic and unparalleled political election, namely the election of 1948. That result was so decisive that it was not only to a large extent of significance to the National Party in that it was victorious, but South Africa itself was the victor. That date, 1948, ushered in a new period in the political history of South Africa. It was a turning point, but that important, crystal-clear choice was made in 1948 and the choice which the nation made it gave as a commission to the National Party. Do hon. members know that the National Party Government has carried out that commission so purposefully and honestly, so faithfully and with so much energy that the people have for almost a quarter of a century now been giving the reins of the Government of South Africa into our hands&#x003F; Is that not the greatest political miracle&#x003F; Mr. Speaker, you and I came to this House 29 years ago, and who would ever have dreamt when we were in the Opposition that we would be the only two who would remain to have the privilege of belonging to a political party, a political party which has governed the country so well that we, who began with a majority of five in 1948, have been able to increase this to a majority of almost 70 in the year 1972&#x003F;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>What were the three premises of our Nationalist action for the past 25 years since we first came into power&#x003F; I shall tell the hon. members. The first was in respect of those things in regard to which the hon. members on the opposite side said: &#x201C;Wipe them out!&#x201D; We came forward with the rallying cry&#x2014; this was our political creed and we suited action to our words&#x2014;of &#x201C;South Africa first&#x201D;, and &#x201C;South African Nationalism&#x201D;. What did that party do then&#x003F; They issued placards &#x201C;Eradicate Nationalism&#x201D;! It is when you have as your point of departure the idea of Nationalism first &#x2026; [Interjections.] Yes, they issued them. Our point of departure is South African Nationalism. Successive National Party Governments were the architects of the structure of sovereign independence. It is we who introduced the unity creating symbols and it is we, this Government under the leadership of that great political and almost spiritual political sprinter in South Africa. Dr. Verwoerd, who carried out this South African nationalism to its logical consequences, to such an extent that we today have an independent and free Republic outside the Commonwealth. Is that not a mighty achievement&#x003F; Becoming a Republic was in fact indispensable to national unity. Union citizenship was indispensable. The citizenship in which they believed, was ambiguous. The man&#x2019;s body wandered around in South Africa while his soul wafted about in another country. It was a dual citizenship. One wanted one&#x2019;s Union citizenship, now one&#x2019;s Republican citizenship, and this in fact means a citizen of only one country, of the Republic of South Africa. That is the point of departure. It is an important one. We introduced the unity creating symbol, and carried it out to its logical consequences. I do not want to spend much time dealing with this.</p>

<p>We established national unity, and did so as well by means of mother-tongue education, not by means of dual medium schools, so that our English-speaking <span class="col_4699-4700" refersTo="page_0813"/>friends who are good South Africans could educate their little children through the medium of their own mother-tongue in order to have a perfect instrument for acquiring knowledge, so that we could have the wisdom of statesmanship for saving the White nation in this country. But what we do not begrudge them we do not begrudge the Afrikaans child, i.e. of also acquiring his knowledge through his own mother-tongue, so as to process this knowledge as well, together with his compatriots, the English-speaking South African, and in that way save our fatherland.</p>

<p>Nationalism is a common sentiment for both good English and Afrikaans-speaking South Africans. Nationalism is not exclusive. When Dr. Malan was Prime Minister I was sitting there, and he stood here, and he said: &#x201C;Nationalism is inclusive&#x201D;. Hon. members did not understand what the Minister of Defence told them today, because he hit the nail on the head. He wants national unity on the right basis. It must be a felt experience. It must not be idle lip service. You must put your words into action, as we, as National Party, on this side of the House, do.</p>

<p>But there is a second point of departure. It is no use your having a nation which is free and growing with national pride, if you forget that you have been placed on this vast continent, in this South Africa, where there are Bantu, Indians and Coloureds. You are the Christian White nation with a calling and destiny, and you will not be able to hate, because hate destroys the hater. You will have to act in such a way, not only in your relations towards the Whites, but also towards the non-Whites, that you can also have peace in this country. That is why we have another point of departure, in our relations policy. You know, Mr. Speaker, how our groups convened in those days when we were in the Opposition. It is not only now that we have begun to think of these things. We thought of those things at that time and we thought out our entire policy, from its foundations, to the course it would take, to its ultimate consequences and aims.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>Of course I am still thinking, but you have stopped thinking. The people of South Africa must think, and you do not want to think. We have thought out our policy of apartheid to its logical consequences, so that Dr. Verwoerd could say that one should lift the damper, that you as Christian guardian should lead them along a course of development so that they could realize their potentials and acquire self-determination. We are part of a developing world. Even if it should take a hundred or a thousand years, one will be living in a world which consists of self-determining Black, Yellow and White states coexisting on a basis of international maturity. That is the background. It is a matter of politics. As I said at Calitzdorp, politics is the science of government. For, I said, politics itself is clean. Ugly people make for ugly politics, but clean people make for clean politics.</p>

<p>Now I am very pleased that the Leader of the Opposition is here. I want to say something to him, and he must tell me whether I am right or wrong. In the years prior to 1948 a U.P. man was still a U.P. man. Then they still spoke of integration. The hon. member for Yeoville said &#x201C;Integration is a fact&#x201D;, and his face was radiant.</p>

<p>He still says it. He himself said that Black people can be represented by Black people here in the House of Assembly, not so&#x003F; But on the eve of the Hottentots-Holland election, in 1947, when the Leader of the Opposition was the candidate, he had sitting next to him on the platform the Crown Prince of the United Party, a man with a brilliant mind who was indicated in that year in Hansard as being the deputy premier of South Africa The hon. the Leader of the Opposition had this man as his spiritual compatriot, the future Prime Minister, who would succeed General Smuts. He addressed the meeting which took place there, and I want to quote <i>Die Burger</i> in this connection. The meeting took place on 15th January, 1947, in the Hottentots-Holland town hall. I now want to speak to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, because he once repudiated me in this House. I also have the reference here where he said that it was not true. I have made a study of this, and I have found that I was right, and the hon. the Leader wrong. I now want to quote from <i>Die Burger</i> (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Hofmeyr spoke in support of the U.P. candidate, Sir de Villiers Graaff. In <span class="col_4701-4702" refersTo="page_0814"/>reply to questions by Mr. P. W. Botha, he set out his standpoint regarding the political representation of Natives and Indians.</block>

<p>Do you see&#x003F; Even at that early stage Mr. P. W. Botha was in action against the United Party; today, in his capacity as Minister of Defence, I find that he is doing it just as efficiently as he did it that night. Here are the questions and replies which were put that night&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Question: Are you in favour of the extension of the political rights of the Indians&#x003F;</block>

<block name="quote">Reply&#x2014;Mr. Hofmeyr: I have explained the position in Parliament. I think that eventually it will be desirable that they be represented by their own people.</block>

<block name="quote">2nd question: In the Transvaal as well&#x003F;</block>

<block name="quote">Mr Hofmeyr: I think that this will have to come there as well.</block>

<block name="quote">3rd question: Are you in favour of the representation of Indians by Indians in this Parliament&#x003F;</block>

<block name="quote">Reply: Eventually, yes.</block>

<block name="quote">To a question as to whether he was in favour of the retention of the present Native legislation.

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition was the candidate, and now I want to ask him : What Whites were too unsatisfactory as members here of the House of Assembly, to cause Mr. Hofmeyr to say that he would rather have Natives take the place of those White representatives&#x003F; I want to know that.</p>

Sam Kahn was not even here then, so it was not he whom they wanted to get rid of. What I can in fact say is that it is clear to me that they had not wanted Sam Kahn here, but in 1952, when we had to vote to turf Sam out, then they all voted that Sam was not a communist and that he should remain here. I now come to the <i>Cape Times.</i> In those days it was said: &#x201C;That is merely <i>Die Burger</i> again&#x201D;. Sir, as you know, all members of the House of Assembly study the newspapers. I note that members on the opposite side have also recently been reading <i>Rapport</i> frequently. What do I read in the <i>Cape Times</i>&#x003F; I read the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. J. H. Hofmeyr&#x2019;s eve of the poll statement at the Strand that eventually Natives and Indians would be represented in Parliament by members of their own race, will almost certainly set the Nationalist hounds once more in full cry after him. When once the election of non-Europeans to the provincial and local councils of the two coastal provinces becomes an accomplished fact, however, it will become hard to resist the logic and justice of the claim that will ultimately be made to direct representation in Parliament. That is not to say that this is immediately practicable but there are many men among non-Europeans of high intellectual calibre and cultural attainment who are perfectly qualified to sit in Parliament and when the public examines the intellectual qualities of some of those who sit in Parliament now, there are many people who will agree with Mr. Hofmeyr&#x2019;s caustic remark that they would rather see Natives represented in Parliament by Natives.</block>

If a political marriage should take place between the hon. members for Bezuidenhout and Houghton, it would be an ideal marriage, for there would be compatibility of temperaments. It would be a perfect marriage. Let me now say this: If I am not mistaken, did Mr. Myburgh, the U.P. candidate in Oudtshoorn, not at one stage leave the United Party and befriend Mr. Japie Basson&#x003F; Is that not true&#x003F; And then the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is the spiritual compatriot of the hon. member for Houghton!

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to say a few words about the speech of the hon. the Minister of Defence, but I really would not like the hon. Chief Whip&#x2019;s speech to pass unnoticed. Sir, I readily listen to him. His speeches usually deal with a period young people have only read about, but which he has lived through. I remember that Mr. Hennie du Plessis wrote a book with the title &#x201C;Die Goue Draad&#x201D;. Mr. du Plessis states that he listened very closely to a speech the hon. Chief Whip once made, and after the hon. Chief Whip had resumed his seat he came to the conclusion that he had learnt a lesson. That lesson he learnt from the Chief Whip was that the United Party men were responsible for the Great Trek!</p>

He also knows that I know that he was a student of the works of Nietzche. He is therefore a man with a philosophic background. We put a simple question to the hon. Chief Whip by way of an interjection. We asked him where he stood in connection with the question of White supremacy (baasskap). He launched a tremendous attack on us, and we asked him where he stood in connection with the question of White supremacy which was the policy of the late Mr. Strydom.</p>

<p>The hon. Chief Whip says that he advocates White supremacy over White South Africa alone.

Sir, I want to tell the Chief Whip that in 1966 it was still one of the private platforms of the National Party in my constituency. There is nothing old about that. But I do not want to speak about that now. I want to tell the hon. member that he made a very reasonable speech in the atmosphere that prevailed here this afternoon. It seemed to me as if his speech had to serve as a lightning conductor for the explosion that came from the hon. the Minister of Defence. The hon. member&#x2019;s speech was actually an apology for the conduct of the Minister of Defence.

</speech>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, for quite some time in South Africa there was a feeling and a trend of thought to the effect that the National Party, under the leadership of the new Prime Minister, the hon. B. J. Vorster, was moving along a new road, a road of enlightenment. It is a road that was initially embarked upon by the hon. the Prime Minister when he made his acceptance speech here on the steps of the House of Assembly and said that he was going to strive for the creation of national unity in South Africa. Subsequently, from his trend of thought, the word &#x201C;outgoing&#x201D; was born. It was a new course, and it was with gladness that people accepted the fact that we were going to move along a totally new road, a road that was regarded as the road of enlightenment. But, Sir, there were people opposed to that. The Hertzogites broke out of that party specifically as the result of the fact that the National Party was following a new course. They pulled out specifically because they said that the National Party, as it exists today, does not look after the cultural assets of the Afrikaner and is leaving the Afrikaner in the lurch. That is the first point. Secondly, the Hertzogites said they were breaking away from the National Party because that party is selling out the Whites to the non-Whites. Those are the two points. In spite of that the National Party went ahead and proclaimed their new outgoing policy, which was welcomed on all sides. They told the people that it is a good step for South Africa because the National Party is now growing up and the people are maturing. For the first time it was said in South Africa that we can now speak of a new politics, a politics that will be completely devoid of White racial division; a politics in which we can look at points of policy and weigh one point up against another as far as race relations are concerned, placing policy against policy as far as economic affairs <span class="col_4707-4708" refersTo="page_0817"/>are concerned. But in spite of this levelheaded standpoint, welcomed on all sides by the English and the Afrikaans Press and by numerous people, it took only one Brakpan to tear off the National Party&#x2019;s verligte cloak and expose them as nothing more than Hertzogites. After having listened to the hon. the Minister of Defence this afternoon I want to tell him this : There is only one party that will profitably listen and take note of his words, only one party that will be smiling broadly, the party which actually achieved the victory yesterday and today, and that is the party of the Hertzogites. They achieved the victory. Let us view the position.</p>

<p>This campaign that was started yesterday, that was unleashed here by the hon. the Minister of Labour and taken further by the Minister of Defence, is a campaign that was initiated as far back as a few weeks ago, and do you know who the man was who set the bomb off&#x003F; It was the hon. the Minister of Defence. I now want to state my case in these terms. Let us look at the hon. the Minister of Defence.</p>

<p>We shall simply do so in thought. He is not a backbencher. He is not simply an ordinary junior Minister. He is one of the most senior Ministers and one of the Ministers holding one of the most important positions in the Cabinet. He is the person responsible for the military viability of the whole of South Africa, a viability that must be maintained against an Africa into which the communists are filtering, a viability that must be maintained against the terrorists on our borders. The hon. the Minister is responsible for the military viability of South Africa, and to give effect that viability successfully, that Minister must draw on the loyalty and the fidelity of not only the Afrikaans-speaking and English-speaking Whites, but he must also draw on the total loyalty of every sector of the South Africa population. Unless the hon. the Minister can succeed in relying on the loyalty of every sector of the population, White and non-White, English and Afrikaans speaking, I tell him he is grossly impinging upon South Africa&#x2019;s viability. If the hon. the Minister is serious about South Africa&#x2019;s military viability, he above all should at all times place himself above anything that encourages racial division and racial disloyalty in South Africa.</p>

<p>Let me put it this way: If an action for defamation were to arise we would pay the costs ourselves and the State would not have to do so. Let me take the House back in time a little to the problems that were revealed by this Budget. This Budget was one of three. There was the Post Office Budget, that showed a tremendous deficit. The Railway Budget of the hon. the Minister of Transport showed a deficit of R39 million. The hon. the Minister of Finance furnished a Budget with a deficit that I can not even remember, because it is too colossal. What does the Minister now come to the House with&#x003F; Did he tell us how he viewed the picture for the future&#x003F; No, he comes along with nothing more than mere empty hope. He does not even have an idea of what the future will be like. He pays lip service to those very aspects that must initiate growth and economic prosperity in South Africa. The hon. member for Johannesburg North made an arresting and constructive speech about the labour question in South Africa. The hon. the Minister of Labour was the next to stand up, but we are still waiting for a single word from that side. If he had only listened he would have heard that in the South African economic society, within eight years, no less than 1&#x00BD; million trained Black people must be found if we want to have any proper growth in South Africa. They do not speak about that. Not a word! There is only a deathly silence. They do not say how we must cover this deficit next year. The Railways&#x2019; reserve finances have already been exhausted.</p>

<p>It seems to me the hon. member for Potchefstroom is now getting worried for the first time. He is looking for advice. Why does he not ask the advice of his own clever Ministers&#x003F; Those are the questions we are faced with. There is the question of the millions of Bantu that are converging on the urban areas of South Africa and for whom the other side has no policy. This question is not being dealt with. When we ask hon. members opposite what their future policy is with respect to two million Coloureds, the hon. the Minister of Planning says he will make a plan. He is still planning after 24 years. Those are the people who tell us about a record. They are free to consult the political archives until tortoises grow feathers, but they must realize that the South African people are no longer interested in what used to be. They are familiar with the past 25 years, which were really arid politically, industrially and economically under a &#x201C;Nat.&#x201D; Government. What the people of South Africa now want is what this Government has to offer for the future. We got nothing from that side except a lot of abuse and disparagement. I am glad that what is coming to the fore is a new young generation that is looking for new politics and will find it, but not by digging up the old skeletons of the past. People are at liberty to tell me that I am soft as far as Communism is concerned, but will it be of any use to me, or will I gain anything by saying that that side of the House was at one time soft as far as Nazism is concerned&#x003F; What does that mean to a modern South African&#x003F; What are we solving&#x003F; These two days will go down in parliamentary history in South Africa as one of the biggest tragedies that have yet been enacted here. The National Party may continue in this vein and they are welcome to win the Oudtshoorn election. However, of one fact I am certain, i.e. that they will lose the future as far as Afrikanerdom is concerned, because Afrikanerdom cannot exist alone in South Africa. It must co-operate wholeheartedly with the other Whites in South Africa.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the hon. member for Lydenburg blamed the Hertzogites for the way they made propaganda. But he is the one who tries to make political propaganda out of the possibility of a parliamentarian of this House having to eat with a Coloured. He wants to make propaganda out of that possibility. What is the difference between such a possibility and the photograph of the Prime Minister between two non-White women&#x003F; If there is no difference &#x2026; [Interjections].

<p>That hon. member is the one who wants to make propaganda. The question in South Africa, as far as relations in Africa are concerned, is not whether Dr. Banda may eat with the Prime Minister. That is not the problem because the occasion can always be arranged. The question South africa is faced with is how we, as Whites, must behave towards the non-Whites so that the people of Africa will know that we are at least sincere in respect of our own Black people. As long as we get the kind of speech we had from the hon. member for Lydenburg, which was greeted with approving &#x201C;Hear, hears&#x201D; from the other side, we are destroying any good that we are possibly doing in the country.</p>

<p>I have never been ashamed of the fact that I am an Afrikaner. I challenge any Nationalist to tell me&#x2014;except for the fact that I am a United Party man&#x2014;where I have ever failed to do justice to the Afrikaner&#x2019;s cultural assets. I challenge them. I say with all respect to my fellow-members that the pattern and the atmosphere created in this House from the Ministerial side, with the approval of the Prime Minister, is something that not only disturbed me, but made me very ashamed as an Afrikaner. I want to appeal to hon. members opposite that if they have the welfare of South Africa at heart, they should stop digging up the bones of South African politics and look at the problems as they exist in South Africa today.</p>

<p>I am not dealing with Blythe Thompson at all. I am asking the hon. member for Maitland whether he is prepared to say that there was nobody on that side of the House who made this statement. Apparently the hon. member for Maitland is now having trouble with his Chief Whip, for they are engaged in a t&#x00EA;te-&#x00E0;-t&#x00EA;te. It was in fact, of all people, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout who stated that this was one of the reasons why he resigned from the United Party. It was by no means donkey&#x2019;s years ago that he made that statement. He did so in 1960, and since then 12 years have passed. Now this hon. member who has just resumed his seat, almost has a fit when one merely touches upon the question of national unity. I do not want to waste the time of the hon. House. The hon. member may look up these things for himself. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout claims that we have no idea of what things are like for the Afrikaner and his institutions under the United Party. The same member for Bezuidenhout had to report on certain things to Gen. Smuts because he had arranged a rally at which he spoke Afrikaans. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout landed in difficulties with his party because he banked with Volkskas. What is more, that hon. member for Bezuidenhout once walked into an election office of the United Party, and when he spoke Afrikaans, the person who sat there said to him, &#x201C;Do not speak that language in this office.&#x201D; Do those hon. members deny this&#x003F; If they do, then let them rise and say so. Those hon. members may rise at any time to tell us whether they admit or deny this. They should not ask me; their battles are no concern of mine. They can make enquiries with the hon. &#x201C;verligte&#x201D; member for Bezuidenhout in regard to these matters. These things were said about that party, and when the hon. the Minister of Defence treads a little on their toes as regards this type of thing, it is, according to the hon. member for Maitland, the Minister who is absolutely dragging South Africa&#x2019;s defence through the mud. This afternoon hon. members on that side referred sneeringly to the standpoint taken by our hon. Prime <span class="col_4715-4716" refersTo="page_0821"/>Minister when he said that we did not have all the answers in regard to the solution to the Coloured question, and that we would have to give further thought to the matter in the future. Now the National Party is being reproached with not having come to a final decision on the matter of race relations.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. D. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>We have never denied that we have not yet come to a final decision, but if one accuses someone else of not having come to a final decision, it implies that one oneself has already done so. Let us take a somewhat closer look at this squabble between the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and the Leader of the Opposition. As recently as this year, during the course of this session&#x2019;s no-confidence debate, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and his leader actually had a few words with each other unofficially. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition referred to what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout had allegedly said, and I want to quote from Hansard, column 424, what was said by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As far as the statements of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout are concerned, about &#x201C;paternalistic political crumbs&#x201D;, I want to say that our policy makes provision for the discussions the hon. member wants. He has his own ideas about representation or non-representation, but what he is saying does not conflict with what may be the ultimate result of that consultation between White and non-White in South Africa.</block>

<p>Then the hon. the Leader of the Opposition went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The distance between our party and the National Party is that we proceed by way of consultation at all levels to try and carry these people with us.</block>

<p>The people that are to be carried along according to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, are the non-White groups in South Africa. It is very obvious that if there is room for the standpoint of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout within the framework of the United Party&#x2019;s policy, the United Party has by no means come to a final decision. I say this because within that same framework there is room for people with views like those of the hon. member for South Coast. We in South Africa must take note of the fact that those people have not reached a final decision on the policy in South Africa. They have not even thought about this basic and fundamental question, namely the Bantu policy for South Africa. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition admits this himself. Apart from the words of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition which I have just quoted, he also said that representation and the manner in which representation would be effected in this White Parliament were not really relevant at this stage. According to the <i>Argus</i> of 24th September, 1971, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said in Durban that the manner in which the Bantu would be represented in this House was purely an academic question. Therefore, it is of no practical importance to them. It is purely an academic question. We, on the other hand, indicate explicitly and very openly where we stand in regard to representation. The people outside may take note of what our standpoint is. This kind of <i>laissez-faire</i> policy of the United Party, this policy in terms of which there should be room within the framework for the &#x201C;verligtes&#x201D; as well as the &#x201C;verkramptes&#x201D;, is a direct consequence of what the United Party inherited in the person of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I do not have the time to deal fully with this matter this afternoon, but if we look at the development of the United Party&#x2019;s Bantu, Coloured and Indian policy, it really is striking that, since the hon. member for Bezuidenhout stated in 1960 the standpoints of his National Union in regard to this matter, the United Party has systematically taken over these standpoints of the National Union and of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. Was it not the Leader of the Opposition himself who in the early sixties did not talk about this matter at all, but kept quiet about the fact and even denied that there was room for the thinking of a man such as the member for Bezuidenhout&#x003F; Now, to me there is one very important question. When we are dealing with a two-party system, such as we have here in South Africa, we have a Parliament such as this one which is the highest derived authority in regard to national government. Therefore, in this derived authority, in its institutional form, as we have it here as a legislative assembly, we have the governing party as the people <span class="col_4717-4718" refersTo="page_0822"/>constituting the legislature. The role of an Opposition&#x2014;I am referring specifically to the United Party Opposition&#x2014;is therefore to be the conscience of the governing party within the framework of that institution, within the provision of the principle of derived authority. But in giving some serious thought to this matter, we should pause to reflect. We know what it means to have a conscience. Any person knows what it means to have a conscience. But if a governing party were to have a conscience such as the one the United Party has today, which finds it possible to adopt these dualistic standpoints and then wants to act as the conscience of a Parliament the functional body which has to handle the derived authority within all international boundaries, then what would happen here, is what we once again saw here today.</p>

<p>What would happen then, would be the situation be once again had to experience today, namely that the conscience of this Parliament, the United Party, is unable to make a contribution, but merely comes forward with admissions and denials, as did the hon. member for Maitland, and, without any substance, levels a reproach at the hon. the Minister of Defence. I suppose the hon. members are rather exhausted after the first part of today&#x2019;s sitting; that is why so few of them are here.</p>

<p>As I have shown, the hon. member for Maitland and those hon. members are not correct; even in their ranks there are people who detest the Afrikaner&#x2019;s institutions and his language. If they are supposed to be the conscience of this House, we want to ask them this: What makes their conscience tick&#x003F; Let us hear how their consciences work. Do they work in the manner in which the hon. member for Musgrave acted today&#x003F; If that is the manner in which the conscience of this House acts, then the people outside should know that we in South Africa, within the province of the derived authority as a governing party, are governing without our having any conscience at all.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. D. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in column 342 of Hansard of this year, the hon. the Minister of Justice placed on record certain quotations from a document entitled &#x201C;Directive by the South African Communist Party&#x201D;. I should like to refer to some of these sentences, as they appear in Hansard, as directives of the communists to their followers&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We cannot afford to play a game according to a set of rules &#x2026; No set of principles is sacrosanct &#x2026; we must force our enemy on to the defensive: If necessary by lies and false accusations. We must muster all our energy &#x2026; to vilify our enemy.</block>

<p>Sir, it is clear that no principle is sacrosanct to the communist and that all energies must be mustered to disparage and to vilify the Government and the Leaders of the National Party by means of false accusations and lies. And during the past three years in particular we have had a great deal of vilification. The Opposition has developed it into a fine art. In this regard many thousands of words were spoken for the purpose of disparaging anyone from the hon. the Prime Minister to the most junior Deputy Minister, and particularly for the purpose of casting suspicion on their motives. Especially in respect of those aspects of our policy in which the outside world takes an intense interest. The greatest measure of suspicion was aroused in that regard. This is a subtle policy with which the Opposition occupies itself.</p>

<p>Now I should like to refer in passing to the behaviour of the hon. member for Simonstown in this House, which gave rise to the situation that a Select Committee of this Parliament is at present investigating certain charges made by him against the hon. the Deputy Minister &#x2026;</p>

<p>Sir, you will remember that while the hon. the Minister of Justice, was reading out the document entitled &#x201C;Directive by the South African Communist Party&#x201D;, the hon. member for Durban North rose and asked on a point of order whether the hon. the Minister was entitled to say that the Opposition wanted to assist the communists and other subversive elements who were the enemies of the State. Shortly afterwards it was the turn of the hon. member for Orange Grove to speak, and in column 343 he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If ever an unfair insult has been slung at this side of the House, it was the statement by the Minister of Justice to the effect that we wanted to help the enemies of South Africa. It is on the same level as the words of the hon. the Minister of Police when he accused the Press of assisting communism &#x2026; we do not take second place to one single person on that side of this House as far as our love of our fatherland and our patriotism are concerned.</block>

<p>The hon. member says &#x201C;hear, hear!&#x201D; For that reason I should like to repeat his last sentence to him. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We do not take second place to one single person on that side of this House as far as our love of our Fatherland and our patriotism are concerned.</block>

<p>Now I want to challenge him on this statement. I want to ask him whether it is an act of patriotism and of love of our fatherland when the hon. member for Yeoville rises in this House and breaks the astounding news to the world that South Africa&#x2019;s devaluation was an act of bankruptcy. Sir, the Opposition is suffering from a bankruptcy of comprehension and understanding of what is meant by patriotism and love of fatherland. Is it an act of patriotism and love of fatherland to create suspicion, by means of a subtle question in this House, a single word, a suggestive sentence, in the outside world of the action taken by the Government to ensure the security of this country and its people&#x003F; I am referring to detention without trial, a matter about which the Opposition kicked up a tremendous fuss this session, a matter, the necessity of which was borne out once more during the recess when a train disaster and a land mine explosion claimed many human lives and caused injury to many more people. But yet the <i>Sunday Times</i> of last Sunday said the hon. the Minister of Police was exploiting these two matters for political gain when he, as a result of them, drew attention to communist and terrorist activities and again drew attention to the necessity of detention without trial. Now I want to accuse the Opposition along with their Press of attaching more value to the freedom of movement of communists and terrorists than to the security of this country and its people.</p>

<p>Sir, is it an act of patriotism and love of fatherland to suggest that the Security Police terrorize innocent people just because they are opposed to the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development&#x003F; Is it an act of patriotism and love of fatherland to imply that the so-called ill-treatment of prisoners is Government policy&#x003F; Then, in pursuance of the judgment in the terrorist trial at Pietermaritzburg, the <i>Sunday Times</i> last Sunday made the following pious statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There will be general relief that the ugly charges brought against the Police have turned out to be without foundation.</block>

<p>This, Sir, after they themselves had brought the charge, after they themselves had conducted the trial and after they themselves had pronounced judgment against the Police and had found them guilty. Is that an act of patriotism and love of fatherland. Sir&#x003F; Is it an act of patriotism and love of fatherland to present South Africa as a Police State for the suppression of the Black people&#x003F; Why do they not answer me&#x003F; I ask whether that is an act of patriotism and love of fatherland.</p>

<p>The hon. member asks who did that. If that is an indication that they are not implicated, then I want to state emphatically that they are implicated, and I want to prove this by putting the following question. Is it an act of patriotism and love of fatherland if the Opposition does not address one word of <span class="col_4721-4722" refersTo="page_0824"/>censure to these journalists who feed on this stinking carrion of politics for the purpose of vilifying South Africa and doing it untold damage overseas&#x003F; The Opposition no longer knows anything about patriotism and love of fatherland, for otherwise the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town would not have asked me in this House to abandon my Afrikanerhood and to join him and his lot of jingoes in forming a new nation with the Black people. Where is the patriotism of which the hon. member for Orange Grove boasted, and where is his love of his fatherland&#x003F; These things fade away completely in the United Party&#x2019;s zeal to destroy at all costs the National Party Government, which is basically an Afrikaner Government. Sir, they want to destroy the binding force of the Afrikaner people, i.e. its religion and its morals, its language and its culture, its traditions and its customs, those things which distinguish it from all other peoples and nations, those things which may be described in one phrase as national pride, that which gives the National Party its strength, with the concept of one nation consisting of 20 million people, because then the Afrikaner will no longer be a factor of political power in South African politics. If we realize our Afrikanerhood, to which the hon. the Minister of Defence referred, then, in their eyes, we are lowering politics to the lowest level in the history of South Africa. We may no longer realize our Afrikanerhood. That is what they demand from us, and what is more, they demand that we abandon it.</p>

<p>Sir, let us take a look at the objection of the hon. member for Orange Grove to the so-called accusation of the hon. the Minister of Justice and the hon. the Minister of Police that the Opposition assist the enemies of the State. In addition to the quotations from the document &#x201C;Directive by the South Africa Communist Party&#x201D; which the hon. the Minister of Justice placed on record, I should like to place on record the following quotation as well, which was used by Lenin himself when he described the purpose of the Communist Party. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Party&#x2019;s purpose is by definition, of course, and often quite sincerely, &#x201C;to secure the interest of the exploited majority&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Sir, the words &#x201C;to secure the interest of the exploited majority&#x201D; appear in quotation marks&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; but this does not mean that the majority ought to have any voice in deciding what its interest is, or that its opinion has any validity that the Party ought to consider.</block>

<p>Sir, if you compare this statement of policy by Lenin on the purpose of the Communist Party to certain aspects of the Opposition&#x2019;s policy, such as, <i>inter alia,</i> the policy that the economic growing-power of this country must be increased by uncontrolled numbers of non-Whites but with the reservation that the non-Whites will never be placed in a position of leadership&#x2014;and I emphasize &#x201C;with the reservation that the non-Whites will never be placed in a position of leadership&#x201D;&#x2014;secondly, the Opposition&#x2019;s policy in respect of the development of Bantu homelands, with the reservation that they will never get independence&#x2014;and I emphasize &#x201C;that they will never get independence&#x201D;&#x2014;thirdly, the Opposition&#x2019;s policy in respect of their federation scheme, with the reservation that White supremacy (<i>baasskap</i>) will be maintained in all spheres at all times&#x2014;and I emphasize &#x201C;that White supremacy will be maintained in all spheres at all times&#x201D;&#x2014;fourthly, their policy that non-Whites will be represented by Whites in this House&#x2014;and I emphasize that it will be Whites&#x2014;and, lastly, their policy in respect of the number of representatives they want to grant every population group in this House&#x2014;and I emphasize the number&#x2014;then I read in the Opposition&#x2019;s policy the following words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Party&#x2019;s purpose is, by definition, of course, &#x201C;to secure the interest of the exploited majority&#x201D;, but this does not mean that the majority ought to have any voice in deciding what its interest is or that its opinion has any validity that the Party ought to consider.</block>

<p><span class="col_4723-4724" refersTo="page_0825"/>Sir, this is what I read in their Party&#x2019;s policy, and the attitude which the Opposition wants to reflect to the outside world through this policy is that of a fair and just minority group in this House, that devotes itself wholeheartedly to the salvation of a vast mass of people who, for the greatest part, in the Opposition&#x2019;s view, are too lazy or too stupid to realize that they are in need of salvation. Surely it is their policy that non-Whites should be represented here by Whites because the non-Whites are apparently too stupid to do so themselves. Surely it is their policy that the non-White should not elevate his own language to the status of an official language in the homeland because apparently it is an uncivilized language; surely it is their policy, Sir, that the non-Whites are not able to govern themselves in their own homeland because apparently they are too incompetent to do so. It is their policy, Sir, and I want to tell them that no matter how effective this policy may be outwardly under certain circumstances, it is and remains the antithesis of the democratic concept of politics and constitutional education with a view to bringing about political and constitutional maturity. Now I am speaking of political and constitutional maturity for the non-Whites. Sir, the share they want to grant non-White authorities in non-White homelands and the aspects of their policy I have outlined, are directly contained in the principle of the above quotation I made. Mr. Speaker, my time has expired.</p>

<p>That is fine, Sir. The hon. member for Odendaalsrus tried here this afternoon to revive the old communist story. In fact, he led as his star witness the hon. the Minister of Justice. He quoted what the hon. the Minister of Justice had said, that we were helping and making ourselves the tools of the communists. No, Sir, they tried that one just before the Brakpan election and it did not work, and this new story that they are trying for the Oudtshoorn election is not going to work either. But, Sir, I want to say this to the hon. gentleman who has just sat down to the hon. the Minister of Justice: When the same thing as the hon. the Minister of Justice said in the House was said outside this House in a pamphlet put out by that Party, we obtained a court order to stop it, and what is more, on the return day the interdict was confirmed by another judge and, what is more, since then the National Party has abandoned its appeal against that court order. Sir, I will say no more about it because there is an action for defamation against the publishers of that pamphlet.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for Odendaalsrus talks about &#x201C;beswaddering&#x201D; that has taken place. He says that we have had a lot of it over the past three years. What is the &#x201C;beswaddering&#x201D; to which he refers&#x003F; The moment one raises some of these matters, for example the Agliotti matter, everyone loses their cool and gets the jitters. This is not a campaign of &#x201C;beswaddering&#x201D;; these are the acts of this Government, inefficiency and all sorts of things, and surely we are entitled, and in fact it is our duty, to inquire about these matters. We had a debate the other day, a short debate, about the extraordinary goings on in the <i>Natal Mercury</i> offices in Durban when the investigator <span class="col_4725-4726" refersTo="page_0826"/>of the Agliotti investigation was being investigated. You will recall what happened, Sir.</p>

<p>One of the things that has become quite obvious is that this Government has lost its judgment as well. Its performance about the language groups this afternoon shows, I think, a lack of judgment. They do not appreciate what we have found; let me tell them that the man in the street, wherever you go during this Easter recess, whether it is in Brakpan or in Oudtshoorn or in Durban, is asking what on earth is going on in this Agliotti inquiry. Do they not know what is happenning&#x003F; The public has every reason not only to know but to be extremely concerned about what is or what is not happening about the Agliotti inquiry. We keep asking but we do not get a reply, and when the public asks us we can only say that we asked but we got not reply.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>There it is. Sir, The hon. member for Prinshof says that is because we started &#x201C;skinderstories&#x201D;. What is this &#x201C;skinderstorie&#x201D;&#x003F; Let me say at the very beginning, that all we had when we raised this matter, apart from some emotional displays from people who ought to have known better, was a lot of abuse from the hon. the Minister, who called me &#x201C;Muddy Mitchell&#x201D;. Why does he call me by that name&#x003F; He does so because I inquired and asked for a short half-hour debate which you, Sir, allowed, about the happenings in the <i>Natal Mercury</i> offices, which was an investigation, as it now turns out, into a &#x201C;skinderstorie&#x201D;. I heard this &#x201C;skinderstorie&#x201D; for the first time from the hon. the Minister of Police. We did not know what was going on in regard to this extraordinary affair where the Commissioner of Police causes an investigation to be made into the Deputy Commissioner of Police, the Chief of the CID, behind his back, and sends a man on his own staff to go and get a sworn statement from a witness as to something which he, Gen. Bester, the Deputy Commissioner, is alleged to have said about the Agliotti affair. We did not know what it was and we kept on asking what it was, and what is it&#x003F; Who tells us when for the first time we hear what it is&#x003F; It is not the newspapers which tell us about these &#x201C;skinderstories&#x201D; and it is not the Sappe but the Minister himself. What is it&#x003F; I want to read what the Minister himself said. He said that in the first place a report was conveyed to the Commissioner of Police personally that Gen. Bester had alledgedly made certain statements to a reporter of an English language newspaper in Natal. These statements which Gen. Bester had allegedly made were to the effect that the Government wanted to impose certain restrictions on certain aspects of the inquiry into the Agliotti matter. In other words what it amounted to was that the Police, because of action from the side of the Government, could not conduct their inquiry freely and in an unhampered way. Furthermore, according to the report which was conveyed to the Commissioner of Police, Gen. Bester had allegedly told the reporter that as a result of the interference of the Government in regard to the inquiry into the Agliotti case, he was going to retire before he was due to retire and that after he had retired he would make a full story and all the information available to this reporter for publication. That is more or less the content of the statement allegedly made to the reporter by Gen. Bester.</p>

<p>As I say, no one had heard of this before the hon. the Minister produced it and told us what it was. Sir, it is a devastating sort of statement for anyone to be alleged to have made, especially having regard to the extraordinary, inordinate, unexplained delay in the investigation into the Agliotti case. What was this statement that Gen. Bester is alleged to have made&#x003F; This whole affair was investigated under the supervision of the Commissioner of Police, and this statement was called a &#x201C;skinderstorie&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Now in regard to this statement, either it was rumoured that Gen. Bester had said <span class="col_4727-4728" refersTo="page_0827"/>this or it was not a rumour but something more. I want to say that I find it very hard to believe, without any explanation, which we still have not had, &#x2026;</p>

<p>Just be quiet for a moment. That statement was investigated by the Commissioner of Police. Was it just a rumour he heard&#x003F; Surely he would not investigate his deputy behind his back just on a rumour&#x003F; I would suggest that he would surely have said he would not investigate a &#x201C;skinderstorie&#x201D; like this unless he had a statement on oath, an affidavit. I do not believe that he would do such a thing unless he had such a statement.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Someone is lying. There are two affidavits. One of them is from Gerry Strauss, the reporter, and the other one, according to the Minister, is from Gen. Bester, and there is another sworn statement from someone else saying something different from what is in those sworn statements. What is he going to do about it&#x003F; If there is no sworn statement, then I find it absolutely scandalous that the Deputy Commissioner of Police can be investigated behind his back merely on a rumour, not made on oath in a statement. And, Sir, will the hon. the Minister indicate whether there is a sworn statement&#x003F; I hope he will. But if there is no sworn statement, then without a proper explanation, one can find no good reason for the commissioner having caused this investigation to take place in which he wanted sworn statements from people, unless someone had said to him : &#x201C;I hear this has happened; I want it investigated.&#x201D; Then he does not have to have a sworn statement if the person can ask him to do this. And there are only two people who could ask him to do it. The one is the hon. the Minister of Police and the other the hon. the Prime Minister. This whole situation, in so far as the Commissioner himself was concerned, was ridiculous and a lot of nonsense.</p>

<p>Then there is the other point which has not as yet been answered. The hon. the Minister did not answer it last time. Perhaps he did not have time. This concerns the question why this investigation took place behind Gen. Bester&#x2019;s back. Why did he not as in the normal course of events say to Gen. Bester: This is what I hear has happened; what have you got to say about it&#x003F; This did not happen. Even a common thief, when he is investigated by the Police, is told what the charge is against him. This is done before the investigation takes place. But not Gen. Bester, the chief of the C.I.D. He is the longest serving policeman in South Africa with an impeccable record. And this is the way he is treated. How do strange things like this happen&#x003F; They don&#x2019;t happen in the ordinary course of events in an ordinary departmental inquiry. In my experience certainly it does not take place in the Police Force where they are meticulous and excellent in their investigations and very fair to everyone within the Force.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<p>But not in this case.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Not in this case and as I have said:&#x201C;Why not&#x003F;&#x201D; This is the Chief of the C.I.D. It lends support to the <span class="col_4729-4730" refersTo="page_0828"/>view that this was not just an ordinary investigation. Someone has to explain. There are only two people who could have told the Commissioner to investigate without a sworn statement and those are the two gentlemen I have mentioned.</p>

<p>A long time has elapsed since this investigation started. If my memory serves me correctly, the hon. the Prime Minister himself ordered the Police investigation into this matter in September, 1971, while the commission that was enquiring into the Agliotti matter was still sitting. We have had no satisfactory reply from the hon. the Minister or anyone yet as to why these investigations which are now approximately 18 months old, have not been completed. In fact, earlier on, in June, 1971, for example, we found the following report in the <i>Cape Times</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Brig. Burger said that he had no comment to make on the investigations at this stage except that they will be very thorough.</block>

<p>And then in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of the 6th June of that year, again you find&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Gen. Danie Bester told me that detectives who belong to a special unit of the Police were making a thorough investigation into matters concerning the Agliotti affair.</block>

<p>This is what was going on then, having started in September. Nothing has happened at all. The hon. the Minister of Police can&#x2019;t tell us why. But he can tell us&#x2014;how extraordinary&#x2014;that he expects that the inquiry is going to be completed by June. Why June&#x003F; Why does he feel that it will be completed in June especially as the matter is still being investigated, but, Sir, even more especially, because he says &#x201C;it is a delicate matter&#x003F;&#x201D; I will tell hon. members what is very interesting as well. It is not just the hon. the Minister who says it is delicate. In fact, he says it is very delicate. The Commissioner of Police says that the inquiry is a delicate matter. This is what we want to know. What is it that makes the inquiry into this ugly scandal of the Agliotti affair &#x201C;delicate&#x003F;&#x201D; Surely the only thing that can make it delicate is that delicate matters arose during the course of the investigation. Why is it delicate&#x003F; We want to know. We have not heard. It must be very, very delicate if the inquiry is as protracted as it has been, but we do not know. What we do know is that in the middle of all this the man who is in charge of the investigation is suddenly investigated himself concerning something he said about that. The country is sick and tired of having no answer to this question. In fact, the distinct impression that is created is that there is something not delicate, but something fishy and smelly about this whole affair. [Interjections.] See how touchy they get. They say it is all my creation. This is not so. The hon. the Prime Minister appointed a commission to look into the matter. The commissioner found that there were irregularities such as one could not have believed had one not seen them in the report. He also found there to be <i>mala fides,</i> and he suggested that the papers should be submitted to the Attorney-General for what action he could take. There were only two people that he mentioned in his report, namely Venter and Agliotti, in respect of whom he thought the Attorney-General should take action. Does this Government expect the country to believe that the Police have been investigating for 18 months and that they will not complete their investigations until June into the activities of two people involved in one transaction&#x003F; I hope the hon. the Minister is going to give us a reply. We do not want a reply from the hon. member for Prinshof. We had his flow of abuse and invective last time. What we want are the facts &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! The hon. member must withdraw that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I beg your pardon, Sir. I withdraw that. We had a lot of noise from the hon. member for Prinshof, but no facts. He does not know the facts and there is therefore no point in his talking about this matter. We want the facts now. Only the hon. the Minister can give us those facts. One of the immediate reactions to this affair came from senior members of the Police Force. They said in effect that they could not understand how Gen. Bester could be investigated behind his back. What one of them said, I think, sums the whole matter up, namely &#x201C;If this is happening at the top, then God help us down below&#x201D;. This is the Minister of Police who is there to look after the Police Department and the policemen to see that things are properly done and properly run. What does he say&#x003F; What is his contribution and message to <span class="col_4731-4732" refersTo="page_0829"/>the Police Force&#x003F; It is that as far as he is concerned, he approves of every action of the Commissioner. The Minister also said:&#x201C;Had he asked me beforehand whether he should do this in the way in which in fact he did, I would have given him the necessary instructions to do so.&#x201D; I would like him to justify that and I am sure every policeman in South Africa would like him to justify that and to say that he will have such an inquiry once more. All these questions still remain unanswered. The hon. the Minister said that he had given no instruction to the Commissioner of Police to set up this investigation. He also spoke in that regard on behalf of the hon. the Prime Minister. Did the hon. the Minister of Police know that this investigation was going on&#x003F; Did he&#x003F; That is a very important question for him to answer, because the distinct impression we got the last time he spoke on this matter was that he did not know that the investigation was going on. In fact, he said that had he been asked by the general to do it in the way it was done, he would have said yes. The impression is that he did not know. If he did know, why did he not know&#x003F; Why did he, the Minister of Police, not know&#x003F; It is no good his shaking his head like that, trying to fob it off; he is the Minister of Police. The Deputy Chief of Police is investigated behind his back, sworn statements are required and the Commissioner of Police in charge of it, the Commissioner of Police himself actually asks a witness for a sworn statement and the hon. the Minister of Police does not know anything about it. Is this possible&#x003F; The only way it could be possible is that someone else gave the instruction. That person could only be the Prime Minister. No one else could have done it. If the Minister did not know about it, I do not believe that the Prime Minister could not have known about it as well.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, yesterday the hon. the Minister of Labour made the statement that the United Party was trying to commit character assassination in South Africa according to the American pattern. If ever people wanted to have an example of that, they have had in this House this afternoon the most perfect example one can possibly have of groundless disparagement. I wonder whether the hon. member for Durban North will pay some attention, after I have sat here listening patiently to his nonsense. Now, what are the facts of this matter&#x003F; What are the facts of the statement of the hon. the Minister and the statement of Gen. Joubert, the Commissioner of Police&#x003F; If the hon. member for Durban North had used his brains at all, which he did not do, he would have known the facts immediately. Now I want to show to this hon. House that the hon. member was simply indulging in gossip and in discrediting Ministers and the Police to the worst degree. The fact of the matter is that Gen. Joubert said that he had heard a piece of gossip from Natal. He heard that Gen. Bester had made a statement. He immediately caused an investigation to be made. To me it is as clear as daylight why he caused the investigation to be made, because it is so that in Natal everybody goes about with their noses and ears to the ground so as to pick up every possible and impossible bit of gossip and to run with that to the Sunday newspapers to start a fire where there is absolutely no fuel.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>And then the hon. member for Durban North walked in here and asked quite na&#x00EF;vely why a sworn statement was not obtained before an investigation was carried out. Gen. Joubert sent a police officer to obtain a sworn statement, and what statement did he obtain&#x003F; The hon. members expect an answer from us, but when we give them the answer they do not listen. [Interjections.] I said the hon. member had asked why a sworn statement had not been obtained. Gen. Joubert sent an officer to obtain a sworn statement in regard to the so-called statement. What sworn statement did he obtain : Gen. Bester had said nothing! That concluded the matter. Why&#x003F;&#x2014;Because it was gossip. A sworn statement was obtained so that the Minister, when the gossip-mongers ran to Parliament to ask for a judicial commission of inquiry, would be able to say that there was a sworn statement to the effect that Gen. Bester had made no statement. That was all that happened, but what do we find now&#x003F; The M.P.&#x2019;s from Natal, the hon. member for Durban North, to be specific, heard something. He did not have the faintest idea of what he had heard. But, after all, he is a responsible member of the House of Assembly. He ran to the <i>Sunday Times,</i> but with what&#x003F; He had nothing which made it necessary for him to run to the paper, but he came to light with a piece of gossip and made the headlines with that. What was his news&#x003F; He put a question; and on the basis of that a full page was written! His question was: Who asked for an investigation to be ordered against Gen. Bester&#x003F; In order to commit character assassination, he came to the conclusion, which was gossip, that it had to be either the Minister of Police or the hon. the Prime Minister. What was the idea of that&#x003F; It had a single motive only, i.e. to start sowing suspicion and to discredit the Cabinet so as to allow of further gossip. That was the real motive. Now he has come to the House of Assembly &#x2026;</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban North called for a dramatic debate. What did he do in his dramatic debate&#x003F; He put exactly the same question to us and made exactly the same little statement he had made in the <i>Sunday Times.</i> He produced the same piece of idle gossip. What motive did that have&#x003F; The motive was to create, by way of repetition, a false image of our Cabinet and of the actions and work of our Police. It was a disparagement of our national administration; it was to tell the country outside, &#x201C;Just see how bad this administration is&#x2014;the Ministers do not even know what is going on in their departments&#x201D;. The hon. member then came forward with these soggy arguments, repeated the same debate to which he had already received a full reply, and said that there had been no reply to his arguments. With all respect to the hon. member for Durban North, it is not our fault if he cannot understand the replies given to him. I am afraid, however, that that hon. member is one of those people to whom one may say something a hundred times, but once he has something in his head, he flies off at a tangent and it is impossible for one to bring him back to the right track. From here he will again proceed to Natal with the same gossip. On Sunday there will be another huge front-page report on one question only: &#x201C;What is the answer&#x003F;&#x201D; He has been given the answer ten times, but even now he does not know what it is. If the hon. the Opposition comes into power, I should like, even at this stage, to tell the hon. the Leader something he must consider very seriously. The hon. member is supposed to be a shadow Minister. This kind of irresponsible action can only bring forth more of the same kind of thing. Today I want to tell the hon. the Leader of the Opposition this : They are undermining the authority of our Police and our Ministers. What they are doing is deliberate, unfounded and unmotivated. They are occupied with a false impression at all times.</p>

<p>Now I want to try to make this point. Once again we have to sit through six months and waste our time listening to the type of speech we have just heard from the hon. member for Durban North.

<p>Yes, all our sons, and it behoves the hon. member to remember that. It is not our sons only; I speak of all the South African sons. While the hon. member is discrediting the administration of the police here, without any justification, those men are defending our country. Sir I want to tell the hon. member for Durban North that it is not proper of him to come and tell these pieces of unfounded gossip he has picked up on the south coast of Natal in a responsible Parliament such as this. It is not proper of him to conduct this kind of debate in these serious times. The proper thing for us to do, in the light of the given evidence, is to stand by the Police administration, Justice and the men. Sir, I just want to mention a few examples to you. Recently some of our young men were killed and others maimed in a landmine explosion up in the North. Do we ever get an outburst of indignation from the English-language press in respect of that kind of thing&#x003F; Has the hon. member for Durban North ever risen, in the public interest, in a debate to ask the Minister of Police to strengthen the security of South Africa&#x003F; No, Sir, while those things are taking place, they come here with that kind of nonsense and then we are to take it seriously. Last year when 49 people were rounded up here, hon. members on that side told us that we should not detain people without trial. Three of those people were charged forthwith and the Attorney-General said they could be released on bail. What happened&#x003F; They absconded. Did the hon. member call for a debate that time to suggest that we should take steps to stop this kind of thing&#x003F; No, he comes to this House with this kind of childish nonsense.</p>

When 13 people were tried in Pietermaritzburg, what happened&#x003F; The statements that the Police had allegedly beaten up these people to force them to give evidence, were published under huge banner headlines. If the advocate put a question, not the answer but the question was published under banner headlines. If a question was put &#x201C;Did you beat up such and such a man in the cell until the blood ran&#x003F;&#x201D;, the newspaper reported, &#x201C;It is alleged that blood ran in the cell&#x201D;. It was an attempt at disparaging this Government and this country&#x2019;s administration of justice. With these attacks on the Terrorism Act that hon. member participated in this disparagement. And what did we find in the end&#x003F; We found that an English-speaking Judge, the Judge-President of Natal, had found those people guilty.</p>

There is more than sufficient evidence of that, and I expect the hon. member for Durban North to rise and to agree wholeheartedly with me and to tell this Government, &#x201C;Go ahead; you are doing a fine job of work&#x201D;.

<p>What about Agliotti&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#kruger">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Durban North is a so-called legal man. He knows just as well as I do that when the Prime Minister appointed the Agliotti Commission so quickly it was virtually attempting the impossible for the Police to bring someone to book. I think it redounds to the credit of this Government that it is taking so much pains over such a long period to gather the evidence which is so vital. But what is made of this&#x003F; In spite of the fact that the hon. member should have known this he again indulged in sowing suspicion in connection with the point he, as a legal man, ought to have known could not have been brought to finality any earlier. Sir, I want to make an appeal to hon. members on that side to put a stop to this character assassination and sowing of suspicion, particularly as far as the Police are concerned, and particularly as far as section 6 is concerned. The times are too dangerous. Hon. members on that side must not come and tell us that they, as a party, know better how to deal with subversion that we do. They did in fact do so, and they enjoyed doing so. Do you know why&#x003F; Because the people against whom they acted were not communists&#x2014;they were sitting together with them in the Friends of the Soviet Union&#x2014;but Afrikaners. They enjoyed it because these people were Afrikaners, but what did they do with regard to the communists&#x003F; They were sitting together with them in one melting pot&#x2014;in the Friends of the Soviet Union. I want to tell hon. members on that side that they should stop that now; the people have been aware of it for a long time.</p>

<p>Then comes the following report, of which I want to quote certain sections&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Scores of South Africans are crashing the apartheid colour bar in White-Coloured marriages, despite classifications as non-Whites under the Population Registration Act.

<p>But what is actually happening here&#x003F; The hon. member for Durban North is making use of an obvious loophole in the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act to allow marriages between non-Whites and Whites to be performed. In practice the hon. shadow Minister of Justice is then opposed to the prohibition on mixed marriages. I now want to ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition whether the United Party is opposed to the prohibition of mixed marriages, or are they in favour of the prohibition of mixed marriages&#x003F; I am putting that question to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. Is the United Party in favour of the prohibition on mixed marriages, or are they opposed to it&#x003F; The hon. the Leader of the Opposition is not aware of the fact that I represent 1 600 U.P. supporters in my constituency.

<p>We have by now heard such a great deal about Agliotti from the hon. member for Durban North that we no longer need to hear about it from the hon. member for Pinelands. This is a very important matter, one which deals with the relations policy in South Africa. It is a matter which deals with the relationships between Whites and non-Whites.</p>

<p>Sir, I shall tell you what conclusion I draw from what happened among the ranks of the United Party, and now the hon. members of the United Party may deny this if they wish. They have decided not to reply to the questions put by Nationalists, for they then find themselves in difficulties. Recently we have seen that all of them&#x2014; from the Leader of the Opposition down, all the front-benchers and back-benchers&#x2014; do not reply to the question if a member of this side of the House says he wants to put one, while hon. members on this side of the House are always prepared to reply to questions. [Interjections.] We discussed Agliotti, and we replied to all the questions put by hon. members. But I am levelling an accusation across the floor of this House to the effect that the hon. members on that side of the House have reached an agreement and have said to each other : We must stick together and not reply to any questions because as soon as we reply, they give us a damned good hiding (<i>neuk ons op</i>)!

<p>Parliamentary rules and practice make provision for my being able to put questions to the Opposition across the floor of the House, and it is customary that specific questions be answered. It is done daily. Why does the Leader of the Opposition not want to reply to the question&#x003F; Let us analyse the position. Firstly, he does not know the answer, or secondly, if he knows the answer for the present, he is too afraid to reply for he knows that by doing so he will make certain members in his party angry. Further, he knows the answer; he knows they are opposed to the prohibition on mixed marriages, but he does not want to say it because a by-election is to be held in Oudtshoorn next week. Why does he not furnish a reply to this&#x003F; We place it on record that the United Party is opposed to the prohibition on mixed marriages.</p>

<p>I want to make a single comment on national unity and what has been said in this connection. I want to make it very clear that we on this side of the House are quite clearly in favour of national unity. I want to make it clear that national unity at its best can flourish under the National Party and not under the United Party.

The issue here is whether he is in fact prepared to show respect for the Afrikaner by using their language as well in this House. That is all that is at issue here. The Prime Minister said on one occasion &#x201C;To speak and to understand the other man&#x2019;s language is to show your respect for him&#x201D;. The hon. members will probably not say whether they agree with that, but I want to sum up the standpoint of the <span class="col_4745-4746" refersTo="page_0836"/>National Party by saying: &#x201C;We understand and we speak the English language and we do it because we respect it&#x201D;. But what we ourselves do, we also demand for ourselves, and that is the difference. That is what is at issue here. The entire argument this afternoon revolves around the fact that the other side of the House is not prepared to show to the Afrikaner what the Afrikaner is prepared to show to the English-speaking South Africans. What is at issue is respect, and regard. Let me say this to that side of the House.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, after the exhibition that we have had both this afternoon and yesterday on the subject of national unity, I don&#x2019;t think it behoves any hon. member on that side to deal any further with that topic. It was as repulsive to me to listen to some of the speeches, particularly the speech of the hon. the Minister of Defence, as it is to watch maggots feeding on a corpse. Hon. members, such as the hon. Minister of Defence, making speeches such as they did, feasted on the emotions of the people in as repulsive a way as do maggots on a corpse. And it was perhaps appropriate that the worst offender in that regard should have been the hon. the Minister of Defence because he has not only the spinelessness but the shape and the colour of those repulsive creatures as well. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pretoria Central who has just spoken, revealed his ignorance about the position in terms of the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act. He attempted to embarrass this side of the House and the hon. member for Durban North in regard to a certain situation which arose in terms of that legislation. And what was it&#x003F; It was the case of a Coloured and a White living together with children. And what happened&#x003F; Under the legislation of this Government, administered by the officials of this Government, these people were entitled to be married as Whites in terms of that legislation in order to legitimize their children.</p>

<p>That is not the position.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Why the hon. member for Durban North should take the blame for this state of affairs, I cannot imagine, more particularly as we have read recently of yet another case under the laws and the administration of this Government of a White woman classified as Chinese in order that she can marry a Chinaman. Now, let us leave these irrelevancies alone and get back to more important matters such as the position of the hon. the Minister of Police.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Police has already lost a great deal of the shreds and tatters which remain of his reputation as a Minister when it was said by one of his own organs that he should be replaced by Mr. Haak from outside because he could no longer carry the portfolio of Commerce and Industry, having been a complete failure in that portfolio in the eyes of his own press to the extent that he must <span class="col_4747-4748" refersTo="page_0837"/>be replaced by a man as discredited as was Mr. Haak when he left the Cabinet. Having reached that position, what do we find in his other portfolio, namely that of Police&#x003F; We are in a situation where the allegation is against a very senior, the second most senior police officer in the Police Force in South Africa. The duty of the hon. the Minister is to stand up in this House and to clear the name of that member; that is his duty. His duty is to disclose the facts to this House so that that senior policeman&#x2019;s name is finally cleared. But what does he do&#x003F; He hides behind senior Police officials, such as Gen. Joubert. He even hides behind the inadequate person of the hon. member for Prinshof. It is not only ourselves. &#x2026;</p>

<p>It has been the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s custom, whenever there is a ticklish statement to be made in regard to Police affairs, to put up a senior police officer to make that statement for him Gen. Gouws was one of those who had to be put in that position. Our concern in this matter is shared. I do not often find support in <i>Die Burger,</i> but our concern is shared by that organ of the National Party in an editorial of the 15th of June, 1971. Amongst other things they said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ook na gister se debat in die Volksraad bly pynlike vrae onbeantwoord waarop waarskynlik ook net in &#x2019;n geregshof behoorlik ingegaan sal kan word &#x2026; Die publiek se vertroue in die hantering van Staatsgeld is geskud.

<p>This is the point. As daar koppe moet af, dan moet hulle af&#x201D;. What is the inference to be drawn from the statement which was revealed for the first time as was pointed out by the hon. the Minister himself&#x003F; It cannot be dressed up as rumours and scandalmongering which emanated from this side of the House. It cannot be dressed up as rumours and scandalmongering which emanated from the English-language press. Nobody in the country, not any organ of the Press nor any member of Parliament on this side of the House, knew of this alleged scandalmongering until the hon. the Minister made the statement in this House. <i>Die Burger</i> says that if heads must roll, they must roll. What was the allegation&#x003F; What was the allegation which the hon. the Minister disclosed which Gen. Bester was alleged to have made&#x003F; He is supposed to have said that there was interference by the Government in the investigation of the Agliotti case. The Minister spoke carefully and he left a number of things unsaid. What did he say&#x003F; He said that it was alleged that Gen. Bester had said&#x2014;and I quote the Minister&#x2019;s Hansard&#x2014;&#x201C;that the Government wanted to impose certain restrictions on certain aspects of the inquiry into the Agliotti matter&#x201D;. Now the first question immediately is what restrictions is it alleged the Government was placing upon the enquiry&#x003F; This is what the country wishes to know, because as far as one can see the only restrictions which are conceivable in these circumstances are restrictions on the investigation of certain persons. We want to know who they were and what these restrictions are that it is alleged Gen. Bester said were being made by the Government upon this inquiry. We do not want the hon. member for Pretoria Central put up or the hon. member for Prinshof or the hon. member for Potohefstroom. We do not want the hon. the Minister to follow his usual habit of hiding behind somebody. We want him to get up to answer this question in this House.</p>

I myself do not propose to repeat it again after this. The circumstances are peculiar and they point to the very heart of this matter; that is why they must be stated. On the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own statement, not only is this man somebody of immense seniority and respect in the Police Force, and not only is he the head man investigating the Agliotti matter, but, so we are to understand, at the time when the Commissioner of Police who investigated, according to the Minister, who launched this investigation, at a time when the Commissioner of Police knew that the man involved was such a man as is Gen.

Minister dealt with this matter on the last occasion, he said in his own statement in justification of Gen. Joubert&#x2019;s action that he would want to determine whom the man was who had lied and who had implicated Gen. Bester&#x2019;s name in that way. Therefore, he said, it was essential for the Commissioner of Police to investigate what had happened here. We go along with the hon. the Minister there and that is why I say we want a clear statement from the hon. the Minister as to who made the statement upon oath, a statement which was false, and we want to know what action has been taken as a result of that false statement.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>It is not a scandal story, but a legitimate inference they will draw from the known facts if the hon. Minister will not give us the full facts.</p>

<p>I see the hon. Minister of Agriculture has gone. I regret it, but nevertheless I shall have to deal with another matter concerning him. This Minister is a gentleman who, according to his own Press, ought to resign. I quote the headlines of <i>Rapport</i>: &#x201C;Burger s&#x00EA; aan Uys, bedank.&#x201D; However, we have here, and I have to deal with it very quickly, another case of what appears to be the habit of that hon. Minister, namely the habit of giving preferential treatment to important people. That is the way the facts appear unless we get an explanation from the hon. Minister concerned. We have here, curiously enough, some 5 600 acres of State land overlooking the land of Mr. Bell. I see that the hon. Leader of the House is making motions; I did not send a message to the hon. Minister of Agriculture because when I stood up he was sitting in his place. We have here 5 600 acres of State land overlooking the land of Mr. Bell which towards the end of 1962 was advertised as open to tender as sisal land to the public. The advertisement is important because it says specifically: &#x201C;The lease of State-owned land at Duku Duku for the cultivation of sisal.&#x201D; It makes no reference to any other crops, but says specifically &#x201C;sisal&#x201D;. Furthermore it says that the lease will be for a period of 20 years. A number of people in Zululand have read this advertisement which appeared widely in the Press. A great many of them took the view that this land was unsuited for sisal and consequently did not apply. Had they known that the land would subsequently be allowed for purposes other than sisal, many more would have applied for it. Despite the misgivings of some, many applied and they were given details of the conditions which the successful tenderer would have to comply with. Those conditions included some of the following. I am dealing with the Duku-Duku State land which was leased for the purpose of sisal cultivation. The lease was for 20 years according to the conditions given to those who tendered. The land was to be used exclusively for the production of sisal and for any other purpose directly connected with sisal. The successful tenderer was required to commence using the land for those purposes within one year of entering into the lease. This meant that the land had to be cleared within a year, which was a very considerable undertaking. As I will show, it was something which deterred many from applying when <span class="col_4753-4754" refersTo="page_0840"/>they saw the conditions of the lease. Finally, no part of the land could be let without the prior written permission of the Minister. My time is very short; so I shall have to concertina what I wish to say.</p>

<p>These conditions were received and studied by the local people. Because, as I say, only sisal, in terms of the advertisement and the conditions, could be grown, and because the conditions required that the land be commenced to be used for that purpose within one year, which meant that there was a colossal job of clearing bush for the successful tenderer, many people gave up the idea of tendering and did not go ahead with the scheme. I say in passing that this land is most suitable for sugar purposes. But the conditions of the lease as advertised, precluded sugar being grown on this property.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, and I will say it again because it is important. That hon. Minister is involved in it as well. Nothing further was known about this matter until it was discovered that the lease for this land had been awarded to an immigrant from Tanganyika, a certain Mr. Bassiliou. He was the successful tenderer. It struck many people as surprising that an immigrant from Tanganyika should receive a lease for 5 600 acres of State land and particularly when there were many South Africans in those parts who had for years grown sisal and were well experienced in the production of that crop. He commenced felling trees, which upset many nature conservationists. It is a most magnificent indigenous forest in a high-rainfall area. The matter was reported to me and I put certain questions on the Order Paper.</p>

<p>The first point I wish to make is that the lease, as granted to Mr. Bassiliou, is quite different from that which was advertised for the general public&#x2019;s consumption; it was quite different. Despite the Department having told me in writing that it was for 20 years, it is in fact for 25 years. I now discover it from the answers which the hon. the Minister gave to the questions. The next point is that it is not limited to the growing of sisal. Cane has been planted on 240 acres, for which the hon. the Minister or his predecessor has granted a quota. Any other crops may now be grown which the Government will allow from time to time. Finally the conditions of the existing lease are that any land unsuitable for sisal&#x2014;and there is plenty of it&#x2014;can be used by the lessee at his discretion, which means that this man can grow any crops he likes.</p>

<p>No, Sir, I am not prepared; I have not the time to answer any questions. This reveals a state of affairs in the Department of the hon. the Minister of which one has complained before. That is a wholly wrongful handling of State-owned land. It is a mishandling of it, to the disadvantage of the ordinary citizen of South Africa, to the disadvantage of the man who does not have access to high places. Now, Sir, what is the first principle that is wrong&#x003F; You advertise land with very limited and severe terms so as to exclude the mass of people who would wish to apply. Then when you have chosen a certain individual as the right tenderer, you relax all those conditions and make the proposition more attractive than when the others were excluded. That is the first principle which is wrong. You let him grow, for example, a wide variety of crops, and extend the term of the lease. The point is that many others would have applied for this property had they known that sugar, for example, could be grown on it. But the story does not end there. There is a forfeiture clause in this lease which provides that if the terms of the lease are not complied with the Government can forfeit this lease. This man has now been there for ten years. Of these 5 600 acres he has not put 400 acres under sisal. The sisal he has grown has been allowed to revert to grass and bush.</p>

He has not complied with the terms of the lease in the sense that he has not cleared the land in question within the stipulated time. He has not maintained his sisal production as he is required to do in terms of the lease. He has allowed it, indeed, to go back to veld and to thorn trees.</p>

<block name="quote">The land is thus ordinary State-owned land which falls under the control of this department. The question of making available approximately 5 600 acres of this land on a lease basis for the cultivation of sisal and the suitability of the land for this purpose was fully investigated by various committees on which all interested Government departments were represented. It was felt that it would be in the national interest to encourage the production of sisal on a large scale with a view to building up an export market once the local demand for the product had been met. The State Buyer was requested to call for tenders from interested parties for the lease of the land for sisal production, and notices to this effect appeared in the <i>Government Gazette</i> and the following newspapers: <i>Die Transvaler, The Star,</i> the <i>Nataller,</i> the <i>Mercury, Die Landbouweekblad</i> and the <i>Farmers&#x2019; Weekly.</i> The Natal Sisal Growers&#x2019; Association was also approached in the matter and offered no objection. After careful consideration of the tenders received, the Cabinet decided to lease the land to Mr. C. J. Bassiliou, a sisal producer from Tanganyika, who had the necessary assets as well as experience to make a success of the undertaking and whose knowledge of sisal production would be of great benefit to the industry in this country.</block>

In 1962 public tenders were invited for the farm Dukuduku No. 14 866, in the district of Hlabisa, 2 407,0719 ha in extent. The purpose of this lease was to have sisal cultivated and processed on that property. A Ministerial committee decided in 1963, after they had appointed a committee consisting of officials to enquire into the whole matter, to lease the land on their recommendation to Mr. C. J. Bassiliou at a rental of R3 000 per annum for a term of 20 years &#x2026;</p>

<p>That is not what you told me.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; the main object being, of course, to plant sisal on it. Sir, Mr. Bassiliou was decided upon as he possessed mature experience and sound knowledge of the sisal industry. He was an immigrant from the then Tanganyika, and while living there he owned all the necessary machinery and equipment. However, although Mr. Bassiliou was regarded as having enough capital for tackling a major undertaking of this nature, he did not have sufficient capital for purchasing out of his own pocket the land for this purpose as well. At that stage the object of the leasing of the property was to promote the sisal industry in the Republic, since, at that Stage, only three-eighths of the Republic&#x2019;s requirements were produced locally and since there were threats of possible boycotts from countries abroad, and because we could not obtain jute from overseas. That was why the Cabinet decided at the time to give this encouragement to the production <span class="col_4763-4764" refersTo="page_0845"/>of sisal. The view was also taken that he could make a contribution by making available his experience and the knowledge he had gained in Tanganyika. In the initial stage, even before the date of the letter received by the hon. member, Mr. Bassiliou was informed that the land could only be used for the cultivation of sisal and related undertakings. At that stage, when the negotiations were taking place, i.e. during in the first half of 1964, matters had deteriorated to such an extent in Tanganyika that there were doubts as to whether Mr. Bassiliou would be able to transfer his heavy equipment and capital to this country. The lessee pointed out that he was experiencing problems in this regard. Hon. members know what the circumstances were at the time. He pointed out that the deforestation and the development of the land would require substantial capital expenditure.</p>

<p>He has done very little.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It was also a well-known fact that it would take several years before any income would be derived from the proposed newly planted sisal plantation. Under these circumstances Mr. Bassiliou requested permission in 1964 for cultivating in the interim certain other crops, including sugar, which would provide him with an income to live on as well as capital for the further development of the property. Mr. Bassiliou was also desirous of taking a certain Mr. Papanicolaou into the undertaking as a partner, since at that stage this person had been connected with a sisal undertaking for many years. That was in 1963. After consideration and recommendation by the then Land Board, it was approved on 14th May, 1964, that <i>inter alia</i> the lessee be permitted to take in one partner for the purpose of cultivating crops other than sisal, but that the department reserved the right to determine the nature and extent of such crops&#x2014;to cultivate 97,1246 ha of sugar cane, subject to the department&#x2019;s right to withdraw this permission at any time&#x2014;and that the term of lease would commence on 1st February, 1964. An agreement of lease to the satisfaction of both parties was concluded on 22nd July, 1964, after the lessee had since 1st February, 1964, been engaged in carrying out the necessary deforestation. The hon. member for Zululand was also informed to this effect in the letter&#x2014;the letter he put away for eight years in order to try to stir up a scandal in regard to this situation tonight. Subsequent to that no further representations were made by Mr. Cadman on this matter, but as a result of representations by other bodies and persons an amended agreement was concluded with the lessee during February, 1967, in terms of which 809 ha of the land on which part of the natural Dukuduku forest had been established, was withdrawn from the agreement of lease. The 809 ha which was involved originally, was subsequently withdrawn and in substitution of it 607 ha of land was placed at the disposal of the lessee. In other words, at that stage he received 200 ha less. The hon. member for South Coast will recall that at the time he still made representations for the preservation of the forests in that area. It was also agreed that, because the extent of the land had been reduced by 200 ha, the term of lease of 20 years would be extended by five years in order to compensate for the fact that less and poorer land had been offered in substitution. During 1965 another amendment was effected to the agreement of lease by mutual agreement, an amendment in terms of which the State, for a period of at least the first six years, surrendered its right to suspend the production of sugar at any time. The reason why we had to deviate from it, is that the mill to which the sugar was to be supplied, could not receive the sugar if the period were fixed at six years. They wanted a longer term in order to arrange their affairs. This agreement was made to enable the lessee to supply sugar cane for the purpose of acquiring additional working capital. During 1967 Mr. Bassiliou suddenly died in a car accident, and permission was granted to his partner, Mr. Papanicolaou, to take over at a compensation of R35 668,00 the interests of the estate in the lease, i.e. 55 per cent of it, which were not held by the latter but belonged to Bassiliou. As a result of various amendments to the agreement of lease, which was still to be registered pending the survey of the land, as well as the cessions that had taken place and the occurrence of certain other essential amendments, it was decided that a new contract of lease should rather be concluded with Mr. Papanicolaou. This step was then to serve to facilitate the registration of the new agreement. The following amendments were effected at the time: The description of the leased land was laid down in the new contract, the exchange of <span class="col_4765-4766" refersTo="page_0846"/>the 806 ha for the 607 ha. The date of commencement was changed from 1st February, 1968, and the term of lease was reduced to 21 years, since four years of the previous contract had already expired at the time. The term of lease was therefore reduced from the original 25 years to 21 years. The fixed period during which sugar could be cultivated was extended from six years to 12 years for the reason I mentioned, and also to provide the mills with security. A condition was added in terms of which the lessee was granted the right to cultivate other crops on land which was unsuitable for sisal, and also to utilize the pasture on the land. Now, Sir, at that stage an investigation was once again conducted on the farm in order to see how the new agreement was being implemented. Now you must appreciate, Sir, that it happened in the meantime that we had a complete over-production in the sisal industry in South Africa. It happened that these lessees could not get their machinery and implements from Tanganyika. It was essential for them to clear their land, and there was a tremendous drop in the price of sisal, so much so that the sisal industry finds itself in very great difficulties today. The investigation that was conducted towards the end of last year and the beginning of this year proved that the lessee had planted bananas on 24 ha. With the recent floods they had there, more than half of those 24 ha of bananas were flooded and destroyed. This is the good banana land to which the hon. member referred. The land on which the bananas were planted, is low-lying and hardly suitable for that kind of cultivation. Of the 97 ha of sugar cane that was planted, 15 ha failed because of drought conditions. 182 ha of sisal has been established. An area of 607 ha has been deforested and cleared and partially planted with sisal; at the moment sisal is being planted on the rest of this area.</p>

<p>The lessee also had his problems. The cost of deforesting and clearing such an undertaking is tremendously high. In addition to this the lessee was continually faced with capital problems, because of the fact that they could not bring into this country their heavy capital equipment from Tanganyika, now Tanzania. The 607 ha were nevertheless cleared and deforested, and sisal cultivation has already been established on a large portion of that area, and, as I have said, they are engaged in planting more sisal. Owing to representations that have been received, a large portion of the land had to be withdrawn from leasing and other land, poorer in quality, had to be given in exchange. In other words, those 809 ha which had been withdrawn were replaced by 607 ha of land which was poorer in quality. The reason why this lessee was permitted to plant sugar cane, was that it had become clear that he would experience capital problems owing to circumstances which were quite beyond his control, and subsequently he was granted permission to put 97 ha under sugar cane cultivation. Initially this permission was granted on condition that it could be withdrawn at any time. However, a temporary concession of this nature still did not enable the lessee to obtain financial assistance. For this reason it was decided to permit him to cultivate sugar for a period of not less than six years. This period still did not meet the requirements of the mills and the sugar industry&#x2014;not the Minister of Economic Affairs. As this body has to plan ahead and is therefore not favourably disposed to granting sugar quotas or financial assistance to persons allowed to cultivate sugar on a loose footing &#x2026; In this regard I may just mention that in the course of the first five years the lessee had to invest R52 000 in order to get the sugar plantation going. For instance, he had to pay R40 000 for a share in the mills in order to qualify as a producer who may be a supplier to the Umfolozi Mills. Under these circumstances he was subsequently permitted to produce sugar for a period of at least 12 years. This whole matter of the leasing of the land and the reasons why it was leased, was discussed fully by the Cabinet; it was a Cabinet decision which was conveyed to the Cabinet by my predecessor. It was circumstances prevailing at the time which required South Africa to expand its sisal production. Here we had persons who were familiar with sisal production in East Africa <span class="col_4767-4768" refersTo="page_0847"/>and who were prepared to come here and to carry on with it subject to certain conditions relating to assistance. Circumstances proved that these people could not get their equipment and that their financial costs were higher than had been anticipated, and under these circumstances these concessions were made to them, i.e. to use the land for other purposes, subject to restrictions. In the meantime, as I have said, 800 ha of that land was withdrawn subsequent to representations made by the hon. member sitting over there, and he received less land for it and the contract of lease was adapted subject to those conditions. Now the hon. member says that one of the ex-officials of the department is living on that land at the moment. There are expensive houses on that land. The lessee may employ any person he wishes. The Oppenheimer Company employs many people who are in the Public Service. Has any person ever talked about it and said that in bygone days he did something of that nature from that organization&#x003F; Why does the hon. member now try to cast a reflection of dishonesty, or whatever it may be, in regard to the leasing of this land&#x003F; I pointedly want to ask the hon. member a question &#x2026;</p>

This also forms part of the Boer-hate story to which my friend referred. The hon. member wants to discredit me, but unfortunately he missed the point because I was not responsible &#x2026; [Interjections.] Unfortunately he made that mistake. Unfortunately he forgot that the transaction had occurred 10 or 12 years ago. Unfortunately he forgot that it was eight years ago that he had received a letter in which the situation was explained. Unfortunately he conveniently forgot all these things. The few amendments that were effected to the contract, had been envisaged by him in this letter at the time.

<p>Because he usually looks fairly respectable.

<p>During the same period I captured two safe U.P. seats for the National Party. There were times when he made progress and times when I made progress.

That was also part of Mr. Strauss&#x2019;s work; once again a kind of parallel development. Ten years after he had taken over from Mr. Strauss, he sat here with 37 seats&#x2014; after he had started with 63 which he had inherited from Mr. Strauss in this Parliament. [Interjections.] In 1958 I, too, took over from Mr. Strauss. I started with the division of Agricultural Economics and Marketing, and I was given the whole Department of Agriculture, as well as two other divisions of other departments which had been handled at the time by two other Ministers of those departments.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, since the hon. the Minister of Agriculture should have replied to the hon. member for Zululand, and because his reply was completely unsatisfactory, he thought the best tactics would be to act in a way that has characterised the entire debate thus far, i.e. to come along with lighting conductors. The hon. the Minister did not focus his attention on the relevant points raised by the hon. member for Zululand, but defended himself chiefly by offending the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. The hon. the Minister thought he was tremendously clever in telling the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that they entered politics more or less at the same time and that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition had lost seats. The hon. the Minister had the safe False Bay seat, but the hon. the Prime Minister and his party in the Cape thought fit to take him from this safe seat and put him in the Senate where he represents the Coloureds. The hon. the Minister of Agriculture says that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has not yet had any success, but as far as I can remember the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has never been asked to resign by any single newspaper in South Africa, much less his own newspapers. According to him this hon. Minister has now had 12 years of success in the Department of Agriculture, and during this time the farmers of South Africa have vanished from the rural areas one after another. During his period of office the Agliotti scandal occurred. At one stage the hon. the Minister&#x2014;he was a director of <i>Dagbreek</i> at the time&#x2014;was asked to resign. For example, <i>Die Burger</i> requested it. Why do they ask the hon. the Minister of Agriculture to resign&#x003F; Because this afternoon and this evening he has again given us an example of how he does not have any thoughts of his own. He does not have his own interpretation of what is happening in his department. He simply had to quote what his department dictated the situation to be in connection with this case. The hon. gentleman is so out of touch with affairs in his own department that he must quote to us what happened. I now want to ask the hon. the Minister a few questions about this case. This land, which was originally State land and was leased to Mr. Bassiliou &#x2026; Is that correct or not&#x003F; In the first place I want to ask the hon. gentleman whether that request came before the Select Committee on State-owned Land&#x2014;yes or no.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member may get his Deputy to answer the question. That is the first question I am asking him. Then I have a second question in connection with the gist of the hon. member for Zululand&#x2019;s argument. When the land was initially advertised for leasing, was it to let for a certain purpose. I am now putting my question to the hon. the Minister and to the Deputy Minister who is going to reply to it: When Mr. Bassiliou died and the next lessee took over, was it not this department&#x2019;s duty to re-advertise that land for leasing&#x003F; In the meantime the whole purpose for which the land was to have been leased changed completely. In the second place, as the hon. member for Zululand said, certain requirements were laid down. He asked whether all those requirements were met.</p>

<p>Of course I was listening properly. The hon. member for Zululand stated the position very clearly. If the members of the public were originally aware of the purpose for which this land would have been used, there would not only have been one or two people interested in this land.

<p>And that is the great soldier on that side speaking. The hon. gentleman has now seen fit to begin again with the old story that on this side there is contempt and hate for the Afrikaner. Actually, the hon. the Minister of Defence is not angry at the Opposition; actually, he is not angry at the so-called elements on this side that hate the Afrikaner, but do you know, Sir, who he is angry at&#x003F; He is actually angry at the Oudtshoorn electorate. The hon. gentleman knows that the Oudtshoorn electorate is not interested in the tales of hate of the hon. the Minister; they are really interested in the bread and butter questions of South Africa. After 24 years this Government has now shown us that they are not able to solve the question facing the South African people and that is why the hon. gentleman has only one answer, and that is to tell the Afrikaner that his position, his culture and his language are in danger. Sir, the reason why that hon. Minister adopts such an attitude is a simple one. He does it because he does not have an answer for the questions South Africa is faced with today. When the Oudtshoorn election is past, that hon. member and his companions will be laughing up their sleeves at the sentimental susceptibility of the Afrikaner, because they are playing a game here. They are playing a game to exploit the Afrikaner&#x2019;s sentiment and his emotions for their political purposes. Up to a certain stage they achieved success in those endeavours, but <span class="col_4773-4774" refersTo="page_0850"/>the hon. the Minister and his companions on that side are completely out of touch with the modern, young Afrikaner of today who firstly wants to be a South African rather than an Afrikaner. He does not need to ask me whether that is the case; he only has to look at the surveys conducted by <i>Rapport</i> during the past fourteen days. Let him look at the surveys conducted in Pretoria. Let him look at the surveys conducted in Stellenbosch.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Newton Park referred to the Afrikaner sentiment and emotions which we are supposedly exploiting, with reference to the speech made by the hon. the Minister of Defence. The hon. member is making a very big mistake. The hon. the Minister of Defence has every right, just as I and every Afrikaans-speaking person in South Africa has the right, to wonder whether we will ever again, if the Opposition should come into power, hear a Budget presented in Afrikaans here again.

<p>The aspirant Minister of Finance on that side has never made a speech in Afrikaans in this House.

To my mind the clearest evidence that hon. members on that side are in fact exploiting matters of this kind, is the following: Why has the hon. member for Newton Park never yet levelled the accusation at this side of the House that we are a lot of Free Masons&#x003F; Do you want clearer evidence than that&#x003F; Why should they always be picking on the Broederbond, an Afrikaans organization, while Freemasonry is never dragged in by the hair here&#x003F; For various reasons, Sir.

<p>It is not necessary. We shall give the hon. member a Select Committee if he asks for one. Twelve years ago, when sisal was a completely unknown product which had to be boosted because South Africa had a shortage of sisal, a contract was drawn up and tenders were called for, for the sole purpose of sisal production. What happened then&#x003F; Here we had a man, down from Tanganyika, a man who had all the knowhow, all the capital and all the machinery. All the departments were consulted and eventually, after long consideration, it was decided, for the sake of the industry, to give this man the lease. After a while it was realized that there was no future for sisal production and the lease was in due course changed.

<p>&#x2026; and he comes along here and says today that all State-owned land which is leased, is referred to the Select Committee on State-owned Land. Have you ever heard such an absurdity&#x003F; In other words the Select Committee will have to be a full-time body, for we lease land every day. The hon. member does not understand the mechanics of the Department of Agriculture. The hon. member says that the land was advertised in any case, and he asked why we did not advertise it again. The hon. the Minister told him emphatically that Bassiliou had a partner, Papanicolaou. Bassiliou had an accident; Papanicolaou then came along and said that he would pay R35 000 into the estate of Bassiliou to enable him to take over the entire contract, with a few amendments, because he could no longer make a success of sisal production. Is there anything wrong with that&#x003F; The contract was then revised. The hon. member would like to spread a little gossip in regard to the fact that Venter is now living in that House. He told it here with acclamation; you could see that he was enjoying himself to the tips of his toes, but he will not get anywhere with this story, Sir. [Interjection.] We are now talking about gossipmongering; hon. members on that side say that we gossip. What happened here this evening&#x003F; The hon. member wants to know why Venter is on that land. Venter was an official of the Department of Agriculture.</p>

<p>Then he retired. Papanicolaou then asked whether the house that Bassiliou had built before his death could be sub-let, because the house was standing empty. Permission to do this was granted, and then it was discovered that he was an official. When the matter was investigated further, the department decided that Venter could just as well continue staying there, because he was no longer in the service of the department. What is Venter today&#x003F; That the hon. member will not tell us. He is today a manager of the farm for Papanicolaou at R200 per month, and he says that he will vacate that house at any time if necessary, and that he will leave the farm.

In other words, if he had 400 sheep and he withdraws 300, he will have to look after 100 sheep for the rest of his life.

<p>Before I go further, there is a personal matter I should like to put straight. I think it gives us an indication of how hon. members opposite and senior Ministers handle certain matters. Yesterday in this debate the hon. the Minister of Community Development thought fit to abuse me for, <i>inter alia,</i> having slandered South Africa&#x2019;s name overseas. In order to motivate this&#x2014;and I am quoting an extract from his Hansard of yesterday&#x2014;he said the following:</p>

<block name="quote">In the motion of no confidence the hon. member for Hillbrow said that here in South Africa we no longer have single freedom left.</block>

<p>I have taken this from Hansard and I am going to quote his exact words to hon. members : &#x201C;We no longer have a single freedom left&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Then I asked him by way of interjection to give the reference. The hon. the Minister replied&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I shall give it to the hon. member at a later stage. I did not write down the number of the Hansard column. The fact remains that he said that we no longer have a single freedom left in South Africa.</block>

<p>Sir, you will see that the hon. the Minister repeated three times that I had allegedly <span class="col_4787-4788" refersTo="page_0857"/>said that we in South Africa no longer had a single freedom left.

<p>If we on this side needed any indication or were looking for any proof of the fact that the Government really is in trouble, yesterday and today gave us not only sufficient but also tragic proof of it. If the Government is in trouble, when it has its back to the wall, when it is on the defensive, the reaction is always characteristic. The first thing that happens is that a smoke-screen has to be put up to conceal their vulnerability, and we have seen how this is done. Secondly, the storm-troops must be sent in; we know all of them. Usually they are those who make the most noise and the least positive contributions. What are their tactics then&#x003F; After all, we have seen over the years what they are. In the first place it is the &#x201C;Black peril&#x201D;.

<p>Locally there is a new militancy among our non-White groups which is alarming. If we disregard these early warnings, we shall still rue it. The one ray of light is that there is a new flexibility in our political situation. This is not only reflected in election results, but throughout the country there are people who are talking and feeling this way. Now we again have the characteristic reaction of the governing party. The small enlightened group insists that the Government should have surveys in depth conducted in order to find out what has gone wrong. But the larger group, which is in charge, says: &#x201C;No, it is not necessary.&#x201D; The Government must merely spruce up the economy a bit before the next election; it must merely grant salary increases again; it must merely scare the people further with terrorists and communists; it must merely try to mobilize Afrikaner sentiment again and beat the tribal drums as they have done in the past two days, and then a miracle will happen and the picture of 1966 will repeat itself. But, Sir, this is a dangerous approach, because it estranges us from reality and leaves completely unsolved the major problems which the entire population wants solved.</p>

<p>I want to tell the Government that we have also had surveys conducted. Normally I would not convey the results of these surveys to them, but because it is in the national interest I shall do so. The voters of South Africa are indisputably turning their backs on the Government. This is not only because of the Government&#x2019;s inability to combat inflation, it is not only because of the maladministration, which has almost become proverbial now; it is not only because of the arrogance of those in power; it is also because their so-called policy, their so-called programme of principles&#x2014;the positive part of it&#x2014;is collapsing and its negative part is landing us in ever-increasing difficulties. It is true that our people are put off by cases such as those of Marendaz and Agliotti, because to them these are symbolic of a malady which lies much deeper. It is also true that our people are no longer prepared to chase after phantoms and to set off on a mad hunt for the end of the rainbow. This is the change. A new realism is discernible among the voters of South Africa. They are not interested in policy alone, but also in <span class="col_4791-4792" refersTo="page_0859"/>the practicability of a policy. In addition, the voters feel instinctively that adjustments must be made today, but they also know that this Government is not able to make such adjustments, because any substantial adjustment will clash with their basic political dogma. What is worse is that a credibility gap has arisen, because the voters no longer believe the Government. Recently <i>Die Burger</i> expressed it like this: <i>Die Burger</i> said that the people no longer believed that the Government was serious about its policy; they no longer believed that what was being said was going to be done, could be done or would be done. A credibility gap has arisen. [Interjections.] Surely the hon. the Minister has already made his speech. If he can get another turn, he may speak again.</p>

<p>Because of these factors there is a new interest today in the views and standpoints of this side of the House. It is for this reason that I should like to indicate the differences in approach between that side of the House and this side of the House today. These differences cover the wide spectrum of our national attitude, but because so much has been said on the other hand about the race problem, I should like to start with that.</p>

<p>In the first place it must be noted that we do not come to the people of South Africa with a slogan or with a war-cry. Apartheid is such a war-cry. It has been in existence for a quarter of a century already, but there is very little which can give a positive indication of what has been achieved. It is like a massive cardboard castle which is crumbling now. Recently one of their own newspapers in the Transvaal launched a competition in which it invited its readers to give a definition of apartheid. It reported that it received hundreds of entries, but it also received hundreds of definitions. Apartheid is one of those concepts which can mean all things to all people. Up to a certain point this was an advantage, but now that our people are expecting action, it has become a disadvantage. We do not come to the people of South Africa with a dogma either. We are not handicapped by a dogma. We are in the favourable position that we will be able to tackle first problems first. The first thing we shall do will be to reduce the race tensions in South Africa, to desensitize the situation in order then to lay the foundations, in consultation with others concerned in the matter, for long-term and peaceful co-existence. We do not come with a dogma. We look at the realities of the South African situation. What is the reality of our race situation today&#x003F; I should like to summarize it as follows. In the first place South Africa is a pluralistic society in which quite a number of different groups may be distinguished on different levels of development.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from><person refersTo="hansard_za">*An HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>You are on the lowest level.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>In the second place there is the White group with its exceptional level of development in the cultural, economic and political spheres, which is exceeded in number by the non-White group. In the third place, while opportunities should be created for meaningful political participation for all groups, the White group, which has the political power, demands that the survival of Western values and standards should be guaranteed. In the fourth place our economic progress in South Africa is based on the contributions made by the Whites as well as the non-Whites. We have one economic system, and its fragmentation will lead to our total economic downfall. In the fifth place, since pressure from outside is building up against us, it is essential that the breeding grounds for communism such as poverty, ignorance and the denial of fundamental human rights be removed. We must create the situation where all the inhabitants of this country will resist the foreign intruder. There should be a common loyalty towards our country of birth.</p>

<p>If we accept this, how then do we approach this situation in the face of these <span class="col_4793-4794" refersTo="page_0860"/>fundamental realities of South Africa&#x003F; Since we have to deal with various groups such as is the case here, there are three levels where people have contact with one another and where conflict may arise. The first is the social or cultural level. Here we accept that every community in South Africa has the right to its own identity. In addition, we accept that separation as a principle may be helpful if it is established in order to eliminate hitches and points of friction. Then I also want to say immediately that separation merely for the purpose of separating as a dogma, as a doctrinal obsession, becomes a point of friction in itself. This is what has happened here. A great deal is said about apartheid and petty apartheid. I do not know how helpful those terms are to us. I like using the term &#x201C;unnecessary apartheid&#x201D;. We can give hundreds of examples of unnecessary apartheid.</p>

</speech>

</speech>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>Not only does it lead to bitterness in South Africa, but it has also made us the outcast of the entire civilized world. As far as this point is concerned, our approach is that where separation is necessary for the continued existence of a particular community, we shall regard it as just. Where it can be seen as a symbol of suppression and where it may harm the goodwill which has been built up among the races over the years, we shall remove it from the Statutes relentlessly. In the second place we accept the principle of personal or local choice. Why should exactly the same treatment be meted out to all&#x003F; As we see the position in respect of social and cultural matters, groups and persons will have the right to decide for themselves how to act towards their fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>The second level on which we have contact with one another is the economic one. In this regard we immediately accept the inter-dependence of all our groups. As Prof. Tomlinson said, we have only one economic system. We do not have a White economy, a Brown economy and a number of Black economies. We do not have White money, Brown money and Black money in this country. Therefore there is an economic foundation which we must all serve. Furthermore, we are opposed to the Government&#x2019;s &#x201C;poor but White&#x201D; philosophy. We realize that the poorer we become the less we shall be able to assert ourselves.</p>

<p>If we continue with this &#x201C;poor but White&#x201D; philosophy, we shall all end up as poor Whites. To us the most important factor in the economic sphere is to raise the standard of living of all our population groups. Consequently we shall abolish any measures existing at present which place an artificial ceiling on the economic development of certain groups. The White man&#x2019;s protection lies in his better training and as long as we have a growing economy, there is no danger. Then there is no danger, because at present we need four non-Whites to create one employment opportunity for one White. It will be said that this means economic integration. We do not see it as such. It is economic co-operation. It is the whole basis of our existence at present, and will have to continue as it is.</p>

<p>In the third place we come to the political level. In this regard our standpoint is that where one has such a heterogeneous community such as we have in South Africa, the federal system is the only constitutional model which makes it possible to have decentralization of political participation, but which nevertheless also ensures co-ordination of political activity on the highest level. Every time we say this, we find an absolute obsession with the franchise on the opposite side of this House. All they ask is who is going to vote, where they are going to vote and how they are going to vote. Development is not based purely on the franchise, and this is the very point which they lose sight of. Under the federal system one is not concerned with the counting of heads. It is under the unitary system that one has to count heads. Under the federal system one has 101 checks and balances, and here I can give many examples which have nothing to do with votes. However, let us start with the franchise. The franchise is exercised on three levels.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>In the first place the franchise is exercised on the local level and here, I think, we do not have <span class="col_4795-4796" refersTo="page_0861"/>any great difficulty, because on the local level every community must have the right to establish its own locally elected council which may deal with its own local matters. The second level is the regional or communal level. Here too the problem is not such a major one, because the Whites already have their regional council in the form of the provincial councils. We shall not only retain them, but also strengthen them. The Coloureds and the Indians have their communal councils. These already exist. We differ with the Government in the sense that we shall make them fully elected bodies. We shall grant them powers, real powers, in regard to matters in which they are intimately concerned. Then we differ with the government about the urban Bantu, the detribalized Bantu. They do not accept them as a permanent group. Apparently they will disappear in some or other miraculous way. We accept them as a reality. Consequently we shall recognize this reality by giving them their own communal council on the same basis as those of the Coloureds and the Indians and by giving them the right to buy their own houses in their own residential area.</p>

<p>Oh no, sit down, man. Then we come to the homelands. Our standpoint is that the Bantu homelands are cultural, economic and political growth-points for certain ethnic groups. But having said that, I also say that we regard their economic development as of far greater priority than their political development at this stage. We have to deal with impoverished areas here. In the economic sense they are economic depression areas. We support Prof. Tomlinson&#x2019;s finding, i.e. that their economic carrying capacity should be raised and that this can be done only by means of controlled private White capital investment in these areas. As far as their political envelopment is concerned, we grant them the greatest possible degree of self-government, but we do not regard it as being in their interests nor in the interests of the greater South African whole that they become fully independent and may break away from South Africa. When we say this, we are told that we are verkramp, but you know, Sir, the greatest liberalist in the world is probably Bertrand Russell.

<p>This is the standpoint we accept. But on the opposite side such a fuss is always made about the right of self-determination. These Bantu uniits, we are told, must have the right of self-determination. But self-determination is an indivisible concept. You cannot tell them you may have self-determination only in your own area and on your own. If you accept the right of self-determination, you must also accept that they have the right to insist that they should have their political rights here in White South Africa. If you do not accept this, you are making a farce of the entire concept of self-determination.</p>

<p>In the third place, one has the national level. All we have said is that as long as these areas, regions or communities constitutionally form part of South Africa, they should have representation in this supreme authority. This is elementary fairness. But we have also said that we shall create the machinery to consult with all the other population groups for the full development of our federal system.

<p>Mr Speaker, I have always regarded myself as a businessman. When I listened to the speech of the hon. member for Hillbrow, I felt that I could make R1 million if I could buy him at the price I think he is worth and sell him at the price he thinks he is worth. I am not impressed with the tremor in his voice and the oratory of the hon. member for Hillbrow. I have been in this House for many years and I am not impressed with this showmanship.

Sir, South Africans have not forgotten that, but hon. members opposite want to forget it. The advice they got was that they must forget about their dirty past. I want to speak to the hon. member for South Coast, and I want to read out a few things that he said about the South African Republic. The idea of the Republic was to get away from the idea of the monarchy. What did the Leader of the Opposition do&#x003F; He made it a Party issue He said that the United Party was going to fight the Republic tooth and nail.

<block name="quote">At one stage in his speech Mr. Mitchell said that when the Prime Minister was getting so provocative in his reply to the Republican Bill debate in Parliament and asked him whether he intended to lead a rebellion, he had felt like saying, &#x201C;Yes, I am.&#x201D;</block>

<p>But, of course, &#x201C;I did not say so.&#x201D; Then the report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<p>I think it was then later changed to &#x201C;March, march, march!&#x201D; That was that Party&#x2019;s attitude towards the South African Republic. [Interjections].

[Interjections.] And then the other thing was to consolidate the English-speaking vote, as they had it in the past.

<p>I shall come to Marendaz and that Minister. He will find out that Diesels will not carry him one single yard except to his undoing and ruination. He may just as well keep quiet. That hon. Minister&#x2019;s way of conducting a debate will cause me to call for the appointment of a Select Committee in terms of the rules of the House to investigate his conduct with Marendaz. If he is an honourable man, which I take him to be, he will get up and he himself will call for such a Committee to clear his name which has been besmirched by himself and his conduct.</p>

<p>Do you see, Mr. Speaker, you hear &#x201C;hear, hear!&#x201D; Do you know from whom one hears &#x201C;hear, hear!&#x201D;&#x003F; One hears it from all those persons whose parents refused to fight on the side of the Boers. All the people who refused to fight against the English would now like to seize the opportunity to fight against the English for once. We who come from families who have already fought against the English, need not fight the battle all over again.</p>

<p>Now, let me start with the hon. the Minister who has just sat down. He was very funny; he said nothing; he was simply very funny. I have come to the conclusion that the old Boers certainly had a nice language, i.e. Afrikaans. It seems to me that hon. member was appointed as Minister <span class="col_4807-4808" refersTo="page_0867"/>only for the &#x201C;sports&#x201D;. He has nothing to do; he was simply appointed for the &#x201C;sports&#x201D;. Small wonder that a certain person, a certain Mrs. Waring, wrote the following in <i>Rapport</i> of 5th Maarch (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The voters are bored with the Government &#x2026;</block>

<p>I take it that they are also bored with the Minister. She went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and this is a natural reaction since no political struggle for life and death is being waged, which would have been able to draw the moths to the flame of the Government.</block>

<p>Would hon. members believe it; would hon. members believe that the people and the wives of Cabinet Ministers are so bored with them that they write such things&#x003F; What does ex-Minisetr P. K. le Roux say&#x003F; He says that the sports policy in particular is causing worry. I do not want to occupy myself with things of that kind. I was deeply hurt when I saw the conduct of Government members on the matter of national unity. I had hoped and believed we were completely past the stage where there could be any difference about national unity. I had believed that every member of this Government desired national unity just as I do and just as the hon. the Minister of Community Development did when he was still in the United Party with me. I had believed that we could continue to heal the breach of the past; I had believed that a new day had dawned under this Prime Minister. I had believed, as the Leader of this House did when he was in the United Party, that we should forget the ugly things of the past and that we should march forward in order to build a new, stronger and sounder South Africa, consisting of Afrikaans-speaking and English-speaking people, with two languages and perhaps with two cultures, but with one mutual allegiance to South Africa. That was what I had hoped. As an Afrikaansspeaking Afrikaner, I want to associate myself once again with what was said in the days of yore, i.e. that the Englishman in this country must cast off his Englishness just as the Afrikaans-speaking Afrikaner must cast off his Afrikaansness. Jointly we must be forged together into one South African nationalism to ensure the welfare of the children of all of us.</p>

<p>I cannot believe in supremacy (<i>baasskap</i>) and in Afrikaner supremacy. Neither can I believe in English supremacy, but I can believe in co-operation and in one common allegiance to one common country, South Africa. If people may be called upon to die for one common country, as was done during the last war, they may also be called upon to be loyal to one common country, as we in the United Party are doing here this evening. Furthermore, if we did not have the support of the National Party during the last war, let us at least get the support of the National Party now. They are the Government now. Let them accept our support now in pledging a common allegiance to South Africa. Whether the party in power is that party or this one, in the near future we shall need everyone who wants to swear allegiance to South Africa. It does not befit the Government to talk as they did here today and to abuse people and to hurt them deeply in their hearts, their souls and their being. That is not right. It does not befit us, and we do not achieve anything whatsoever by doing so. What do we want to achieve&#x003F; Do we want to win an Oudtshoorn election&#x003F; I think any Government or any Opposition can win or lose an election without dragging in matters of this kind. What is the point of it&#x003F; The Bible tells us: &#x201C;For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul&#x003F;&#x201D; We must not hurt the soul of the Afrikaner in the process of trying to catch a small number of votes only&#x2014; the votes of people who can still be incited by the sentiment of the Boer War or by racial hatred. I have always believed, and I still do today, that any party which appeals to the two basest and meanest emotions in man, i.e. hate and fear, will not get very far. It may win, but the country which it is to govern, will lose. It will be <span class="col_4809-4810" refersTo="page_0868"/>of no use to us if that side or this one wins and if South Africa loses. Let South Africa win. What is a political party&#x003F; Political parties come and go, but South Africa remains for all times. Should this not be the approach of anyone calling himself a South African&#x003F;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>No, I believe the Nationalists as well. I believe there are thousands of Nationalists in this country who love South Africa more than they do the National Party. Just go back in the history of the National Party. In every time of crisis this National Party emerged badly from that crisis. Mention one election to me which was won by this National Party in a time of crisis. They have never won an election in a time of crisis. The National Party strongly reminds me of a small poem by Langenhoven, who lived down Oudtshoorn way, in which he said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<p>No, it was not a time of crisis. The crisis was past. The people were released from the gaols. The enemy had been shot dead and crushed. Peace prevailed once more. There were no crises. In 1943 there was a crisis. In 1933 there was a crisis. In 1939 there was a crisis. Where were they then&#x003F;</p>

<p>I do not want to go too far into the past of the whole business. I just want to say this: I listened very attentively to the arguments used here today as well as yesterday. I listened to the way in which accusations were levelled, almost after the style of beating the old racial drum. If we on this side of the House were to take over the Government one day, it would result in a Black South Africa and the future of our children would be in peril once more.</p>
