<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, when we were discussing the Interior Vote yesterday afternoon, there was no opportunity of replying to certain questions put by hon. members in regard to the Public Service Commission. Because the Public Service Commission must control such a large proportion of the activities of the Department of the Interior, I think it is only right that I should say a few things right at the outset of the debate this morning in order to give hon. members the background to these matters. At the outset I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to thank the Public Service Commissioners sincerely for the work they have done in recent years. These people have a very difficult task. Personal contact between them and the officials is not always easy; there is a large gap between them, and it is probably difficult for the Commissioners to carry out their work as they should like to. But in my experience, the work they have done in the past year was of such a nature that I think that on behalf of this House I should convey our thanks to them for what they have done. Furthermore, I think it is necessary on this occasion that we should convey our thanks to the senior officials in the Public Service Commission who have an extremely difficult task which they have performed extremely well in the past year, and as far as I know, in the past as well. One does not want to mention names on such an occasion, but I do think I should mention the <span class="col_8565-8566" refersTo="page_1238"/>name here of the Secretary of the Commission who has been there for many years and who has a very great share in the activities of the Department which falls under him within the Public Service Commission.</p>

<p>Sir, just as a background, I want to mention a few facts to hon. members this morning in order to indicate what we are doing and trying to do in order to improve, as far as possible, the circumstances under which public servants work and which are often sharply criticized. I think it would interest hon. members to hear what has been done for our officials in this regard in the past year. To start with, I want to refer to the great improvements which have been effected in recent years. Hon. members will remember that in 1971 considerable improvements were effected in the Public Service. Great improvements were also effected in 1969, as well as in 1965. During this period of five years, the salaries of public servants were increased by 34 per cent, which works out at an increase of an average of 7 per cent per year. However, together with this, it should be taken into account that many additional improvements have been effected over this period, and if this additional improvement were to be calculated in terms of cash, it would have increased the average salary increase of 7 per cent per year considerably. Then, of course, there are also conditions of service which have been improved, of which hon. members are perhaps not aware because not much publicity was given to it. In the third place, we have what is known as fringe benefits which have recently been given to public servants. I just want to mention a few of these fringe benefits, because I believe they should also be taken into account in establishing to what extent public servants are better off today than they were in the past. In the first place, there is the question of the pension gratuity. One of the hon. members mentioned it here yesterday and asked what was being done in this regard. Men who in the past received a smaller pension gratuity on their retirement than women, are now receiving the same as women. In other words, in this respect men and women are being treated on an equal footing. Furthermore, for the first time employees may become members of their provident funds immediately. In the past they had to complete two years&#x2019; service before they could join this fund and enjoy the benefits attached to it. Furthermore, a formula has been worked out according to which additional pensionable service may be purchased by the payment of arrear contributions. The formula has been made considerably more favourable in the past year. Then, the question of full holiday leave credit was also mentioned here by one of the hon. members. Unfortunately I cannot deal individually with all the various points raised here by hon. members, because naturally, in a debate such as this, a large number of minor points are raised. On the death of a public servant, holiday leave is now paid out as a gratuity to his dependants without any limit. Furthermore, it has been decided to introduce a system whereby a leave gratuity is paid out automatically to employees according to their date of appointment. In addition, the subsistence and field allowances, which hon. members may consider to be of lesser importance, were increased considerably during the past year. This, of course, has also affected the total income of our officials. Furthermore, the merit system has been improved, and the medical aid scheme has also been extended. In our opinion it is probably one of the best schemes in the country today. There is no doubt that this scheme is comparable to the best medical aid schemes known to us. I think our officials have reason to be grateful for the fact that provision is now being made for something which they have requested over a period of many years. As far as financial assistance in respect of housing is concerned, Sir, it will interest you to hear that in the past year alone, 12 100 100-per-cent housing loans have been granted to officials.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Before the hon. the Minister leaves the question of housing loans to public servants, may I ask him whether the limit of R15 000 has been raised or whether it still applies.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, it has not been raised as yet. It has been under consideration for some time.</p>

<p>*The holiday savings bonus which has been introduced, has been welcomed by public servants throughout the country. This is also something our officials have been requesting for many years. Another interesting test which will interest you, was carried out in the past few years. It was carried out in co-operation with our Public Servants&#x2019; Association and the Commission <span class="col_8567-8568" refersTo="page_1239"/>itself, and its aim was to determine what the productivity of our officials in South Africa was and whether it was at all comparable to that of other countries. It is often said by way of criticism that the productivity in the Public Service in South Africa is poor and we felt that these tests should be carried out so that we could have an indication, in any case in as far as something like this is possible, of what the potential of our officials is. A team of our most senior men went abroad on two occasions. First they visited 11 countries, and subsequently they visited three more in order to determine exactly what the position was there and how this could be measured. It was found that the increase in productivity as regards the Public Service in South Africa between the years 1963 and 1969, which is a fairly long period, namely seven years, was 64 per cent. This was the increase in productivity, as compared to an increase of 54 per cent in the productivity in ten of the greatest industrial countries abroad. Amongst those countries in which the tests were carried out, were the U.S.A., the United Kingdom, West Germany, France and Japan. I think this is particularly interesting to know in regard to a country such as Japan which claims that its productivity is probably the highest in the world. Of course, many factors have contributed towards this. In the first place, the private sector was tested, i.e. the productivity in the private sector, and not only in the Public Service, but it was also determined that the Public Service itself in a country, and particularly in South Africa, must be able to make a considerable contribution to the productivity of the private sector to produce a percentage of 63 per cent over a period of seven years. This study group determined, <i>inter alia</i>, that an economic factor should be taken into account, a factor which is in fact very important, namely the question of the number of working hours. The question of how the working hours of our Public servants compares with those of other countries was put to me in the Other Place and was also mentioned here yesterday. The figures we have obtained from abroad in the past few months, are interesting. South Africa is one of the few countries where the public servants still work a 40 hour week. In general it is 40 hours, but it goes up to 48 hours per week. This is extremely high in comparison with other countries I want to mention. In the case of Australia, the working hours are 36&#x00BE; per week spread over 5&#x00BD; days. In the case of London it is 36 hours and in the rest of Britain it is 37 hours, in West Germany it is 35 and in the U.S.A. 37&#x00BD;. In other words, the figure in South Africa is the highest as far as this is concerned. The group which carried out this investigation, also found that in almost all the other Western countries pressure is now being brought to bear on the Governments to reduce the number of working hours; to reduce everything above 40 hours to the level which is regarded there as a reasonable average, i.e. 35 hours per week.</p>

<p>Can you tell us how the productivity is measured?</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is a very technical procedure. It is a very long list. I could give you the details I have with the greatest of pleasure, but it would of course be a very difficult task to deal with it now. Many factors must be taken into consideration. Of course, something of this nature cannot be one hundred per cent scientific either. It cannot be done in the same way in the private sector or in the Public Service.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>May I put a question? The hon. the Minister said that percentage-wise the production had increased. Can he also say that the actual productivity is greater than in the other countries? I am referring to the productivity itself, not merely the improvement which has been effected.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I have no figures as far as that is concerned. I think one of the other hon. members will probably deal with that matter. My figures extend only over the period from 1963 to 1969. At the moment I do not know what the position is, but I think one of the other hon. members would be able to give you those details.</p>

<p>Considerable criticism was levelled here yesterday as well as on previous occasions at the methods used in recruiting officials. In general the Public Service Commission is satisfied that these methods produce the average result, or an average result which should be regarded as satisfactory in comparison with the losses one has to recoup, and with the position in other countries as well. Perhaps it is not necessary to go into details in respect of this matter. All I want to say is that in spite of these small gains <span class="col_8569-8570" refersTo="page_1240"/>which have been made over the past few years in regard to the recruiting of officials, it is possible, of course, to reduce one&#x2019;s work by means of certain methods and to let a smaller number of persons handle it. I think this is in fact the major object of this particular investigation.</p>

<p>As far as the Whites are concerned, there is a particular fact I want to mention, namely that we are still assisting the non-White groups to a large extent by seconding some of our officials to the non-White sections, namely the Bantu, the Indians and the Coloureds. This is being done because we are trying to fill many of the important positions, especially among the Bantu, as we have done in recent years in the Transkei, from which we are gradually beginning to withdraw them again, but now we are gradually transferring the same services to the other Bantu homelands as well. We are helping the Coloureds and the Indians in the same way. We have to second a total of approximately 3 400 Whites to those groups or governments, which does not have a prejudicial effect, I will not say that, on the availability of White officials, but which does nevertheless have an overall effect which must be taken into account. We are using some of our better employees there, with the particular idea in mind that we should help those population groups on the highest levels to establish patterns and to be able to manage the more technical and professional services which they cannot do by themselves in the beginning. In an attempt to improve the manpower position and particularly as a result of this loss of 3 400 professional people as well, we are trying to recruit more women to the Public Service. It is quite interesting to know that we have a very high percentage of women in the Public Service in South Africa. It compares more favourably with other countries than one would think. For example, we have a number of women who are employed in a permanent capacity. There are more than 9 100 of them, all of whom occupy salaried posts, as opposed to 41 000 men. This gives a total of 62 000 officials who may be grouped under the salaried group. As far as the number of women is concerned, it means that 33,6 per cent of those people are women, while in a country such as Belgium, only 22 per cent of their people are in the same category. We are also trying to make use of married women as far as possible, for the simple reason that we realize the problem in respect of younger people who marry, leave and do not always have the training and background for particular posts as the married women have. This has led to 52 per cent of the workers in the higher categories in the Public Service being women, as opposed to 48 per cent men. Of these women, 11 per cent are permanent, i.e. they occupy some of the most senior permanent posts in the Public Service. Furthermore, it is the case that a considerable number of these women have already occupied some of the most senior posts. In one case one of these women has become a deputy secretary of a department.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. In the private sector the position of women is not as favourable as it is in the Public Service. The figures which have been analysed, indicate that there is a greater percentage in the Public Service and also that women in the upper income group in the Public Service, earn more than in the case of the private sector. The policy in this regard is that in future, when shortages in the Public Service necessitate it, we shall try to recruit an increasing number of women, even though it may be on the same basis as in some other countries where such women work in a temporary capacity for a short period every day. Of course, it would not be possible for them all to be full-time staff, but some could be used if they made themselves available for parts of the day, which is in fact happening already. We already have approximately 4 000 women in South Africa who are available on a part-time basis, for part of the day, and who can therefore fill the vacancies in that way. As far as part-time units are concerned, I may mention in passing that their number is increasing and that in future we shall concentrate on trying to increase productivity by using them.</p>

<p>&#x2020;In so far as productivity is concerned, I should like to point out that this is one of the main problems which I believe every Western country has. As far as I know, this is one of the greatest problems with <span class="col_8571-8572" refersTo="page_1241"/>which countries have to cope. It is very difficult, of course, as I said initially, to make comparisons between productivity in South Africa and in the rest of the world. The older techniques which we used to increase productivity were drastically changed over the past few years and the number of our senior men who we sent overseas found that it was possible to introduce a system more compatible with circumstances in South Africa and which in the end proved in fact to be very fruitful. The inspectorate of the Public Service Commission later succeeded in evolving a scheme of this nature and I think it is worthwhile to inform the Committee that this new technique which was introduced, and called the KTE technique, is today considered to be one of the foremost in the world. In fact, it is a technique in respect of which particulars are being called for by other countries in the world.</p>

<p>Many advantages were discovered during the investigation of this new technique with a view to its ultimate introduction. <i>Inter alia</i> it improved the supervision over people in the lower grades; it improved the training of staff and it increased productivity by between 20 per cent and 30 per cent, as we see it. This percentage is a fairly rough estimate and cannot be proved scientifically. Quite remarkable results were achieved as a result of the introduction of this new technique. Where this new technique was not directly linked with bonus incentives, it was applied to approximately 5 000 employees in various categories and in 29 departments and administrations as a whole. Where the new technique was coupled with direct incentives, the results achieved were more or less the following: In the first place, in the case of a bureau of a department, the increase in productivity appeared to be about 60 per cent. In the case of coding divisions of departments there proved to be an increase in productivity of about 100 per cent. These are of course also rough estimates because they cannot be scientifically proved. In the case of the accounts branch of departments there was an increase in productivity of about 45 per cent as a result of the introduction of this particular new technique.</p>

<p>I say again that I do not wish to deal further with the matter of comparisons with other countries, but it does appear as if this technique may in the course of time be widened with the result that it may be accepted by countries which are at present still working on older techniques than we are.</p>

<p>I mention these figures this morning because there has been a great deal of criticism during the past two years on account of the fact that we do not want an investigation into the Public Service. We do not want to appoint a commission of inquiry into what is going on in the Public Service and with a view to inquire whether better methods or more scientific approaches can be introduced. One of the reasons why we do not want to appoint such a commission of inquiry is that it will be very difficult for people who are laymen, like myself, to serve on a commission which investigates the activities of the men who have been busy with this type of work for 10, 15, 20 or 30 years. I think it will be, I shall not say stupid, but quite unwise if one were to appoint a commission as was done in the case of the Centlivres Commission in 1929 &#x2026;</p>

<p>Yes, that is correct. I want to thank the hon. member very much for that.</p>

<p>Those investigations both took place at a time when we did not have these direct communications between countries and when the methods used in different countries were not available to all concerned. Today it is much easier. We do not take a step in respect of anything which we regard as very important, without consulting other countries, getting information from them or sending over a team who can investigate the position <i>in loco</i>. This in itself makes it rather unnecessary to appoint a commission of inquiry.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Is the hon. the Minister not aware that the issue which we have raised is that the Public Servants&#x2019; Association at their annual gatherings during the last few years themselves constantly raised this matter and passed resolutions calling for the appointment of such a commission comprising not only members of the Public Service but also people from outside?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from><span class="col_8573-8574" refersTo="page_1242"/>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I can assure the hon. member that I know all about the particular matter in as far as the association is concerned. One can read <i>The Public Servant</i> every month, the publication which they publish. I attended their congress too and I had many discussions with the Public Servants&#x2019; Association in connection with this particular matter. I have indicated to them that it would not serve any good purpose if one were to appoint a commission of inquiry. In fact, I can tell hon. members that they will not find any reference in any of these Public Service publications to the need for further investigation during the past six months. I think that is a result of the fact that we have put before them the facts as we see them and because of the direct contact we have with all developments in other countries as far as public service work is concerned.</p>

<p>As far as recruiting is concerned, I want to say that this is also a matter which has been raised from time to time. It stands to reason that recruiting in itself and publicity in respect thereof is a matter which is raised on every suitable occasion every year. It has become a hardy annual. I think the replies that we have given in the past cover more or less the same field.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Is there a possibility of increasing the number of bursaries?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I will come to that. I will deal with the question of bursaries in a few minutes. There are five different fronts, as they are called by the Public Service Commission, on which they try to improve recruiting and publicity in respect thereof. Firstly, they naturally concentrate on schools and school-leaving pupils. In 800 of the high schools of South Africa three lecturers are given per year on the prospects in the Public Service. It is interesting, too, to note that they concentrate on the private sector in an endeavour to find people who are interested in public service work. Although they are interested in public service work, these people may have been ignorant about the prospects in the Public Service and after they have been approached, they decide to change their jobs and come over to the Public Service. As far as university students are concerned, I want to say that we have a number of ways in which we approach them. We give lectures at the universities and different types of publicity media are used to inform students of the courses which are open to them in the Public Service and what it offers them. Then we have courses in the Service itself to disseminate information to some of our public servants whom we feel should have this information at their disposal. I do not want to keep the House any longer on this question of advertising media, but I do want to mention that I have a long list here of all the advertising media which are being used today in an effort to recruit as many people as possible for the Public Service. We also make use of films on a large scale. In 1971 more than 200 lectures were given to adult audiences, to women&#x2019;s organizations and other people who were interested. We have also had a number of exhibitions. We made use of film strips, colour slides, photos and so forth in various ways and in various spheres. In general, I think the public is becoming aware of the fact that the Public Service is today offering them much more, not only in the form of direct salaries, but also in respect of all these other matters which I have mentioned. Generally speaking, I think the use of the Press was a very good idea, too. This has been fruitful in the past year, because a number of newspapers were quite keen to help us in publicising articles on the careers which can be followed in the Public Service and the salaries attached to the various posts.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Green Point asked me about the question of bursaries and financial assistance to people in order to make it possible for them to join the Public Service. I can give this House interesting data in this regard. We are doing a fair amount in an attempt to improve the position. In fact, we have six different methods which we use for rendering financial assistance to people who in our opinion have the potential to be used in the Public Service. In fact, we search for the more intelligent people. There is, for example, the payment of class fees, over and above bursaries. This is only one of the things we do. Then we have bursaries not only for part-time study, but also for full-time study. We have schemes for the training of technicians which are financed by the Government. We have financial schemes under which a person&#x2019;s full salary is paid while he is undergoing his training. Then there is the training of people for paramedical services. This in particular is an extremely interesting task, and it would interest the <span class="col_8575-8576" refersTo="page_1243"/>hon. member for Green Point. We are concentrating more and more on rendering financial assistance to people who, in our opinion, can be used in the paramedical sphere. There is a large shortage in this regard.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Whites and non-Whites?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. Members of all four groups may obtain bursaries in respect of any of these categories I have mentioned here. This holds good not only for the Whites, but for all groups. Another interesting example is another scheme we have to ensure that people with legal qualifications are recruited for the Departments of Justice and Bantu Administration and Development by rendering financial assistance to people for their training. We are doing this because we foresee a large shortage arising in that department. With the development of our Bantu homelands and the emancipation of the other groups, more legal aid is required for establishing a good pattern in a Bantu homeland, or wherever. More people with legal training are required for this purpose. At present more than 770 people have received bursaries merely for this particular matter I have just mentioned, i.e. for training in law. The hon. member for Green Point asked me what the position was in respect of the awarding of bursaries in general. The scheme which, as hon. members know, has been in operation since as far back as 1956, has led to literally millions of rands being made available by the Government to people who are worthy of being awarded bursaries, people who have earned it because of their achievements. In 1971 750 bursaries were awarded. The bursaries amount to approximately R250 per year&#x2014; R500 in the case of college and university students where the costs attaching to higher education is higher of course. If a man goes abroad to study, he receives a bursary of R1 200. Direct financial expenditure by the Government on bursaries amounts to R1 750 000 per annum. This gives this hon. House an idea of how the importance of financial assistance to people who cannot always afford it themselves, has increased. More than 1 100 people received bursaries this year. A considerable number of them are studying abroad. Of course, we send people there, especially if a person wants to study and qualify in a particular sphere in which we can put him to good use in South Africa. I do not think hon. members want further figures in regard to bursaries, but you may go ahead and request them if you wish. Several figures are available in this regard.</p>

<p>Then we come to the question of in-service training, in respect of which I was asked yesterday what we were doing in that regard? For a long time we have had criticism levelled at us to the effect that we are not paying sufficient attention to the training of people already in our service. Hon. members will be interested to hear that 30 000 of our own officials&#x2014;i.e. 30 000 out of the total&#x2014;are assisting in various schemes for in-service training. That number of 30 000 has been divided into four sections and covers virtually all fields, from Bantu languages to hydrology in the Department of Water Affairs. There is virtually no subject which does not make in-service training possible in the Public Service.</p>

<p>Thought has already been given to the possibility of establishing what is called a training college for public servants. The work done by public servants differs considerably from the work done in other professions, or rather from the work done at universities and in schools. Because the instruction and training which is given there differs so much from the training required in the Public Service, consideration has been given to the possibility of a training college which may perhaps be established in South Africa one day. Some of our people who were sent abroad, found that such colleges in fact existed in various countries. I would say the United States of America was leading the field as regards the quality of its college. There are four countries in Western Europe which also have such training colleges to which they send people who are selected at school or university, with assistance from the side of the State. This committee which was abroad, has already reported. They suggested that we should consider in principle the possibility of establishing such a college in South Africa at a later stage. Because this is not possible at present because of economic and other circumstances, of course, hon. members will understand that we shall have to start with something smaller if we want to introduce training of this nature. Consideration is being given to a training school, as it is called, which may perhaps be considered by the Government or by the Cabinet in the next few years after <span class="col_8577-8578" refersTo="page_1244"/>such a school has been approved by the Public Service Commission.</p>

<p>The question of merit is also something which has undergone a complete change as a result of investigations carried out by the Public Service Commission in recent times. How does one assess the merit of a person? It is extremely difficult to assess it, of course, for the simple reason that one is not working with factors which can be assessed scientifically. Nor is there a formula which one can work out. In the case of persons, especially if they are fairly young, one cannot always assess what kind of material they are and how one is to assess their merit. Modern methods which have been devised by psychologists and educationists, are available and are applied in South Africa as well. We investigated the position in 14 different countries. We investigated in what way the methods used for assessing a person&#x2019;s merit were being applied. In this respect alone, I want to say to you that this is an indication to you that the Public Service Commission is in fact working on this. I claim nothing for myself, because I know absolutely nothing about this matter. Nominally I am in charge of the Public Service Commission, but in reality I know very little about it. The position is that this particular investigation was carried out in 14 countries by persons who have been dealing with this for many years. As regards the question of the time and energy which must be used or devoted to the matter of assessing whether a person is meritorious or not, you can imagine that if one has to deal with thousands of people every year and a decision has to be taken whether a person should be appointed to a particular post or department, this in itself brings about a tremendous wastage of man-hours and time. In order to eliminate this, the committee also investigated the possibility of shortening the method of assessing a person&#x2019;s merit. We have been successful in reducing the man-hours devoted in the past to the testing of people, by 45 per cent. I think this in itself is a very good indication of the fact that it was worthwhile spending a small sum of money on an investigation of this nature. One finds that the results, too, are more than worthwhile. In this regard, I could also draw comparisons with the systems followed in other countries, but I do not think it is necessary. I just want to leave you with the assurance that we&#x2014;the department in any event&#x2014;is very well conversant with all methods used for testing a person&#x2019;s merit, working capacity, aptitude, insight, judgment, attitude, etc., before he is then appointed to a particular post.</p>

<p>At the end of my exposition as far as the Public Service Commission is concerned, I just want to mention one or two matters which, in my opinion, will have to be given much more attention by the Government than we could give it in the past. I am referring to what was sometimes called bureaucracy in the past, what is in fact not bureaucracy, in other words, the extension of the departmental machine. We have a great number of departments in South Africa. Many of the hon. members will know what our difficulties are in this regard. I shall mention a few to them. We have 43 departments in South Africa. Let me compare this to the position in other countries: In the United States of America there are 11, in Germany 22, in the Netherlands 10, in Japan 13, in Switzerland 7, in Sweden 12, in Australia 26, in Canada 26 and in Great Britain 24. These are all fewer than here. However, we must remember the most important reason for that is the fact that we have four population groups.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Not necessarily; it depends on how far a particular group has developed. As you yourself know, some of them, the Indians for example, do not need a great deal of help in this connection. They have developed further than the Bantu, as you know. For that reason alone we second fewer people to the Indians and Coloured people than we do in the case of the Bantu. This seconding in itself means that we require fewer departments or units for the Indians and the Coloureds, as opposed to the Bantu. That stands to reason.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The Government is aware of the difficulties which we have in this regard and the matter has been given attention by the Government in the past. It is, however, extremely difficult to unite two or three departments, to bring them together. The fact is that we are aware of the rather large <span class="col_8579-8580" refersTo="page_1245"/>number of departments in South Africa, which in turn, of course, means a large number of units, including secretaries and other more highly paid officials; that stands to reason. There must inevitably be a certain amount of duplication between departments if there is such a large number of them, and things cannot be co-ordinated easily, as is the case in countries where there are 12 or 15 or even 20 ministries, as the case may be. But this is a direction in which we are working; the Government has given the matter attention in the past, and in the future I am sure we shall find media and procedures which can be followed, as a result of which improvements can be brought about.</p>

<p>*Mr. Chairman, in conclusion I want to say something in regard to wages. I promised last year that I would have the wage structure and problems we may have in that regard investigated by the Public Service Commission and concomitant bodies. I am speaking in general terms now. As hon. members will see in my Hansard, I spoke about the Public Service Commission itself last year. It is not my duty to investigate the position of persons outside the Public Service and that of officials who have nothing to do with the Public Service; this I cannot do. However, what I am doing and what I undertook to do last year, is twofold. In the first place, I am ascertaining whether the gap between the Whites and the non-Whites in the Public Service can be closed, yes or no. Hon. members will be interested to know that we have made a considerable amount available to non-Whites in the course of the past year to restore parity &#x2026; no, I am not expressing myself very clearly. Let me rather put it this way: The amount has been made available to restore the position to the ratio which existed at the beginning of 1971. There was a certain ratio in regard to the professional groups; this was mentioned by the hon. member for Green Point yesterday. For instance, there was a percentage ratio in respect of White medical practitioners, Bantu medical practitioners, and Indian medical practitioners. That ratio was restored in October last year. This has also been announced in the Press.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Has it reached the ratio of 10, 9, 8 or has it not reached it yet?</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, in the case of medical practitioners it is 80 per cent as against 100 per cent. This is the position only in the case of medical practitioners.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, wait a minute. I have also been on the executive committee for a long time, and it was not always 10, 9, 8. At times it varied. It was changed from time to time by the four administrators in South Africa. The last ratio the hon. member is referring to, is the 10, 9, 8 ratio.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, 1964: that is right, but it was changed in 1968. It was not changed by the National Party or the Government. It was changed by, amongst others, the Co-ordinating Committee on Hospital Affairs. There were other bodies involved here. Three of them were concerned with this matter, and made suggestions in regard to a change in the ratio. I have the figures here. A question was put to me in this connection by the hon. member for Houghton, and I gave her the reply. I see she has the information in that document before her. I do not have the percentages off-hand, but I shall look them up. Here they are; the present ratios are as follows:</p>

<table border="1">

</table>

<p>Those are the figures I gave the hon. member in reply to her question.</p>

<p>*This is one of the promises we made. The position has been revised and we were able to make the adjustments in October to bring the position into line with the previous <span class="col_8581-8582" refersTo="page_1246"/>position. But in addition&#x2014;as I have said a moment ago&#x2014;we also made available a cash amount of R12 million per year to our non-Whites. Of course, this amount has been divided among a great many of them, in the various categories. In the third place, I can give hon. members the assurance that an investigation is being carried out into the general facets of the difference in wages between Whites and non-Whites. The position is under consideration all the time. We have held talks with the various bodies to ascertain which will best be able to deal with this matter. We will have to make certain surveys, because all the statistics in South Africa about these matters which would have made it easier for one to lay down a procedure and a consistent policy in this regard, is not always available.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but only to a certain extent. As the hon. member knows, approximately 10 per cent of the employees of the provinces fall under the Public Service Commission; the remaining 90 per cent are, of course, their own people who get paid by themselves. In many cases they are being paid according to the standards of the normal wage boards in those places where these people work. It is therefore not a matter for us. We deal with the &#x2026;</p>

<p>In any case, Sir, I think I have said enough in this regard.

I shall also try to furnish replies to the other matters raised by members opposite yesterday.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, yesterday afternoon the hon. member for Vryheid took the opportunity to attack the Natal Parks Board and, in doing so, also took the opportunity to attack me personally. I want to reply to some of his points.</p>

<p>May I commence by saying that I have read in the Press of statements the hon. member made as to how I was to be grilled here and how I was to be subjected to a number of questions, which I would be called upon to answer, and so forth. I do not remember that I was grilled, and I do not remember any particular questions. But I want something more than questions from the hon. member. If he is going to attack the Natal Parks Board, he has to give the grounds for his attack. He has to say what his grounds are. He did not attempt to do that yesterday, excepting for two allusions to the very latest report of the provincial auditor. The first was where he quoted from the auditor&#x2019;s report and said that the Parks Board had made a loss during this last year. The auditor&#x2019;s report said nothing of the kind, Sir, I challenge the hon. member to show me where it says so. The auditor&#x2019;s report never said that. The Parks Board cannot make a loss. It is not a trading concern. Not a penny of the Parks Board&#x2019;s revenue goes to the Parks Board; it all goes into the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the province. The hon. member was a member of the provincial council &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, if the hon. member made any reference to it, then I take it he is withdrawing it now, because I am still hoping to get his Hansard. But let it pass, Sir, The point is that the hon. member should know, when he comes to dealing with finance concerning the Natal Parks Board, that no revenue of its own comes to the Parks Board; it is paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the province; and I provided for that when I was administrator, when we passed this Oridinance, so that there is no temptation on the part of the Natal Parks Board to make a profit. The idea is that we are giving a service to the public. We want particularly families and we want children who may not be able to afford high fees to go and take advantage of the facilities that are available in the nature reserves and the game reserves in the province. We hold them in trust not for Natal; we hold them in trust for the people of South Africa. If the hon. member wants to know what some members of his own Cabinet think about it, then let him find out from them. A number of them have been up to those reserves over the holidays.</p>

I am not talking about giving people priority; I say let him find out what accommodation there is and in what way people are treated, including the children, because it is the children we are trying to get to the parks. This then was the total gravamen of the hon. member&#x2019;s accusation; the sum total of his accusations is that we mishandle money, but then he does not indicate on what grounds he says that. Sir, let me say to him that every one of the accounts of the Natal Parks Board is audited by the provincial auditor.</p>

But, Sir, he was a member of the Select Committee on Public Accounts, and the report of the Provincial Auditor goes to the Select Committee on Public Accounts, in exactly the same way as is our procedure here in Parliament. If the Provincial Auditor and the Select Committee on Public Accounts can find nothing wrong with the accounts of the Parks Board, why then does the hon. member not come here with chapter and verse, with something which is of a concrete character, instead of coming here and making wild accusations? No, Sir, the hon. member for Newcastle cannot help the hon. member out. He does not know anything about it either.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want the hon. member for Vryheid to run away from this. He can go and give interviews to the Press behind my back; he is a big boy; he is going to do all sorts of things when we come to Parliament. Here we now face each other as man to man and I challenge him: Don&#x2019;t come with stories and accusations of graft and corruption; stand up and say that I am guilty of graft and corruption, with the other members of the board.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. N. H. JANSON</person>:</from>

<p>In the limited time at my disposal, and after having listened to this private business, I should just like to come back to what the hon. the Minister said earlier this morning in the debate in connection with the Public Service. I think it is necessary, under this Vote, to take note of the very important statement the hon. the Minister made in connection with the difficulties being experienced by the Public Service to recruit, train and retain proper staff. I think it is necessary, in addition, for us to take note of the statement made by the hon. the Minister concerning the number of Government departments and the fact that South Africa actually has an endless number of departments to administer in comparison with the rest of the world. The hon. the Minister added that this results in overlapping from time to time, as well as in duplication. I was glad to learn of the efforts we took cognizance of earlier in the report of the Public Service Commission, i.e. that positive attempts are being made to combat such harmful overlapping. It was the hon. the Prime Minister who said recently in another debate, when the merits of legislation were being discussed, that there will certainly be &#x201C;overlapping&#x201D;, but to use his words &#x201C;it is better to have an overlap than to leave a gap&#x201D;. I think that we can say of the Public Service that in spite of all the sometimes justifiable criticism there has been from time to time, an efficient Public Service has been built up over the years under the very exceptional circumstances in which our country, with its population groups, finds itself. However, I want to broach another matter that fits in with this, because in its planning the Public Service Commission is continually dealing with the question of other levels of government that are also competing with it in certain respects.</p>

<p>In the establishment of the Public Service Commission, and in the report of the commission, mention has been made of the fact that last year in the Public Service a total of 269 000 persons were employed, 103 000 of these being Whites. In the S.A. Railways there are about 111 000 Whites out of a total of 227 000 workers. Compare with this the fact that in the provinces, where these salaries are not controlled, there are 96 000 White persons employed out of a total of 192 000 from all race groups working there, as against the 103 000 of the Public Service. But, to mention a further aspect, in the South African set-up, with its triple level Government, one often loses sight of the fact that the third level of government, where most of the bottle-necks occur that creep through to the Public Service, is the local authority sector which is indirectly controlled by this Minister as well. Last year there were about 52 000 Whites employed and 208 000 persons were employed by local authorities as against the 269 000 that I mentioned for all race groups in the Public Service. These people&#x2019;s remuneration is determined by bodies other than the Public Service Commission, with the single exception of public servants in the provinces. I want to say that the hearty co-operation that has existed throughout the years between the provinces and the central Government is something to be grateful for. I think that appreciative note can be taken of the provinces&#x2019; honouring of the &#x201C;gentlemen&#x2019;s agreement&#x201D; not to compete with the Public Service when it comes to the remuneration of their officials and the consultation that takes place there. I also have appreciation for the fact that in many cases local authorities try to bear in mind the salary structure of the central Government&#x2019;s establishment when salaries are fixed. But I think the Public Service Commission is going to be faced with a problem within the next few years, a problem relating to the remuneration, the recruiting and the retention of its officials, if serious attention is not given to this problem of competition, not only as far as the private sector is concerned, but also as far as the semi-State sector and the other two levels of government are concerned. It is alarming to note that in order to balance their budgets, and with particular focus on <span class="col_8591-8592" refersTo="page_1251"/>the paying of salaries, local authorities must announce tremendous taxes and tariff increases, which has a detrimental effect on the economy of the country as a whole. This has been indicated in the past year by new assessment lists to make provision for this kind of staff recruitment and high salaries. This affects the general taxpayer. It does not matter what steps the Government may take to keep taxes or the cost of living low, if this is not done at local government level. If it soars on the local level then every citizen is affected. I want to allege that these finances, which are needed by local authorities and provinces, constitute between 33&#x2153; and 45 per cent of the budgets of those respective government levels. One can then imagine the kind of problems a Public Service Commission is faced with when it must keep pace with that pattern laid down for it from the lowest government level. I am not very fond of figures, but I just want to mention the figures I have here of the two large provinces. In the Cape Province R133 million is spent per year on salaries, and in the Transvaal R169 million is spent, excluding the additional things that are paid for. This constitutes a tremendous amount of money that must be taken from the taxpayer&#x2019;s pocket in some or other way, and particularly as far as this Ministry is concerned it creates the particular problem that within the Public Service the retention of staff is not only made difficult, but at times even impossible. In connection with what the hon. the Minister said about the investigation of departments falling under him, the various Government departments, I also want to ask for an investigation to be instituted into, and for attention to be given to, the place occupied by these other two levels of government. I venture to say that the public service officials have the full right to complain about the way they are remunerated when they work for the first level of government and their portion compares less favorably with the salaries, the leave privileges and all the other privileges that are given to the two lower levels of government. I have said that the provinces have been exceptionally co-operative in this respect, and I think this deserves the utmost thanks on the part of the Government and this House, but I believe that the necessary co-operation must also be obtained from the local authorities and that it must be made possible for them, under the Du Plessis formula, or under whatever other legislation must ensue, to act, not in competition, but co-operatively as far as their share of handling the government of our country is concerned.

<p>The hon. member for Witbank touched on some very difficult questions connected with the shortage of skilled manpower in the country, something which has of course taxed this Chamber for many years, and as I am quite sure that it is something which is very much in the forefront of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s mind, I hope he will forgive me if I deal firstly with the hon. member for Vryheid.</p>

<speech by="#oliver">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>One of the points I was making was that only a judicial commission is capable of ascertaining exactly what moneys were obtained by Mr. Gouws in contravention of the provisions of the Public Service Act by way of commission or raising fees or from any other benefits. This money belongs rightly to the Government. The Public Service Act makes provision that if money is accrued in this way, illegally in terms of the Act, it is the right of the Treasury to take action against the person who has obtained the money and to recover it so that it can be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund.</p>

<p>There is an element of urgency about this. It is quite clear that the department of the hon. the Minister of Transport has been very tardy in this matter. In fact, the hon. the Deputy Minister of Transport said a short while ago in the Other Place that this was not a departmental matter, not a matter for a departmental investigation. He said this when he was taxed by the hon. Senator Getz about what departmental steps had been taken. If it is not a departmental matter, what sort of matter is it? One thing is quite clear&#x2014;it is not entirely a Police matter. Here we have the prospect of the State possibly through the lapse of time losing money which it is entitled to claim. This money &#x2014;I think it is common cause&#x2014;could run into a very large sum indeed. Certainly, the suggestions made by the hon. the Minister and the hon. the Deputy Minister of Transport in this House about the nature of Mr. Gouw&#x2019;s activities suggest that a large sum is involved.</p>

<p>I was even more surprised to hear the hon. member in his speech last night trying to defend Mr. Gouws.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rissik asks why. Is he against control? Does he want this country to be inundated with pornography? It is obvious that there must be some control. He might disagree with me, but then he must have his disagreement with the Minister. We have repeatedly put our point of view on the need for control and the hon the Minister will remember that in the debates which we have had since I have been in the House, at least, we have constantly warned that the body entrusted with controlling publications, entertainment and such things should go out of its way to gain the support of the people who are affected by it: not only the public at large, but also writers, journalists, playwrights, film-makers. What has this Publications Board done? It has certainly earned the hostility of writers, journalists&#x2014;even journalists of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own Press&#x2014;and it has made itself look ridiculous in the eyes of the public. What is more, the Publications Board has set for itself a record of extreme arrogance in the carrying out of its work. You see, even Judges have voiced their displeasure at the way in which the board goes about its work. I refer to what Mr. Justice Diemont said some time ago. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is to be regretted that the Publications Control Board acting, as far as the public is concerned, as an anonymous entity did not give its reasons for its decisions fully and in a proper way when asked to do so.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I shall not deal here with the matter in connection with Mr. Gouws. I think the hon. the Minister will be able to reply to that better than I can. In connection with the Publications Board, a matter the hon. member for Kensington raised here, I want to say that the hon. member&#x2019;s references to the Board form part of the process of discrediting the Publications Board, as other hon. members mentioned here. It is not only the Publications Board that has been discredited by those hon. members. In the past we have the same thing in connection with the Group Areas Board and in connection with Bantu education. In 1968 a question was asked about who the members of the Group Areas Board were. The same kind of question is now being asked again: Who are the members of the Publications Board? That is disparagement.</p>

<p>We also had this when we began with Bantu education. The same kind of question was asked: Who are the members who must carry this out? Now they have again got hold of the Publications Board. The Publications Board was criticized here about certain decisions it took. A few years ago a certain case came up before the Supreme Court in Cape Town. It was an appeal against a decision of the Publications Board. Two Judges sat, and they disagreed with each other. The result was that the full Bench had to sit in judgment of that case. This shows that even when it comes to the Bench there can be disagreement about the interpretation of the Act and about the concept of &#x201C;spiritual assets&#x201D;. Why was that the case? I think that the matter in question was <i>Where the lion feeds</i>.</p>

<p>The Publications Board decision was that it may not be published. The matter was then referred to the Supreme Court, where two Judges sat. The two Judges disagreed and the full Bench of the Cape Division of the Supreme Court then had to sit in order to pass judgment in that case. Now the Publications Board is being blamed, while even two Judges disagreed about a matter that was referred to them on appeal.</p>

<p>Hon. members opposite have not yet made any concrete suggestions about how this Publications Board should function. They want it scrapped.</p>

<p>Oh, the courts must take its place! And when the courts themselves disagree, as in the case I have just mentioned, must the matter go to the Appeal Court? It can happen that two or three Judges in the Supreme Court must decide that case and it is possible for them to disagree. Then five Judges of the Appeal Court sit, and there can also be a difference of opinion there. Who will then be right? It happens on numerous occasions that three Judges on the Bench disagree on a two to one basis. Then the case is heard by five Judges and they can disagree on a three to two basis. A decision must subsequently be given about that specific matter.</p>

The Academy is the highest ranking body when it comes to matters of this nature, and even as far as the Academy is concerned there was a difference of opinion about these two books.

There was also a difference of opinion in the Academy about Etienne le Roux&#x2019;s book.</p>

<p>Of course, but people disagree more about you than about me. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I now want to come to another aspect of this matter. Recently a new word has cropped up, i.e. &#x201C;bureaucracy&#x201D;. It is a word that has suddenly been discovered, and everything is now discredited by calling it &#x201C;bureaucratic&#x201D;. We can understand something like this happening in individual cases. It must happen when one is dealing with a large organization like the Public Service. But I want to say that the Public Service has always been the conservative factor in any State. From 1870 to the assumption of office by Gen. de Gaulle, French Governments have come and gone, but the Public Service was the bulwark. The Public Service was France&#x2019;s salvation. I think it was Mr. Eric Stockenstr&#x00F6;m who said in about 1930, after the fall of various Governments: &#x201C;It was a kaleidoscope of chaining ministries.&#x201D; But the Public Service was the bulwark for the salvation of the French people and the French Government.</p>

<p>We pass new acts in this House of Assembly. It is not always easy to implement those acts in practice. If hon. members go back in history to 1910 they will see that whenever new Acts are passed they are subsequently amended, after it has been discovered in practice how those Acts work. Here new Act are now being passed, and the public servants have to implement them in practice. When they do so they find that there are certain loopholes in that legislation that have to be plugged again. Then that legislation has to be amended. That is why there has always been legislation that has to be amended throughout the years, whether in this Government&#x2019;s time or in the time of any other South African Government. When new legislation is passed one does not always know what the practical implications of that legislation will be. That is why amendment Acts are passed. In the drawing up of Acts in 1915. for example, there were precedents that could serve as clues. Consequently there were not so many amendments necessary as far as that legislation is concerned; but when it comes to new laws, the amendment of those laws inevitably becomes essential. It will also be found in the private sector that wrong <span class="col_8599-8600" refersTo="page_1255"/>decisions are taken, because the officials in the private sector are also only human. The same thing will happen in the Public Service. This must take place where one is dealing with a big organization. The South African Railways does not, for example, form a part of the South African Public Service. Neither is the Post Office a part of the Public Service. Mistakes are made. But how many mistakes do hon. members on the other side not make? [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, if one reads through the debates that have been conducted under this Vote in the past, one finds that attacks have been launched on a wide front and in respect of several aspects that this department handles. It is interesting to note the pattern that has been adopted this year in this House. The attack is mainly centred on the Publications Board. I do not want to go into the merits of the arguments used against the Publications Board. It is interesting that in certain circles recently a great deal has been said about the Publications Board. A great deal has also been written in newspapers about the Publications Board. The reason why the attacks this year are being concentrated on the Publications Board is simply because the United Party is of the opinion that such an attack on the Publications Board will be popular as far as the general public is concerned.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. L. S. AUCAMP</person>:</from>

<p>The standpoint they adopt is an opportunistic standpoint without consideration of, or I can almost say, without caring two hoots about, the morals of our people in this country.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the Public Service and express a few ideas about it. In this country a great deal is being said about the productivity of our people. A great deal has been done by the Public Service Commission in this connection, as was also indicated here by hon. members and by the hon. the Minister. There is one very important aspect that indicates that the Public Service is meeting with success in their attempt to increase productivity. This is as a result of the emphasis that is being placed on efficiency. If emphasis is not placed on efficiency, higher productivity cannot be obtained. To obtain efficiency the Public Service trains its people. They create the opportunity for academic and technical training. What is of particular importance &#x2014;and in this the Public Service takes the lead today&#x2014;are the courses they offer and the techniques they employ for in-service training. And this training by the Public Service is already known today in sectors outside the Public Service in this country. I am aware that there are already several large financial undertakings in our country that are making use of these techniques and courses of the Public Service, and doing so with great success. Together with the courses being introduced for in-service training, the Public Service also has a special system that is almost the only one of its kind in the world, a system that is closely related to this and that stimulates training as far as the individual is concerned, i.e. the system of advancement on merit. As far as I know, South Africa is about the only country in the world that has this system in its Public Service.</p>

<p>Previous speakers have referred here to the officers of the Public Service that are drawn off by the private sector. One of the most important reasons why people are drawn from the Public Service to the private sector is the fact that our officers in the Public Service have had this thorough training and that the private sector is not prepared to spend the money and take the necessary steps to provide similar training as far as their people are concerned. As a result of the fact that I am aware that there are institutions in the private sector that make use of the techniques and courses of the Public Service, I want to ask the Minister today that this knowledge, which the Public Service has at its disposal, should be made more freely available to the private sector. It would pay the Public Service if we were to release officials to give the necessary training and guidance when private bodies want it, and to equip them in the training of staff. If this were to happen I think greater co-operation would ensue between the private sector and the Public Service. In addition, the Public Service <span class="col_8601-8602" refersTo="page_1256"/>would be able to make a tremendous contribution to the economy of the country. To show what an incentive the Public Service&#x2019;s training has for its people, as far as their advancement on merit is concerned, we may take note of the number of persons that have qualified for it in the Public Service over the past year, the year ending 31st December, 1971. 914 officers qualified for it. The achievements of 559 of the officers were such that the merit advancement was given to them before the due date for their promotion. I say that this is proof of the success the Public Service is achieving today. I would like to see attention given to transferring to the private sector, or to whoever wants to make use of that service, this experience and the knowledge that the Public Service has gained. This can only be to the benefit of our country as a whole.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I listened with great interest to what the hon. the Minister had to say this morning on the Public Service. I must say I wonder whether it has ever occurred to him that we really have a tremendously high percentage of gainfully employed people directly and indirectly in State employment, in a so-called free-enterprise country. I think that the figures he gave us this morning probably exceed the number of people in the employ of the State during Mr. Wilson&#x2019;s socialist government. For a country that prides itself on being a free-enterprise country, an anti-socialist country, it seems to me astonishing that more and more people are being taken up in State employment. Of course, the reason is clear; the hon. the Minister mentioned it himself. It is the fact that everything in this country is ethnically divided so that there is quadruplication of services. I do not think that his explanation that we do not need to quadruplicate because we need fewer people for the Indian section, carries any weight at all, because those persons, whether they are Indians or Whites, are still in the service of the State. Therefore it is still a quadruplication of services. Everything is divided up. Education, welfare, and every single facet of life has to be repeated in different colours in South Africa. This is of course a tremendously expensive exercise. It is one reason why we have so many people in the employ of the State in this country. That is another reason why the State expenditure is so enormously high. Until we change our basic ideas on this, there is not going to be much improvement.</p>

<p>I was also interested to hear what the hon. the Minister had to tell us about the change in ratio and narrowing of the gap in the pay of the different racial groups in the State service. Although it is true that R12&#x00BC; million was made available with retrospective effect from the 1st October, 1971, to be divided among the three groups, the Coloureds, the Indians and African employees, we still have a tremendous way to go before we can say that the gap has narrowed to any appreciable extent, to an extent which is going to satisfy, for instance, the African and the Coloured nurses.</p>

<p>The African and Coloured nurses&#x2019; salaries are so far below that of their White colleagues, particularly when these women know full well that they received the same training, they hold the same qualifications and they carry the same responsibilities. To think that African nurses have a ratio of 45 to 100 <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> their White colleagues and that Coloured and Indian nurses have a ratio of 61 to 100 <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> their White colleagues, is an appalling situation. I think the teacher situation is also very bad. As far as the African teachers are concerned, they get only 52 to 100 as against the 72 to 100 of the Coloured and Indian teachers. Radical changes need to be introduced there before any satisfaction is going to be felt by the professional people. I get many letters from them. Very often these letters are anonymous because they say they are scared of being victimized. This is a pretty sad reflection on the existing state of affairs. Then of course, in regard to university teaching staff, there can be no explanation for the fact that a White lecturer or a White professor gets so much more than a Bantu, a Coloured or Indian professor or lecturer at the ethnic universities. Of course, the situation in the case of doctors has always been appalling. I can never ever find any rationale for government thinking in the case of doctors, and professional people generally. I hope the hon. the Minister is going to redouble his efforts so that he can report to the House next session that very much more extensive improvements have been made than have so far been achieved.</p>

<p>Last night I was trying to develop a point about the confiscation and withdrawal of passports. I know the hon. the Minister has not yet replied to that part of the <span class="col_8603-8604" refersTo="page_1257"/>debate, and that he is going to do so, so I am glad of the opportunity to say a few more words about this before he does reply. He was good enough, unlike his predecessors, to give some basic criteria which apparently guide the Department of the Interior in the removal or withdrawal of passports although, as I said earlier, I rather think that to a large extent all this is really governed by the Special Branch and its activities. He told us that there were, I think, five or six points which guided them.</p>

<p>I should like the hon. the Minister then to give this Committee some information as to why all these Nusas executive members have been deprived of their passports. I do not see what category they fall into. The fact that they disagree with Government policy is not necessarily a besmirching or a slandering of South Africa. For instance, I happen to disagree with the hon. the Minister on almost every basic principle of this Government. I do not, whatever the Minister may think, besmirch or slander South Africa. What I do is to put my own point of view and say that there are many thousands of people who happen to agree with a point of view which I think is enlightened, and that does South Africa a great deal of good overseas. It does it much more good, I may say, then trying to defend Government policy, which is indefensible to most of the Western world as far as racialism is concerned. Now these young people certainly disapprove of Government policy, and they say so, but that is not slandering South Africa. That is disagreeing with the Government. I do not think it can be said that any of the young people are terrorists or that they support sabotage. There are many laws in this country and presumably they would have been hauled before the courts long ago if this could be proved in any way. They are not communists; they do not support banned organizations; they are certainly not an embarrassment to themselves or to the countries they visit and they are not likely to be a financial burden. So, I should like to know on what grounds the hon. the Minister is doing this. I know that there was one Nusas student who went to Ghana in order to plead for the abolition of arms sales to South Africa, and to put that point of view, but he never even got as far as doing so. In fact, he was turned back by Ghana.</p>

<p>Yes, Mr. Streek. As I have said, he never even managed to do that. The point is that he has never ever besmirched or slandered South Africa abroad and he does not fall into any of these other categories. Even asking for an arms boycott of South Africa is not asking for the use of force against South Africa and it is not asking for sabotage. It is not asking for terrorism or communistic activity. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister, since he is far more reasonable than his predecessors on this particular score in that he is prepared to give some reasons for this, to give some rationale for the withdrawal of these passports. Failing that, I am afraid there is only one conclusion which can be drawn&#x2014;it is certainly the conclusion that I have drawn and that many others have drawn&#x2014;and that is that this is sheer intimidation of some of our young men, or women, for that matter. <span class="col_8605-8606" refersTo="page_1258"/>Some women have also been denied passports. It is an attempt to intimidate young leaders of South Africa, for these are leaders of South Africa, from taking executive positions in one of the major student organizations of this country. This is certainly how the students view it, and unless the hon. the Minister can give us some startling disclosures to justify the withdrawal of passports and the refusal of passport applications by these young people, I am afraid there is no other conclusion which can be drawn.

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Houghton will forgive me if I do not follow up on what she said. I just want to tell her that I fully understand her policy; it is very clear to me. I differ with her in principle, but I should prefer to carry on a conversation with hon. members of the United Party, because their policy is not always as clear to me as that of the Progressive Party.

<block name="quote">The United Party will have to explain the place which the Public Service and the Public Service Commission are to occupy within their federal system in South Africa, and particularly what place the Bantu and their various ethnic groups as well as the Indians and the Coloured people are to occupy in the State administration.</block>

<p>I went on to ask&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United Party must, in particular, tell us how the Bantu are going to be incorporated in the central administration in respect of the State departments, the Public Service, the Public Service Commission, State Finance, the South African Railways, Harbours and Airways, State-owned corporations, control boards, such as the Agricultural control boards and other control boards, advisory boards, professional boards, judicial and arbitration boards, commissions and research institutions.</block>

<p>I went on to ask&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Is it going to incorporate the Bantu as administrative officers? If the United Party has got that far, are they going to incorporate the Bantu as administrative control officers?</block>

<block name="quote">Young United Party shed their party&#x2019;s policy.</block>

<p>Then the report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United Party&#x2019;s policy of race federation exists as a blue smudge rather than as a blueprint for the future, according to Mr. Neale Gordon, one of the young South Africans, the United Party&#x2019;s youth movement. Mr. Gordon&#x2019;s assessment was made during a recent symposium at which official United Party policy was scrutinized by its younger members. He was commenting on those aspects of party policy which give him slight grey hairs.</block>

<p><span class="col_8607-8608" refersTo="page_1259"/>Well, it does not give me grey hairs, for to me it is just a subject for study. The report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Gordon was concerned about the lack of clarity &#x2026;</block>

<p>I agree with Mr. Gordon&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; which surrounded the concept of race federation. He was not alone in his concern.</block>

<p>And then, in quotation marks&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Nobody knows what the heck they mean by race federation,&#x201D; said Mr. Trevor McGlashan.</block>

<p>Then the following, also in quotation marks&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;What is race federation?&#x201D; asks Mr. James Smith.</block>

<p>And then reference is made here to an Afrikaans-speaking person, Mr. T. D. Jooste; perhaps he is also a Daniel&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. T. Jooste found it difficult to explain race federation to progressively minded voters because he did not understand it himself.</block>

<p>Then, at the end of the report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whatever the debate&#x2014;and there was plenty of it&#x2014;there was no disagreement with Mr. McGlashan&#x2019;s plea at the end. &#x201C;We must make up our minds,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;We must find out what we want from race federation, simplify it and give it to the people.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Most probably it has to be much simplified for me to understand it, because the whole concept of race federation is not only the question of the representation which the various race groups are to get in this Parliament, but also the part which the Public Service and the Public Service Commission will play within that framework. I asked all these questions in all modesty, because I should like to conduct a debate here with the hon. members of the Opposition. But then the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District spoke after me and said it was not I who was asking the question, but the Herstigtes, and he spoke of my so-called leader, the hon. member for Waterberg, and then said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Chairman, to come back to this question of the Civil Service, the hon. member for Rissik knows that there is a little yellow pamphlet entitled &#x201C;The Answer: You want it, We have it&#x201D;. I see that he has a copy of the leaflet. He can find all the answers in there. Why is he asking all these stupid questions?</block>

<p>Now. Sir, a question is never stupid. I have been a teacher myself. A question is never stupid; it is only the reply which can very often be stupid. I looked at this little book very carefully, because the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District had said: Van der Merwe, go to the little yellow book and those questions you want to ask have all been recorded there. I did so. I took up the little yellow book, &#x201C;The Answer: You want it. We have it&#x201D;. I looked at the index first. In the index it says &#x201C;Our policy for the Whites; our policy for our children; our policy for our workers; our policy for our farmers; our policy for racial harmony; our policy for old age and sickness&#x201D;. That will probably interest the hon. member for South Coast. Then they talk about houses and then &#x201C;our policy for State Departments, page 25&#x201D;, and they mention the Public Service, the Post Office, the S.A.B.C., Transport and the Police. So I turned to page 25, because I should like to have these stupid questions of mine answered, for I too, am keen to ensure the survival of my people, as also of the various other population groups in South Africa, and therefore I listen seriously to what is said by the hon. members of the Opposition. Now, on page 25 there is &#x201C;Our policy for State Departments&#x201D;, and I was looking for the reply to the question concerning the place which the non-Whites were going to occupy in the State administration in the Republic of South Africa. I looked at page 25. and it did not say a word about it. I looked at pase 26, and it did not say a word about it. I looked at page 27, and it did not say a word about it; page 28 is a blank page. Perhaps the hon. members still wanted to write something on it. Once again, a year later, I am coming to this House in all seriousness because your programme of basic principles says that your view of the survival of the White man in this country is different from that of the hon. member for Houghton, and I completely disagree with her in matters of principle, <span class="col_8609-8610" refersTo="page_1260"/>but I know what she believes and thinks and what her policy is, and therefore I leave her alone. But you go to the people and you go to the younger generation and I can understand that the young people do not understand your policy.</p>

It is understandable. I should like hon. members, since they say with us that they, too, see the survival of the White man in South Africa, to tell us with regard to the administration of our country, in the first place, what kind of place the non-White will occupy in the State administration without endangering the position of the White man, and, in the second place, how they will provide for all the aspirations of the non-White, also in the field of State administration.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to deal with one aspect in regard to passports, with which the hon. member for Houghton dealt. If I understand her correctly, she feels that the advocating of an arms embargo on South Africa was not necessarily a reason for withdrawing a passport.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>No, I said it had not happened. I said it would not necessarily be a reason.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Oh. I see. It would not be. I want to say immediately to the hon. the Minister that, as far as I am concerned and hon. members on this side of the House, we will accept any proposal of or assistance in the development or extension of an arms embargo on South Africa, as full justification for the withholding of a passport. We hold this view because it has two adverse national effects. The one is that it places us in a financially difficult position to acquire arms if we have an arms embargo and we have to procure them ourselves by some other means. In the second instance it is an attitude towards this country which is adverse to our security and certainly one which we on this side of the House will not support.</p>

<p>I want to say that I have listened with interest to the speech of the hon. the Minister this morning which was just on or just over 60 minutes. If ever there was justification for our request that there should be an annual report from the secretariat of the Department of the Interior, it was supplied this morning. The facts and figures which the hon. the Minister gave are most interesting and I am sure that we could have had a fruitful <span class="col_8611-8612" refersTo="page_1261"/>debate had those figures been available by way of a report before we came to this House or before we started debating this issue. I hope that it will be a practice which the hon. the Minister will introduce, that we do have a report from the secretariat of the Department of the Interior in addition to the report which we received from the Public Service Commission.</p>

<p>I admit that he answered several questions which we put to him, but one which I hoped he would deal with specifically was a request which I made and which was mentioned by the hon. member for Kensington twice. We believe that there is an urgent necessity for the appointment of a judicial commission into the activities of Mr. Gouws in so far as they may give rise to an obligation to repay funds into the Consolidated Revenue Fund.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has dealt with the productivity of public servants. This is a matter which is being handled by the Public Service Commission. We welcome what he has said. We note with interest the claims which he makes about the improvement in productivity. However, that is not the inquiry which the Public Servants&#x2019; Association wants. Quite naturally the question of increased productivity is a question for the Public Service Commission. But the Minister&#x2019;s frank statement to us, that we in South Africa have 43 state departments, which is approximately double the number required by the government of the United Kingdom or of the United States of America, has revealed the matter which needs investigation; and not investigation from within the department, but from without. As the Public Servants&#x2019; Association in their resolution said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The lack of co-ordination between government departments on the one hand and government departments and semi-government departments on the other hand should be investigated.</block>

<p>In 1970 the Public Service Commission&#x2019;s reply in their report was that the matter was receiving attention. It is this matter which requires investigation. How much labour, how much money and what personnel are being wasted because of the duplication of departments and of heads of departments? What about the wasted time for consultation between four different departments, each doing the same job, but for different sections of the community? These are the matters that need to be investigated, e.g. the interdepartmental cooperation, overlapping between departments and the proliferation of departments. I believe there is still a good case for that investigation by persons outside the Public Service Commission itself.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister disappointed me tremendously this morning when he indicated that it had not been possible yet to raise the maximum loan limit of R15 000 provided by the Community Development Department for public servants. This is a matter that I do hope can be dealt with. Public servants themselves have asked for it over and over again. I hope that between the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Community Development this matter can be looked at, so that that limit can be raised and these housing loans be made of greater value to public servants.</p>

<p>There is another matter which the Minister mentioned, and that was the question of allowances. I want to deal with just one of them. The Parliamentary allowance for civil servants at present is R6 per day for a married man, irrespective of the size of his family and R3,50 per day for a single person. I do not think there are any Members of Parliament who have to come to Cape Town from other quarters who will not agree that these Parliamentary allowances to the public servants are totally inadequate. The hon. the Minister spoke generally of an adjustment of allowances. I know some have been adjusted. I do hope that this is one that can receive urgent attention. I do not think it involves a considerable sum of money, but it certainly means a considerable amount to those members of the Public Service who are involved.</p>

<p>Then I want finally to comment also on the Minister&#x2019;s statement in regard to closing the gap. Our difficulty is this: He limited his remarks to the Public Service Commission itself; and quite correctly, because it is the department which he controls. But the vast majority of the doctors, nurses and paramedical personnel are in the employ of the provinces. The provinces are in the position of having, first of all, to fix salaries which conform to those stipulated by the Public Service Commission, and then, they will now be dependent on the Treasury for the necessary funds to implement the adjustments. The difficulty that we are in today is a difficulty into which we slid back from what was decided <span class="col_8613-8614" refersTo="page_1262"/>in 1964. The hon. the Minister was then an administrator and a member of the Executive Committee in Natal, and served on that co-ordinating committee. In 1964 it was agreed, so far as doctors were concerned, that the ratio would be 10 for Whites, 9 for Coloureds and Indians and 8 for Bantu. We got up to that stage of closing the gap. From 1964 the gap just widened. Now the Minister claims that he is doing a great deal by bringing it back to a 10 : 8 : 7 ratio. Sir, that is not back to where we were in 1964, eight years ago. I know the Minister has a big job.</p>

<p>Yes. Unfortunately, I know he is trying to put right what his colleagues did wrong over seven years. But I do hope that the hon. the Minister, if he has done this in one year, will try and get back at least to the ratio of 10 : 9 : 8, which at that stage I personally found was acceptable to the non-White doctors. They accepted it then. They did not regard it as being completely just. I do not regard it as being completely just that there should be a differentiation. But they would have been prepared to work on that basis. If the hon. the Minister can extend this a little bit further, to get back to what we had before, he will be doing a great service and make it possible. through consultation with the provinces, for the provinces to apply the same ratio as he is prepared to apply to the Public Service Commission.

<p>Now I have quite a number of shorter replies which one cannot, of course, deal with comprehensively on an occasion such as this. Perhaps I can just start at the beginning with what I have in front of me here. This is a question put by the hon. member for Orange Grove. He asked whether we were going to keep the famous or infamous statue in front of the building of the Department of the Interior. I think my hon. colleague, the Minister of Public Works, has stated the position. He has also indicated that he is responsible. The hon. member knows that his department is responsible for that. I suppose I need not reply on his behalf again to what the hon. member asked.</p>

<p>Then there is a question here by the hon. member for Houghton, which refers to the question of the four different points which I mentioned in my speech when she was not here. I want to reply to the hon. member right now, because these are actually four of the questions which concern broad national politics, or party politics more particularly. If I may remind her, she indicated in the first place that she cannot be held responsible for questions put by her which then receive publicity.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Oh, I don&#x2019;t mind at all.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>You don&#x2019;t mind publicity, I know; we all know. The mere fact of the case is that the first question I put to her in respect of a question she put to me, was this: Was it necessary at the time, when South-West Africa was under discussion in all the newspapers and other news media right over the world, to ask&#x2014; this was the fourth question she asked me&#x2014; how many passports were still held by the department since 1971? That was what she wanted to know at the time. Obviously she wanted to know the figures in respect of each of the four races. It is practically impossible to reply immediately to that question, for the simple reason that we do not keep those figures. Secondly, it would have indicated who had made application and who had wanted to leave or come into South-West Africa. We have these passports and at the time it was very important information for the hon. member or anybody else to have. All this information I could have supplied to her at the time, would have been given to the newspapers and publicized overseas. So naturally I said to her that I felt it was rather an unusual question to put. Then she asked why we could not keep statistics in respect of the number of passports withdrawn and whether these statistics were only kept by the Special Branch. I indicated to her <span class="col_8615-8616" refersTo="page_1263"/>that that was not so. If we wish to do so we can spend a little more money and a little more time on extending the work that is done in this department by keeping a record of all passports. That is quite possible if you want to apply your mind to it. In fact, it would be a waste of time of two units, furthermore, but it can be done. In any event, there is no reason why it should be done. Really, I think it is a waste of time.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the hon. member asked me about the case of the young Douglas-Home, whom the hon. member protected in her speech at the time &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member&#x2019;s attitude was that this was not a matter of great importance. From her point of view Parliament should not have wasted its time on the matter, and so forth. We thought otherwise. The hon. member also asked me why the reasons for this could not be given. As the hon. member knows very well, we have reasons which we cannot supply. The hon. member mentioned seven or eight reasons which I gave her last year as to why we do act at times. I said at the time that we should not and that we will not disclose which reason applies in every particular case. We had sufficient reason to get rid of him as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said that 83 requests by people to visit South Africa had been refused. She asked me whether Owambo was included in this. The answer is, &#x201C;Yes, Owambo was included.&#x201D; It included the whole of South-West Africa.</p>

<p>The last question which the hon. member put to me this morning concerns the differences between the salaries of professional people who are in the Public Service. She asked me why the ratio was so low in the case of nurses. She particularly mentioned the Bantu, Indian and Coloured nurses. As the hon. member knows, an investigation was undertaken last year. A special committee was appointed to investigate the possibility of increasing the salaries of non-White nurses. As the hon. member quite correctly said, the ratio is now much lower than it was in 1971. That investigation is still proceeding and I hope that it will be possible for me to tell this House in time what the Government has decided in this respect. I think that disposes of the questions the hon. member put to me.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parow put a few questions to me which I should like to reply to.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I ask the hon. the Minister whether he includes in his general reply on the question of passports, the reply on the withdrawal of the passports of Nusas executives? Is that included in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s general reply on passports? Does the same thing apply to the withdrawal of the passports of the executives of Nusas?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I never indicated in any way that this applied to the members of the Nusas executive. Neither did I indicate that it applied to a clique, the hierarchy of this group. The cases of those people were dealt with on merit. We have a file on each of these people, because they were leaders of Nusas. We had every reason to withdraw their passports, also on account of the investigation that is taking place. I think that it would have been unwise for that hon. member to have suggested that those people should be allowed to go overseas at that particular time. It may be that the committee that is inquiring into this matter may need evidence from some of these people. We do not know. It is impossible for us to say beforehand. It is wise, in any event, to take precautionary measures and make sure that those people will be available should they be needed to give evidence before the committee.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Just before we adjourned for lunch, I was replying to a few questions which were still outstanding. I had come to the questions put by the hon. member for Parow. In the first place he asked what steps were being taken in regard to foreign entertainers. He indicated that he was not very happy about the fact that a large number of these people were visiting this country. In addition, he referred to Percy Sledge and said that since then matters had worsened to a considerable extent in the sense that we had had a number of artists here who did not know how to behave themselves and who had also been allowed to appear in front of Whites. I can only give the hon. member the assurance that in the past month the departmental policy in regard to this matter has in fact been made stricter and that in future it will be more difficult for this type of person to enter the country. Furthermore, we shall see to it that persons of Percy Sledge&#x2019;s calibre will in any case not have the opportunity of appearing before Whites. It is important to know that we all feel that we should encourage our own artists, and that the development among non-Whites of musical talent, or whatever talents they may have, should also be encouraged. For that reason I can give hon. members the assurance that we shall act a good deal more strictly in respect of those people who are not outstanding artists from abroad, and who try to enter this country.</p>

<p>The hon. member also put another question to me in regard to the possibility of an annual report. I think I have already replied to that in part by saying that we shall consider it. Not only that, but I think I can give the hon. member the assurance that in future we shall have such a report. The difficulty is, of course, to have such a report published in time and with the necessary information which hon. members want. In any case, we shall investigate that matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wolmaransstad said that voters who did not register and therefore failed to comply with the Electoral Act should be prosecuted. The difficulty is that at present the Electoral Act does not make provision for action to be taken in the case where changes of address are not notified.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Will you have it changed?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am not willing to give any assurance of that nature. However, it is important to note that the Electoral Act imposes the obligation that all 18-year-olds should see to it that they register. Whether we are going to take further steps will depend on whether the new system of population registration will make it possible to keep ourselves informed of a person&#x2019;s change of address. If this is the case, it will, of course, be much easier to act.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Malmesbury spoke about the loading and deloading of constituencies. He drew comparisons between the rural and the urban constituencies, which, <span class="col_8619-8620" refersTo="page_1265"/>according to the latest figures we have, are very large. Furthermore, he asked whether this particular matter could be considered when we reached the stage next year of investigating amendments to the Electoral Act. At the moment I do not want to express a personal opinion on this matter, but some of us are of the opinion that the surface constituency, as we call it, should be taken into account to a greater extent in the loading and deloading process than is the case at present. He also referred to the fact that it is done in the United Kingdom and in a few other countries, and that there was no reason why we in South Africa, with our vast plains and our small number of cities, should not consider it. In any case, it is for the Government to consider whether or not that provision should be incorporated in the Electoral Act next year, when draft legislation must be prepared&#x2014;it can, of course, be referred to a Select Committee subsequently I can nevertheless give the hon. member the assurance that this is a matter which will be taken into account.</p>

<p>The hon. member also requested that the old system&#x2014;i.e. the system which did not make continuous registration possible&#x2014; should be reintroduced, if I understood him correctly, and that registration over the years or from time to time should again become the responsibility of the voter. The difficulty with the old system is that it is going to be replaced as a result of the new population registration and the identification changes. We shall now be able to know where a person is: we shall know his address and what changes may occur. We shall be able to locate him exactly. In actual fact it will mean that we shall not need to have a continuous registration such as we had in the past. To tell the truth, once the new system is in force, the system of continuous registration will obviously become unnecessary, for the simple reason that it will be possible to trace a name or address at any time.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Malmesbury also asked whether it should not be made compulsory to produce identity cards at elections. This is laid down in the Electoral Act at present, but for certain administrative reasons it has apparently never been applied in the past. There are reasons why this was not put into effect, but there are also good reasons why it should in fact be put into effect, and I personally agree with the hon. member that it should be done; it is an obligation which should be imposed on those people who do not fulfil that responsibility. In other words, what I want to say to the hon. member is that the provision does exist in the Electoral Act, but that for administrative reasons it is not in operation.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point put various questions to me, to which I have replied in the course of the debate. One of these was the request whether the passport could not be done away with when we had the new identification documents.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>It could fall away automatically.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, whether it could not happen automatically. This matter has been discussed by the Government. This possibility has been considered, but the Government decided against it because in the course of time it should be possible for the document itself to be converted into a document which may be a passport as well. In other words, it could take the place of a passport, and this would have the same effect as doing away with the passport completely, because there would then only be the document.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pretoria District made a plea in regard to grievances. I agree with him that the matter should be investigated. I do think there is reason to take cognizance of the fact that there are people in the Public Service who do not always have the opportunity of putting their case. It is very difficult to have these matters handled only by the Public Service Commission. I think this is acknowledged. This is a request which has been considered on various occasions, but which we have not yet acceded to or put into operation. We can look at the matter again and consider how a grievance commission could be composed and whether it is necessary. In any case, I hope I shall be able to inform the hon. member next year what the views are of not only the Public Service Commission, but also the Public Servants&#x2019; Association.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Point asked whether I could supply a time-table in regard to when the next delimitation will take place. The hon. member is a former organizer of his party and probably knows the Electoral Act very well already. He knows that this cannot be done and that the Constitution also provides that <span class="col_8621-8622" refersTo="page_1266"/>there must be a general delimitation every five years. This should enable the hon. member to calculate when the next one will take place, since the last one was in 1965. I just want to make it clear that it may not take place before a period of five years has elapsed and that it may not take place later than ten years after the previous one. He must simply do his own guesswork and see if he can come to a decision when he works it out for himself.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is the prerogative of the State President to appoint the delimitation commission on the advice of the Executive Council. The hon. member wants an assurance from me that the delimitation of constituencies will take place before the next general registration. I think the same answer I gave him a moment ago, applies here, i.e. that he, as a former organizer of his party, should know that there is no chance at all of doing something like this. In addition, there is no reason why we shall do so. Furthermore, it is a matter about which the State President himself must decide and I cannot answer on his behalf in respect of such a matter I think the hon. member knows very well that we cannot give a reply to that. It will be considered by the State President and by the Cabinet in due course.</p>

<p>He asked the same question as the hon. member for Wolmaransstad, that is to say, he asked that people should be prosecuted when they committed offences. The hon. member for Durban Point, who knows the electoral system very well too, knows that many irregularities occur in respect of which no prosecutions are instituted. On the other hand, it is not the prerogative of a party or a Minister to do that. It is the sole prerogative of the Attorney-General, who may decide on that. There is an obligation on hon. members and on myself to bring any irregularities of which we know, to the attention of the Police. This is virtually the only obligation resting on one, i.e. to bring irregularities to their attention. Then the Attorney-General must decide whether prosecutions are to be instituted or not.</p>

<p>Then there is another question to which I must reply. It is in connection with the fees which will be payable to the enumerators as from now. In the past the fee was R3, which it remained until 1964. Subsequently, in 1969, it was increased to R6. At this election the enumerators will receive R7-50. As a result we should attract a considerable number of interested persons.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister intervened in this debate right at the commencement to make certain statements to direct the debate in the line which he would perhaps have liked it to go. He then intervened this morning for a period of 60 minutes with a discursive discussion on facts and figures relating to the Public Service Commission. He has now stood up to reply to this debate and he has left unanswered a vast number of questions which have been posed by this side of the House. One of the questions which we have asked him&#x2014;and I asked this question originally&#x2014;was whether he would take cognizance of the debates which have taken place in this House and of what has been said by the hon. the Minister of Transport and the hon. Deputy Minister of Transport and whether he would recommend the appointment of a judicial commission of inquiry into the activities of the manager of the M.V.I. The Minister now says that he will wait to see whether recommendations are made. The hon. the Minister knows that in his department the manager of the M.V.I. superseded 11 other officials in that department. The appointment was his responsibility and in so far as that appointee is responsible to repay, it is the responsibility of this Minister to see that the facts are ascertained.</p>

<p>Then there are other matters of vital importance to the Public Service which were just glossed over and in respect of which we did not get a reply. We have asked him questions in regard to certain allowances, particularly Parliamentary allowances, but the Minister gives no reply. We have asked him whether he himself is to give effect to the statements which he has made in public about closing the gap, whether he is prepared to make recommendations to make this possible within the provincial councils and whether he will do so through his co-ordinating council. We have asked him whether he will make it possible for funds to be made available to the provincial councils in order to close the gap. We can only note at the end of this debate that these questions remain unanswered. We can only judge the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s public utterances of intention in the light of what he has said in relation to the practical application of them in the department which he governs.</p>

<p>I will reply to those very questions. The hon. member has mentioned three possible questions now. It has been put to me that I did not reply to them. I said from the outset that it was not my duty or prerogative to reply to the question or to act in terms of the Act. This is the way it was interpreted to me by legal advisers. I am not responsible for taking action in the case of Mr. Gouws. I said that at the beginning. Now the hon. member accuses me of not having replied to his questions.

<p>Sir, the hon. members for Green Point and Kensington are conducting a personal vendetta here against a certain public servant who has been suspended from the Service, and they are doing so only because this person, when he was originally appointed to this position, was apparently promoted over the heads of certain other officials.</p>

<p>The merits of the case, or misconduct, or theft or whatever may have taken place, is not the issue here at all; this is merely a vendetta which is being conducted here by two hon. members against a decision of the Public Service Commission and of the department that a certain person should be promoted to a certain post. I want to say to the hon. member for Kensington that he in any case gave a total misrepresentation of the case to the Committee. The fact of the matter is that Mr. Gouws has already been suspended from the Public Service. What can the Public Service do to him now? They cannot go and catch Mr. Gouws and lock him up; that is the work of the Police.</p>

<p>Sir, there we have the same simple reasoning again. What money must they recover from Mr. Gouws? Sir, it was proved here in a previous debate that Mr. Gouws had taken no money from the State or from the fund. No State money came into the hands of Mr. Gouws. The hon. members want to create the impression here now that Mr. Gouws stole money from the State or that he stole money from the fund.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, it is not commission which is due to the fund. If Mr. Gouws received commission, it was over and above any other commission which was payable; it is not commission which is due to the fund. The fund suffered no loss here. How on earth can the hon. member for Kensington say that funds which were not due to the State should be recovered? The hon. member is giving the Committee a misrepresentation. Mr. Gouws has already been suspended from the Public Service. It is now for the Police to prove that he unlawfully received money which was not due to him. In any case, if he did receive any money, that money was not due to either the fund or the State. Therefore the State cannot seize it, because it has nothing to do with the State. Sir, those hon. members do not know what they are talking about. The fact of the matter is that they are conducting a vendetta here against an official because he was promoted over the heads of other officials. Mr. Gouws was a good official, as we heard in this House; he was a top official and he was promoted on merit, but hon. members are attacking him because he was a competent official who was promoted over the heads of other officials.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I just want to read out a note I have received from my department a moment ago, and I want to ask the hon. member to reply to it then and to show me where the Public Service Act gives me as Minister of the Interior the right to act before the Department of Transport has charged Mr. Gouws in terms of the Public Service Act. Only then could we act, if it should be necessary then. I am asking the hon. member to show me where we have that right in terms of the Public Service Act. In the meantime, in order to give the hon. member time to consult the Public Service Act, I should like to reply to a question put to me this morning by the hon. member for Witbank in regard to the position which has arisen, as a result of the financial relations between the provincial administrations on the one hand and the municipalities on the other, in respect of the payment of salaries <span class="col_8627-8628" refersTo="page_1269"/>to their officials, and the difficult position in which the provincial administrations find themselves as a result of the fact that some of the municipalities pay and offer higher salaries than those which the provinces are able to pay their officials, with the result that the provinces lose some of their officials to the local authorities. I can merely inform the hon. member for Witbank that a few years ago the provinces considered the possibility of requesting that legislation be introduced by the Central Government in order to place the third level of government. namely the local government level, on the same basis as the provincial administrations and the Central Government as far as salary scales are concerned. But the local authorities, in the Transvaal as well, felt so strongly about it that we did not take that matter any further. But I want to agree with the hon. member that if the salaries of officials are controlled on two levels of government, we probably have the right to investigate the possibility whether officials in the service of the local authorities should not be treated in the same way. In any case, it would eliminate the competition existing at present between the local authorities and the provincial administrations and would greatly facilitate matters from the point of view of the two higher levels of government, namely the provinces and the Central Government.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have never seen such a strange attitude as that adopted by the Opposition. They have actually judged and found a man guilty while the Police investigation is still taking place. They want to blame my colleague, the Minister of the Interior, for not having instituted an inquiry into Mr. Gouws&#x2019;s activities. But surely the initiative rests with my department. My department must take the initiative to ask for an inquiry into the misdeeds, or whatever you might wish to call it, of any member of my department, but that can only take place after the Police inquiry has been completed. Hon. members opposite have judged Mr. Gouws and found him guilty before the Police investigation has taken place. They do not know what actually happened in regard to the commission that Mr. Gouws received. They do not know from whom he received the commission; they do not know the amount of the commission, but they want my colleague to institute an inquiry.

<p>Sir, I have been a Minister for 24 years and at least I should know what the procedure is. If any officer of a department is guilty of any misdemeanour, the initiative in regard to his discharge or any disciplinary action against him rests with that particular department, not with the Minister of the Interior. He has nothing to do with my department. If, as soon as the Police inquiry has been completed, there is sufficient evidence that Mr. Gouws should be charged before a court of law, then that will be done, and then and then only will the department take the necessary steps to take disciplinary action against Mr. Gouws. I simply do not know why hon. members opposite are condemning my colleague, the Minister of the Interior, for not taking action. It has nothing to do with him. If they have a quarrel it is a quarrel with me, not with him.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, it is a pity that the hon. the Leader of the House was not here when this matter was discussed. There is no question of having judged and <span class="col_8629-8630" refersTo="page_1270"/>found Mr. Gouws guilty of any crime. That is a matter that is being investigated by the Police. What we were concerned with was section 24 (3) of the Public Service Act. The hon. the Minister will know that during the course of the debate on the Transport Vote it was confirmed that certain commission had been paid to Mr. Gouws. You will agree with that. We are concerned with that under this Minister&#x2019;s Vote. Section 24 (3) of the Act requires that any remuneration or allowance whatsoever received by a public servant&#x2014;and Mr. Gouws was a public servant&#x2014;over and above his salary, should be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund; it does not deal with whether he was guilty of a criminal offence. That is correct; that is something for the Police to investigate. But this Minister, who is in charge of the Public Service, has a duty to find out what this man has received. As has been pointed out by the hon. member for Kensington, if one looks at one item alone, R23 million was invested with building societies. The hon. the Minister of Transport will know as well as I do that it is customary with investments in building societies for a half per cent commission to be paid, and that in itself would amount to something like R115 000, on just one year&#x2019;s investment with the building societies. I believe it is the duty of this hon. Minister to find out where that money went to. The Police cannot find that out. But if the Minister recommends to the State President that there be a judicial commission, that commission can cause each one of those building societies to find out if and to whom this normal introductory fee was paid. And that is just one year&#x2019;s investment. We are not concerned about criminal actions under this Minister&#x2019;s Vote; we are concerned with the fact that he has an obligation under the Public Service Act to see that moneys received by any public servant over and above his salary are repaid, and we ask him under that head to have a commission appointed to investigate all these people who receive moneys. We have reason to believe, and we have said it before, that one of these building societies in fact received money on condition that it made another loan. Did this servant at the time receive any raising fee in respect of that other loan? We are concerned here with purely the financial obligation to repay money. That is what we ask the Minister to have investigated. We are not concerned now with the criminal aspect. It may or may not be a crime, but there is the obligation to repay.</p>

The Police have to find out who paid commission and what amount of commission has been paid to Mr. Gouws, if any. That is their job. They first of all have to find out who paid commission to Mr. Gouws and, if any, what the amount of the commission was and then they have to find out What happened to that commission.

Only when that inquiry has been completed, can steps be taken to recover that commission from Mr. Gouws, if he is not entitled to it. But my colleague over there has nothing to do with it.

<p>Under Vote 14 there has been a considerable increase of R2 million. I should like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister what the reasons for this increase are.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the Government has decided to reduce the price of butter by 10 cents per 500 gram. This will result in a total cost of approximately R4 million, R2 million of which has been contributed by the Government and R2 million by the Dairy Board from its funds. Hence the additional R2 million.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kingwill">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this is obviously a special subsidy in connection with the reduction of the inland selling price of locally produced butter. This is what one might call a consumer subsidy, the effect of which is to make butter available to the man in the street at a price which he can afford and is prepared to pay. At the same time this consumer subsidy makes it possible for the efficient producer to be assured of a price which gives him a reasonable return on his capital investment and for his enterprise. It also takes into account the risk factors which are always present in an agricultural industry. Because we on this side of the House for many years have pleaded for this very policy which the hon. the Minister is now implementing, we welcome this appropriation. We are sure that this amount will not only stimulate that consumption of this essential foodstuff, but that it will also tend to stabilize the dairy industry as a whole. We therefore welcome this measure.</p>

<p>Could the hon. the Minister give the reasons for the increase of R7 million under item E?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture_">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we have on the Estimates R30 million in respect of the subsidy on maize. It was increased to R35 million on account of the bigger estimate <span class="col_8637-8638" refersTo="page_1274"/>for the new crop. As a result the subsidy was increased by a further R7 million to enable the Maize Board to pay out to the farmers R3-51&#x00BD; per bag of 200 lbs. The additional amount is required in order to be able to pay the price of R3-51&#x00BD;.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Deputy Minister has now told us that the R7 million increase is because of the necessity of subsidizing the export of our mealies. I am not going to discuss the rights or wrongs of fixing the price of maize. It is quite right too that we should export our surplus maize. I understand that we are exporting at a loss. But we must export as we have to get rid of the surplus. In addition we need the foreign exchange. But what is perplexing to us is that the producer seems to get less for his maize while the consumer has to pay more. I understand that the producer&#x2019;s price in 1971 was R3-65 for a 90 kg bag. The 1972 price to the producer is R3-51&#x00BD;. The consumer, on the other hand, in 1971, paid R3-70 while now he has to pay R3-91&#x00BD;. The price gap in 1971 was 5 cents, while in 1972 it is 40 cents. The producer&#x2019;s price is down by 13&#x00BD; cents but the consumer&#x2019;s price is up by 21&#x00BD; cents.</p>

<p>I understand, too, that of this 21&#x00BD; cents increase in the price to the consumer, 10 cents go to the Stabilization Fund and 11&#x00BD;<i></i> cents to the increased price of the bag. As far as the price of mealie meal is concerned, the consumer&#x2019;s price in 1971 was R4-73 for an 80 kg bag, but now it has gone up to R5-06 making a difference of 33 cents on 80 kg. Now, who has to pay for this? This increase in the price to the consumer, for him to subsidize the export of maize, amounts to a sectional tax. In this case it is a tax on the poorer people, the people who can least afford to pay; because the consumers of maize are the poor people, mainly the Africans, and to a certain extent the Coloureds and the poorer Whites. I made inquiries at a supermarket today and bought this bag of mealie meal. This bag of 2,5 kg costs 22 cents. It used to cost 21 cents. Now, one cent may not seem such a difference for this bag of mealie meal, but consider the people in Dimbaza and Sada.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Walmer asked the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development&#x2014;he is smiling nicely at the moment&#x2014;what the rations were for the people living in those two resettlement areas. I understand that the rations are fixed at R2-50 per month per adult. He told us how the rations are divided up. For one month they get 9,07 kg of mealie meal and 3,628 kg of mealies. If you take the increase in the price of mealie meal at the supermarket, where the profits are cut, of one cent on 2,5 kg, it means that the rations to these people are now going to come down from 9,07 to 8,6 kg. Now, that is a big difference when you are living on rations of this nature, barely existing. I say that it is quite wrong, and we want to lodge our protest at this increase in the price of mealies and mealie meal, which is going to hit the poorer section of the population. We have to export&#x2014;with that I agree&#x2014;but we do not agree that the poorer section should have to subsidize the export of maize. I want to lodge our protest against it.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the main question is: Is the Opposition satisfied? The hon. member asked: &#x201C;Why bring down the price for the producer?&#x201D; We have stocks carried over from last year. This year&#x2019;s crop will be 130 million bags. Our consumption is 55 to 57 million bags. If we export the lot, the loss will be more than R60 million. Must the Government pay the R60 million, or should we accept the proposals of the Maize Board and let everyone make a contribution? The price of a bag has increased by 11&#x00BD; per cent. We keep the price for the producer at R3-70. Add the price of the bag, and you get R3-81&#x00BD;. He contributes 30 cents to the Stabilization Fund. That brings the price down to R3-51&#x00BD;. The consumer has to pay more. 11&#x00BD; cents for the bag, plus 10 cents to the Stabilization Fund for export losses. Everybody has to make contributions. I fully agree with the hon. member.</p>

<p>Whose money is that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The taxpayer&#x2019;s money. Do hon. members suggest that we should increase the subsidy and keep the consumer price at what it was before? We discussed this matter for hours and hours, because it is not easy to subsidize to this extent. We may have another 100 million bag crop next year, which may perhaps cost the taxpayer R20 million extra. Must I take it that the Opposition feels that we are subsidizing too little, or what is their suggestion? We cannot have it both ways. The hon. member said that we must not bring the price down for the producer, but what can be done when we have exported at a loss of R60 million? Who must pay for it? We are not unsympathetic towards the small man or the poor man. As it is, it is of the cheapest food in the world.</p>

<p>*It should be borne in mind that with this subsidy the Government has enabled the Maize Board to stock-pile the maize for two and perhaps three years. The Government pays the storage costs as well as the handling costs, losses and other costs of stock-piling the maize. It is not a pleasant thing that the price should drop when there are spiralling costs. What I want to ask the Opposition is this: If they are not satisfied with this subsidy of R38 million, because, if the crop is a little more, which I believe it will be, the subsidy will have to be R40 million, how much should it be then? Let the hon. member tell us what subsidy the Opposition suggests in respect of mealies.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Deputy Minister has misunderstood me. I am not arguing about the price being paid to the producer. I am not arguing about whether the producer is getting too much or too little and whether there should be a reduction in his price or not. What I am arguing about is who is to pay the subsidy for the export mealies.</p>

<p>I am surprised to hear an interjection like this. He said the Government is paying its share, but who is the government? The government is the taxpayer. But now you are making the poorer section of the people, those who cannot afford to pay taxes and who are living at subsistence level, subsidize the export of maize. If the Government has to give a subsidy for the export of maize it must get it from other taxpayers and not take it from the poorer sections of the population. This is the point I am trying to make. The people who cannot afford to pay are made to pay, not for luxuries and not for clothes, but for food. If one looks at the list of rations given to us by the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration, one realizes that they can barely exist on those rations.</p>

<p>But who is the taxpayer? The Government. What I object to is making the poorest section bear the cost of the subsidy. It is all right for that Minister sitting there with his hands in his pockets, because he does not have to live on 9 kilos of mealie meal and 3 kilos of mealies a month. He probably does not even eat mealie meal. He will be paying nothing towards the special levy paid by people who eat mealie meal. My protest is not that the producer should get less, that he should get more, or that we should not export our maize. My sole objection is that the poorest people are being made to pay and I want to record our objection to that.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Walmer is aware of the fact that we have introduced the stock withdrawal scheme, but that we did not know at that stage what interest would be shown in this stock withdrawal scheme. In the course of time we have found that more and more interest was being shown as a result of various factors of which the hon. member is aware. The Cabinet was kind enough to agree that an additional amount be voted so that the stock withdrawal scheme may be implemented further.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is quite obvious that the stock reduction scheme prove more attractive to farmers than the Government originally expected. There are more participants in this scheme than the Government expected and this is obviously why this extra amount has to be provided. On behalf of this side of the House, I just want to say that we fully support the extra expenditure that is involved. We believe the stock reduction scheme to be probably the best measure yet introduced to ensure the protection of our country&#x2019;s greatest heritage, viz. its soil. It is also probably the best long-term measure the Government has yet introduced. I might say that we on this side of the House, have pleaded for this measure. We feel that we also have a share in its implementation with a view to rehabilitating the small-stock industry in South Africa. Because there are, I believe, certain misconceptions about the stock reduction scheme, I want to take this opportunity to say a word or two about it. Firstly, there are those especially in the cities where most of our mutton is consumed, who think that the mutton shortage which is prevalent in the country at the present time, has arisen directly as a result of the introduction of the stock reduction scheme. I do not believe this to be the case.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_agriculture">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Tell that to your United Party candidates.</p>

<speech by="#kingwill">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>I am telling the hon. the Minister what the United Party&#x2019;s view is in respect of the stock reduction scheme. When I have finished, he will know exactly what our view is. I do not believe that the introduction of this scheme was responsible for the shortage of mutton. One of the factors that have effected the shortage of mutton and the present high price of mutton is the unprecedented drought which we have experienced during the years 1960 to 1970. The stock reduction scheme may have disrupted supplies in the short term, but it is interesting to note and I think the hon. the Deputy Minister will agree with me, that during the last two years we have been slaughtering in the region of 9 million sheep per annum, which is the highest slaughtering the country has done in spite of this stock reduction scheme. I think it is wise to say this year so that the people in the cities will realize that the introduction of this scheme is not the reason why they have to pay higher prices for mutton at this stage. What is important, especially in the long term&#x2014;I believe this ought also to be said&#x2014;is that another drought will come as sure as the sun will rise tomorrow and had this scheme not been introduced, we would have been faced in the pastoral industry with very severe losses to our small-stock in the country.</p>

<p>The country had got into the state where, unless something drastic was done, our veld would not have been able to sustain the sheep that were running and grazing there. I believe that, because we have had the scheme and because the farming community have co-operated&#x2014;I believe they have cooperated very well&#x2014;we have got the situation where, because of the bounteous rains we have experienced and the lesser number of sheep on the farms, there has been tremendous restoration and improvement taking place in the pastoral areas of our country. I say that, if the Government had not introduced this scheme, they may well have <span class="col_8643-8644" refersTo="page_1277"/>been confronted with far greater expenditure in trying to rescue drought stricken sheep in the future than will now be the case with the money they are appropriating. I believe that the total amount which will be spent, could be in the region of R12 million per annum. If one thinks that we are spending probably R250 million per annum on our physical defence and our security, then I say that the R12 million the Government is now spending on this scheme to protect our soil, which is after all basic and essential, is not really a very big investment. I believe it is not only an investment in the soil of South Africa by the State, but I think that, by introducing the scheme, the government has given every citizen of South Africa the opportunity to make an investment in the soil of South Africa. I believe that, for this reason, this scheme should not be done away with too hastily. I was not pleased when the Minister decided to terminate it, when he gave notice that there would be no new applicants allowed after the beginning of March, this year because I believe this scheme is so important that the Government must think very seriously before they terminate it altogether. I think it is a scheme that is of real value to the farming industry of South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the increase under subhead N is in respect of allowances to be paid out to the Bantu government of the Witsieshoek area. They are not yet financed in accordance with the new formula. Their finances still go through the South African Bantu Trust, but as from next year they will fall in the other group.</p>

<p>I hope from 1st April, 1973. They will then fall under the same group as the others, which falls under subhead O. The increase under subhead O is in respect of pensions of the seven Bantu governments concerned. These pensions must increase because of the announcement made by the hon. the Minister of Finance during his Budget debate. It makes it necessary to increase the pensions and children&#x2019;s allowances, in respect of children&#x2019;s homes only, for the seven Bantu governments concerned.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the Reynders Commission of inquiry into the promotion of our exports recently submitted its first interim report. In that report it deals with the financing costs assistance scheme which was started in the past, in 1970. The Reynders Commission has come to the conclusion that although proper provision exists for long-term exports, in other words, that the reinsurance scheme existing within the Department of Trade makes proper and effective provision for long-term projects, no proper financing scheme exists for the ordinary short-term exports. For that reason the Reynders Commission has suggested now that means be found of affording exporters the opportunity of being able to grant proper credit facilities to the persons to whom they export. Today I am not in a position to set out the details of this project as they still have to be worked out. What we are doing at this stage is to vote the necessary funds for that purpose. This project enables the exporters to provide proper credit facilities to the persons to whom they export. As I have said, full details in this regard will be given at a later stage. The amount of R4 875 000 for which provision is now being made, is supplementary to an amount of R1 125 000 already included in the existing Budget. It is the view of the Reynders Commission that the scheme they envisage will cost approximately R6 million. Therefore this additional amount of R4 875 000 together with the appropriation in the Budget makes provision for that amount of R6 million.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS AND OF REHOBOTH AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the account of R2 716 000 is, of course, the amount which is to be used by the Coloured Persons Representative Council to make provision for the increases in social pensions and allowances. These include old age pensions, the pensions for blind persons and the disabled as well as war veterans&#x2019; pensions. Provision is being made for approximately 101 000 cases. In addition there are the parents&#x2019; allowances and the childrens&#x2019; allowances. These things come to a total amount of R4 937 783 per annum. Then there is the extension of the means plus pension limit, which makes them qualify sooner for pensions at R30 per annum. This will have the effect that some people who did not qualify for pensions before will in fact qualify now. In this regard the amount is R219 300; and in addition we are making provision for an increase of approximately 5 per cent in the number of beneficiaries. This is calculated to come to a total of R5 432 000, but because the allowances will be paid as from 1st October, in other words, for six months only, the amount is R2 716 000. Exactly the same principle applies in South-West Africa. The only thing is that it is, of course, a much smaller amount.</p>

<heading>POLICE AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_police">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POLICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>From the long title it will be possible to deduce that the Bill deals with amendments which are for the most part of an administrative and internal nature. The exception is clause 6 which deals with the establishment of a Police Reserve.</p>

<p>The principle of course is by no means a new one. Hon. members will recall that I mentioned during the discussion of the Police Vote on 2nd June, 1971, that the Police were working on a scheme which could result in a far larger Reserve Police Force, but that I also warned hon. members not to conclude that the establishment of such a scheme was an accomplished fact.</p>

<p>Since then, and even before that time, hon. members on both sides of the House corresponded with me on the possibility of allocating a percentage of the national servicemen who are called up annually in terms of the Defence Act for military training, to the Police for basic police training and for subsequent national service in the South African Police for at least the periods to which they are liable to peacetime service in the South African Defence Force. This matter has been thoroughly researched, but for the present we have decided on the procedure as contained in the measure which is now before you.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Defence and his department is thoroughly aware of the problems with which the Police have to contend, and I have reached an agreement with the Minister of Defence to the effect that all persons who have served for a period of not less than six months in a permanent capacity in the Police Force will be exempted from compulsory military service, provided they are acceptable to the South African Police and are in fact incorporated in the proposed Police Reserve. There will obviously be those who are not suitable for Police service, and they are not in any way being exempted from compulsory military service. The proposed section 34A (9) relates to such persons.</p>

<p>Of course the principle in respect of a Reserve Police Force is not a new one either. Hon. members are aware that such a Reserve, consisting of civilians who are prepared to assist the Police Force voluntarily in time of emergency, and even in normal times, has existed since 1961. These persons are rendering excellent service, and statutory provisions which apply to the said reserve remain unchanged. Membership is of course confined to volunteers. In addition a Police Reserve of Officers has existed since 1964 which includes all persons who held the rank of officer in the Police.</p>

<p>Clause 6 provides that the existing Police Reserve of Officers be replaced by a Police Reserve. As has already been mentioned, a distinction must be drawn between this Police Reserve and the Reserve Police Force. The proposed Police Reserve will include all persons up to the age of 65 years who have served in the Force in a permanent capacity for a period of not less than six months. Subject to certain provisos, with which I shall subsequently deal, national service in this Reserve will be compulsory, but no person will be compelled <span class="col_8649-8650" refersTo="page_1280"/>to serve in a rank inferior to the rank in which he served in the Force in a permanent capacity&#x2014;cf. the proposed section 34A (4).</p>

<p>As hon. members know all citizens between the ages of 17 and 65 years, with the exception of some who hold specific posts may be called up for compulsory military service in the Defence Force. Under certain circumstances this may also include Police duties. Section 3 of the Defence Act (No. 44 of 1957) relates to this and, <i>inter alia,</i> section 97 of that Act grants exemption from military service to members of the South African Police Force. Since persons who are in fact incorporated in the Police Reserve will be members of the Police Force in terms of the proposed amended definitions of the &#x201C;Force&#x201D; and &#x201C;member of the Force&#x201D; (clause 1), they will therefore be exempted from military service.</p>

<p>The provisions of clause 6 are therefore in no way unfamiliar. All that is in fact being decreed is that instead of persons terminating their service in the Police Force and then being incorporated in the Defence Force or its reserves, they are now being incorporated in the Police Reserve and remain subject to the provisions of the Police Act. The essense of clause 6 is that&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) a member of the Police Reserve may be called up for Police service, if the Minister deems it necessary, for a period of not less than 30 days per annum within the first five years after he has terminated his permanent service in the Police Force;</li>

<li>(b) if the Minister is of the opinion that the public safety, the maintenance of public order or the protection of lives or property is seriously endangered, he may order any member of the Police Reserve, regardless of whether or not the period of five years has already elapsed, to report for service; and</li>

<li>(c) any member of the Police Reserve must notify the Commissioner of Police of his address or of any change of his address.</li>

</ol>

<p>The practice at present is to notify the South African Defence Force of all persons leaving the Police Force before attaining the age of 25 years, and in those cases the South African Defence Force acts in accordance with the provisions of section 67 of the Defence Act, i.e. they are incorporated either in the Citizen Force or the Commandos, and may also be called up for further compulsory military training and service. The average discharge figure (whether through resignation, retirement or for other reasons) amounts to 1 480 per annum, calculated over the last five years. Of this number approximately 300 return annually to the Force. The number of members who buy themselves out of the Force before having completed five years&#x2019; service, and who do not re-enter the Force, is calculated at approximately 700 per annum. Of the latter number approximately 300 annually are still liable to compulsory military training and they are, in terms of the existing arrangement, incorporated either in the South African Defence Force or with the Citizen Force or the Commandos. The remainder, i.e. those who are between the ages of 25 and 65 years, become part of the National Defence Force Reserve, and for all practical purposes are exempted from national service. Unless of course they are called up in time of war they are not specifically incorporated anywhere to render any service in the national interests in peacetime.</p>

<p>According to estimates the basic training of only one Police officer costs the State approximately R1 829. If an average number of only 500 persons annually, whose basic training cost R914 500, were added to the proposed Police Reserve, it would be possible to build up a strong Police Reserve of at least 2 500 over a period of five years, and the great expenditure would to a considerable extent have been justified.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I dealt with clause 6 first because, as I have already said, it contains the main amendment. Clause 1, to a certain extent clause 5, clause 7 and 8, all have a bearing on clause 6.</p>

<p>Clause 7 defines the obligations of employers of members of the proposed Reserve, makes provision for facilities to be afforded to a Reserve member so as to enable him to render service, and protect him as well as the employer against being prejudiced in any way. Here, too, there are no new principles at issue. In fact, these agree basically with the provisions of section 4 of the Defence Act, and section 11 of the Civil Defence Act, No. 39 of 1966.</p>

<p>Clause 8, i.e. proposed section 34C, is in fact a repetition of the provisions of the existing section 34<i>bis</i> which is substituted <span class="col_8651-8652" refersTo="page_1281"/>by the new section 34A (clause 6) of this Bill. This deals for the most part with remuneration and conditions of service which may be prescribed on the recommendation of the Public Service Commission, and with approval of the Treasury.</p>

<p>The clauses which do not relate to the proposed Police Reserve, are the following:</p>

<p>Clause 2, which makes provision for replicas of the signatures of the State President and the Minister on commissions issued upon the appointment of officers. This will obviate large numbers of commissions having to be signed personally by the State President. Section 83 of the Defence Act already contains a corresponding provision.</p>

<p>Clause 3: With a view to the establishment of a Police Reserve it is essential that the failure to comply with notices issued in terms of clause 6 should be punishable. Furthermore, the powers of the Commissioner in respect of the application of discipline are being expanded. In departmental disciplinary hearings his competence in respect of appeal or revision of conviction and sentence is at present restricted to the quashing of the conviction or, on the contrary, the confirmation or reduction of the sentence. For example he has no power, in the case of a main and alternative charge, to amend a conviction on the main charge to that of the alternative or, where a divisional commissioner has reduced a sentence, to bring it into line with the sentence of the trial officer if he is of the opinion that the correct sentence was, on the basis of the evidence, imposed in the first place. The proposed amendment will bring the review and appeal competence in regard to disciplinary hearings into line with those which apply to criminal cases in terms of section 369 of the Criminal Procedure Act, No. 56 of 1955.</p>

<p>The amendment in clause 4 is necessary because articles which are sold in Police canteens are not exempted from sales duty, and to ensure absolute clarity in regard to the intention of the legislature.</p>

<p>Clause 5 extends the powers of the State President to make regulations in respect of&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) the research laboratory of the South African Police which deals, <i>inter alia</i>, with the analysis of hair and other exhibits which are of importance in regard to the solution of crime;</li>

<li>(b) registers for, and the duties of members of the Police Reserve on which clause 6 has a bearing; and</li>

<li>(c) the more effective control of funds, such as the Widow and Orphans Fund, established for the South African Police.</li>

</ol>

<p>Clause 9 contains the short title of the Act and provides that various provisions may come into operation on different dates, as fixed by proclamation.</p>

<p>After what I have just said, you will understand that by far the most important objective of this measure is that the Police Force should have a Reserve which has been specially trained for Police tasks and which will be available in a time of abnormal disturbances.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Bill has the support of this side of the House. Indeed, any attempt to boost the reserves of our Police Force in these troubled times will have our support. This is in many ways a compromise, as the hon. the Minister has indicated, between the thoughts which have been expressed from both sides of the House, apparently, that one should use a number of the trainees under the Defence Act and train them in the Police Force; so that they do their basic training there and their camps every year as well. This is a compromise which has been arrived at, and it has our blessing and our support.</p>

<p>What this Bill really does, as the hon. the Minister has indicated, is to provide for a new Police Reserve, as opposed to the reserve police force, which is known as a Police Reserve at the moment, comprising those persons who have retired from the Force and those who have resigned. So we are going to have a force, Sir, of the &#x201C;old and bold&#x201D; who have retired and the &#x201C;young and unsung&#x201D;, who have resigned early. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s estimate of the number he is going to have, which he thought would be thousand, is going to remain at that figure. I think one thing is clear: As the hon. the Minister has indicated, a number of people have joined the Police Force, stayed there for a certain minimum period, and thereby avoided having to do any military service thereafter for the next ten or 16 years, or whatever it may be. I believe that the effect of this measure, namely that <span class="col_8653-8654" refersTo="page_1282"/>you will not be able to escape your responsibility any more&#x2014;you can be called up for the next five years for 30 days at a time at least, and in addition for other periods, if the Minister deems it necessary &#x2014;is going to be that those persons who joined the Force in order to avoid military training, will be dissuaded from doing so in the future. So I think that that number is going to come down. I hope that indeed it will have that effect. But it is going to affect the strength of this extra reserve.</p>

<p>There are a few points which we would like to suggest in the Committee Stage, which will improve this Bill; but at this stage we support it. Our experience is quite clearly that in matters of internal disorder, the best vehicle for maintaining and restoring law and order internally, is our Police Force, to whom I would like to pay tribute this afternoon for the manner in which they have done their duty internally in the most difficult circumstances. We are pleased that the service of persons experienced in and subject to the discipline of this Force will be retained for at least five years. We will support the Bill in this stage.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I wish to associate myself with the words of my hon. colleague here and to welcome the Minister&#x2019;s most lucid explanation on introducing this Bill. Apart from updating and streamlining the Police Act with a view to improving efficiency in the relentless fight against crime, this Bill deals also with the maintenance of law and order. The idea of the establishment of a Police Reserve as provided for in clause 6 we welcome whole-heartedly. As the Minister has said, it is nothing new. Sophisticated countries overseas have had Police reserves, and the example of Great Britain in this respect is a very good one. We know that there they perform full-time in the case of local and national emergencies. Indeed, this Bill also serves to extend the existing Police Reserve of officers which the Minister mentioned, to all ranks of ex-members with service of not less than six months and not over the age of 65 years of age. We see this reserve of fully-trained, experienced and professional men as of inestimable value to South Africa&#x2019;s first line of defence, viz. the Police. Furthermore, we welcome the limitation of service to five years as from the date of discharge or retirement, as this will ensure a constant flow of fresh blood into the reserve, thereby minimizing the possibility of any stagnation. According to present figures, as the Minister has shown, there will be an annual inflow of over 1 000 Whites, and I take it this reserve is going to be extended to the non-Whites as well. We welcome this aspect of the measure as well. This is going to be a Force of specialists not to be trifled with and of great value to this country.</p>

<p>We also welcome the provisions made regarding the duties of employers towards reservists, as well as the obligations of the reservist towards his employer. Without these, the whole scheme would be placed in an unfavourable light.</p>

<p>Last, but by no means least, we welcome the provisions made for the remuneration of members of the Police Reserve and trust that not only adequate, but also generous provision will be made for those who might be injured or killed in service of their country.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_police">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POLICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to express my appreciation for the support this measure has received. I think there is in fact only one important point which was raised by both the hon. gentlemen who spoke, and in regard to which I can in any way comment, and that is the expected number of persons we will have in this Police Reserve. The hon. member for Durban Point mentioned that since they are now required to serve on the Police Reserve it may perhaps have a prejudicial effect on the numbers recruited. I have another expectation. I want to argue that persons who have joined the Police and then retired, were not previously exempted from national service altogether, and they should have rejoined one of the military units. We are now giving the assurance that the person who joins the South African Police and receives training for a period of not less than six months&#x2014;it may be more than six months&#x2014;will subsequently be incorporated in the S.A.P. for national service. So, I think that there will be sufficient numbers of people who will be interested in Police work and who will prefer to do their national service with the Police than with the Defence Force perhaps, and that we will then be able to draw a certain percentage of those people into our Police Reserve in this way. We give them the assurance, when they join and are incorporated in the Police, that they need undergo no further national service training. <span class="col_8655-8656" refersTo="page_1283"/>I have another additional expectation, if I may express it, which is that a young man may perhaps join the Police and regard service in the Police Force as his national service, but once he is there, he may find the Police Force so attractive that he will remain in it. I sincerely hope that I will in this way be able to attract more men to the Police Force in a full-time capacity, more than I have attracted before. Then, too, I want to point out to hon. members that we will also have the advantage of all those who retire at the age of 55 years. We are in fact being inundated today by ex-police officers who retire at 55 years, and would like to stay on. Everyone who now retires at the age of 55 remains on in the Police Reserve until they reach the age of 65. This will also be a fundamental supplementation of this Police Reserve.</p>

<heading>PREVENTION AND COMBATING OF POLLUTION OF THE SEA BY OIL AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Shortly after the publication in the <i>Government Gazette</i> in 1971 of the Prevention and Combating of Pollution of the Sea by Oil Act, it was brought to the attention of the Department of Industries that the Government would forfeit all its right to put in claims in terms of CRISTAL&#x2014;that is the international insurance scheme established by the oil cargo owners of the world in April, 1971&#x2014;if the Act were to be put into operation in its present form.</p>

<p>In this regard I should like to explain that there are two voluntary insurance schemes in terms of which claims in connection with oil pollution of the sea and beaches may be put in, viz.: (a) TOVA-LOP, which was established by the world&#x2019;s tanker owners in October, 1969. In terms of this scheme national governments may claim up to a maximum amount of $10 000 000 per incident. The scheme only pays out in cases where the owner or commander of the tanker was negligent. The onus to prove the contrary rests on the latter; and (b) CRISTAL, which has already been mentioned and which was established only in April, 1971, by the world&#x2019;s oil cargo owners. This scheme is supplementary to TOVALOP and claims up to a total maximum amount of $30 000 000 per incident may be put in by governments and private individuals in terms of this scheme. This scheme considers all reasonable claims, whether there was negligence or not. In terms of its articles of association the following amounts, <i>inter alia</i>, first have to be deducted from the amounts it pays out to governments: (i) the amount a government receives from TOVALOP in pursuance of a claim and (ii) the amount a government collects in terms of its national laws directly from an owner of a tanker or an owner of the cargo in connection with an incident of pollution. The present South African legislation makes provision for the Government to put in claims against an owner of a tanker for oil pollution damage, but no maximum amounts are prescribed. International shipping insurance, however, provides over up to a maximum amount only and since the operation of CRISTAL is based, from the nature of the case, on the operations of and the limitations imposed by first mentioned, the Government was informed that it (CRISTAL), technically speaking, would not be authorized to consider claims from the South African Government. The argument was advanced that the claims of the Government could amount to any amount exceeding $30 000 000.</p>

<p>Therefore the main object of this amending Bill is to prescribe the maximum amount which the Government may claim from an owner of a tanker and to make it (the Government) qualify in that way for the right to put in claims in terms of CRISTAL. The necessary provision for this is being made in clauses 2 (a) and 3 of the Bill. What it amounts to in effect is that claims up to a maximum amount of $10 000 000 may be put in per incident. CRISTAL indeed makes provision for the payment of claims up to a maximum amount of $30 000 000 per incident, but it should be borne in mind that that involves, <i>inter alia</i>, the reductions to which I have just referred and, moreover, that it is not only national governments but also private <span class="col_8657-8658" refersTo="page_1284"/>persons who may claim <i>pro rata</i> from CRISTAL.</p>

<p>At the same time we are taking this opportunity to effect a few other amendments. These amendments concern more particularly the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><i>Clause</i> 1: The object of the proposed insertion of the underlined words in section 3 (1) (a) and (b) is merely to enable the Minister to give an owner or commander of a tanker, also in suspicious circumstances, certain instructions so as to prevent oil pollution.</block>

<block name="quote"><i>Clause 2 (b):</i> The contents of the proposed new subsection (2) in section 4 of the principal Act are really obvious. It merely makes provision for such portions of deposits made by owners of tankers and not required by the Minister for the removal of oil pollution, to be refunded to the owner of the tanker concerned. Similarly it is being provided that guarantees are to be cancelled after the Minister&#x2019;s expenses have been repaid to him in terms of given guarantees. The amendment is being effected, for the sake of clarity, at the request of the overseas bodies concerned (TOVALOP and CRISTAL).</block>

<block name="quote"><i>Clause 4:</i> Section 7 of the existing Act authorizes certain authorized persons to carry out inspections on board a suspicious ship. The scope of these inspections is now being extended in terms of the amendment so that samples of the oil on board a ship may also be taken.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we will support this Bill. The interesting thing about it, I think, is that it clearly illustrates the hazards of oil pollution with which the modern world is faced today. Here you have two organizations, TOVALOP and CRISTAL, who have undertaken to meet insurance claims, in the one case up to $10 000 000 and in the other up to $30 000 000 whether there is negligence or not. I think this highlights the problems with which we are going to be faced, particularly at this point of Africa, in the years to come, through the hazards of oil pollution, certainly until such time as the Suez Canal is opened again and probably even thereafter, because the big tankers will probably continue to come round the Cape.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister has given us a detailed description of the purpose of this Bill. There is no need for me to reiterate its provisions. I think we will from time to time have amendments to Acts of this nature as the world becomes more knowledgeable, not only of the hazards, but of ways to deal with the hazards of oil pollution around the coasts of the world. The one interesting thing in this Bill is the reference to an amount of 140 million gold francs. I must admit that when I first read this Bill, I had no knowledge whatsoever of what 140 million gold francs meant. I am informed that 140 million gold francs is the equivalent of 10 million dollars. That puts it in some perspective.</p>

<heading>COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>As hon. members will recall I agreed to the Community Development Bill (No. AB 39 &#x2014; &#x2019;72), which was initially introduced during this session, being referred to a Select Committee of the House.</p>

<p>However, the Bill which was initially introduced contained a number of amendments to existing measures which are deemed necessary for the effective implementation of the duties of the Community Development Board, and which have nothing to do with the new principle in regard to urban renewal by a private developer. This new principle, as contained in clauses <span class="col_8659-8660" refersTo="page_1285"/>1 (b) and 5 of the initial Bill, is in fact the matter which has to receive attention from the Select Committee.</p>

<p>Consequently the Select Committee has consolidated those clauses in the initial Bill which have nothing to do with the principle of urban renewal by a private developer, in the Bill which is at present before you so that they may be considered by the House. The principle of urban renewal by a private developer (i.e. clauses 1 (b) and 5 of the initial Bill) is at present still receiving the attention of the Select Committee.</p>

<p>As I have just said, the Bill which is at present before the House comprises the clauses contained in the initial Bill. The Select Committee effected certain amendments and made certain additions with which I am in full agreement.</p>

<p>I explained the clauses when dealing with the initial Bill in this House, and I shall therefore, to refresh the memory, deal only briefly with these provisions.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 1 (a):</p>

<p>This amendment deals with the prevention of physical decay. As already mentioned to the House this matter was investigated by a representative committee and the relevant amendments now provide the necessary machinery to establish preventative measures against physical decay.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 1 (b):</p>

<p>At present section 15 (5) (b) prescribes that the costs of arbitration shall be determined in terms of section 23 of the Slums Act, 1934. However, this is confusing and is not conductive to efficiency. Efficient provisions in regard to the costs of arbitration in the case of expropriation are contained in section 45 of the Community Development Act, and consequently an amendment is now being effected so that arbitration cases in terms of section 15 (5) (a) shall now be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of section 45 as well.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 1 (c):</p>

<p>In the practical application of section 15 (5) there is lack of clarity in regard to the determination of the &#x201C;price&#x201D; mentioned in the section, particularly when cases are referred to arbitration. In order to ensure clarity therefore an addition is now being made to subsection (5). Since there may be a difference in the market value as at the date when the area is frozen and the date on which the Board exercises its preferent rights, it is being provided that the price shall not exceed whichever of the two market values is the greater.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 2:</p>

<p>Section 16 of the Community Development Act, 1966, provides that when the Community Development Board has acquired all the premises in a township or part of a township, ownership in all the public places is vested in the Board. &#x201C;Public place&#x201D; is defined in the section as the land comprising any street, road, square, thoroughfare, etc., shown on the general plan of a township. It is now being found that in certain cases where the Board is engaged in extensive urban renewal, no general plan for the township exists, with the result that the ownership in the public places, where the Board has acquired all the premises, does not vest in the Board. Since it is clearly the object of the Act that where the Board becomes the owner of the premises, it should also become the owner of the public places, the mere fact that the public places are not shown on the general plan should not stand in the way of the Board acquiring the public places so that it may proceed to the redevelopment of the area.</p>

<p>In addition the definition of &#x201C;township&#x201D; does not comply with the requirements of the Board where it has to take action in urban renewal areas. However, the Deeds Registries Act, 1937, contains a subsequent definition of &#x201C;township&#x201D; which is far more comprehensive and which will therefore cover any problematical cases the Board may encounter.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 3:</p>

<p>This addition to section 41 is being effected to enable the Board to compensate an owner whose property has been expropriated or an owner from whom affected property has been purchased, or from whom a property has been purchased in a frozen area, for any actual financial loss or any inconvenience caused by the expropriation or the acquisition of the property.</p>

<p><span class="col_8661-8662" refersTo="page_1286"/><i>Clause</i> 4:</p>

<p>This amendment is being proposed in order to bring the Community Development Act into line with the provision in this respect contained in the Expropriation Act.</p>

<p>Furthermore, since the Board is required to pay compensation for the expropriated property, and the Board is continually seeking to determine and pay out the compensation as quickly as possible, there is no reason why the payment of compensation should impede registration in the name of the Board, and in this way hold up projects involving thousands of rands. Consequently paragraph (b) of subsection (3) of section 43 is being deleted.</p>

<p>Since the amendments contained in the Bill before the House are of a nature requiring expeditious treatment, I wish with this to thank the Select Committee for the urgent attention it has devoted to this matter in order to make it possible for the Bill to be before the House today.</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as the hon. the Minister has informed the House, this Bill deals with certain clauses of a non-controversial nature which were in the original Bill, AB 39 &#x2014; &#x2019;72, which was referred to a Select Committee earlier in this session. Because of the wish of the department that these clauses be dealt with during this session, the Select Committee dealt with them separately, leaving the main clauses to do with urban renewal by private developers to be dealt with at a later stage. Certain amendments were agreed upon in the Select Committee which in our submission improve the relevant clauses, and I am pleased that the hon. the Minister has indicated that he supports these amendments. This side of the House supports the Bill, but I wish to draw to the attention of the House, and particularly to the attention of the hon. the Minister, certain matters raised by the South African Property Owners&#x2019; Association subsequent to the matter being dealt with by the Select Committee which, I think, warrant consideration, particularly in view of the fact that this is a responsible body representative of a large number of property owners of South Africa. One of the points which they raised is, I believe, of particular importance because it would seem that perhaps we on the Select Committee over looked an important consequence of one of the amendments which was suggested by the Select Committee and which is embodied in this Bill. That amendment deals with clause 4 of the Bill, which amends section 43 of the principal Act. Section 43 of the principal Act deals with the registration of transfer of affected properties expropriated by the board. As originally proposed in the Bill referred to the Select Committee, it was proposed that that section be amended by the substitution of certain words at the beginning of subsection (1), which are not relevant to the point which I wish to make. Then it was to be amended by the deletion of subsection (3) (b)&#x2014;no, I beg your pardon, Mr. Speaker, in the Bill which was referred to the Select Committee, it was proposed to delete altogether subsection (3), that is to say, to delete the necessity, before transfer of the property expropriated, to satisfy the registrar by way of a certificate signed on behalf of the board, that the procedures had been observed and that all amounts payable by the board on the transaction had either been paid or guaranteed. The Select Committee suggested that subsection (3) (a) should remain and that subsection (3) (b), only, be deleted.</p>

<p>The South African Property Owners Association, in a letter addressed to the chairman of the Select Committee, the hon. member for Parow, a copy of which I believe has been sent to the hon. the Minister, points out that the effect of this is to leave the mortgagee completely unprotected. I believe that, in fact, this is the case. It is, of course, a serious fault of this clause and I suggest that it must be amended, because it is right that a mortgagee, with the real right that he has, should receive the protection which he normally gets under a mortgage bond. Let me explain why it is that he is unprotected. I asked the hon. the Minister to look at subsection (1) (b) of section 43. This provides, if we adopt the present wording, that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The notice whereby expropriation is effected under section 39 shall be authority for the registrar of deeds to register transfer of the property in question in the name of the board and the registrar of deeds shall, subject to the provisions of section 31 of the Deeds Registries Act &#x2026; upon the request of the board in writing&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li><span class="col_8663-8664" refersTo="page_1287"/>(a) register the transfer to the board of the property in question; and</li>

<li>(b) if such property is subject to any bond, endorse upon the bond and note in the appropriate records that the property is released therefrom.</li>

</ol>

<p>&#x201C;Therefrom&#x201D; means from the bond. Subsection (1) (b) remains the same. I pointed out that that remains the same and that it has not been changed, but the effect is important because as the section stood, before, it was perfectly all right to release the property from the bond because in the original Act subsection (3) (b) read that before transfer could be effected the registrar had to receive a certificate that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All amounts payable by the board on the transaction have been paid or guaranteed.</block>

<p>Clearly one of the amounts payable by the board on the transaction would be the amount owing to the mortgagee. It was all right to release the property from the bond because that subsection provided that the board had to guarantee the amount and therefore the mortgagee remained protected. What is being done now is to delete (b). Therefore, there is no need now for the registrar to receive a certificate that the amounts payable by the board on the transaction had been paid or guaranteed. If we look at that in conjunction with section 42 of the Act, we see that section 42 (1) provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any compensation for immovable property expropriated shall, subject to the provisions of section 38, be paid to the owner of such property, if his address is known.</block>

<p>If it is not known, there is the procedure for paying it into court. Let us take the case where the address is known. The amount must be paid to the owner. Once we delete this provision regarding the guarantee, the mortgagee is left completely unprotected. I do submit that there is substance in this argument and that in fact the South African Property Owners&#x2019; Association is correct that this is a consequence which was possibly overlooked when this matter was considered. I think it could be remedied by adopting a somewhat similar provision to the provision which exists in the Expropriation Act where the position is as follows. Section 5 (1) of the Expropriation Act of 1965, Act No. 55 of 1965, provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If any property is expropriated in terms of section <i>two</i>, the ownership in such property shall, on the date stated on the notice in question, vest in the State, released from all mortgage bonds &#x2026;</block>

<p>In other words, we have a similar provision there, but the Expropriation Act does contain a further section, section 11, which secures the position of the mortgagee. Section 11 which is titled &#x201C;Discharge of debt secured by mortgage bond over land&#x201D;, provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If any land expropriated in terms of this Act was encumbered by a registered mortgage bond immediately prior to such expropriation, the Minister shall, subject to the provisions of section 11A, not pay out any portion of the compensation money in question, except to such person and on such terms as may have been agreed upon between the owner of that land and the mortgagee and as the Minister may have been notified of in writing by them.</block>

<p>I would not suggest the adoption of a precisely similar section because in the case where the owner cannot be found it is impossible for the mortgagee and the owner to agree as to how much the mortgagee is entitled. The mortgagee may not be able to obtain payment. But I do believe that a provision along lines similar to these should be inserted in the present Bill to protect the position of the mortgagee and I will suggest some amendment in the Committee Stage. Then, Sir, there is also the question of the rights of persons holding real rights other than mortgage bonds, the rights of persons such as fiduciaries, usufructuaries, possibly persons with registered leases and persons with water and mineral rights. I think that some provision should be made regarding them also, and perhaps a note could be placed on the title deeds to the effect that these rights continue until such time as adequate compensation has been settled in respect of them between the holders of the rights and the board. Sir, there are those two aspects which I think require consideration in respect of the amendment proposed in clause 4.</p>

<p><span class="col_8665-8666" refersTo="page_1288"/>Then there are certain other matters which the South African Property Owners&#x2019; Association raised and which I think are worthy of consideration. Firstly, in respect of clause 1 (a), they proposed that in the amendment which was accepted by the Select Committee, namely that before steps to prevent decay are taken, there should be consultation with the local authority, the words &#x201C;after consultation&#x201D; should be changed to &#x201C;with the approval&#x201D;. In other words, they proposed that there should be the active consent of the local authority, not merely a unilateral reference, which is the case if one is merely required to consult. There is, I would suggest, some substance in this proposal, especially in view of the fact that the hon. the Minister has pointed out on many occasions that he wishes the local authorities to participate in urban renewal and slum clearance and so forth and, in fact, would like them to play a greater role than they are playing at present. In view of this, I would ask the hon. the Minister to give some consideration to this suggestion and to indicate what his views are in this regard.</p>

<p>Then in regard to clause 3, the amendment which has been accepted by the Select Committee now makes it obligatory upon the board to add compensation if it is necessary to do so in order to make good any actual financial loss or inconvenience caused by the expropriation. Previously, under the clause which was submitted to the Select Committee, this was merely in the discretion of the board. I suggest that this is an important and satisfactory change, but I would point out that subsection (3) remains, which reads that the amount determined by the board under paragraph (b) is final, that is to say, the amount to make good actual financial loss or inconvenience. The South African Property Owners&#x2019; Association suggest that this amount should be subject to review by or appeal to a competent court of law, or to arbitration in the case of the amount of compensation. In the case of the amount of compensation which is awarded, that amount is subject to arbitration in terms of other provisions of the Community Development Act, and it is submitted that the amount added to the compensation to make good actual financial loss or inconvenience should likewise be the subject of arbitration or review by a court of law, because this is part and parcel of the amount which the owner of the property expropriated is entitled to receive in respect of the expropriation. This is a matter which, I must tell the Committee quite frankly, was put to the Select Committee. After discussion the Select Committee unanimously passed the clause in the form in which it now appears. But in view of the fact that this proposal has again been repeated by the South African Property Owners&#x2019; Association which, as I have indicated, is a responsible body representing a large number of persons who are concerned, I do think that it is worthy of further consideration, and I would ask the hon. the Minister to give further consideration to it and to agree to amend the clause along these lines.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as I have indicated, we support this Bill. We would, however, urge the hon. the Minister to give consideration to these matters which I have drawn to the attention of the House. I do submit that if these clauses are amended along the lines I have suggested, it would make the Bill an even better one than the Bill we have before the House at the moment.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I want to thank the hon. member for Musgrave and his side of the House for their support of this Bill in its present form. In regard to the objections raised by the hon. member, principally as a result of representations made by SAPOA, it does seem to me as if there might be some merit in his representations, particularly as far as clause 4 is concerned. The hon. member states that under clause 4 the mortgagee is not afforded any protection. It is not quite clear to me at the moment whether this is true or not, but I shall go into this matter very carefully. I think it is essential that the mortgagee should enjoy protection. I shall go into this matter, and if the mortgagee is not being afforded the necessary protection, I am quite willing to discuss this with the hon. member again during the Committee Stage. As far as clause 1 (a) is concerned, the question of physical decay, the hon. member made the point that there should not only be consultation with the local authority, but that the local authority should give its consent when steps are taken to prevent that decay. I do not think that that is a very good point. The entire object of this legislation is to place the Community Development Board in a position to prevent physical decay, even if the local authority does not want to give the necessary attention to the matter, and I am afraid that the proposal made by the hon. <span class="col_8667-8668" refersTo="page_1289"/>member for Musgrave would place the Development Board entirely at the mercy of the local authority, and I am not quite certain that this would be the correct thing to do. But this point as well can be discussed further by us in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>The hon. member then referred to the payment for any inconvenience and actual financial loss. Whether this should be made subject to an appeal to a court or to arbitration, is a question we can discuss. I do not know whether an appeal to a court is in fact necessary. But whereas an agreement cannot be reached in regard to the amount, it does not seem to me to be an entirely unreasonable standpoint that this should be made subject to arbitration. I shall give attention to this matter as well, and we can then discuss it further during the Committee Stage. Further to that, it seems to me as if there is no difference in regard to the basic principles of the Bill. Once again my sincere thanks to the hon. member and to the Select Committee for the good work they have done.</p>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_coloured_affairs_">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>As I explained in connection with the Amendment Bill, which was introduced in 1970, it is necessary, in the light of experience, for the Coloured Persons Representative Council Act, 1964, to be supplemented from time to time to adapt it as the Constitution of the Council and to ensure that the activities of the Council and its administrative machinery function with proper smoothness. I want to give the assurance that there is no unnecessary tampering with that Act. On the contrary, certain amendments, which are now being moved, were already considered and recommended last year by the executive of the Coloured Persons Representative Council. Owing to a full legislative programme, however, it was not possible to introduce this during the 1971 parliamentary session. The principles contained in this Bill can best be explained by dealing with each clause separately.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 1:</p>

<p>In Act No. 49 of 1964 there is no provision about the period of office of the Council, there merely being a provision that members hold office for five years from the date of their election or nomination. The periods of office of elected and nominated members do not, however, start on the same date and therefore they do not cover the same period. It is felt that a reference to the period of office of council members as such is inadequate, and in order to eliminate the practical problems, which this shortcoming entails, a law amendment is being moved to make provision for the duration of each Council to be 5 years, commencing on the date on which the first council met for the first time, i.e. 20th November, 1969.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 2:</p>

<p>At present the Act provides that council members must take the prescribed oath before a magistrate. Owing to practical considerations it is now being proposed that provision be made for a member, who is taking his seat after the first sitting-day of a new Council, to take the oath before the Chairman of the Council in accordance with the procedure in this House.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 3:</p>

<p>As has been mentioned in connection with clause 1, the existing section 12 (1) of the Act provides that a member of the Council holds his seat for a period of five years from the date on which he is elected or nominated. Unless this section is adapted it will be incompatible with the proposed provision in clause 1 of this Bill to the effect that the duration of each Council shall be five years, and we therefore propose to provide that members hold their seats until such date as the Council, which they are members of, is dissolved by effluxion of time. This amendment will also eliminate the problem of the disproportionate termination of service, a problem that can occur now.</p>

<p><span class="col_8669-8670" refersTo="page_1290"/><i>Clause</i> 4:</p>

<p>For the same reasons applicable in the case of Parliament and provincial councils, it is also necessary, in the case of the Coloured Persons Representative Council, to provide that in the interim period between dissolution by effluxion of time and the constitution of a new Council, the Council may continue with its business and that membership of the Council continues for that purpose. Since the Council is largely moulded according to the procedures of the House of Assembly and provincial councils, it is therefore proposed that the provisions of sections 53 and 71 (2) of the Constitution of the Republic be followed in respect of the Coloured Persons Representative Council.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 5:</p>

<p>The proviso in section 17 (6) (c) of Act No. 49 of 1964, as it reads at present, provides that the Minister of Coloured Affairs may so delegate any such power conferred upon him by any provisions of the Public Service Act or the Coloured Persons Education Act only in respect of persons who are not Whites and only to the chairman of the executive of the Coloured Council. The reference to the Education Act is linked in this sentence to the Public Service Act, which exclusively relates to staff matters, and it was also the intention with this proviso to only give the chairman of the executive powers in respect of non-White staff, powers that rest with the Minister of Coloured Affairs in terms of the Public Service Act or the Education Act &#x2014;in other words, only in respect of staff matters. However, legal advisors are of the opinion that the projected proviso, as it reads at present, must be interpreted as stating that any power that the Minister derives from the Education Act, or the regulations made under it, may only be delegated to the chairman of the executive. This means that powers in respect of the largest branch of the activities of the Coloured Persons Representative Council, i.e. education, cannot be delegated as in the case of other smaller branches, and that in practice the member of the executive entrusted with education is, as it were, put out of action. If this were to continue it would cause an insufferable state of affairs in the executive, and an amendment of the said proviso is therefore being moved in order to put the matter right. Since the validity of certain powers, which were delegated in the past to the said member of the executive, is being disputed by legal opinion, a correction is being proposed with retrospective effect from the date on which the first delegation took place, i.e. 31st October, 1969.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 6:</p>

<p>At present there is no legal provision (which is a requirement) according to which the council can decide to grant powers to the Chairman of the Executive for virement authorization and the issuing of a warrant in respect of the combating of unforeseen and urgent expenditure. Such action is essential for successful financial management. Virement authorization, for example, is granted annually in the Appropriation Act to the Minister of Finance, and in terms of legal authorization the State President and the Administrators of the four provinces issue warrants. In the case of the Coloured Council consideration was given to legalizing these essential powers by regulation, but that method was not acceptable to the legal advisors. The projected additions to the Act will consequently have to be made.</p>

<p>Paragraph (c) of clause 6 provides that if the Council, for some or other unforeseen reason, fails to provide by resolution the funds generally voted by Parliament, the executive may do so. If the Executive also fails to do so, the Minister of Coloured Affairs is vested with the necessary powers to implement the Budget. The only motive for this amendment, the necessity for which is also felt in Council circles and supported by the Executive, is that the necessary funds must be available at all times for the continuation of existing services for which the Council is responsible, for example education and welfare for Coloureds, to mention but a few. Mr. Speaker, I do not have to elaborate on what could happen if the Council failed to appropriate moneys for the services of the Council. Someone will have to be able to take over in such a case, with the proviso, however, that this body may not introduce any new services that have not previously been authorized.</p>

<p>As a result of overspending by the Council during the 1970-&#x2019;71 financial year, the Select Committee on Public Accounts, 1972, pointed out in its Second Report that it deems it necessary that the relative bodies investigate the accountability in respect of parliamentary appropriations to <span class="col_8671-8672" refersTo="page_1291"/>the Council so that if it is thought necessary amending legislation can be submitted to Parliament. The findings of the Treasury, which instituted the inquiry, were that although the present statutory provisions adequately covered the situation and there is no justification for a change in the accountability arrangements, it is nevertheless desirable for the following amendments to be made to the Coloured Persons Representative Council Act, 1964, to clarify the relationship as far as accountability is concerned and to relieve certain bottlenecks: (a) An amendment of section 22 (3) so that an over-drawing of the Council&#x2019;s bank account may be granted with the approval of the Minister of Coloured Affairs, acting in consultation with the Minister of Finance. This provision is necessary because if there should be a repetition of a situation such as that investigated by the Select Committee, this may give rise to the Council&#x2019;s bank account being overdrawn; (b) Amendments to sections 22 (3) and (4) so that it is permissible for the unspent balances, to a maximum of R500 000, in the books of the Coloured Persons Representative Council not to have to be repaid at the end of a financial year into the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Thereby greater flexibility will be obtained and as yet unauthorized expenditure, awaiting the proper authorization and condonation, can provisionally be covered by available balances in the Council&#x2019;s account; (c) An amendment to section 22 (6) to require that apart from submission to the Council, it must also be possible to table in Parliament. through the agency of the Minister of Finance, any report of the Controller and Auditor-General concerning the accounts of the Coloured Persons Representative Council for reference to the Select Committee on Public Accounts. With a view to this I shall move an amendment to clause 6 (f) in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>The above amendment is contained in paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) of clause 6 of the Bill.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 7:</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the reasonably flexible wording of section 26 of the Act, it was found in practice that the subjects about which the Minister can issue regulations are, in actual fact, exceptionally limited. To make provision for existing and unforeseen circumstances, it is consequently being proposed that a subsection, similar to those in other Acts of Parliament, be added to eliminate the shortcomings in the Act.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to conclude by saying that this Bill is merely intended to lay down essential procedures. As far as certain provisions are concerned, we have even drawn liberally from the existing procedures and provisions of this House. I therefore want to express the hope that the Bill will be considered against that background.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is a tragedy that the Government should have to introduce legislation of this kind in order to prop up an ailing council which, had it been allowed to function on a proper democratic basis, would not have required the interference of the Minister in this manner or at any stage. Apart from some administrative matters which the hon. the Minister mentioned in his Second Reading speech, what he is really doing here is taking plenary powers in the event of an emergency. It is part of the irony of history that the idea of controlling the activities and the approach of the council by nominating 20 members, to whom the hon. the Deputy Minister referred yesterday, has now boomeranged right back into the Government&#x2019;s face. Far from the system of nominated members helping to maintain a balance and stability within the council and over the conduct of its affairs, the very system which the hon. the Minister instituted in 1964 is now clearly endangering the foundations of the council itself and turning its proceedings into a kind of farce. Only this Government could have had so little imagination not to realize that this was inevitable. The Coloured people are not fools. They exercised political rights with us, as the hon. the Minister knows, for a 100 years before this council was introduced, here in the Cape.</p>

<p>In so far as an analysis of the Bills concerned, we have no real objection to the practical administrative changes contained in clauses 1 to 5. The real principle of the amendment, of course, is contained in clause 6. Subsection (a) of clause 6 allows for the transfer of surplus funds under one head of the budget to meet a deficit under another head. We do not think that this power should rest in the hands of the chairman of the council alone. It should surely be vested in the executive committee and I hope that the hon. the Minister <span class="col_8673-8674" refersTo="page_1292"/>will consider this matter when we come to the committee stage. The whole reason for the Bill is contained in subsection (c) of clause 6, which provides that if the council fails to pass the budget the executive committee may do so. Further, should there be a serious division of opinion within the executive committee itself, the Minister can take over and virtually appropriate on the council&#x2019;s behalf all monies voted by Parliament for the council&#x2019;s use.</p>

<p>Clause 7 provides, in addition to the Minister&#x2019;s present powers for him to make regulations in terms of the 1964 Act, an additional clause which, in the present highly sensitive climate of White/Coloured relationships, gives him very draconian powers indeed. I cannot resist quoting this to the House. The Minister, in addition to his existing powers under the regulations, will now be able to make regulations relevant to &#x201C;any other matter which he considers it necessary or expedient to prescribe in order that the purposes of this Act may be achieved&#x201D;.</p>

<p>There is only one possible interpretation of this Bill in any event, namely, that it is a grave admission of failure on the part of the Government to handle the electoral scene for the Coloured people. No more and no less.</p>

<p>The voting figures in the council at the present moment are: Federal Party, 30 seats; Labour Party, 23 seats; Independent Party, 4; Republican Party, 1; and National Party, 1. Then there is a by-election, which is pending. This means that all proceedings, as things stand, are dependent upon the chairman exercising a deliberative as well as a casting vote. This is the ridiculous position in which the hon. the Minister now finds himself because of the Government&#x2019;s refusal to allow the elected party to take over and run the council. We know perfectly well, and the hon. the Minister mentioned it in his speech, that the Federal Party executive was consulted over this Bill. We know and they know too that this is an emergency measure. The question is why should this be necessary? The Government has got itself into a tidy jam over the whole business and the consequences of their actions have not alleviated friction but exacerbated it among the Coloured people themselves.</p>

<p>The Federal Party executive issued a statement which appeared in the <i>Cape Times</i> of 26th May to the effect that the executive of the Federal Party had been consulted over this Bill. The Administrative Secretary, Mr. Peter Swartz, made a statement following this announcement in which he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister, however, has seen it fit to take the necessary precautions to avert any such crisis &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is if the budget was not passed by the council&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; even though it would appear to be remote. It is perhaps unfortunate that the taking of this step, however necessary it may appear to be, is indicative of a wavering confidence in the ability of the council to promote the affairs of the Coloured people.</block>

<p>Although the hon. the Minister says quite correctly that the executive committee of the council was consulted over this issue, to suggest that they are entirely happy about the situation, is in no way correct. The hard fact is that the Government made the fatal error in the first place of not giving the Coloured people a fully elected body in 1969.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister and the Minister himself told us yesterday that at the 1974 elections it would not be a fully elected council; they must wait till 1979. He then talked about our having elections ourselves, and heaven knows what sort of excuses. The hon. the Deputy Minister said here in this House yesterday that the principle of a fully elected council had been accepted. We accept that that is correct. But one of the reasons given for the Government&#x2019;s nominating members was that one of the parties involved in this election had every intention of wrecking the council. He referred to the Labour Party&#x2019;s intransigence, in effect, in his speech yesterday afternoon. May I just say that if the Coloured Labour Party have been intransigent over this matter in the opinion of the Government, they were incensed by the nomination of 20 members over their heads when they had won the election on a perfectly democratic basis, as set out in terms of the 1964 election procedure under their own Act.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the Labour Party in 1969 won 26 seats out of a total of 37 that were contested. Three were left uncontested to the Federal Party, and the rest were nominated by this Government. I submit that the Government is directly responsible for the degree of distrust towards this council which exists today among all sections, not only one, of the Coloured people. This is one of the things that make it increasingly difficult to function.</p>

<p>Not even local authorities amongst the Coloureds are given adequate powers today. I have a circular issued by the Department of Information setting out the position, in the usual strange and rather woolly language in which they are apt to do it. The Indians in Natal, to my knowledge, already have about 5 or 6 fully independent local authorities, which they are running and controlling in every aspect themselves.</p>

<p>It is not only one. Ask the hon. member for South Coast; he knows as much about it as the hon. the Minister. The Transkei Legislative Assembly has far more powers today than this Coloured Council has been given. The irony of it is that the 1964 Act contained large sections which were merely adaptations of our own Electoral Act. In 1964, when this council was created, the scope of the vote was extended to cover all men and women over 21 years. No qualifications were laid down. Having made this fine gesture, the people they elected were then not permitted to take office. Yesterday the hon. the Deputy Minister made a great deal of the question of ensuring responsibility in the running of the council. I just want to tell the hon. the Deputy Minister that none of us on this side of the House believe for one moment that any single Coloured political party, whatever its views, that was voted into office and was allowed to take office would have been purely destructive, for the simple democratic reason that they would have been answerable to their voters, just as we are. They would have been dependent upon the trust, confidence and the support of the voters if they hoped to achieve anything at all or to remain in office. No democratic political party in the world can afford to ignore the opinions of its voters, whether they are Coloured, Black or White. They would have known perfectly well that they would only have remained in power with the support of their voters &#x2026; [Interjections.] It is all very well the hon. the Deputy Minister saying that.

<p>If the Labour Party or any other party had won the election, the vigilance of their own voters, I suggest, would have provided the necessary check and balance on their misbehaving or acting irresponsibly. No party can afford to disregard its voters. The Government was too scared to allow the council to function on this basis. Why was that so? Can the hon. the Minister tell us why that was so? I want to make it clear that unless a subsidiary body of any kind, whether at the basis of local government, regional government or federal government, has the power to levy rates and taxes, however limited the scope, it has no constitutional meaning or status at all. This body has none of those powers. The hon. the Minister has anticipated that the time will come when they are going to have them, but how much longer must they wait for them? The present body was suspect from the start and this was the initial fault. I want to remind the hon. the Minister that at the time of the elections in 1969 out of an eligible number of 615 000 voters roughly 300 000 voted&#x2014;in other words, less than 50 per cent.

<p>The Bill hinges on this question of the Budget. The powers of the Executive are involved when it comes to the Budget. I am quite prepared to accept that any Budget proposals anywhere are initially drawn up by the officials, the experts, in many cases, of any Government department that is involved. That also goes for the Department of Coloured Affairs and Rehoboth Affairs with regard to the Budget of this council. I am also aware that once the draft Estimates have been completed for the Coloured Representative Council that they are submitted to the council&#x2019;s executive committee for scrutiny and comment. I am also aware that the executive committee is free to make suggestions for change and to discuss the needs and requirements of the Coloured community together with the officials concerned, and the Minister if necessary, and also with other Ministers. The council could even, if it wanted to, by recommendation only&#x2014;and I repeat by recommendation only&#x2014;suggest that money allocated to one service be allocated to another. I am not trying to create any false impressions in this regard. There has been a deadlock over this question of the Budget. The Labour Party that won the election now refuses to discuss it. That, I again say, was the direct result of their winning the election and then being refused the right to run the council. On the other hand, let us be realistic. All four parties of the council have passed very many good resolutions on a variety of subjects reflecting a mutual concern for their people about which the Government has done practically nothing. There have been many consultations. I was interested and, I must say, slightly amused at the number of consultations that have been reported by the Department of Information. For instance, there was one in September, 1971, on local government for the Coloured people. There was a long story about plans of the department with regard to powers of local government. Then, right at the end, the statement says that in view of the fact that the Coloureds are not yet in a position to take over full municipal control, in effect, nothing will be done about these boards as planned. I suggest to the hon. the Minister that if the Indians are competent to run a local authority, our Coloured people who have been acquainted <span class="col_8679-8680" refersTo="page_1295"/>with government very much longer, should be in a position to do so.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry, Sir, but the hon. the Deputy Minister is doing the interrupting. So, I thought, perhaps, I was justified.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has called in this Bill for emergency powers in the event of the Budget not being passed. This is relevant to this debate, because the hon. the Deputy Minister yesterday accused this side of the House of consulting on this matter only with people intent on destroying this council, with people, in other words, who may prevent the Budget from being passed. The hon. the Deputy Minister mentioned Mr. Curry by name and said that we held a private meeting with him and that we were responsible for hobnobbing only with people of that kind. May 1, in all fairness to this side of the House, get that record straight. The hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s information is not even remotely correct. The members of our caucus quite openly&#x2014;I was the person who arranged it&#x2014;here in this House of Assembly met the leaders of both the Labour Party and the Federal Party on two separate occasions, the chairman and the vice-chairman and three of the Labour Party&#x2019;s executive members on 3rd February, and Mr. Tom Swartz and 11 members, including his Executive Committee office-bearers, held discussions with us here in Parliament on 28th February. What is more, in the course of the discussions, Mr. Tom Swartz informed us that he had notified the Minister that he was meeting us. Therefore, for the hon. the Deputy Minister to come here and say that we spend our time consulting with only one section of the Coloured people, is not true.</p>

<p>In conclusion, let me say that if clause 6 is passed as it stands and the emergency anticipated by the Minister arises, then as far as the Coloured people are concerned, the Government will have to function by decree, which is deplorable.</p>

<p>The responsibility for the payment of Coloured members of the Public Service, for teachers&#x2019; salaries, pensioners and others, rests squarely upon this Government&#x2019;s shoulders. If it does happen to have recourse to this type of legislation, it has only itself to blame. It should be quite obvious that, if any Coloured political party that had won the election had been in a position to exercise its powers in a proper, democratic way, the very last thing that would have happened, would have been for it to have left its own people in the lurch, unpaid and insecure. In fact, had any Coloured party in power left their own civil servants, pensioners and teachers unpaid, it is quite clear&#x2014;the hon. the <span class="col_8681-8682" refersTo="page_1296"/>Minister should know it&#x2014;that they would have received short shrift at the hands of their own electors.</p>

<p>I just want to say in conclusion that, if loyalty is expected of South Africa&#x2019;s Coloured people, it can only be required of them on a basis of citizenship, which in turn involves responsibility, i.e. the right to be trusted in the exercise of power for and on behalf of one&#x2019;s fellow-citizens. This was not done when the original Bill was brought in. Now the Minister has proved it be introducing this amendment. We demanded a fully-elected council in 1964, and we moved that the amendments contained in the 1968 Bill should be read this day six months. This party, I should like to make quite clear, will have nothing to do with this Bill, because it is a retrogressive step. I only want to repeat that we apparently have more faith in the loyalty and integrity of our Coloured people than the Government has. On those grounds I wish to move on behalf of this side of the House&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House declines to pass the Second Reading of the Coloured Persons Representative Council Bill on the grounds that it, <i>inter alia</i>, represents a retrogressive step in the political development of the Coloured people, and a vote of no-confidence in their ability to administer their own affairs&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Wynberg has again had the opportunity to play a nice game of politics. She says that such legislation is a tragedy, and then she refers, in particular, to clause 6. Why is it a tragedy? Clause 6 is in no way at odds with normal custom; it is quite normal procedure in any democracy. For example, as far as finances are concerned: We have two Houses, but the Other Place has no say when it comes to finances. Do hon. members know that a provincial council cannot reject an Administrator&#x2019;s budget? Under certain circumstances the State President can intervene.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. VAN STADEN</person>:</from>

<p>I shall come to that in a moment. I think the time has come for the history of the 1966 Select Committee to be revealed, because the hon. member has again made a case out of it. Today the hon. member again referred to the late Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s promise of 1961. The late Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s promise has been kept in letter and in spirit. In the meantime, however, other things have taken place; in 1966 there was the Prohibition of Political Interference Act. That was another Act of the late Dr. Verwoerd. The day the Second Reading of that Act had to be introduced here a tragedy took place. At the time negotiations were entered into by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. As a result of those negotiations a Select Committee of this Parliament was appointed in 1966. That Select Committee could not complete its work and was converted into a commission.</p>

<p>As a result of its report, which was tabled in 1967, the 1968 Act was introduced. As far as the Coloured Council is concerned, that report was unanimous. What I am now saying here is history. An hon. member, Mr. Bloomberg, who was a Coloured representative, suggested on that committee that the division should be 40:20, and the hon. member for Yeoville seconded it. Now they are hiding behind something else. They say that they issued a minority report. That is true, but the minority report only concerned one aspect; they were unanimous about the other aspects. The minority report only concerned the removal of Coloured representation in this Parliament. That was the minority report. The United Party shares with this side full responsibility for the Council as it was constituted on a 40:20 ratio. That is history, and I hope the hon. member will now stop talking nonsense here in Parliament.</p>

<p>What are the facts? The first legislation was passed in 1964, but due to circumstances the first Representative Council was only chosen or elected in 1969; a mere three years ago, actually not even three years ago. It will only be three years in November. This year&#x2019;s Budget is only their second. What does one learn from this? After all, in the course of time one discovers problems. We have now discovered problems. One will inevitably encounter problems. It also happens here with us. It happens in this Parliament, and it happens in any democratic parliament in the world. The Auditor-General discovered, for example, that there was unauthorized <span class="col_8683-8684" refersTo="page_1297"/>expenditure, which was actually not there. That is why there was a second report of the Public Accounts Committee. However, these amendments are being moved to prevent such a situation. They were drawn up at the recommendation of the Treasury, as a result of the report of the Auditor-General. The amendments are actually the result of practical experience. Moral considerations actually compel the Minister to introduce these amendments because the Government carries the eventual responsibility and not the Opposition. Council members can put a spoke in the wheel in some way or other. Thus they can prevent the Budget from going through. What is the result?&#x2014;The teachers cannot be paid &#x2026;</p>

The hon. member for Wynberg has no responsibility as far as this matter is concerned other than trying to get a little political bait out of it. What other practical method can now be applied to carry on with the administration and the services? It is not merely under these circumstances that the Council does not want to appropriate the money. A moment ago I referred to that when I said that it happens in any democracy. It happens in the provinces and it happens in this Parliament that powers are allocated to the Administrator and to the State President. This legislation contains the important amendment in which power is being granted to the Executive. In case the Executive does not act, the powers are granted to the responsible Minister, and I think this is the correct method to adopt.</p>

<p>I want to say that this amendment Bill shows me clearly that the basis and the foundations that were laid in respect of the Coloured Persons Representative Council are beginning to create problems for this Government. That is why they come along with this amendment to eliminate problems which they see for the future and which they think could perhaps occur. In an amendment Bill they want to establish measures to make it possible to do something about problems if they should crop up. It is clear to me that the Government is embarrassed with respect to the present Coloured Persons Representative Council. It is clear to me that this hon. Minister acknowledges that the foundations of the Coloured Persons Representative Council have been wrongly laid. It is also clear to me that if one looks at the Coloured Persons Representative Council one sees that the wrong principles have been applied. Now the Government and the hon. the Minister come along with an amendment Bill to take precautionary measures. One asks oneself why these precautionary measures are being introduced. I am convinced, or rather I am almost sure, that this Bill involves combating the new complications in the Coloured Persons Representative Council. There is about an equal division between the ruling Federal Party and the Labour Party, which is the opposition. The Minister is now afraid that if he were to submit a Budget to this Council for approval, he would perhaps be faced with the problem of their not approving that Budget. I want to say here today that it appears to me as if the Minister foresees the total collapse of the Coloured Persons Representative Council.</p>

I want to tell you that this side of the House has the utmost confidence in the Coloured Persons Representative Council. We are confident they will not give the Minister any reason to apply to them the amendment he is coming to this House with. In other words, if there are any frustrations as far as the people of the Coloured Persons Representative Council are concerned, those frustrations are a result of this Government having laid the foundations of that Council incorrectly. In the first place the Coloured Persons Representative Council wants to be a representative council. In the second place they want powers allocated to them in terms of which they can act. In the third place the Coloured Persons Representative Council also wants a say in matters of general importance. Because these people harbour those frustrations, the hon. the Minister <span class="col_8687-8688" refersTo="page_1299"/>comes along with this amendment to eliminate problems which he himself foresees, and which I say this side of the House does not foresee, and to solve this problem in this way as far as he is concerned.</p>

<p>I repeat, as I said yesterday in the debate on my Vote, that the United Party in the Select Committee supported the proposal by Mr. Abe Bloomberg that the Coloured Persons Representative Council be constituted on the basis of 40 elected and 20 nominated persons, and that that was the unanimous decision of the Select Committee. What the hon. member has said here does not mean a thing. He is once again employing United Party tactics. We know that it is United Party tactics to keep a back door open, even if it is a very small back door. Sir, you can study those words read out by the hon. member; I listened to them, but I am giving this House the facts and I say that in the Select Committee that was a unanimous decision, supported by the United Party, that the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council be constituted on the basis of 40 elected and 20 nominated councillors. That cannot be denied. When I said this here yesterday afternoon, not a single United Party member reacted to my statement. They had to go and look up a report, in which they tried to put certain words. We can analyse that report in further debates in this House, but I make the statement here as a positive statement. We are now being told that it was such a fatal mistake and that it is derogatory to the Coloured people. But I maintain that this was done with the full concurrence of the United Party.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I shall not detain the House long. I want to say that I have all the confidence in the world in the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council and in the Coloured people.

Must I wait until that happens? I say that the onus is not on me; I cannot be blamed. The onus for this measure is on those people; they must take whatever blame there is. I am acting here only in the interests of the council. I am trying to give the council a better instrument, a better constitution on which to work. Hon. members opposite are only concentrating on the one clause. Sir, this measure is an improvement to the Coloured Persons Representative&#x2019;s Act, and a very distinct improvement. I maintain that I am only acting in the interest of the ordinary Coloured man and woman in South Africa, so that if those people take it into their heads not to pass a Budget, then I can still take steps to ensure that the needy Coloured men and women get their pensions and that the teachers get their salaries.</p>

<p>*Sir, I want to say once again that I have the fullest confidence in the Coloured population of this country, and time will show that my confidence is not misplaced. As surely as I stand here today, time will show us this.

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>As usual this Bill deals with miscellaneous matters affecting the Consolidated Revenue Fund and the Railway and Harbour Fund. Since the various clauses are explained in the explanatory memorandum, or White Paper, which hon. members have before them, I do not consider it necessary to deal with every clause in detail. However, if any hon. member desires further information in regard to any aspect, I shall do my best to furnish further particulars. I take it that the Committee Stage will be the appropriate stage in which to do this.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Finance, in one of our previous debates, said he was going to be brief and then took about 50 minutes. Today he said nothing, but was extremely brief. I want to thank the hon. the Minister for having, as usual, given us a White Paper on this Bill. It was very useful to us. The Bill provides the necessary machinery to implement a number of measures proposed by the hon. the Minister in his Budget speech. It also makes provision for a number of financial matters such as guarantees by the Government to the Reserve Bank, which are necessary for the orderly running of the country&#x2019;s affairs. It also deals with a number of unrelated matters, concerning, <i>inter alia</i>, health, education, customs and excise, the Post Office, etc., and in so far as these matters may require to be debated, they are best dealt with in the Committee Stage. But there are one or two clauses I want to deal with now.</p>

<p>The reason for clause 11 is not very clear to us. What would the circumstances be that would make the Industrial Development Corporation want to force the Government to be obliged to take over from it any investment that that had been made previously by the Industrial Development Corporation at the request of the Government? This is the provision in this clause. In the White Paper Sasol and Foscor are given as examples, as undertakings for which agreements have been signed, which could force such action on the Government, but Sasol and Foscor were established with funds provided by the Government. So, if you get a take-over by the Government, all that really happens is that the interest, say, in Iscor held by the IDC will now belong to the Government and the IDC will reduce its loan to the Government to a like amount. It is not quite clear to us why these provisions should be necessary.</p>

<p>When we come to clauses 2, 12 and 13 and 14&#x2014;and I link them together because they have a similar theme&#x2014;these are fiscal policy matters which relate directly to the Government&#x2019;s financial administration of the country and to economic policy. Clause 2 provides for the amount of R39,1 million which was transferred from Revenue Account to Loan Account in 1971 to be transferred back to Revenue Account this year. Clause 12 provides for funds to be transferred from the Stabilization Account to Revenue Account. This will enable the hon. the Minister to make his transfer of R140 million from the Stabilization Account to Revenue Account as he proposed in his Budget speech. The clause also provides that the Minister may in future transfer to the Stabilization Account any surplus at the end of any financial year which may exist in the Revenue Account or on the Loan Account.</p>

<p>Clause 13 provides that transfer duties on immovable property shall again be credited to Revenue Account as was the case before 1966 when these transfer duties were taken away from Revenue Account and handed to Capital Account. Clause 14 provides that the revenue deficit of the Railways for the year ended 31st March, 1972, shall be met out of the Rates Equalization Fund. It seems to us that what is happening here is that the hon. the Minister and the Government have embarked on a game of financial musical chairs. In 1971 he took <span class="col_8693-8694" refersTo="page_1302"/>nearly R40 million from Revenue Account to give to Loan Account. In 1972 Revenue Account takes it back again. It provides in this Bill to meet a deficit as high as R140 million on Revenue Account by transfer to Stabilization Account, but in the same clause of the same Bill it provides for the transfer of any surpluses on Revenue Account or on Loan Account to Stabilization Account. It is a sort of two-way traffic. It is something like a yo-yo. In 1966 he took from Revenue Account and gave to Capital Account all transfer duties and the reason given by the then Minister of Finance was that Capital Account needed this income and that&#x2014;and I quote&#x2014;&#x201C;expenditure on Loan Account will remain at a high level for the foreseeable future&#x201D;. Now we know that the expenditure on Loan Account this year has been increased by 8,6 per cent compared with a much higher expenditure last year, but we also know that this state of affairs cannot continue indefinitely or for any long period of time unless we want our infrastructure and our services, and those of the provinces and of the local authorities, to get into more difficulties than they are in at the moment. Loan Account expenditure on a basis of strict priorities has to be incurred for the sound running of the country. Therefore, next year or the year after, it will probably be &#x201C;turn again Dick Whittington&#x201D; and there funds from transfer duties will go back to Revenue Account. These provisions in clauses 2, 12, 13 and 14 flow directly from the Government&#x2019;s complete misinterpretation or reading of the economic signs in 1970 and 1971. Last year the three hon. Ministers, the hon. the Minister of Finance, the hon. the Minister of Transport and the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, based their Budgets on completely optimistic and unrealistic estimates of the trends in the economy, and what happened was that they all turned in deficits. They turned deaf ears to comments from every reliable quarter that the damping down of the economy could only lead to the decline in growth, to a high rate of inflation and, more important in the context of this Bill, to a drop in fiscal income. What is happening today is proof of this. We are getting the reversal of policy every day. We have had it today in the easing of the deposits required on hire purchase agreements, for example. The economy has to be stimulated as we have been telling the hon. the Minister for some time.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister and the Government have had to learn eventually that events will catch up with them. The purpose of these clauses in this Bill before us is to try to rectify the financial implications of the errors of commission on the part of the Government. We are going to support the Bill because these things have to be adjusted and the financial accounts of the Government have to balance. However, we hope that in future we shall be spared the necessity of Bills with clauses of this type with which we have to agree.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is as the hon. member for Parktown and the hon. the Minister of Finance said: These matters may be better discussed during the Committee Stage. However, the hon. member for Parktown then went on to make a speech in this Second Reading debate which obliges me to make a few remarks, because certain statements which he made cannot be left unanswered. The hon. member for Parktown referred to the actions of the Minister of Finance as a game of musical chairs, since the Minister has transferred certain revenue items from the Revenue Account to the Capital Account and <i>vice versa</i>. However, there is a proverb which declares that people who live in glass houses, should not throw stones. If there has ever been an hon. member who played a game of musical chairs, then it was the hon. member for Parktown. To what extent did he not plead here for a curtailment of Government expenditure? But now he says here this afternoon that we will have to change this picture very quickly, for if we do not we are going to run into trouble with our infrastructure. How can one on the one hand curtail Government expenditure, as he has been asking all these years, and on the other hand allow the expansion of the infrastructure to proceed?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to spend much time dealing with these matters because they can be discussed further during the Committee Stage. However, my hon. friend touched upon certain principles, and I think it is perhaps time we went into those principles. The most important principle he discussed is that I am taking the right here to remove certain expenditure incurred on the Loan Account from that Account and return it to the Revenue Account. I want to inform the hon. member that I am not making any excuse for doing so. In practice the Minister of Finance frequently finds that he is confronted by a problem in regard to the financing of either the Loan Account or the Revenue Account. Last year we experienced problems with the Loan Account. The economic circumstances at the time were such that we found it difficult, owing to interest rates, and so on, to obtain money for the Loan Account. When the position is such that one is unable to acquire loans, the normal procedure is to try to finance the deficit on the Loan Account from the Revenue Account as much as possible. When the position is reversed, and one is able to obtain enough money for the Loan Account, it is necessary to return items which where intended for the Loan Account to the Revenue Account. If I had done what the hon. member wanted me to do, I would not have been able to transfer to the Revenue Account those funds which should have gone to the Loan Account, and that would have meant that I would have had to levy more taxes.</p>

<p>The last point I want to mention is that we are working in the direction of a unitary Budget [Interjections.] Yes, the hon. member agrees, and consequently I need not say very much more about this. Many countries have a unitary budget in which no distinction is drawn. The hon. member therefore agrees that it was not necessary to raise this objection.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>I am sorry that I am not as fortunate as my hon. colleagues who moved the Second Readings of the previous two Bills, in the sense that it will not be possible for me to finish this Second Reading speech as quickly as they did theirs. I shall be obliged to explain briefly the various clauses of this Bill. I think I owe this to the House. Although the Bill does not appear to be a lengthy one and is not of a drastic nature either, there are nevertheless certain things which I deem necessary to say.</p>

<p>Clause 1 contains an extension of the provisions of section 6 of the Liquor Act, 1928, in terms of which certain persons have been exempted from the obligation to hold a licence for selling liquor. This amendment is being effected in order to grant exemption to an approved person from holding a licence to sell liquor in the restaurant in the Hendrik Verwoerd building across the street. It has already become common knowledge that several Ministries with their parliamentary staff are housed in that building, and that restaurant facilities of a high standard are offered in that building. The provisions of this clause have been cast in the same mould as those of sections 6 (1) (d)<i>quat</i> of the Act in regard to the sale of liquor in a restaurant which is on premises controlled and maintained by the Postmaster-General. The idea is to regulate by way of conditions, just as is done in regard to various other cases in terms of section 6, the matter relating to the selling and the hours of selling liquor. It is the intention to permit the following persons to avail themselves of the facilities offered in the restaurant: members of the Senate and the House of Assembly; parliamentary officials; officials in the employ of the State; the spouses of such members and officials; the guests of such members, officials and spouses; also members of the Public Service Commission; the Commissioners of the Railways and Harbours Board; the members of the National Liquor Board and the <span class="col_8697-8698" refersTo="page_1304"/>Hotel Board, who are not officials; and the spouses and guests of such persons.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. These restaurant facilities will, of course, be available all year round, although it goes without saying that less use will be made of them during the times when Parliament is not in session.</p>

<p>The insertion of the expression &#x201C;or (<i>d)quin&#x201D;</i> in clauses 2 and 3 is consequent upon the amendment in clause 1. The insertion of the expression &#x201C;(cA)&#x201D; in those clauses is consequent upon the amendment effected last year by the insertion of section 6 (1) (cA).</p>

<p>The amendments in clauses 4 and 5 go hand in hand. It is common knowledge at present that strip-tease dances or performances are presented on certain liquor-licensed premises from time to time. These are frequently connected with all sorts of suggestive and offensive acts. Consequently the various liquor licensing boards in the country, while holding their annual meeting during November of last year, considered imposing a condition in terms of which licensees would be prohibited from allowing strip-tease dances on their licensed premises. The vast majority of these boards imposed a condition in this regard, but the wording of the prohibition was not the same in all cases. Since it is desirable for the wording of the prohibition dealing with such a matter to be uniform, and since it is highly undesirable for acts of this kind to be used for luring people to statutorily controlled premises where liquor is sold, a generally applicable and uniform prohibition is being imposed on such acts, as is provided in clause 4.</p>

<p>As far as clause 6 is concerned, I want to say at the very outset that this amendment is connected with a state of affairs which simply cannot be allowed to exist. Cause for this provision was given by the employment in an attorney&#x2019;s office of a certain Mr. Rowley Arenstein, who was an attorney in Durban, who has for many years been an openly self-confessed communist and whose name appears on a list of persons who were office-bearers, officers, members or active supporters of the Communist Party and who, on occasion, said in the open court that he believed in Marxism. In October, 1966, he was convicted and sentenced to four years&#x2019; imprisonment on a charge of committing an act calculated to further the achievement of the objects of communism. An application for his name to be struck of the rolls was made under section 5<i>quat</i> (1) (b) of the Suppression of Communism Act, 1950, and granted by the Supreme Court. Just after his discharge from prison, Arenstein went to work for his former articled clerk, who had become a practising attorney in Durban by that time. In order to employ him, the attorney had to obtain the consent of the Incorporated Law Society of Natal. This consent was granted by the Natal Law Society. It did not take long before Arenstein was once again an attorney in everything but name, so much so that after I had forbidden him by way of further restriction orders to carry on with this work, representations were made to me to allow him to carry on with his work in connection with the recent Pietermaritzburg terrorist trial. In documents submitted to me it was stated, <i>inter alia</i>, that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Because of the long duration of the trail, the intricacies of the issues, it would be impossible at this stage for any other person to take over the work of Mr. Arenstein and if he is not given an extension to complete the work on the trial, the accused in the case may be seriously prejudiced.</block>

<p>The following was also said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026;it would be impossible for any of the other attorneys &#x2026;</block>

<p>Please note the choice of words in the phrase &#x201C;any of the other attorneys&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; presently working on the case to complete their assignments as well as those of Mr. Arenstein.</block>

<p>You see, therefore, that for all practical purposes he became involved in the case as an attorney. At that stage I brought <span class="col_8699-8700" refersTo="page_1305"/>certain information to the notice of the secretary of the Natal Law Society with the request that the council of the law society give consideration to the way in which Arenstein became involved in the defence of the accused in the case to which I referred; the nature of the work performed by him in an attorney&#x2019;s office, and so forth; and that I should like to hear whether the law society approved of this state of affairs and, if not, what the law society intended doing about it. The reply was, <i>inter alia</i>, that applications received from attorneys who had been struck off the rolls were dealt with strictly on merit, and that the council of the law society was inclined to be sympathetic in cases where persons were not struck off the rolls as a result of fraud or dishonesty; furthermore, that the council of the law society was of the opinion that once consent had been granted for an attorney previously struck off the rolls to work in an attorney&#x2019;s office, such an attorney was in the same position as was an unqualified clerk in an attorney&#x2019;s office. In addition, the council indicated that it was not possible for it to decide on the facts submitted to it that Arenstein&#x2019;s participation in the case exceeded that of an unqualified clerk, and that it was consequently not its intention to take any further steps in regard to the matter.</p>

<p>As a result of this reply, I had the Secretary of the Law Society informed in writing that I assumed that his council had also acquainted itself with the reason why the person concerned had been struck off the rolls; that he had been sentenced to four years&#x2019; imprisonment; and that I assumed that the council of the law society was aware of the large number of cases which were tried in our courts and in which references were made to the activities of the Communist Party in South Africa, the A.N.C., and so forth, as well as the acts of violence, subversion and sabotage committed by members of these organizations. I also referred them to certain findings of the Appeal Court in the ffrench-Beytagh case in regard to the violent objectives of, <i>inter alia</i>, the Communist Party in South Africa, and I pointed out to them that the effect of striking Arenstein&#x2019;s name off the rolls had to a very large extent been undone by the consent granted to him to enter into service with a firm of attorneys.</p>

<p>I said, furthermore, that in the light of all the circumstances and the attitude adopted by the council of the law society, I felt free to say in public, as I am doing now, that the council of the Law Society of Natal had no objection to persons whose proven acts and ties are prejudicial to the maintenance of law and order getting involved in our administration of justice.</p>

<p>Sir, as far as this amendment is concerned, if people do not have the interests of the State at heart in this regard as well, we have no alternative but to obtain a say in a matter such as this one with a view to future situations. The amendment speaks for itself.</p>

<p>The provisions of clauses 7 and 8 do not introduce anything new, but in fact confirm something which is by and large being done in practice already and is consequently of a technical nature. Pursuant to certain problems which had arisen, the historical background to the definition of &#x201C;Minister&#x201D; in the Magistrates&#x2019; Courts Act, 1944, was examined, and the conclusion arrived at was that as the Act read at present, it contained no express provision in terms of which one Minister could in creating districts, and so forth, include in such districts an area administered under the control of another Minister, and in terms of which the control of district administration for the purposes of the Magistrates&#x2019; Court Act could be transferred from the one Minister to the other Minister. The problems that have now been identified, appear to have existed since amendments were effected in 1935 and since the commencement of the Magistrates&#x2019; Courts Act, 1945, i.e. on 2nd July, 1945, when the functions to appoint magistrates and create districts were transferred from the Governor-General to the Ministers of Justice and of Bantu Administration and Development, respectively. As the Act reads, these functions could only be exercised in those districts or areas which were under their control in 1945, and the power was not expressly conferred at the same time to include in future in the creation of districts areas which are under the control of the one or the other and to obtain administrative control by appointing magistrates in an area which previously was under the control of the other. The amendments contained in clauses 7 and 8 confer express powers in this regard, i.e what was previously considered to be tacit powers.</p>

<p>As far as clause 9 is concerned, section 341 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1955, provides that a court may stop the trial <span class="col_8701-8702" refersTo="page_1306"/>of any person and order that an inquiry be held in terms of section 30 of the Abuse of Dependence-producing Substances and Rehabilitation Centres Act, 1971. In view of the fact that the Coloured Persons Representative Council of the Republic of South Africa itself has now passed a Coloured Persons Rehabilitation Centres Law, namely Law No. 1 of 1971, it is being provided by this clause that inquiries in regard to Coloured Persons may be held in terms of that Law; and while I am dealing with this matter, Sir, I want to refer to clause 31 as well. By virtue of the passing of the Coloured Persons Rehabilitation Centres Law, 1971, by the Coloured Persons Representative Council, the Retreats and Rehabilitation Centres Act, 1963, which is still applicable in so far as it is necessary for the administration thereof by the Minister of Coloured Affairs, is being repealed by clause 31.</p>

<p>I shall deal with clauses 10 and 25 later on.</p>

<p>Clauses 11 and 12, Sir, are aimed at supplying a deficiency in the Act. At the moment the Water Act provides that if upon receipt of an application for an irrigation loan, the Minister is satisfied as to the security offered, he shall cause an estimate to be made of the probable cost of the work in respect of which such loan is required. After that he may submit the application for a loan with his recommendation to the State President, who may order that an irrigation loan be made to the applicant, who is usually an irrigation board. The law advisers have expressed the opinion that the Act only contemplates a non-recurring loan and that the Act does not make provision for any revision of the original estimate of the probable cost. Now, it happens in practice that after an estimate of the cost of a scheme has been made, tenders are invited for the execution of the works. As a result of rising costs during the interval between the date on which the estimate is made by the Minister and the date on which tenders are received, it happens that the tender amounts exceed the estimated cost of the scheme, and in the light of this legal opinion it is not possible to get a supplementary loan approved by the State President. For that reason provision is made in clause 11 for a revised estimate and the granting of a supplementary loan, still subject to the condition that if the revised estimate exceeds R150 000, the approval of both Houses of Parliament must be obtained. Clause 12 is self-explanatory. It may happen that there is a rise in costs in respect of water-works already under construction, or that it appears after completion that the cost is higher than the estimated cost; in those cases, too, provision is being made for the revision of the probable or actual cost in respect of works for which a loan was originally requested.</p>

<p>As far as clause 13 is concerned, and clause 29 is connected with it, the provision for the imposition of a compensating fine with the alternative of imprisonment in default of payment in the case of stock-theft cases, is now being substituted in effect by the provisions of section 357 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1955, in terms of which a court may in certain circumstances order a convicted person to pay compensation to the injured party. In effect this means that the same statutory provisions will be applicable in the case where damage or loss is suffered as a result of stock theft as are applicable in the case of damage to or loss or other property.</p>

<p>In regard to this provision I may refer to the judgment of the Natal Provincial Division in the case of the <i>State</i> v. <i>Hlatswayo and Others</i>, 1969 (2) 497. In that case a full bench of the Natal Judiciary, consisting of three judges, gave a detailed survey of the effects of the provisions of section 15 of the Stock Theft Act, 1959, and the dubious purpose served by them, and suggested that serious consideration be given to the repeal of this section. It appears that the provisions relating to the imposition of a compensating fine with the alternative of imprisonment in default of payment thereof are not aimed at punishing offenders, but at persuading them to pay the fine. In practice, however, this has the effect of &#x201C;punishment&#x201D;. Experience gained over all these years during which this provision has been on the Statute Book, shows indisputably that it is therefore not serving the purpose for which it was placed on the Statute Book. We consulted widely on this matter, namely Judges, magistrates, attorneys-general, the Commissioner of the South African Police, and so forth, and I may say that the support for the repeal of the provision in question is overwhelming. It goes without saying that the South African Agricultural Union as well as the South-West African Agricultural Union were consulted in this regard. Both of those unions endorse the principle <span class="col_8703-8704" refersTo="page_1307"/>that the provisions of section 357 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1955, should apply in the place of section 15 of the Stock Theft Act.</p>

<p>Clauses 14 to 19 are self-explanatory. Clauses 14 increases the maximum pension payable to Judges upon retirement. At the moment the maximum pension is pegged at a period of 15 years&#x2019; service. However, upon retirement the vast majority of the judges will have completed considerably more than 15 years&#x2019; service. The maximum for which provision is made in clause 14 now, will be payable after the completion of 20 years&#x2019; service. I may mention that the basis on which pensions are payable to judges, was last amended in 1968. As far as the widows of Judges are concerned, the judges are prepared to pay in 50 per cent more in respect of monthly contributions towards income in respect of widows&#x2019; pensions. Clauses 15 to 19 deal with this matter. As far as clause 20 is concerned, Sir, the law advisers have expressed the opinion that any person appointed as appraiser under the Administration of Estates Act, 1965, holds an office of profit under the Republic, and that such a person shall consequently, by virtue of the provisions of section 55 of the Constitution, not be capable of being elected or nominated or of sitting as a member of the Senate or the House of Assembly. Of course, the provisions of section 55 shall, by virtue of the provisions of section 70 of the Constitution, <i>mutatis mutandis</i> apply to members of the provincial councils. The law advisers have based their opinion on, <i>inter alia</i>, the fact that appraisers are appointed by a Minister of the Republic; that their appointment may at any time be cancelled by the Minister concerned; that their powers and duties are laid down in the Act; and that their remuneration is calculated in accordance with a tariff prescribed by regulation. Now, it is true that appraisers are in point of fact not in the service of the State, and although their remuneration is determined by the authorities they are not remunerated by the authorities for their services, with the result that there is no reason why such persons should be incapable of being a member of the Senate, the House of Assembly or a provincial council. Hence this amendment. Perhaps they would find themselves in an unenviable position if a good voter of theirs were to ask them to make an appraisement which he would like to have. I would not like to be in their position in such a case.</p>

<p>The object of clause 21 ought to be clear after all the publicity about the killing of dogs, and there is hardly any need for me to say any more about this matter. It is being proposed to deal with the matter in accordance with the provisions contained in paragraph (c) of clause 21, so that action may be taken whenever the circumstances of a particular case call for it. The view should not be taken that the killing of every animal imaginable is going to be prohibited. Every situation will be judged in the light of its own circumstances, and, where possible, bodies will be consulted.</p>

<p>As far as clause 22 is concerned, the Transkei consists, in terms of section 2 of the Transkei Constitution Act, 1963, of all the Bantu areas in the districts referred to in that section. In some the towns in the White areas in those districts only a few White landowners are left at the moment, and most of the towns have been zoned for occupation by the Bantu. The amendment in this clause will make it possible for the control, organization and administration of such part of the Police Force stationed in these towns, to be transferred to the Government of the Transkei.</p>

<p>This brings me to clause 23. The interpretation attached to the provisions of section 4 (1) and (2) of the Dangerous Weapons Act by the Supreme Court is that the imposition of sentence of imprisonment is compulsory, also in those cases where the circumstances justify the imposition of a sentence lighter than the one prescribed, and that imprisonment so imposed may not be suspended in whole or in part. Of course, the intention was merely that it ought not to be possible for the minimum or a more severe sentence to be suspended. Furthermore, it appears from certain cases that the compulsory imposition of imprisonment in those cases where a lighter sentence is justified, may have an aggravating effect. That is the reason for the amendment in clause 23.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POLICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am aware of the events that took place there, and I should like to inform the House as follows: Hon. members will appreciate, of course, that as criminal proceedings arising from these events are pending at the moment, I cannot say anything which will in any way affect the merits of the case. In broad outline it appears that the following related incidents occurred: On Thursday, 1st June, a number of students of the University of Cape Town held a demonstration outside this House in Parliament Street, which led to a number of them being arrested. They will be tried before long. As far as could be ascertained, six members of this group come from abroad and are ostensibly here to study. I shall furnish you with their names and particulars, Sir, The first of them is Christopher David McQuaid; he is 19 years old and was born in Northern Ireland. Then there is Peter Ronald Bennett; he is 22 years old and was born in Sheffield, England. Then there is Michael Edwin Vernon Hubbard; he is 24 years old and was born in Jersey in the United Kingdom. Then there is Lucille Keril, a woman; she is 20 years old and is a Rhodesian citizen. Then there is Leslie Foulds, another woman; she is 19 years old, a resident of Zambia and a British subject. Then there is Cyril Couve, who is 24 years old and was born in Mauritius. He is a British subject, too. They are people who came to this country as guests and who are enjoying the hospitality of South Africa. What is more, the taxpayers of South Africa have to contribute to the cost of allowing them to study at our universities, and instead of availing themselves of those privileges, they have come here to concern themselves with unlawful, leftist activities. They will receive the necessary attention from the Government.</p>

<p>On Friday afternoon, 2nd June, students of the same university held a meeting in the Jameson Hall, and according to my information a minority group&#x2014;and I emphasize this&#x2014;promised their support to a proposal for a demonstration on the steps of the St. George&#x2019;s Cathedral. This group went to the Hiddingh Hall in Cape Town, from where they moved to the Cathedral in small groups and took up positions here on the steps outside the Cathedral from approximately 2 p.m. onwards. Posters bearing seditious slogans were displayed. Pamphlets were distributed left, right and centre, and before long a large number of people had congregated, thus disrupting traffic. A number of policemen under the command of senior officers went to the scene in order to maintain law and order, whilst other members of the Force were standing by near the Houses of Parliament. The behaviour of the students was provocative throughout, although initially they were careful not to commit offences. As could be expected, the so-called freedom song, &#x201C;We Shall Overcome&#x201D;, was sung time and again, and apparently, to create a semblance of propriety, they also sang the South African National Anthem, with less enthusiasm and more uncertainty. Round about 3.40 p.m. one of the students, a certain Robert Dirk Kemp, who was born on 6th September, 1952, in Sheffield, England, and who is a British subject, started addressing those present by means of a portable loudhailer, called a megaphone. The so-called peaceful demonstration then became a public meeting. When it was pointed out to the speaker by the officer in charge that he was committing an offence by doing so, he continued in a provocative manner. Thereupon the officer informed him that he was arresting him in that case, and he took him by the arm. The student resisted and at the same time the officer was struck from the rear whilst others held and prevented him from taking away the student with the megaphone and thus performing <span class="col_8707-8708" refersTo="page_1309"/>his duty. At that point a commotion developed amongst the demonstrators and bystanders. Girls shrieked and screamed hysterically and disorder resulted. This chain of events was the proverbial match in the powder-keg, and the Police were obliged to resort to action. In this process the Police made use of batons in order to disperse the demonstrating students. In this confusion some of the students and apparently some of the bystanders and Pressmen as well, who had got among the crowd, were injured slightly. I want to express my regret to those persons who can be described as innocent onlookers and who sustained injuries while action was being taken by the Police. However, they will realize that in view of the appearance of young people nowadays it was not possible for the Police to be able to distinguish at all times between those who were rioting and those who were inquisitive. People who do not identify themselves with those indulging in subversion, should rather see to it that they stay out of the way. In the same way I want to express my regret to members of the Press who also had the misfortune of being injured. If they land in the m&#x00EA;l&#x00E9;e, they as reasonable people may certainly not expect every policeman to know each of them personally. Five persons were arrested there, and a certain Kemp, who made the speech, and who escaped at first, was also arrested later that evening. However, everybody was released on bail. The accused will probably be tried in due course, and those who are of the opinion that they were unlawfully assaulted by the Police, are free to lay their charges before the Police in the normal manner.</p>

<p>Sir, over the past week-end many reports on these events appeared in local newspapers. By way of supplementing what I have said here, I just want to refer to a report published in <i>The Cape Times</i> this morning. A lady, who was obviously an eye-witness, telephoned <i>The Cape Times</i> and gave her version of what had happened there. I shall read only a few paragraphs from this report, and I want to express my appreciation at the fact that in spite of its reporting of Saturday morning, <i>The Cape Times</i> nevertheless placed this report. She said, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Many impressions of clerics and parliamentarians have been given, but it is not stated how much of the entire episode each of these persons witnessed.

<block name="quote">A senior police officer unmistakably uniformed, unmistakably past middle age &#x2026; (inaudible) had earlier at the same spot been praised by the students, was brutally punched from the rear.

Does your paper believe that women who wilfully defy an order to move and wilfully scratch and tear at policemen and who use vile language should not be similarly handled? &#x2026;Is it not possible that those brave male student leaders who stampeded inside past and over their female supporters in their efforts to get inside the Cathedral were the first violators of its holy sanctuary? &#x2026;You should be assured that in at least five incidents on Friday, Press representatives became emotional, irrational, unobjective and hysterical and had to be forcibly subdued and calmed as best as possible. In four incidents women photographers and two male photographers were openly abusive to the police before the police had laid a hand on them.</block>

<p>Sir, regarding the general public, I think there is no doubt that the public want order to be maintained. I want to read out to you, Sir, just two of the numerous telegrams I received this morning. The first one reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We raise our hats high to action in regard to students. We are behind you.</block>

<p>Numerous similar telegrams reached me this morning and, presumably, other hon. members of this House too.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, because we know what is going on and what can be expected, not only in Cape Town but also in other places, it goes without saying that the closest consultation exists between me and the Commissioner of the South African Police, and from the nature of the case the Police made preparations for coping with any possibility of lawlessness. Hence the fact that the Police made use of rubber batons instead of conventional wooden batons. After all, the latter, i.e. the wooden batons, are dangerous and could have caused grievous bodily harm. My express instructions were that if the Police had to take steps to maintain order, rubber batons were to be used. Sir, the public should, what is more, not allow themselves to be misled by the claim that such demonstrations originate spontaneously from the ranks of the students, and that the majority of them are in favour of them. True to the communist pattern, it is in fact the minority who want their standpoint to prevail at all costs, and who raise the cry of so-called &#x201C;student power&#x201D; in an attempt to change the established and traditional way of life of a country. They are engaged in a process of softening up the youth and even the public.</p>

<p>However, there are a few further comments I cannot refrain from making. The public should not allow itself to be led to believe that this episode was an innocent, peaceful demonstration. We are aware of the disturbances of the past few weeks on certain campuses and of the leftist political undercurrents. I shall refer briefly to what the conditions were at several campuses before this incident took place. Apparently the present student unrest has its origin in the suspension of the Bantu student, Abram Tiro, from the University of the North on 29th April, 1972. This gave rise to other students of that institution starting to boycott classes and make demands. What followed on that, is known already. Pursuant to these events signs of unrest also manifested themselves on other non-White campuses and at certain White universities.</p>

<p>At the Indian University College, Durban-Westville, a mass of meetings were held, meetings which were originally concerned with domestic affairs, but subsequently degenerated into a political agitation about so-called suppression, no franchise, poverty, etc. Subsequent to that a motion condemning the &#x201C;high-handed expulsion&#x201D; of Tiro from Turfloop was adopted. On 29th May approximately 100 students met on the sports grounds, where speeches made by, <i>inter alia</i>, Tiro were read out and &#x201C;We Shall Overcome&#x201D; was sung. At the Springfield Teachers&#x2019; Training College for non-Whites lectures were boycotted in sympathy with the students of Turfloop. At the University of Zululand, too, there were boycotts of lectures, processions on the campus and speeches by certain ringleaders. On 22nd May, 1972. a commotion was also started amongst the students at the University of Fort Hare when approximately 300 students congregated in front of the administrative offices in order to see the rector. They put certain demands to the rector, and when their demands were not complied with, the vast majority of the students stayed away from lectures. Post demonstrations were held in front of the administrative block, and class boycotts are still in progress there. At the non-White medical faculty of the University of Natal in Durban, particularly in the Allen Taylor hostel, where the nucleus of SASO, a non-White student organization, is to be found, it was decided on 31st May, 1972, to boycott lectures as from today.</p>

<p>Of course SASO is to a large extent behind the unrest amongst the non-White students, and irrespective of how minor a grievance was, it was blown up to something unheard of. Although SASO had already intimated that it was an exclusively Black organization. Nusas did everything in its power in an attempt to retain the favour of the non-White students as well. In the midst of the disturbances as a result of the expulsion of Tiro and other trivial bottlenecks at non-White universities, Nusas promised its unqualified support <span class="col_8711-8712" refersTo="page_1311"/>to SASO in an attempt to enhance its prestige amongst Black students. At Rhodes University the position is as follows: At first there was very little response at this university. However, acting on the instructions of the president of Nusas the Rhodes Students Representative Council held a so-called emergency meeting on 3rd June, last Saturday, on which a unanimous motion condemning so-called Police brutality was adopted. On the same day pamphlets under the heading &#x201C;Police brutality&#x201D; were distributed in Grahamstown. Sir, now listen to this incident:</p>

<p>On 4th June, i.e. yesterday, students demonstrated in front of the Methodist Church. After the service at the church had ended, male students, dressed in grey raincoats of which the collars were turned up, wearing crash helmets with swastikas painted on them, and carrying sticks in their hands, rushed at female students in academic dress in the presence of school-children and threw them to the ground in a portrayal of the so-called Police brutality. On this occasion six students were charged with holding the demonstration without the approval of the local authority.</p>

<p>Here in Cape Town, pursuant to the Police action outside the St. George&#x2019;s Cathedral last Friday, there were quite a number of disturbances at various universities, and here too. As could be expected, the Students Representative Council of the University of Cape Town feverishly set to work distributing thousands of pamphlets with the intention of rousing the feelings of the public of Cape Town about the so-called Police brutality and calling them up to a further demonstration on the same venue as was used last Friday. Pamphlets were cyclostyled in haste and distributed at cinemas and even at church services. I am going to read just one of the pamphlets that were distributed&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You, the public of Cape Town, know what happened on Friday on the steps of St. George&#x2019;s Cathedral, when peaceful students, bystanders and Press were set upon by the Police and cruelly assaulted. We call on you as responsible South Africans to join us now in our stand and express with us your rejection of this brutality. We are relying on you for your support. You are the public&#x2014; the people who count.</block>

<p>And this is followed again by the address, &#x201C;St. George&#x2019;s Cathedral, 1.15 p.m. on Monday, 5th June&#x201D;. As I have said, this notice was distributed at cinemas and church services as far afield as Stellenbosch. The following notice was issued yesterday by the acting principal of the University of Cape Town, and I should like you to listen to it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Acting Principal of the University of Cape Town, Professor M. F. Kaplan, has supplied the following information: The Chairman and other members of Council, the acting principal, the assistant principals and other members of the university staff will attend the stand in silent protest at St. George&#x2019;s Cathedral tomorrow afternoon in support of the right of lawful protest. A special meeting of the University Council to consider the events which took place on Friday afternoon will be held later tomorrow.</block>

<p>Sir, if this does not amount to spinelessness on the part of university authorities, then I do not know. I may mention in passing that the chairman of the council of the University of Cape Town knows me better than you do, Sir, and if he wants to solve problems concerning the Police, then surely the accepted procedure is to approach me and to discuss those problems with me.</p>

<p>As far as other White universities are concerned, a number of incidents occurred in the recent past, incidents of which cognizance must be taken. The Douglas Home incident, in connection with the student publication <i>Wits Student</i>, is one example of what has in certain circles simply been passed off as a student joke in bad taste, if there really are people who are so na&#x00EF;ve as to believe that. Douglas Home had hardly left the country when Jeremy Thorpe paid us a visit in order to encourage the students further to discredit the existing order and subvert authority. He had hardly left when the hon. member for Houghton fanned the flames further at the so-called teach-in at the University of Witwatersrand.</p>

<p>And so it goes on, day after day, with only one object in <span class="col_8713-8714" refersTo="page_1312"/>view, and that is the destruction of order and authority in South Africa. It follows that there are certain elements that have increasingly come into prominence with their systematic and subtle incitement of students to resist all forms of authority. One only needs to take a cursory look at the pamphlets distributed here in Cape Town on Friday afternoon to notice the similarity between them and the communist pamphlets distributed by the Congress of Democrats in the fifties. Just take a brief look at this pamphlet that was distributed here. I shall read a few paragraphs from it to you&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In solidarity with African, Indian and Coloured students, we demand an end to the racist education system in South Africa &#x2026; The vast majority of oppressed workers in our country cannot afford to give their children more than the most elementary schooling &#x2026; There must be an end to the gross exploitation of most of our workers.</block>

<p>Just listen to this covert threat of revolution&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is clear to us that the Government and those who elect it will never give in willingly to these demands.</block>

<p>Not only the Government, but the majority of the people of South Africa who elect it, will not give in to these demands. In other words, what must happen? Not a democratic solution of the problem, but under the cover of the revolution they are striving after. This pamphlet goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It follows that, as long as effective political power is denied to 15 million of our countrymen, the crimes of apartheid will continue to be committed.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is also conspicuous that in these protests and demonstrations the young first-year students are pushed to the fore while the real agitators remain in the background. The president of Nusas, a certain Mr. Pretorius, was also on the steps outside the Cathedral, but in the background. As a so-called student leader it was not he who used the megaphone to deliver a speech. No, he left that part to a first-year student. Furthermore, women students are increasingly being pushed to the fore whenever action of this sort is taken, whilst the so-called student leaders hide behind those dirty, long dresses and coats of the women. The same pattern has manifested itself in South Africa before.</p>

<p>Many people would probably say that the assault on the officer and his being prevented from arresting and taking away the ringleaders was such a minor incident that the action taken by the Police was unnecessary. No incident is too minor to have far-reaching consequences. Here I want to call the hon. member for Umlazi as a witness. He knows that the bloody riots in Durban in 1949, when large numbers of people died in cruel assaults, were caused by a very minor incident when an Indian slapped a Zulu. He will remember what happened after that, and that it took exceptionally firm action on the part of the Police to prevent the Zulus from butchering the entire Indian population or driving them into the sea.</p>

<p>As far as the students are concerned, I want to say that they are out to cause trouble. Their so-called grievances have nothing to do with their academic activities. Politically they are undeniably leftist-inspired. It is the established norms and practices which they want to destroy. Recently it has also become the fashion for certain organizations to continue their subversive activities under the cloak of religion. For instance, it has become the fashion for the students of Cape Town to rely on the so-called privacy of the steps of the St. George&#x2019;s Cathedral and to take up position there. It appears that they obtained the consent of the church authorities concerned to demonstrate there. If this is true, the Police should not be accused of having no respect for such a consecrated building. If the church authorities allow premises which they deem to be consecrated to be used as a platform for people who are leftist and indulge in subversion, they themselves should bear the consequences that may result from such an act. I have no doubt in my mind that the Cathedral as such holds no semblance of sacredness for them. To them the church is merely a means to an end. The &#x201C;brave ones&#x201D; who fled before the Police into the Cathedral were, in addition to being fear-stricken, probably speechless with amazement at seeing what a place of worship looks like from the inside.</p>

<p><span class="col_8715-8716" refersTo="page_1313"/>As Minister of Police it is my task to see to it that law and order are maintained and the laws of the country are obeyed. I want to emphasize once again, and sound a warning at the same time, that neither the Government, nor the Police, nor the public are going to allow certain student organizations to create a state of lawlessness and disorder in the Republic. The agitators behind the scenes who are indoctrinating the students are not only opposed to the Government of the day, but also against the whole political set-up, i.e. the official Opposition as well, because they believe that the change can only be brought about by force. I believe that prevention is better than cure. We must nip these disturbances in the bud before they degenerate into chaos and bloodshed. I shall purposefully try to do this. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there are many reasons which could be adduced for indicating that this Government was unfit to rule South Africa, but I think there will be few stronger reasons adduced for that conclusion than the conduct of this Government in respect of the incident on the steps of the Cathedral last Friday &#x2026; [Interjections.] &#x2026; and its behaviour since then. We had an explanation this afternoon from the hon. the Minister of Police which glossed over most of the essential facts concerning this incident, which ignored the effect it had on the public of South Africa, which ignored, in addition, the disastrous effect upon South Africa in the outside world of what happened on that occasion.</p>

I disapprove of them just as much as he does. There is no common cause as far as I am concerned with the sort of pamphlet that those students were giving out on Friday afternoon. This party dissociates itself entirely from those pamphlets. What we have had is this hon. Minister trying to tie this up with demonstrations at the non-White universities. I wonder if the hon. the Prime Minister remembers when they started on this business of separate universities for the non-Whites how we warned them that they will become seedbeds for Black nationalism in South Africa. Now he sees those warnings realized before his very eyes. What happened? I believe that on Friday we saw a confrontation between inexperienced demonstrators &#x2026; [Interjections.] &#x2026; probably incited and used by others for a purpose, who allowed themselves to be manoeuvred into breaking the law, and who found themselves confronted by an incompetent Government with a Police Force which, far from tolerant, turned out to be uncontrolled and manifestly untrained for the job it had to do. One of the most fundamental errors made was for the senior officer in charge to get himself involved in the crowd. I would say that it is one of the first principles of crowd control for a senior officer to remain outside the crowd and direct his inferiors as to what they should do. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Like the hon. the Prime Minister, who just gives the orders. He must see that they are carried out. Whatever the demonstrators might have thought was the case, and whatever the call and suggestion was that this was a demonstration for free education for all, it is quite clear from this pamphlet that what was sought was not an educational concession, but a political and social revolution in South Africa. That is what the pamphlet wanted. I think it is right that certain portions of that pamphlet should be put on the records of this House. I therefore want to read certain of them out:</p>

<block name="quote">If there is to be equality in education, if there is to be equality in education opportunities, then there must be a change in the economic organization of South Africa. There must be an end to the gross exploitation of most of our workers. Full bargaining rights must be given to all workers. It is clear to us that the Government and those who elect it will never give in willingly to these demands. It follows that so long as effective political power is denied to 15 million of our countrymen, the crimes of apartheid will continue to be committed. We join with all oppressed South Africans, students and workers, in calling for the right to determine their own future.</block>

<p>That is just the sort of story we saw in the disturbances at the universities in Europe. We on this side of the House dissociate ourselves absolutely from representations of that kind. We dissociate ourselves from the objectives of this pamphlet, possibly the objectives of the demonstration, but we are nevertheless prepared to fight for the right of freedom of speech and the freedom to have peaceful protests in South Africa. It is part of the democratic process which is part of our heritage, something we are determined to see maintained in South Africa. I would have thought that the fundamental issues, which I hoped the Minister would have dealt with, were firstly, why this protest gathering was <span class="col_8721-8722" refersTo="page_1316"/>allowed to continue for so long if possible trouble was anticipated. Those students were on the steps for over two hours. These young people were cooped up; did they really expect it to go on indefinitely without something happening, if they were afraid of some dangerous situation developing? I think the second question that we have to ask is whether ordering a baton charge was justified in those circumstances. I think the third thing we have to ask ourselves is whether any more force was used than was necessary to break up the meeting and clear the steps. Those are the three issues. First of all, one must ask oneself: Was the gathering lawful or unlawful originally? Our suggestion is that the Police officer in charge indicated that the gathering was lawful as long as they remained on the steps. The suggestion is that those steps are private property. I wonder whether those steps <i>are</i> private property for the purposes of the Riotous Assemblies Act; because the definition in that Act is so wide that I have no doubt in my own mind that those steps are not private property for the purposes of the use of that Act. Those steps are a place to which the public regularly has access. They are so close to the street and are used for such purposes that I do not believe they can be regarded as private property for the purposes of the application of the Act. One wonders why then that gathering was allowed to continue. The position seems to be that it was thought that the gathering became unlawful and contravened certain municipal regulations when a loud-hailer was made use of. Surely there were many ways of dealing with that situation otherwise than calling for a baton charge. There are many ways in which that sort of thing is being dealt with in many other countries of the world. There are many ways in which Police accustomed to crowd and riot control know how to defuse the situation and maintain law and order.</p>

<p>What happened, Sir? Instead of sending someone in to deal with the situation, the senior officer in charge himself went into the crowd, became surrounded by them and, to an extent, was cut off from his own men. The question is: Was his authority flouted? Photographs that have been published would seem to indicate that the student Kemp was about to hand the loud-hailer to Col. Crous to explain why he was not allowed to use it &#x2026;</p>

Crous at the time. Anyone who examines those photographs will see that the situation indicated that at no time was Col. Crous in real difficulty. Now comes the interesting question. Col. Crous apparently made a statement to <i>Die Burger. Die Burger</i> was asked not to publish it. By whom, Mr. Speaker? <i>Die Burger</i> said on the very highest authority they had been asked not to publish it, but they thought it so much in the public interest that they did publish it.</p>

<p>Then comes the next question. Who ordered that baton charge, and why? The first statement was from Col. Crous, that he was struck from behind and that he said: &#x201C;Clear these steps.&#x201D; But Brig. Lamprecht, who is a brigadier in the C.I.D., from all accounts was on the Parliament side of where Col. Crous was standing, and was on the pavement. He had very little chance of seeing what was happening. He claimed that he ordered it. But, Sir, the interesting thing is that when he was interviewed on the spot while the disturbance was taking place, he made no reference whatever to any attack on Col. Crous or any suggestion that Col. Crous was being interfered with.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I say that he was on the Parliament side of the pavement, and that he would have had great difficulty in seeing exactly what was happening to Col. Crous because of the people roundabout. I think the photographs published in the Press make that very clear indeed, and the evidence I have is from at least one man who was on the island in the middle of the street and from another who was on the pavement very near to the steps of the Cathedral. It seems then that Col. Crous merely directed the charge when it <span class="col_8723-8724" refersTo="page_1317"/>started. Now, if Brig. Lamprecht ordered that baton charge, Sir, why did he order it? What was the reason? His statement was that it had become an unlawful assembly. Well, if it became an unlawful assembly, why did he not do what he is supposed to do under the Police regulations? Why did he not warn the students to disperse?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#members">

<from><person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBERS</person>:</from>

<p>He did.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Why did he not warn the students to disperse in English and in Afrikaans, as he should have done and probably on two occasions? Nowhere is there any evidence from any bystander that the Brigadier warned those students to disperse. Mr. Speaker, not only were the regulations not observed in that regard, but one is faced with a situation where there was a baton charge which might have been totally unnecessary. I wonder if those students would have stayed there if they had been told by the Police that the assembly had become an unlawful one and if they had been called upon to remove themselves within a certain time, under pain of arrest? Sir, would that not have been a more sensible way of dealing with the matter? That is what the law requires. Why was it not done? Instead, apparently, there was a baton charge, a baton charge which appears to have got out of control very quickly.</p>

<p>One of the questions I think one would like to ask as well is: For how long were the Police armed with batons, waiting at the bottom of the Avenue? One knows they were seen on the lawns outside this building, in a circle, being addressed, with their batons, and one knows they were marched down to the bottom of the Avenue. From evidence given to me by my own members of Parliament, it is quite clear that certain of those policemen took their numbers down when that baton charge took place. It is quite certain also that, participating in that baton charge, were a number of people in civilian clothes, armed with police batons. Mr. Speaker, they had no identification on them of any kind. To this day we do not know who they are. Were they Police reservists were they police off duty? Mr. Speaker, is it not the height of folly to produce people in civilian clothes, arm them with batons and let them take part in a baton charge? How do the people who are charged know whether they are civilians or police? I think you lay yourself open to the possibility that civilians, totally unconnected with the Police Force, can then take a hand as well. Where do you end, Sir, if you have, participating in a baton charge, plainclothes people without any armbands or any immediate means of identification? I should have thought it was one of the first principles of the proper maintenance of law and order, that no one participated in a baton charge who was not in his police uniform.</p>

<p>I have asked why no warning was given to the students and why there was no prior order to leave the area. Nobody knows whether they would have obeyed it or not. But then the charge took place, and we have to decide whether the violence used was excessive or not. There have been enough photographs in the newspapers of four, five and six policemen manhandling and hitting one student at the same time, for no one to have any doubt at all that this became a sort of Roman carnival. Not only was there the use of truncheons, but there is evidence that there was kicking and punching as well. There is evidence that certain women were beaten up. There is a report in one newspaper that a pregnant woman, who said she was pregnant, was also beaten up with a truncheon.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there have been reports in the newspapers and whether they are accurate or not I cannot say but I think it is the duty of this House to find out. I think the <span class="col_8725-8726" refersTo="page_1318"/>country should know. There have been reports of women being attacked with truncheons, of a woman reporter talking to a senior officer, who was hit with a truncheon. There is a report of a woman newspaper-photographer being attacked and when a reporter intervened he himself was attacked by five policemen although he had nothing to do with the students. One cannot help asking oneself whether it was necessary for the acts of violence to continue for as long as they did. Some 20 minutes after the baton charge took place, there is evidence that at least one man was beaten up in Queen Victoria Street. There is evidence of students going into the Cathedral and who were afraid to come out. Some who did come out in an attempt to get away, were chased and beaten up when they got outside. There is one member of Parliament here who went and negotiated with the Police and took them out in threes and fours to ensure that they would not be beaten up. While he was escorting one group out some 20 minutes after the occurrence, a man who dared to draw the attention of the crowd and clapped his hands was beaten up before the hon. gentleman. This led to an intervention from the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, and this happened 20 minutes after the baton charge, when these people had been hiding in the cathedral for that time. One cannot help asking oneself whether this was necessary, if it is true that students were pursued up Queen Victoria Street and up Wale Street and that students were grabbed from behind while they were running away and were beaten on the head and shoulders and forced down. There is a report of one student who was bleeding and who was being escorted by a priest to a doctor, who was again grabbed by the Police and beaten up once more. Sir, I cannot tell you whether these stories are true or not. [Interjections.] I can tell you that a large number of them are vouched for by my own members of Parliament who were present. I can tell you that I have interviewed people who were eye-witnesses, who claim that these stories are true. I think the least this Government owes the public of South Africa is a proper inquiry under the authority of a judge, so that we shall know whether this is the way a Police Force behaved or did not.</p>

<p>Sir, was it necessary to pursue fleeing students into the Cathedral? I know there is nothing illegal in doing it, but presumably they did not go inside the Cathedral to hold a demonstration. They went into the Cathedral to get away from the Police and to break up the meeting. Was it necessary to chase them in and drag them out and lambaste them down the steps and chuck them down? Then, Sir, I want to know something else. Why were Pressmen, who identified themselves, assaulted by the Police, and on whose authority were cameras confiscated and films exposed? Sir, it is the duty of the Press to report what goes on. There is an agreement between the Police and the Press that every possible facility should be given to these people to enable them to do their jobs properly. On whose authority is it that cameras were confiscated and films exposed on an occasion of this kind? I believe that one representative of the newspaper of the hon. the Leader of the House, <i>Rapport</i>, was beaten up, despite the fact that he was protesting hard that he was a representative of <i>Rapport</i>. Sir, I cannot help asking myself what the effects of this action will be in South Africa and elsewhere. It seems to me that as a result of this performance the Government has got the worst of both worlds. Its Police, who have been wrongly used, are going to be subjected to fierce criticism and much dislike. That is one dividend that it is going to get. It is going to get a second dividend, Mr. Speaker. The Government has played right into the hands of the activists who, having sponsored a case, which did not draw much attention and which was not very popular, have now been placed in a position where nationwide interest is focussed on them because of concern about the right of peaceful protest. It is not just I who say that.</p>

<p>No, not as a result of my speech, but as a result of the world-wide publicity which has already been given to this incident; because so careful was the hon. gentleman and his Division of Information&#x2014;or call it what you will&#x2014;that they had this performance right in front of the building where nearly all the foreign correspondents in Cape Town have their offices. They had a grandstand view; they did not have to move. Sir, here is what the Government newspaper, <i>Die Burger</i>, says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Daar is radikale elemente in die land wat die betogings in &#x2019;n gevaarlike rigtings <span class="col_8727-8728" refersTo="page_1319"/>sal wil stuur.

Hy het ook heel openhartig ges&#x00EA; oor sy strategie: &#x201C;Die betogings moet non op die golf van afkeuring van die polisie se gedrag groter en omvat-tender word.&#x201D; Die einddoel is niks minder as die be&#x00EB;indiging van apartheid nie.</block>

<p>There you have it, Sir; out of the mouth of the Government&#x2019;s own Press organ it is indicated what the direct result of this is going to be. And then, Sir, there is a third result that hon. gentlemen opposite have achieved, and that is that the effect on the outside world is going to be catastrophic as far as South Africa is concerned. I think that in the handling of this event the Government revealed the height of incompetence, but I believe that even that incompetence was surpassed by its handling of the meeting scheduled for 1.15 p.m. today. Do you know, Mr. Speaker, that the first news that was received by anybody in or near this House that that meeting had been banned by the Chief Magistrate was at 12.50 p.m., ten minutes to one, 25 minutes before the meeting was to start? Either the Government wanted to ban the meeting or they did not. If they wanted to ban the meeting, it could have been done by an announcement this morning. I telephoned the morning Press last night and asked whether there had been any indication that the meeting would be banned.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>So that the public would be told not to attend the meeting. Was it the Government&#x2019;s object to allow 10 000 or 15 000 people to gather there, not knowing whether there was going to be a meeting or not? What was the objective? If you want to ban a meeting, you do so timeously and do not wait until all the people have got there. Have you ever heard, Sir, of such a hamhanded situation? How do you communicate to the crowd present that the meeting has been banned? I know the Police were there with loud-hailers. The report I have is that the loud-hailers were so poor that a large part of the crowd never realized that the meeting had been banned and they milled around there until 2 p.m. That has been the effect of this utter incompetence, in respect of the handling of this matter. Is it not asking for trouble to leave the matter until it is so late? It appears to me that this Government has no idea at all of how to deal with crowd control. [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, I cannot warn too seriously. There is building up here in South Africa, and the hon. the Minister has given us evidence of it today, a confrontation between the forces of law and order on the one side and the forces of dissent on the other side. In that confrontation, in the last resort, it will depend on the discretion of the Police whether the forces of law and order retain the sympathy of the public on their side. That is why it is so vitally important not only that justice be done but that it also be seen to be done. That is why this party has always been on the side of law and order. But this Government, unless he can so manage things that that discretion by the Police is wisely used in dealing with the dissenter, will find that public sympathy will flow away from the Police as the enforcers of law and order and will go towards the dissenters, the people who do not deserve to have it. That is exactly the situation about which the activists and the agitators in South Africa are rubbing their hands in delight and waiting to see whether they can bring it about. We must not forget that in many of the disturbances overseas the students caused just this sort of situation. They were used by activists themselves. The workers were brought in and their grievances were exploited, and before very long, because of the way the Police behaved in certain cases, the Police lost the sympathy of the public and the forces against law and order got that sympathy. It is for that reason that I want to make an appeal this afternoon from this House to those responsible for our great institutions of learning, our universities in South Africa. I want to appeal to all those authorities at those universities to warn the young people under their care&#x2014;their charges, their students&#x2014;that when they allow themselves to be used for these purposes, which they very often do not properly understand, they are playing with fire because they may start a conflagration in which they will be <span class="col_8729-8730" refersTo="page_1320"/>the first people to be swept aside.

<p>I have asked for a judicial commission of inquiry; I have asked for that commission because I believe that the facts as found by a judge should be put clearly before the public of South Africa. I believe secondly we must have properly formulated the circumstances under which it is right and justified to call for the use of force on occasions of this kind. I want to say to the Government and to hon. members opposite that if they refuse this request, they will be playing into the hands of the very people who are trying to undermine law and order in South Africa, people with whom we on this side of the House, and I am sure also hon. members opposite, do not wish to be associated at all. You see, Sir, this side of the House has always taken the line that we stand for the maintenance of law and order. We stand for constitutional change in South Africa. Whilst we appreciate the dangers to us all of that chaos, which so many of the activists are working for, we understand what the problems of the Police are and what their difficulties are in trying to maintain law and order. By contrast one gets the impression more and more from this Cabinet and this Government that they are intolerant of protests and intolerant of opposition. There seems to me to be amongst them a growing feeling of justification of the use of violence as a proper remedy against protests. The hon. the Prime Minister has issued a warning which to me seems to reveal an intention to deal with unrest on the campuses and with protests by punitive rather than preventive measures and then to justify it by stimulating provocation and, if necessary, taking reprisals. One gets the impression that they felt the students needed a good hiding and they acted as witnesses, judges and executioners. You cannot run South Africa in that way. You cannot maintain law and order in that way. You cannot maintain the traditions by which this country has stood and fought over the years if that is what is done. That is why I want to press my request for a proper judicial inquiry into these events, and a proper answer to the questions I have put, not only in the interest of the protection of the South African Police itself, but also in the interest and the protection of law and order in this country.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I did not expect that I would be participating in this debate at this stage, because I was absent over the week-end and returned to Cape Town only at a quarter past one this afternoon. As regards this matter to which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition referred, I therefore want to say at once that, as a result of my absence, I have naturally not been able to acquaint myself with all the facts and circumstances. I have had neither the time nor the opportunity to do so. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition will therefore understand that as far as this matter is concerned, I am not going to go into details as he in fact did. I merely want to discuss certain general matters in connection with it.</p>

<p>To my regret I have to say this to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition across the floor of the House, or rather ask him: when will you stop running with the hares and hunting with the hounds? [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, one does not easily level such an accusation at a Leader of an Opposition, but the circumstances which have been referred to and the speech made here today by my hon. friend himself, compel me to level that accusation. Furthermore, I want to ask my hon. friends opposite: When are they going to decide where exactly they stand in regard to this matter? This matter is not merely one of a group of students having indulged in student frivolity, fun, or whatever, and having caused a rumpus which led to a clash with the Police. My hon. friend and hon. members opposite know that it goes much deeper than this. Surely my hon. friends know that we must regard those students as nothing more or less than the puppets who were simply dancing to the dictates of the people who were pulling the strings elsewhere. That is in fact what is happening, what we have to deal with. What did my friend do here this afternoon? He made a minutes-long attack on the Police. In passing he dissociated himself from the pamphlet issued by the students, and he addressed a brief word to the leaders of the universities. What was the overall impression conveyed by my friend&#x2019;s speech? The overall impression, and I regret saying this to the Leader of the Opposition, conveyed by his speech is that he is on the side of those who are ranged against the Police. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I have not even completed my argument, but the hon. member for Zululand is so prejudiced against the Police that he wants to hear nothing but evil of them. I say that I was associated with them for years. In those years I as Minister, together with the Commissioner of Police, never hesitated on a single occasion to take action against an individual policeman who had overstepped the mark. This is the guarantee that South Africa has always had from the Government and from the commanding officer of the Police, and this is the guarantee which our people will have at all times, that if individuals in the Police Force transgress, their uniforms offer them no protection at all.</p>

<p>If that hon. member had been a member of my party and I could have hidden him away, I should have liked to do so. [Interjections.] I would have hidden him away completely, because I would have been ashamed that the people should see him. I say that the guarantee which our people have, is the fact that in the past action has always been taken when it was necessary. What is more, the Police themselves have never hesitated to investigate all matters concerning their own colleagues when charges have been laid in that regard. This hon. House and the country knows that in this case, too, if there are people who allege that the Police overstepped the mark and that they acted unlawfully, they know what course they should take. They know that the course they should take is to go and lay a charge and that those charges will be investigated properly. After I had read particularly the <i>Sunday Times</i> yesterday, I want to say that if there is something against which I rise in opposition, it is the trial by newspapers in so far as the Police are concerned in the past few days. For that reason I want to speak out most strongly against the fact that, according to certain newspapers, the Police have already been condemned, accused and found guilty and that judgment has already been pronounced on them as far as this matter is concerned. It is terribly easy, as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has done, to come and relate a lot of stories to this House about what this one said and about what that one said. I could have done the same. But what did the hon. the Leader of the Opposition himself say at the end of his story? He said: &#x201C;I cannot tell whether these stories are true or not.&#x201D; After we had been regaled with these stories, the hon. the Leader said, quite rightly, that he could not say whether they were true or not. I want to repeat to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that if there are people, pressmen, photographers, members of the public, who allege that the Police assaulted them, the course they should take is to lay charges.</p>

There were a number of students&#x2014;let me say at once that one saw this thing coming from far off&#x2014;who came looking for trouble. There is no doubt about that. There is no doubt that they were eventually dispersed by the Police&#x2014;not an enormous number of Police, but 20 or more.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to go further. Let us now argue the matter on the basis that there was no warning. Let me argue the matter as though there was no warning. Then I say these students were bent on infringing the law. The object of these students was to cause a rumpus, to create a hubbub around the Parliamentary Buildings here in Cape Town. For my part I want to say that I would have taken it amiss of the Police if they had not acted as they did. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I want to go further. I want to say it has become time that those in authority at certain of our universities realized their responsibility towards their universities, towards South Africa and towards law and order. In addition, it has become time for them to make their choice. I want to express my thanks and appreciation to the vast majority of students at Afrikaans- and English-speaking universities in South Africa who are not identifying themselves with these people.

<p>&#x2026; when I say that this Government is slowly becoming tired of pleading, which I personally have done with the authorities at those universities. The Government is slowly becoming tired of warning, and a time will come when very drastic action will be taken in respect of these universities. One hesitates to do it and does not do it easily; one makes many allowances. But where it is very clear that South Africa&#x2019;s universities are being harnessed to the cause of communists abroad, harnessed to the cause of terrorism, harnessed to the cause of those people who want to undermine and destroy South Africa, it cannot be expected of any government to close its eyes to it. I want to emphasize this warning very strongly this afternoon.</p>

<p>Sir, then there is the old story that we are playing into the hands of those people. I have a great deal of experience of that. I have a great deal of experience of that sort of cry which has been raised. What do they want? I shall tell you what they want, Sir, We must act in such a way that we give no offence to anyone. We must act in such a way that we slide backwards more and more; we must act in such a way that all these little men become bolder and bolder; we must act in such a way that they get increasing numbers of people on their side &#x2026; [Interjections] &#x2026; otherwise we are playing into their hands. I say that the most effective way of acting in regard to this type of thing, is to take such action as was taken here on Friday. I want to make it very clear that as often as it may become necessary to do so again in future if law and order are at stake, it will be done.</p>

<p>I want to go further, Sir, The hon. the Leader of the Opposition says this is causing us tremendous harm abroad. I want to say to you, Sir, that among responsible people it is doing us a great deal of good that South Africa is proving that it is prepared to take action against such things. I have many reasons for saying that to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I want to say to him: Not only people here in South Africa, but right-thinking people throughout the world are sick and tired of this sort of action by students.</p>

I want to warn that the people behind these students must be very careful. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition and I both know that important people are behind them, in the same way as they were behind the African Resistance Movement and other organizations at the university in that regard. We then took special measures to ferret them out and to eradicate them, and I shall not hesitate for a single moment to do so in this case as well.

<p>That is what the hon. the Prime Minister said. It is quite all right; he does not mind if it is illegal. He is not concerned about this because he says that everyone who feels aggrieved can lay a charge and that it will be dealt with at the highest level. Really, Sir, where have we come to? I do not think the hon. the Prime Minister realizes what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has been saying here, because the hon. the Prime Minister himself gave evidence of the need for a judicial commission of inquiry. What did he say? As far as he knows, Col. Crous gave the order to disperse. Sir, the hon. the Prime Minister is a former Minister of Police and of Justice. He knows how this is done; he must know the procedure. The procedure is, as my hon. leader has indicated, that you give a loud warning in both official languages and in the vernacular if necessary. You make everyone aware of this and you give them time to disperse. Sir, if you look at the Riotous Assemblies Act, you will see that that is what the police have to do under section 7 in circumstances such as these, that is to say, in circumstances where the officer in charge, a man with the rank of head constable or higher, has reason to believe that someone may be killed or that there is a manifest intention to kill somebody or where the probability is that someone may be killed, or where there is a probability that, in his opinion, damage will be done to property. In those circumstances he must give a warning, and in those circumstances the Act lays down that not more force than is necessary may be used. The Act goes on to say just how it should be done. But in this particular case there was, so far as one can see on the evidence, no warning given. The hon. the Prime Minister says that as far as he is aware, a warning was given. If that is the grip that the hon. the Prime Minister has of the facts of this matter, then he should change his mind. If I were to say to him that no warning was given, I hope he will change his mind and say that in these circumstances he has been misinformed and that the facts of the matter ought to be brought to light and that we ought to have a judicial commission. Sir, I am surprised that the hon. the Prime Minister has given no indication that he is sorry about the way in which this meeting was broken up. He has made a great issue about this pamphlet. But, Sir, this is precisely the point that my hon. leader made. I wonder if any member on that side has seen the pamphlet that was handed out on Friday. My hon. leader has read out parts of it, and what my hon. leader said was that the people who compiled this document, were in fact the ones who organized that meeting. It is those people who are crowing at the moment because they have got the reaction that they wanted; they have now got the public with them. Mr. Speaker, this is much more serious. I am not talking about the students now. I am talking about the people who put out this pamphlet. Sir, if after reading that pamphlet&#x2014;my hon. leader has put enough of it on the record&#x2014;you were to say to me that it was compiled by the Congress of Democrats, then I would say, &#x201C;Yes, it seems to me that that is very likely.&#x201D; Sir, I want to tell you something else. I spoke to a member of the Students&#x2019; Representative Council of the University of Cape Town, who were exhorting people <span class="col_8741-8742" refersTo="page_1326"/>to come to the meeting today and to go to the Cathedral yesterday. I asked him whether he had seen this pamphlet. He said, &#x201C;no&#x201D;. I asked him whether he knew that it was being handed out on Friday. He said, &#x201C;no&#x201D;. I then asked him to look at the pamphlet and he did. I then asked him, &#x201C;Do you agree with it?&#x201D;. His reply was, &#x201C;Good heavens, no.&#x201D; That is what is happening here, Sir, I tell you, Sir, that the action of the Police on Friday and the action of the hon. the Prime Minister today is making ordinary, responsible people who reject this pamphlet absolutely, as we do, sympathize with the people who are behind this. This is the effect of it, Sir, I think the hon. the Prime Minister knows that he has no right to say that we stand on the side of those who are against the Police. We have said here often enough, and we will go on saying, that in the end law and order is maintained by the Police Force, and the Police Force cannot enforce law and order if it does not have the support and confidence of the public. When that day comes when it does not have the support and the confidence of the public, then I want to say that it will be unable to maintain law and order. In the very nature of things we have a few policemen who have to do a big job. Sir, in this country we have seen the job that our police do, and I want to say that they have a more difficult job to do than any other policemen anywhere in the world because they have to deal with more difficult circumstances than any other Police Force. It is a small number of policemen who are necessarily charged with having to maintain law and order. Sir, our security is the first concern of us all; the internal security of South Africa is the first concern of us all, and when I say that it is the first concern of us all, I mean us on both sides of this House, and the Indian population&#x2014;we witnessed the riots that took place in Durban in 1949 where, but for the existence of a Police Force the Indian population might well have been wiped out that night and the Zulus and every Bantu race in this country. All these people rely upon the South African Police and give them their support. Everyone does. Sir, if you undermine the confidence of the public in the Police Force you will not have an effective Police Force. The hon. the Prime Minister says he associates himself completely with what the Police did on Friday. Sir, the hon. the Prime Minister does not know what the Police did on Friday, but he is prepared to make a wild, broad, general statement, very &#x201C;kragdadig&#x201D;, that he is with the Police whatever they do. He shakes his head and says again: I am with the Police whether they are right or wrong, whether they act lawfully or unlawfully, whether they keep the public with him or whether they do not. Now, Sir, what does the hon. the Prime Minister not say to us? He says there is no Police Force in the world which does not commit indiscretions. Yes, I agree, and I also agree with him when he says that the indiscretions of the S.A. Police are rooted out by the Police. That is correct, but this was not an indiscretion; this was a major blunder on the part of the Government, on the part of the Police, and what is more, this blunder is being now repeated. It is being condoned not only by the hon. Minister of Police but also by the hon. the Prime Minister. When the hon. members opposite cavil at what my hon. Leader said when he said: These are the things which are reported in the newspapers; these are the things I see; I do not know whether they are true or not, there is a sort of hollow laughter on that side of the House. I want to tell you, Sir, that not one of those statements has been denied, nor did the hon. the Minister of Police today in his statement deny them, so that they stand there on the record. Surely it is of fundamental importance that the public should know that these things happened or did not happen, and should know what is going to be done in this regard. The guarantee that the Police will root out their own members, that the hon. the Prime Minister speaks about, and that this will make everybody certain that their rights will not be infringed, is a departmental inquiry. This is not sufficient. What the public wants and what the country needs is a guarantee that the Government will properly control the Police Force. And that it uses the Police Force properly.</p>

<p>It is no good the hon. the Prime Minister talking about this being a newspaper trial. The hon. the Prime Minister asks why there should be a judicial inquiry. The only reason he gave was that there would be adverse publicity. The hon. the Prime Minister knows better than I do, because he has appointed enough judicial commissions of inquiry in his time, that the commission can be empowered to hear certain evidence <i>in camera</i> if he wants to. Its report is always made available. The hon. the Prime Minister says that there will be a lot of trials, looking at the events to see where the person should get damages, whether somebody acted unlawfully. But that is not what is wanted. What is wanted is an inquiry to determine what happened on Friday and how it could have happened, in the interests of the Police themselves, so that we can be assured and that they can be assured that whatever were the causes of this happening, it will not happen again. That is what we say, that it will not happen again, but the hon. the Prime Minister says it will go on happening. He seems to suggest that this is going to be the <i>modus operandi</i>.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that it may be illegal? Does that not concern the hon. the Prime Minister? Where is the answer to that question why a warning was not given? Good heavens, Sir, one does this in the most severe circumstances, a warning is given. Why was a warning not given to these students? This is not a matter of an indiscretion; this the mounting of a big operation which went completely wrong. One is forced to ask oneself how it could possibly have gone so wrong when trouble was anticipated One does not suddenly have the policemen that there were around the place armed with rubber truncheons, which they do not normally carry. unless trouble was anticipated. If trouble was anticipated, then the questions which have not been answered become even more urgent in requiring an answer. The hon. the Prime Minister says there were only 20 policemen, so why have a judicial commission of inquiry. As far as I am aware, the Police statements themselves have indicated that there were far more than 20 policemen; something in the nature of 60 policemen, so far as I am aware.</p>

Does he approve of that? They were even going into the cathedral. This is the issue. The hon. the Prime Minister must reconsider his attitude. He can<span class="col_8745-8746" refersTo="page_1328"/>not say that he just stands by the Police, that what happened on Friday is the way to deal with them and that this will happen as often as is necessary. Then he is saying that he approves of them hitting pregnant women; he is saying he approves of them hitting women; he approves of them beating up women reporters; he approves of them running around in the cathedral dragging people from under pews; he approves of them running through the cathedral hitting people who are doing nothing except trying to escape from the unlawful gathering. He approves of plainclothes policemen running around hitting people without identification; and he approves of this stroppy attitude that was exhibited apparently, after the event, despite the fact that these are unlawful. No, this is not good enough. This answer is not good enough. The hon. the Prime Minister must reconsider what he has said.</p>

<p>The question that is before us here is: Are we going to be able to maintain law and order? With the attitude the hon. the Prime Minister has displayed today, I can tell you we are going to have great difficulty in doing that, because you will, as I have said, lose the support of the public.</p>

<p>It is a very good argument. What dismays me is this: The hon. the Prime Minister says he got back at quarter to one today and so has not been able to apprise himself fully of the facts. I want to say that the hon. the Prime Minister is not aware of the feeling that is abroad in our country in relation to this matter. I shall tell hon. members that I remember someone who will remain nameless, but who is a responsible person and who on that same day went to lunch and saw the students on the stairs, and who then said: &#x201C;What a scruffy, lousy lot they are! I have no time for them.&#x201D; When he came back this was happening, this unnecessary event was taking place. His sympathies were suddenly switched, and that is the danger. I want to say that if the hon. the Prime Minister does not change his attitude in this respect he personally will be responsible for what will flow from this event.</p>

<p>I know you are, and this is what worries me. [Interjections.] The Prime Minister is prepared to accept the responsibility despite the fact that he does not know the facts, despite the fact that in all probability a number of unlawful events took place and despite the fact that the normal procedures were not obeyed. The hon. the Prime Minister is prepared to accept the responsibility just because he is in charge and it is in his nature to say that he is &#x201C;kragdadig&#x201D;. This is the image he wants to keep and just because of that he is prepared to say that this can happen again and that he accepts the responsibility for it. [Interjections.] I want to say that despite the smirking, smug looks on the faces of the hon. gentlemen over there, they themselves must go out and ask their own people what their attitude towards this is. It does not end here and you do not justify something like this because you do not like the cause of the demonstrators. We have made it very clear that we do not like the cause of the demonstrators. The cause behind those demonstrators may not well be the cause of the students, as I have indicated, but the result of this, unless proper steps are taken, will be that this Government will undermine the Police Force and will undermine in the process law and order. I appeal to the hon. the Prime Minister to reconsider his attitude &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#janson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. N. H. JANSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with respect to two brief points I should like to associate myself with what was said by the hon. member for Durban North, who has <span class="col_8747-8748" refersTo="page_1329"/>just resumed his seat. In the first place I believe that one thing he said was true, to a very large extent, for the space of two days, and that in some circles it will perhaps still be true, and that is that what happened on Friday could possibly cause sympathy for students to grow. I think that sympathy for the students&#x2019; conduct could hereby still increase for a long time. This will be the case for those people who will not, or cannot, use their common sense. I also want to say that as far as my personal feelings are concerned, I do not like this kind of thing. I felt unhappy about it.</p>

<p>But I expected more from a responsible Opposition and from any responsible person than this conduct today. Since one has had a week-end in which to think about and reflect upon these matters, I expected that one would have decided what one&#x2019;s standpoint is and not gone on &#x201C;hunting with the hounds and running with the hares&#x201D;, as the hon. the Prime Minister said. I want to state, with the utmost clarity, that this conduct on Friday was not an event with a half-hour long or two-hour long history. This event has a long history, and this Opposition has been fully aware of it throughout the years. They have been warned about it for a long time.</p>

<p>The second point I want to come to is that the hon. member made the following allegation against the Police: &#x201C;Why was a warning not given?&#x201D; Should there have been a warning that that baton charge would take place, a warning that they would be dispersed, or a warning that they would be asked to disperse? I now want to pose a question to the Opposition. This action eventually took place, and a decision will be taken about the justification for that action at a later stage.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I want to pose this question to the Opposition and especially to the hon. member who has just sat down and to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition: Why was this warning not given, not to the Police, but to the students by that side of the House during the many years that we on this side of the House have been warning them that this was what things would lead to?</p>

<p>*There is no need to speak about Friday afternoon as if this were only the culmination. This culmination, which the Opposition has helped to bring nearer and nearer by their aloofness, could have been a much more serious one than it actually was on Friday afternoon.</p>

<p>I want to come back to what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said in his argument this afternoon. In the first place he said that these events would have repercussions for South Africa abroad. I believe this is so. I think it would be foolish to deny this. But these repercussions are being made much worse by the fact that while efforts are being made to maintain law and order under difficult circumstances, circumstances one is not desirous of seeing, the conduct of the students is condoned by the Opposition three days afterwards. That is what happens in this debate. That is what has happened in the debates recently.</p>

<p>In the first place it is not a matter of the &#x201C;outside world&#x201D;. We are right to take this into consideration, but it is firstly a matter of the security of the people, all people in our fatherland. It is also a matter of the safety of the students who think they can rule this country in this way, the small group who use fellow students to issue this propaganda. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said that people realize that the United Party does not agree with such demonstrators. I think it was also the hon. member for Umbilo who said, in a statement in the Press, that he does not agree with it. I do not want to doubt his word. But on 22nd October, 1968, the <i>Star</i> reported that 400 delegates of the United Party&#x2019;s Transvaal Congress were in Pretoria. There were discussions at this congress as a result of some or other statement of the hon. the Prime Minister. The words that were used, according to this report, were the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Japie Basson, member of Parliament for Bezuidenhout, was loudly cheered when he said the United Party should express its strongest disapproval of threats to people who were involved in legitimate protests &#x2026;</block>

<p>and then the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; even if the party did not agree with either the object or the method of the protest.</block>

<p>He was &#x201C;loudly cheered&#x201D; when he said that the method of protest, whatever form it might take, should not be taken into consideration. The Prime Minister&#x2019;s statement, which was being discussed there, was made <span class="col_8749-8750" refersTo="page_1330"/>as a result of protest marches that took place there in the Transvaal at the time. I want to task the hon. the Leader of the Opposition why he has not been warning the students since 1968 about what he expected the Police would do to them under difficult circumstances if at any time the law should be provoked.</p>

<p>But I respectfully say that the Leader of the Opposition is also very much in the dark when he alleges here, as he did in the rest of his speech, that the Prime Minister or the Minister of Police does not have the right to link up the events at the non-White campuses with these events that reached a climax here on Friday and today. I do not know whether the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is interested in hearing a quotation in this connection from the <i>Burger</i>, but if not I shall at least state, for the purposes of the record, that the <i>Burger</i> reported that the official newspaper of the University of Cape Town, <i>Varsity</i>, devoted an entire article in its latest issue that proves that the Opposition Leader is wrong if he says there is no connection. According to the report in the <i>Burger</i> the contents of the leading article in <i>Varsity</i> were as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An attack on Mr. Harry Oppenheimer, Chancellor of the University of Cape Town, was made in a leading article in the latest issue of <i>Varsity</i>, the University&#x2019;s student newspaper.</block>

<p>Mr. Harry Oppenheimer is criticized about wages that he must pay to non-White workers at a factory in Witbank, wages that must be equal to the wages paid to Whites there. But the report goes further, and I would appreciate it if the hon. the Leader of the Opposition would just listen to it. This report is written about Saso, the &#x201C;South African Students&#x2019; Organization&#x201D;, the Black student organization, which was established in opposition to Nusas. In the report it is also stated that, and I quote (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Saso, the organization of Black students, was not established because the students felt they were being treated so condescendingly that they were sick and tired of it, but because they realized that membership of a student body dominated by White people hampered them in a political sense. The White students did nothing and were clearly afraid.</block>

<p>That is what the official Cape Town student newspaper had to say to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition who states that these matters are in no way connected. This report states further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In another front-page article the same theme is dealt with. In one month it appears that the Black students have dealt &#x201C;the White <i>&#x00E9;lite</i> Government clique&#x201D; a hard blow. They have shown that they will never accept &#x201C;lies and misrepresentations about the South African education system&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Does the hon. the Leader of the Opposition still dare to say, with any degree of responsibility, that there is no connection between these matters, as the hon. the Minister of Police said? I also want to mention that not so long ago, in an interview on 15th January, 1971, the then chairman of the Student Council of the University of Cape Town, a certain Mr. Jan Theron, said something that is interesting. It is also recorded in Hansard, because it was quoted in a speech by the hon. member for Boksburg. This question was put to him, <i>inter alia:</i> &#x201C;What bodies do support student protests?&#x201D; He then replied&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We receive support, often moral support, from the clergy, the Black Sash, individual lawyers, the Civil Rights League and the Institute of Race Relations. After all we are affiliated to the League and the Institute. Then there is the Progressive Party and, at times, the United Party.</block>

<p>Can it still be denied that throughout the years, when we have been trying to tell students to continue with their studies and to leave these matters alone, we obtained no help and support from the United Party, as has been proved again today?</p>

<p>The Prime Minister said that the final impression left by the Leader of the Opposition&#x2019;s speech is that he was absolutely bent on launching an attack on the Police, and I want to say that the hon. member for Durban North succeeded in doing exactly the same thing. Show me one speech that has been made by them during the years I have been sitting here, that has been opposed to the incitement of students and their usurping of power. Every time&#x2014; I challenge any member of the Opposition to go and read this up&#x2014;the word &#x201C;but&#x201D; was added, as was the case this afternoon. <span class="col_8751-8752" refersTo="page_1331"/>They are allegedly engaged in protesting against aspects that justify such protest. Every time it is a matter of &#x201C;I do not like your protest, &#x2018;but&#x2019; you have the right to protest&#x201D; or, as the hon. member for Umbilo said &#x201C;I do not like protests, &#x2018;but&#x2019; I did not like the Police either&#x201D;.</p>

<speech by="#janson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. N. H. JANSON</person>:</from>

<p>That is correct. In fairness to the hon. member I want to say that that is quite correct. He said he is opposed to protests, but&#x2014;and this he added&#x2014;he is also opposed to the conduct of the Police. He has the fullest right to be opposed to the conduct of some policemen. However, I look forward to the day when, for once, the hon. member for Umbilo also makes the unqualified statement that: &#x201C;Now this student nonsense must come to an end.&#x201D;</p>

<p>I now want to come back to what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said in his speech in connection with the churches. I think it is necessary to obtain clarity about one matter this afternoon, i.e. what exactly is meant when we speak about &#x201C;churches&#x201D; in this House. I am speaking as an ex-minister of a Protestant church, and I want to add that however much I love my church I have always tried to have respect for all people, whatever their religion. But when it comes to a church being involved in such a way, as I shall quote to you, a church to which I do not belong but which is one of the sister churches, a church I am also proud of for the work it has done for Whites, non-Whites and for students in this country, then my protest starts to be more than a student protest march, then it is a protest that comes from deep from the heart. Are there any denials when the United Party&#x2019;s mouthpieces, which will also carry these reports again this afternoon, say this kind of thing? Listen to the sentimental nature of this report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In what was possibly the worst desecration of a holy place ever to occur in South Africa, the police chased the students about the interior of the church, hitting and kicking them.</block>

<block name="quote">In the dim, ecclesiastic surroundings, with the late afternoon sun filtering through the high stained glass windows, the scene had about it the ugly flavour of a pogrom.</block>

<block name="quote">Would it have happened in the Groote Kerk, a little distance away in Adderley Street? And if so, what would the Dutch Reformed dominees have thought of it?</block>

<p>Here is my reply to this newspaper and such insinuations that also come from some members on that side from time to time: It cannot happen in the Groote Kerk, because the Groote Kerk would not allow students to come along there with this kind of demonstration. The Church would not allow a church building and church steps to be used for the kind of activities that have recently been allowed at these churches by people who openly give their support to those who want to undermine us.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition doubted whether those steps could be regarded as &#x201C;public property&#x201D;. He said he did not know whether that area could be regarded as &#x201C;public property&#x201D;, &#x201C;private property&#x201D; or as &#x201C;church property&#x201D;. I think we must also obtain clarity about that, because this question of the church was dragged in by many people who are probably not very closely connected with the church, though some are perhaps sympathetically disposed to the church. May I ask&#x2014;also with respect to any future decisions about demonstrations on this corner, where other demonstrators also stand so frequently: Where does the property of that church end? Where may a policeman go and drag people away if they are engaged in ugly and illegal demonstrations, if they are doing things that are wrong? Where may he go and drag them away, on ground that is not holy ground? Does this start at the bottom step? Does it stop at the top step? Is it in that doorway to which they retreated this afternoon with posters when they could no longer get onto the steps? Is it just a little further back into the church where the light just reaches, or must it be near the pulpit? Where does that church property end? Where does the holiness begin? I say this with deep respect. I should like to respect any church&#x2019;s property. This Government has gone so far, where churches are concerned, as to tell the Mohammedans that their church properties, which are hallowed by them in a particular way, will be respected when District Six is cleared up. But when religion is abused, as in recent years, when Canon Collins and others, under the cloak of religion, one after another want to destroy everything in this country, including our Christian Religion, which is this country&#x2019;s anchor, then we on this side <span class="col_8753-8754" refersTo="page_1332"/>of the House protest, and then at least every right-thinking person on that side of the House ought to stand by us. Because this circle widens; this circle of people who want to gain sympathy under the cloak of religion. They no longer want to preach the gospel, which is entrusted to churches and which is their task, but they support this kind of incitement against what are called &#x201C;social evils&#x201D;.</p>

<p>In conclusion I just want to touch on this point. If it is a Canon Collins, or others, who pulled out of this country to continue his evil work against South Africa in foreign parts under the cloak of religion, if it pleases those people to also have their cause possibly served temporarily by this means, then we know that only in calmness and determination can we deal with this situation. If we must do so without the Opposition&#x2019;s help, if it must be done the way the Opposition does it now and then, i.e. by saying: &#x201C;Yes, but &#x2026;,&#x201D; we shall go on doing it for everyone&#x2019;s benefit, including those poor misguided students who are abused by a small clique, some of whom are far removed from the universities, to continue their work, their devilish work, here.</p>

<p>Then as a colleague I should like to say something to someone I do not know; as a retired colleague to one who is still in office, I should like to say that that church building, which commands respect from Afrikaners, English-speaking South Africans, Protestants or whoever the case may be, no matter what synagogue or church they attend, must be closed to such demonstrations before it is abused for worse things than its abuse by the students when they fled into it the other day. I see there is also a statement in the <i>Cape Times</i> of the 3rd, a statement by &#x201C;the Dean of Cape Town&#x201D; in connection with this church. The report reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Dean of Cape Town, the Very Reverend E. L. King, said yesterday that he found the police action against students demonstrating at St. George&#x2019;s Cathedral yesterday afternoon and the fact that they entered the Cathedral, absolutely appalling.</block>

<p>Not the entry by the students, but the entry by the Police, is regarded in that light.</p>

<p>This report continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I don&#x2019;t know whether any legal action can be taken, but I hope some very strong action will be taken, he said.</block>

<p>Then it continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Dean was telephoned by the <i>Cape Times</i> soon after he returned home last night to find that his daughter Catharine, who took part in the demonstration, had been hit on the head by the Police. The Dean said it was difficult to comment on something he had not himself seen. The demonstration had taken place on church property &#x2026;</block>

<p>May I say this to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, who asked what the position is in connection with those steps. This is what the Dean says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The demonstration had taken place on church property and students had been given the right to be there.</block>

<p>&#x2020;By whom and for what purpose? To pray in the church&#x2014;I say this with respect &#x2014;to be in or near the church? For what purposes where they there and why were they given the right and by whom were they given the right to be there? And those who gave them the right, were they unable to anticipate that trouble could arise also for his own daughter in a protest such as this?</p>

<p>*Sir, it is not necessary to say that we are sorry, as I am personally, that action also had to be taken against students in the church. I hope it will never be necessary again&#x2014;but I hope that churches will help to ensure that it will not be necessary. I hope the Opposition will help to tell students: &#x201C;Stop tagging along after Fort Hare; stop joining Turfloop in their protests (as they themselves said in their pamphlets); stop doing this kind of thing&#x2014;it means the downfall of any sign of civilization in this South Africa.&#x201D;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have heard from the hon. member for Witbank a statement dealing with matters which are not strictly relevant to the debate this afternoon. It is true that there are questions about the propriety of student behaviour. It is true that questions may be asked about the right of asylum in churches <span class="col_8755-8756" refersTo="page_1333"/>and the degree of co-operation given by churches to students who may be engaged in unlawful activities. Maybe it is so; and for the purpose of this argument, would even be prepared to concede it, if only the Government would come back to the real question which is at stake this afternoon and to which I warn them, the whole country is listening. [Interjections.] They must stop seeking to evade the issue. If they do so, they may do themselves some good in reparation of the harm that was done over this weekend.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, I leave the hon. member for Witbank there. I will return to some of his issues a little later in my speech. I wish to refer in the first place to the official statement made by the hon. the Minister of Police. We heard from him, having given him an opportunity to explain what had happened, to calm emotions and give satisfaction to people whose feelings or bodies have been injured, a long alibi. We heard from him a long self-justification. We heard from him a plausible chain of inconsequential facts, details laden with emotional overtones and tendentious adjectives, designed to put the matter in a good light. I say to that hon. Minister also: The country is listening eagerly and keenly to hear what he has to say in justification of his Government&#x2019;s action or in defence of what happened on Friday. If his Government condones this, and if it has no word of apology, no word of condemnation, he and his Government must take the consequences. It is a hard thing to say to that Minister, but I am constrained to say that as Minister of Police he shows less efficiency even than as Minister of Economic Affairs. [Interjections.] This, I suggest, is a statement which might almost be ruled unparliamentary, because it is so scathing in meaning!</p>

<p>Sir, we heard a poor catalogue of accusations against these students. Now, let me say again: We acknowledge that there are things going on which need to be taken under control, which need to be stopped and which need to be brought under firmer discipline; there are dangerous things happening. But the paltry tale which that Minister told us this afternoon about &#x201C;kos-huis&#x201D; strikes, of bunking of lectures, was a tale of petty indiscipline at universities, with which everyone in this House who has been at university in the last 50 years, is familiar, and treats with contempt. Sir, to string these petty facts together in order to build up a plausible case of a deep plot, is to bring the whole thing into ridicule. If the hon. the Minister has real facts&#x2014;and we believe he well may have&#x2014;let us hear them, but not this paltry tale of petty &#x201C;crime&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Then the hon. the Prime Minister rose, and he distinguished himself this afternoon by making it quite clear that he is prepared to make a strong and &#x201C;kragdadige&#x201D; speech on the basis neither of known facts nor of known law. He was not aware either of the facts or of the law. He was prepared to make these statements which, on cross-examination by the hon. member for Durban North, he was too afraid to corroborate, and which he was too obstinate to withdraw. He was in real difficulty, and I do not blame him for now absenting himself. To give one example, he said that, given the opportunity or given his presence on Friday or on a subsequent occasion, he would do again what was done on Friday. Sir, I have here a report from the very latest evening paper. It contains a statement from Brig. Loubser, the Commissioner of the Police in the Western Cape. What does he say? He also knows what happened; in fact, he knows better than the Prime Minister what happened on Friday, and this is what he says:</p>

<block name="quote">We do not want Friday&#x2019;s incidents repeated and we will try our best to avoid similar incidents today.</block>

<p>[Interjections.] Here, Sir, is something like an apology, something like a note of regret, something like a retraction. But the hon. the Prime Minister, who was not here, says that he would gladly repeat it if he had been here, or if the occasion were to arise again. So this is the attitude taken by the Government, and we call the country to witness. No word of regret has been expressed, and there has been no word of compunction coming from that side of the House. There has been no apology, not a single word of apology. There has not even been a word of consolation for those who were injured. There were innocent bystanders, and there is not even a word of apology to them.</p>

<p>The whole Western world faces a common phenomenon, a phenomenon of youthful dissent, a phenomenon in which universities are rebellious, and where young people are rebellious against old institutions. They do not wish to go on with the <span class="col_8757-8758" refersTo="page_1334"/>old conventions, the old customs; they wish to create a new world which they are prepared, if necessary, to bring about by dissent and revolt. Their protest takes many forms; it is motivated by many reasons. I have no doubt that it is true, as has been alleged on that side of the House, that these people are frequently used by communists, by people who plot the overthrow of other countries &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>These people seek association with the youths who are in revolt. They try to use them, they try to manipulate them in ways which can be subversive, and I believe it is the task of this Parliament to condemn such activities and that it is the task of the Police Force to control and discipline such activities. The question, Sir, is how you do this. Do you do this in a positive way, or do you do it in a negative way? Do you do it in an effective way, or do you do it in a non-effective way?</p>

<p>Sir, in the course of my life I have seen such activities carried on in various countries. In Rome, for example, I have seen the police take action against a mob of 80 000 communists assembled for hostile, dangerous purposes. I have seen the police using fire hydrants, with dyes to stain people&#x2019;s clothes, to break up meetings of a violent nature, which pale this thing on Friday into insignificance. I have seen the police deal effectively and well with such meetings; I have seen them disperse crowds without inflicting injuries and without recriminations and, most important of all, with the population on the side of the police, laughing with the police and against the communists. This is the way to do it, Sir, I have seen this done in France; I have seen it during the Algerian uprising; I have seen the police take action during the OAS disturbances in Paris, and the police were able to do it in such a way that they retained the sympathy and the confidence of the people of France against the people who were causing the uprising. Sir, I have also seen it happen in England. One also reads of cases where it is done in the wrong way. There was a case not very long ago which horrified the world. It ran round the world just as this incident on Friday will run round the world. At Kent State University there was an up rising; there was disorder; the police overreacted and shot some students. Sir, this has done harm to the image of the police in America but it was more deeply regretted by the upholders of law and order in America than any other action. I say that what happened here on Friday is going to be entirely negative; it is going to alienate the sympathy of the people, and it will in fact cause the sympathy of the people to flow towards these very organizations and serve to cover up their misdeeds. It will cause the sympathy of the people to be rallied on the side of those forces which the Government is trying to combat. Sir, it was an act of the utmost clumsiness; it was an act of the utmost incompetence, and this Government should be thoroughly ashamed of itself. What does it do? It says it is prepared to stand up and be counted; it is prepared to pretend that nothing happened, and that what happened was fully justified.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, I want to come to the men of conscience on that side of the House. There are Ministers who stand up and make public statements and who appear to uphold the forces of democracy. There is the hon. the Minister of the Interior, whom I do not see here now; there is the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs, whom I have heard make many speeches in places other than here; there is the hon. the Minister of National Education. Where is he? There is the hon. the Minister of Planning. Do these gentlemen practise what they preach? Do they uphold violence? Are they happy with the condonation that has been given in this House today? Are they content with the apologetic statements we have heard here? Let them stand up and be counted. Sir, I warn them that the country is waiting for them to speak. The country wants to hear them, and they want to hear them in this debate. We are waiting, and they will gain nothing by silence, because silence will be taken as acquiescence and as consent. We wish to hear them in this debate. What are the consequences of what has happened? Abroad. Sir, I assure this House, the consequences will be disastrous. We will have damage done to our image abroad which cannot be corrected by years of effort, years of good works and years of apologies. We will not undo this damage for a long time. Sir, this is a step back greater than the steps forward that the hon. the Minister of Information has taken in the whole time that he has <span class="col_8759-8760" refersTo="page_1335"/>been in office. We have taken a step today which will not be repaired for years, if ever. I can promise him that as a fact. Inside the country what will the effects be? We have alienated moderate thought in this country. There are many people who are middle-of-the-roaders. They are not interested in agitation; they dislike it. They want an orderly and peaceful life. These people treat the Police as their friends and they look to the Police for their protection. Friday&#x2019;s events caused these people to take sides against the Police and to give their sympathy to people who are agitating and who are seeking provocation. Sir, the whole thing was most unfortunate. I would say that this Government in all its actions, in its economic actions and its political actions, suffers from a dreadful disease which can be described as over-kill. They overdo things, they over-kill. Sir, I withdraw the word over-kill, because it is a neat and efficient word and it indicates a degree of deliberate action. I would like to use the word over-lay, in the sense in which a clumsy, drunken mother overlays her child and smothers it. This is what this Government is doing to this country.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>I was actually very surprised when listening to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition this afternoon. In my humble opinion the hon. the Leader of the Opposition gave a display of ambiguity such as we have very seldom witnessed in this House. He quoted, almost in full, a pamphlet which he claimed was the reason behind this demonstration that was held here in front of the church. He went out of his way to dissociate himself from the contents of that pamphlet and he informed us that the content of that pamphlet, which he quoted to us here, is inflammatory, a pamphlet that wants to promote out-and-out violence in South Africa. That is what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition intimated to us here, and then, after telling us that he wanted nothing to do with that pamphlet, because it wants to promote inflammatory violence, he asked: &#x201C;But what did your Police do?&#x201D; I wrote his words down. That is now his view of the S.A. Police, who took action in circumstances brought about by the pamphlet which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition quoted to us. His standpoint in respect of the Police was: &#x201C;This was a confrontation between inexperienced demonstrators, who were manoeuvred into breaking the law.&#x201D; I very respectfully think that this evidences a scandalous ambiguity, and the hon. the Leader of the Opposition must tell us exactly where he stands. Does he stick to what he said in connection with the pamphlet which he says is a completely inflammatory pamphlet, and if people gather on the authority of that pamphlet, must they be dispersed, or does he want to continue with this statement of his that in actual fact the Police manoeuvred the demonstrators into the position where they could strike them?</p>

<p>I say that the Police of South Africa will take note of the words of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition intimating that they purposely manoeuvred the demonstrators into that position. Then he challenges the hon. the Prime Minister. He asked the hon. the Prime Minister where there was any exaggeration in the weekend newspapers? It seems to me the hon. the Leader of the Opposition did not read those newspapers. On the front page of one of the big English Sunday newspapers there is a whole page of commentary by a certain Miss Pamela Diamond. She gives us a terribly graphic picture of what allegedly happened here on Friday and then states that she was also pushed around and struck by a policeman, and then she realizes how far she has gone with the story she is telling and she herself says: &#x201C;Excuse me, if I sound bitter, but it did hurt.&#x201D; In other words: &#x201C;I am now writing under the influence of those blows that the policeman inflicted on me, and now you must excuse me if I go too far in what I am writing because it hurt me.&#x201D; But let us look at one of the other witnesses. In the same newspaper there was also the evidence of a certain Margaret Ensor, who said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I then entered the Cathedral. Many students assembled there. Soon afterwards a scuffle broke out near the side door, and I suggested to the students there that we should move closer to the altar.</block>

<p>In other words, she is telling the students: See that you get as near to the pulpit as possible, so that it will be a great sin if the Police come and chase us out. Sir, I am sorry, but under the circumstances the hon. the Leader of the Opposition must pardon the Police who were carrying out their duty, because people were using a church to seek shelter after they had <span class="col_8761-8762" refersTo="page_1336"/>made inflammatory speeches. Then the Leader of the Opposition asked the Prime Minister why they allowed the demonstration to continue for so long.</p>

<p>Sir, it surprises me that such a question is asked: Why the Police allowed the demonstration to last so long. This happened specifically because this is a democratic country, and because Col. Crous clearly told them that as long as they kept the peace they could demonstrate as much as they wanted to and they could sit on the pavement as long as they were not doing anything; but the moment a student began to make a speech Col. Crous knew it was becoming a public meeting, and after the student had been told to terminate his speech and stop holding a public meeting, Col. Crous gave the command for a baton charge. Now the hypocritical question is being asked: Why did he not issue the warning in two official languages.</p>

<p>No, there was not. I challenge you to bring them along here. Next time you will receive a blow and nothing will happen to you either. Sir, that was the right kind of action in respect of those students who overstepped the mark with this inflammatory speech on the steps of the Cathedral. Now the hon. member for Durban North asks us: &#x201C;Did the Police not practise beforehand with their batons?&#x201D; But what difference would it make if the Police did practise with their batons? Do they want the policeman to charge, completely unprepared, into a mass of people and hurt them? Must there be no practise? Is there no practise for the Police. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition must not come to this House with ridiculous statements.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for Von Brandis comes along and, almost in tears, tells us of the repercussions abroad. Yes, Sir, there will be repercussions abroad, and I now want to tell the hon. member for Von Brandis that I am glad there will be repercussions abroad. But do you know what these repercussions abroad ought to be? The repercussions ought to involve countries abroad taking note that White South Africa and non-White South Africa who support legal government, are not prepared to allow South Africa to be turned inside out by terrorism and violence. Let the countries abroad take note of that and let them take note that if people begin distributing the kind of pamphlets that were distributed, the kind read out here by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, our Police will have to deal with them in no ungentle manner. And let me now tell that hon. member that if the Police had acted in any other way, the agitators abroad would now be telling these people: You were children, it happened in front of a church and the Police were afraid to tackle you, and the Government was afraid to touch you; now you can begin from the beginning again and you can go from one university to another and hold one demonstration after another. I say I am glad if there are repercussions abroad, and I would be glad if the repercussions were of such a nature as to create the impression that South Africa is absolutely determined that its Government, its form of government and its system will not be overthrown by agitators and crime.</p>

Because the hon. member for Houghton is all set to jump in quite unequivocally as far as this demonstration and the conduct there is concerned. That is why the United Party <span class="col_8763-8764" refersTo="page_1337"/>has had a fright. They are now afraid that the Progressive Party will forestall them as far as a certain sector of the public is concerned. Now they at least have to put up some kind of show here.

<p>The hon. member for Durban North&#x2019;s allegation that the Prime Minister is insensitive to people who were hurt and to the pregnant woman who was struck is, I want to say, devoid of all truth. I want to say this to the hon. member: The hon. the Minister said very clearly from his bench, in his speech, that those excessively injured as a result of Police action will be able to pursue the normal channels. The inquiries will be instituted, and if action has to be taken against a policeman who has overstepped the mark such action will be taken. But, in the very next breath I want to add that when our Police take the kind of action they took on Friday, we as ordinary citizens of South Africa want to say thank you to them for proving to the outside world and to those in the country that South Africa is not prepared to allow illegal conduct to change our system here in any way.</p>

<p>What do you know?</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I arrived very shortly afterwards and I made it my business right through the week-end to cross-examine numerous people who were present. One thing I do know&#x2014;Press reports and even the reports of the Police themselves bear it out&#x2014;is that no &#x201C;oproerige&#x201D; speeches were made from the steps of the Cathedral on Friday afternoon. One man had just begun to use the loud-hailer when he was told by Col. Crous that he was not to use it, at which stage he raised it again and said: &#x201C;I shall ask the Colonel to explain why it is I am not allowed freedom of speech,&#x201D; and then there was the ensuing fracas.</p>

<p>For the hon. member to say that an agitating speech was made is utter nonsense. He does not know what he is talking about. The people who were protesting were not terrorists either; they were young students and they were not terrorists. That is another thing &#x2026; [Interjections.] Thirdly, I would like him to tell me what law they were breaking by being there at all. At the beginning of the meeting the brigadier stated that they may have their meeting, that they may say their say and may stand on the steps as long as they did not break the law. He said that as long as they did not break the law and stayed on the steps, they may continue with their meeting.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>The colonel did that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, you are correct; the colonel said that. There was nothing illegal about it and the whole hideous&#x2014; that is the way I describe it&#x2014;incident developed later when, I believe, the Police lost complete control. They did not only lose control of the situation, but worse still, of themselves. If one examines the photographs as printed in the Press, one sees nothing but grinning pleasure on the faces of the Police as three or four of them are beating up a student lying on the ground. I am not interested in what the hon. the Prime Minister said this afternoon, because he was not here either. He was busy elsewhere, although he hastened to defend the Police, as he would do. He is never happier than when he has a truncheon in his hand metaphorically or otherwise. I was not remotely surprised to hear the hon. the Prime Minister say that in no circumstances he would allow a judicial committee to be appointed to go into the happenings of Friday afternoon. I will <span class="col_8765-8766" refersTo="page_1338"/>leave him aside. I will say to the hon. the Minister who spoke this afternoon that he made a statement very quickly after he said that he would have the matter investigated immediately. I saw the hon. the Minister on Friday afternoon and he said to me that he would have the matter investigated and that he would make a report to Parliament on Monday afternoon. To my astonishment, on Saturday morning, the hon. the Minister had already made a statement to the morning Press in which he said that the Police had acted with great restraint or rather, with great tolerance. All I can say is that he could not have done very much investigating. He could not, for instance, have had talks with the lady Mrs. Van Oudenhove whom I found at the charge office on Friday evening with an enormous lump on her forehead, having been struck down by a baton. I have no doubt of the fact that she will lay a charge. She happens to be somebody who was walking past. She remonstrated with the Police about the way in which they were attacking a student, and she was immediately struck on the head by one of the policemen. She will probably lay a charge against the Police. I doubt whether the hon. the Minister has discussed the matter with her. It is also interesting to see how the reports of the Brigadier and the Colonel conflict as to who gave the order, or did they give the order to charge at more or less the same time? Perhaps the hon. the Minister will also answer a question that he would not answer before. That is whether a warning was given before the baton charge took place.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_police">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POLICE</person>:</from>

<p>I shall answer that question.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Right; then I will ask him a few others. Does he seriously believe that there ever was a necessity for a baton charge? Were the actions of the students so provocative and so lawless that it was necessary at all to have a baton charge? What violence on the part of the students necessitated such action? When the students were breaking up their stand, and it was simply a stand, at the steps of the Cathedral, steps which since time immemorial have been used for protest stands, peaceful protests&#x2014;the steps of the Cathedral have always been used for that by various organizations&#x2014;and went into the Cathedral (they had obviously abandoned the steps) they were pursued and beaten up. Why was it necessary to pursue them and beat them up inside the Cathedral? Perhaps the hon. the Minister will answer that.</p>

<p><i>Inter alia</i>, I would like to know what the certain &#x201C;incidents&#x201D; were that he referred to in his Press statement that compelled the Police to take action. Was it the fact that Col. Crous was attacked? If Col. Crous was attacked, I wonder whether he was not attacked by one of these plain-clothed thugs that the Police seem to be employing to assist them in their operations. I agree with every word that has been said on this side of the House about the dangers of using as policemen unidentifiable thugs who can act any way they like. I want to know since when the South African Police Force has in fact allowed itself to descend to such a low level of behaviour as was done in this case. [Interjections.] I say that those leather-jacketed bully-boys have no place in our Police Force. They are unidentifiable and they are not under any authority. Then I should like to ask the hon. the Minister who spoke this afternoon, what is the relevance of the birth place of the students who were arrested. What is the relevance of where they come from?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_police">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POLICE</person>:</from>

<p>If it is not relevant, why do you worry about it?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Well, I am worried about it because the hon. the Minister produced it as his No. 1 important fact in justifying the Police&#x2019;s action. I consider it completely irrelevant. Presumably, the students come here either to study or they come here as immigrants or they are the children of immigrants. Does it mean that if people come to this country as immigrants, they are not ever allowed to take part in any political action? Are they prohibited from taking part in political activity? What absolute nonsense.</p>

<p>Then, of course, we had the usual story. It was all engineered by communists! I want to know what proof the hon. the Minister has that any of this was engineered by communists. There are radical students at our universities. It would be very surprising if there were not. Every university in the world has its quota of radical students. But the hon. the Minister and hon. member opposite completely misjudge the situation if they believe that the present unrest at our universities is <span class="col_8767-8768" refersTo="page_1339"/>caused and is maintained by radical students only.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Or organized. Let me tell that hon. member that there is widespread unrest at our universities, the White English-speaking universities and, I might say, even to a certain measure at the Afrikaans-speaking universities and at all the ethnic universities. There is a rising grounds well of discontent at those universities. It is there for one very obvious reason. It is not because these are revolutionaries, not because they are radicals, but because, in the case of the White students, they are deeply upset and worried about what is happening in South Africa. They are well aware of all the racial injustices that are taking place in South Africa and they hate it. The Government should be aware of the fact that they are growing to hate the Government too. They intensely dislike these injustices. They know perfectly well that their fellow students at the ethnic universities are not only treated as over-grown schoolboys, but that these people are denied equal opportunities throughout their lives. They feel guilty about this and they do not like what is happening in this country. This week of protest that has been taking place, has been a perfectly legitimate protest; it has been in the cause of education for all the children of South Africa. Let me say un-equivocably that is a cause that I support wholeheartedly. I have always been in favour of education for all our children in South Africa, free and compulsory education just as soon as it could be implemented. I believe that is a just cause for the students to be fighting for. It is right that they should be fighting for that. This Parliament deceives itself if it believes that the only cause of unrest, the only cause of protest meetings and the only cause of protest stands and processions is because the students are the stupid puppets of communists, of terrorists, of outside influences, of evil influences from the &#x201C;buite-land&#x201D;. So, as I said, I do not believe for one moment that there is anything relevant about the birth places of those students.</p>

<p>I also notice that every time anybody mentions &#x201C;We Shall Overcome&#x201D;, which, I believe, was originally a negro spiritual, they put it on the same basis as The Red Flag. They think nothing could be worse than that students should sing &#x201C;We Shall Overcome&#x201D;, but if the hon. members only knew what idiots they make of themselves in the outside world by this sort of nonsense. &#x201C;We Shall Overcome&#x201D; is an accepted student song that is sung at every university throughout the world. It is sung all over the world and no intelligent authority at any university takes any notice of it.</p>

<p>They might even sing it at my funeral. I want to say that a couple of years ago there were student demonstrations and protests here and on the Witwatersrand. Cape Town students stood as is their wont with placards on the Cathedral steps just as they did on Friday. Everything passed off perfectly peacefully. I went to see it and the colonel in charge acted with the greatest good humour and tact. I spoke to the gentleman myself and he said: &#x201C;Mrs. Suzman as long as they stand there as far as I am concerned it is perfectly all right.&#x201D; They had their stand.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>They stood there for the whole period of the lunch hour at least. Everything was perfectly peaceful. The Commandant was there with his policemen around, and nobody did anything and the students dispersed. I had occasion in this House to praise the tact and the good humour of the Commandant. I did not do the same of the man in charge on the Witwatersrand, because at the time the students of the Witwatersrand were demonstrating he turned it into a para-military exercise and called out the armoured cars. A great deal therefore depends on the man in charge, and if the man in charge had enough good sense to handle things properly, all this could have been avoided. To have ordered a baton charge without any warning and to have beaten students up in full view of hundreds of passers by, would then not have happened. <span class="col_8769-8770" refersTo="page_1340"/>Fortunately this does not depend on what I say or even on what other members in this House say, there were hundreds of eyewitnesses. The public of South Africa is disgusted with what happened in Cape Town on Friday. Hon. members live here in a sort of cocoon. They don&#x2019;t know what is going on in the outside world. They haven&#x2019;t the slightest idea. They go around patting each other on the back and saying what wonderful &#x201C;kragdadige&#x201D; fellows they are while they do not know what the reaction of the public outside is. I say the public is disgusted with what happened in South Africa on Friday afternoon. I want to say that the Police, as the hon. member for Von Brandis said, in South Africa could learn a great deal about the handling of crowds from the Police in other countries. I have watched time and again on television in England the handling of huge crowds in Trafalgar Square and at Grosvenor Square. The Police use the utmost restraint. Their objective is to avoid violence at all costs. But not here. The sturdy guardians of law and order pile in with enthusiasm against a crowd of unarmed, defenceless students. I say that this country is fast losing its balance. That starts right at the top with the Prime Minister and the hon. the Minister of Police, not to mention, of course, that model of self-control, the hon. the Minister of Defence. All of these gentlemen set the example. They condone these acts of violence and that permeates through the whole echelon of the people who should be maintaining law and order. One gets it in the Army, where in lectures given to recruits in the Army, students are quoted as being the enemies and this is how one handles them. Every day one gets somebody or other making a speech against students, the terrorists, the underminers, the communists, the subversives. So, naturally, when young policemen go into action against students all they can see in front of them are enemies of South Africa. [Interjections.] &#x201C;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201D; says the hon. member behind me. These young students feel strongly about their democratic values, and that is what everybody in this House has forgotten. They value certain democratic values which hon. members on the other side have long ago put from them in the interests of self-preservation. In the interests of self-preservation they have put behind them many of the Western democratic values, which students all over the world, including thank God our students more particularly at the English-language universities, continue to cherish despite the fact that they have had 23 years of Nationalist Party indoctrination at the schools, over the radio, and by virtue of laws which educate them to think in a certain direction. They have managed to maintain their respect for the Tenets of Western democracy.</p>

<p>I cannot answer the second question of the hon. member because I do not know what part the pamphlet played, but I do know that there has been a whole week of protest at all the universities about the education system. As the hon. the Minister mentioned, I took part &#x2026; [Interjections.] I will answer the first part of the hon. member&#x2019;s question. There are certain things in that pamphlet with which I disagree, but there are also things in that pamphlet with which I heartily agree. I heartily agree that wages are too low, and that there is exploitation of the workers. I do agree that everybody should have the right of collective bargaining and I do believe that everybody should have meaningful political rights. I cannot remember the rest of the contents, but I do not agree to changes by revolution. I agree with many of the other things in that pamphlet, and I say so quite frankly.</p>

<p>I should think I made it very clear over and over again in this House. As I have said, there is unrest on our campuses throughout South Africa, and I am surprised that the hon. the Minister of Education is not here &#x2026; Ah, he has arrived in the nick of time. What a perfect entrance! Well done! I am glad to see that the hon. the Minister of Education is here. He is the guardian of our universities and I want to know if it does not occur to him that there is serious cause for concern because of the unrest at our universities and that it cannot just be dismissed as the work of agitators. Something has to be done and done quickly to try to stem the growing unrest, particularly at the ethnic universities. At the moment that unrest <span class="col_8771-8772" refersTo="page_1341"/>is particularly centred around the way in which students are treated by the administrators of the universities, but the basis of the unrest is much deeper than that. It is the lack of equal opportunity both before and after they get to their universities and when they leave the universities. It is in order to associate themselves with the unrest and the feelings of the students at the ethnic universities that our young students at the White universities are demonstrating.</p>

<p>I do not believe that we have had any sort of satisfactory explanation from the hon. the Minister of Police at all. I do not believe that he has answered any of the relevant questions. All that every single member on the Government side has stood up to do is to justify the violence used by the Police on Friday. I want to say that earlier this afternoon there was another demonstration on the steps of the cathedral. I was there and there were thousands upon thousands of citizens there as well. I could not count them, but there were scores of policemen. Certainly, for the first part of the meeting until about two o&#x2019;clock there were no incidents whatever. People went inside the cathedral when they were asked to clear the steps. The policemen in charge exercised restraint and there were no baton charges, to start with anyway. Later, I believe, the crowds were dispersed by means of tear gas. If hon. members opposite do not believe that there are thousands of citizens, not terrorists, not communists, not radicals, who are furious at what happened to the young students on Friday afternoon, are deceiving themselves. They should have come to the Cathedral today. They should make it their business to get out of this Chamber, out of this insulation that they enjoy inside this Chamber, and get outside into the real world and see what is happening in South Africa today. [Interjections.] Well, it seems to me that I am the only one that is moving around. Admittedly I did not go to the rugby on Saturday. I thought that perhaps there were more important things to do. It is perhaps because we lost the rugby test that everybody on that side is in such a bad mood. Of course, losing the match is a national calamity. That is really important; it is a real national calamity. I am very sorry about that, but nevertheless leaving that national calamity to one side, I hope I will get some answers from the hon. the Minister of Police.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I was afforded an opportunity earlier this afternoon of giving a very detailed account of all the events as I see them, and consequently I do not consider it necessary to go into all these events again in detail. But in the course of this debate certain questions were put in regard to which I think it is my duty to give a greater measure of clarity. Right at the outset this afternoon I said that I did not want to go into the specific details of the matter, because various cases were pending. I am afraid that the debate has by now taken its course to such an extent that no cognizance whatsoever has really been taken of these circumstances. Nevertheless, I shall in spite of that attempt to furnish a reply to certain of the questions.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton said, <i>inter alia</i>, that she was not in favour of a change through revolution; but now I want to ask her, in all honesty, whether that is not what she encouraged this afternoon.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, she knows as well as I do that it is the aim of these people to bring about a change by way of revolution. After all, the accepted and traditional procedure is what the hon. member is going to adopt tomorrow evening. A meeting has been called in the Cape Town City Hall, where she is going to appear as one of the speakers. She is at liberty to persuade the entire country and all its people to vote for her party if that is what she wants to do. Surely that is the democratic way. But any demonstration contains the elements of revolution. If the hon. member were to be honest with herself, she would admit that the people did not come and stand at the top end of Adderley Street simply because they wanted to stand there peacefully and quietly, and the other people could simply walk by. Why should it in fact be the top end of Adderley Street?</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, there you have it! Other people must see them; a crowd must gather; there must be traffic congestion; there must be problems and difficulty and blood must flow. If the hon. member and the professors and students of Cape Town University want to demonstrate, <span class="col_8773-8774" refersTo="page_1342"/>let them go to the Rondebosch Common; let them have all the cameras, newspapers and banners there. If they do that in silence, surely it is not a disruption of order. But the hon. member knows as well as I do that that is not their intention. On these steps of the Cathedral in Cape Town there is hardly room for 200 people to stand. This afternoon they want to come and stand on those steps with 2 000 people. Where did they want to stand? I do not want to digress too far on this matter, but I know that the hon. member never speaks well of the South African Police. She spoke here this afternoon of thugs.</p>

<p>The hon. member came to speak to me on Friday afternoon, and she was very excited and upset. She then told me that she had subsequently, after the events, turned up there and given me the information which she had received there, and so on. I then told her that I would make a full statement on the matter in this Parliament this afternoon, because the hon. member for Durban North had already told me at that stage that he would put a question. After this, later on in the evening, because I had found it necessary to send at least a little of the correct story into the world, I changed my mind and made a brief general statement in which no details on the actual facts appeared. I changed my mind.</p>

<p>Women can change their minds, and we love them for it. Why should I not change my mind? I changed my mind, and I made a brief statement on the Friday evening. The hon. member took this amiss of me, and she stated in the newspapers that it was strange that I had changed my mind. Sir, I say again that I think that under these circumstances the Police acted with great tolerance. This demonstration on the steps began at 2 p.m., and these events only took place at 20 minutes to 4. For one hour and 40 minutes the Police were in fact being provoked.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<p>What provocation?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I quoted from a newspaper report this afternoon all the unpleasant things which were said to the Police there. The Police were being provoked during that time. The students would not listen to the instructions of the Police, and I think that the Police displayed the greatest measure of tolerance. The hon. member asks me whether I think this baton-charge was really necessary. Yes, I think so. Sir, I sketched the circumstances to you this afternoon. The hon. member came to tell me on Friday evening that the students were standing there protesting peacefully and quietly; that young Kemp wanted to speak through the loud-hailer; that Col. Crous then told him that he must not speak through the loud-hailer, and that the Police then, without any reason, fell on the students and struck them. That is the story the hon. member heard, but I have furnished an explanation here this afternoon of what happened. Not only was Col, Crous struck from behind, but he was prevented by this crowd and by the students from performing his duty, and that is why it became necessary to take action against them. But over and above that, there was at that stage complete confusion; to a certain extent a state of chaos had developed among this crowd. Violence was already being used before the Police took action, and under these circumstances the Police had to use violence. Sir, if the Police had not used violence, can you imagine what would have happened there? The entire situation would have deteriorated into disorder. For a matter of five minutes there was a charge, and the Police used batons, and with that the whole matter was settled.</p>

<p>The hon. member apparently knows what happened there. I invite him to come and give evidence. There will be cases before the court; he can come and give evidence there, and if he wishes to take any action, he can lay a charge.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition asked who actually gave the orders. I shall try to sketch the picture for you as I see it. Col. Crous went up to Kemp and told him that he could not hold a meeting there; that he could not speak through the loud-hailer; that it was a contravention of a law. I shall inform the hon. members in a moment in terms of which law it was an offence. Col. Crous told him that he could not speak through the loud-hailer, and that he should stop doing so, but Kemp did not stop doing so; he carried on again and addressed the crowd through the loud-hailer. Col. Crous then went to speak to him again, and when he would not listen, Col. Crous went up to him and took him by the arm, because the colonel had to do something; he had to arrest him because he would not listen, and because he had contravened a statutory provision, and when the colonel did this, he was struck from behind and prevented by other demonstrators from performing his duty; from doing what he intended doing, and at that stage Brig. Lamprecht, who was near to him, saw that a state of disorder was developing, and he then told the Police to take action. At more or less the same time, strangely enough, Col. Crous instructed the Police to clear the steps; those were his orders. That is what happened there. I hope the hon. the Leader of the Opposition now has the picture which I have. Strangely enough, these two Police officers realized the need for Police action at more or less the same time and then gave their orders in this connection.</p>

<p>Who was in command?</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Col. Crous is the District Commandant. Sir, the hon. member for Durban North and the hon. member for Houghton have asked why the Police did not first issue a warning. The Police were not acting in terms of the Riotous Assemblies Act. The Riotous Assemblies Act provides that a warning should first be issued. The hon. member for Durban North referred to these statutory provisions, but he was of course completely wide of the mark &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#members">

<from><person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBERS</person>:</from>

<p>As usual.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; as usual. The action taken by the Police was in no way in terms of the Riotous Assemblies Act. The action was in performance of the duties of the Police in terms of section 5 of the Police Act. In this process Col. Crous warned Kemp in terms of the Cape Regulation 1938 published in Provincial Administration Notice 337 of 1946, dated 15th August, 1946, and issued in terms of Ordinance 10 of 1912, which relates to the holding of public meetings without prior authorization from the City Council. Col. Crous told Kemp that in terms of that provision he was not allowed to address the meeting. Sir, I also want you to understand the further picture which this gave rise to. Here Kemp is standing at the side of the street; perhaps he is standing a little way off the side-walk, but if he speaks through the loud-hailer, the entire street <span class="col_8777-8778" refersTo="page_1344"/>becomes part of the meeting; then it is no longer a private action on his part; it becomes a public action, even if he was standing a little way off the side-walk, on private property. I hope that this ignorance which was displayed in respect of the actions of the Police will now cease to exist. Col. Crous, on a number of prior occasions, told Kemp that he should stop addressing the crowd through the loud-hailer, but when it became necessary to take action, no further warnings were issued, nor was it necessary to do so.</p>

<p>How many?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That I cannot say. They were part of the 30, but my information is that they did not have batons. On that point I shall still have to obtain full information. Now the hon. member for Wynberg comes along and asks why we did not use tear-gas. I want to tell her that tear-gas is not always the practical means to use. [Interjections.] If the hon. member would only give me a chance to explain she would be a little the wiser afterwards. Tear-gas is not always a practical thing to use. In the circumstances prevailing on Friday afternoon there were a group of students against whom action had to be taken. It was not necessary to take action against a vast crowd. There were quite a number of innocent people standing in the vicinity, and in fact the traffic had already been disrupted in the process. But there was no reason to disperse the crowds which were standing around. That is why tear-gas was not used, and also because tear-gas would have greatly inconvenienced the innocent people in the vicinity.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, because we wanted to beat the students, because the students were the culprits and we did not want to penalize other people because we had to take action against the students. But this afternoon it was different. There tear-gas was in fact used at the top end of Adderley Street, but this was because thousands of people had gathered there as a result of prior notice and reports, and we were compelled to disperse the crowds, not because we wanted to take action against them, but because we simply could not allow such a crowd consisting of thousands of people to gather at the top end of Adderley Street. That is why we used tear-gas this afternoon, to the very great inconvenience, I am afraid, of the people who were in that vicinity; I am sorry about that, but we had no choice.</p>

<p>Then the hon. the Leader of the Opposition came along and asked the very strange question: &#x201C;Why did they not take action earlier?&#x201D; Now, what should they have done earlier? I ask you! I explained to you. The students were standing there, and they invited more and more people, as simply happens, to stand closer, and this crowd began to gather. But I have also said that the students were careful not to commit any offence. They stood there, and it was only later in the afternoon that the incident with the loud-hailer occurred. Although they were causing disruption at the top end of Adderley Street, they were being careful. What should we have done earlier? Did the hon. the Leader of the Opposition want us to hit out with the batons earlier, when there were fewer people? The hon. member said we should <span class="col_8779-8780" refersTo="page_1345"/>have taken action earlier. The Police warned them. [Interjections.] The hon. members on the opposite side mentioned the harm this will do overseas. Surely they tend to see only the harm which will be caused overseas to the exclusion of all else. They would prefer to avoid the harm which will be caused overseas, if there should be any, which I do not believe. I think the rest of the world will realize that here in South Africa there is a Government which takes action against elements such as these. When Israel takes harsh action against hijackers, that is fine, that is all in order. Israel is appreciated for doing so, but when we do so, it is not appreciated.</p>

<p>I happen to have the figures here of what it costs us to keep students at university. It costs the State R8 000 to have a doctor qualify&#x2014;and then I take it that he has to get through every year. This is the allowance to a university. To have a dentist qualify, it costs R8 600. A teacher costs us R931 per annum. One can deduce from this that it costs the State and the taxpayer approximately R1 000 per annum to keep a student at university, and in addition this Government, we on this side of the House, have given them the vote. All those students sitting there, who are South Africans, have the vote. I take it that all of them are older than 18 years, and for that reason all of them have the vote. But the hon. member does not want them to use their democratic vote. Oh no, they must cause disturbances and waste their time at university.</p>

<p>What happened today? The hon. member and other hon. members are sitting comfortably on these green benches, but what happened on Friday and again today to a certain extent is erupting in other places as well. I have received word, and here I want to refer to what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said, that matters are not being exaggerated. It has been established that a rumour is going the rounds of the Pietermaritzburg campus that one of the Cape Town students was killed during the events last Friday. Even now this is happening at Pietermaritzburg. Before every class commences, students are asked to stand for one minute in silence in honour of the student who has supposedly died. [Interjections.] Then I also have the names of the lecturers who are responsible for these students now having to rise to pay their last respects. In Johannesburg, where no permission was granted today for the students to hold a procession, at the University of the Witwatersrand, 150 to 160 students went in procession to St. Mary&#x2019;s Cathedral&#x2014;again to a Cathedral.</p>

I refer to the hon. members for Stilfontein and Harrismith. When my leader, in his speech, referred to the fact that a pregnant woman had been beaten and ill-used, those two hon. gentlemen almost laughed their heads off.

<p>He was full of laughter, especially when the hon. the Leader of the Opposition was speaking. Dealing briefly with the hon. Minister of Police, I am terribly sorry that he would not allow questions that the hon. members for Bezuidenhout and Umbilo wanted to put to him. As we know, these two hon. members were at the scene, the hon. member for Umbilo while it was happening, and the hon. member for Bezuidenhout a short while later. I think the questions that would have been put to him could have clarified the position very much indeed. But, as we have seen, his was essentially an evasive speech. I just want to touch on a few things that he said. Talking of the demonstrators, he said that the aim of these people was to bring about change by revolution. Is he serious about this? If he is, then is the answer to this charge of bringing about change by revolution, having a baton charge after an altercation over the possession of a microphone? No, that does not wash. If his charge against these people is one of subversion or wanting to bring about change by revolution, then that is not the way to go about it, and he knows it. I think he came very much closer to the truth a little later on when he said: &#x201C;Ons wou die studente slaan. Ons wou die studente <span class="col_8783-8784" refersTo="page_1347"/>straf.&#x201D; As my hon. Leader put it, the police, on all the evidence that we have seen so far, have set themselves up as the witnesses, as the judges and as the executioners. That is precisely what that hon. Minister was saying. In saying that, he betrayed every element of the cause that the speakers on the Government side have tried to present to this House this afternoon.</p>

<p>Just one other thing to show how far out of touch he is. He said the &#x201C;slanery&#x201D;, the baton charge, lasted only five minutes. He invited hon. members on this side of the House who thought otherwise to give evidence to the contrary. If ever anybody in this House this afternoon supported a case for a judicial commission, this was it. If he wants to give hon. members on this side of the House a chance to testify as to what they saw and when they saw it, he, as a lawyer, knows that the only proper venue would be a judicial commission. I shall come back to that in a moment.</p>

<p>We have also had a strange number of contradictions. Earlier in this debate the hon. the Prime Minister said that as far as he was aware, Col. Crous did issue a warning to the people before the baton charge took place. A few moments ago we had the hon. the Minister explaining to us why no warning was given. He said that it was because this baton charge did not take place under the Riotous Assemblies Act. Who is right: the Prime Minister or that hon. Minister? What are they trying to tell this House: what are they trying to tell the country? No, I think it is quite clear that no warnings were given, and warnings should have been given. That is another thing that could be fruitfully investigated by a judicial commission.</p>

<p>What evidence has this House deduced this afternoon? What seems to have emerged is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of undisciplined Police behaviour and. in some cases at least, wanton and indiscriminate beating of men and women, some of them journalists who were merely there in the execution of their duties. I shall come back to this a little later. This may cause merriment to hon. gentlemen opposite, but it was no cause for merriment to the people concerned, and these included journalists representing the newspapers also of that side of the House.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to come to the question of our request for a judicial commission. The hon. the Prime Minister, when he spoke, dismissed this plea. He said he was not going to waste his time with it and that he was going to refuse it. He referred casually to &#x201C;&#x2019;n klein bietjie geweld&#x201D;, a small amount of force or violence that was used. He also made the point&#x2014;and I am surprised that a man of his political experience should make it&#x2014; that a judicial inquiry would give some people the opportunity to gain even more publicity for the Police violence than we have seen already. I reject those reasons; I do not for one moment believe that those are the true reasons. The true reason is that the Prime Minister is afraid of the outcome of a judicial inquiry. I submit to you, Sir, that he does not have the courage to place the issues before an independent Judge and to hear that Judge&#x2019;s findings.</p>

<p>Digressing for a moment, he replied to a few interjections from this side of the House about another judicial commission that had been appointed. This was at a time when he seemed to have no worries about appointing judicial commissions. I refer to the judicial commission he appointed so quickly into the Kolver affair. I think if ever he learnt his lesson about judicial commissions and the impartiality of judicial commissions, this was it. Then, after the Kolver inquiry, as this House well knows, had returned findings that were politically unacceptable to him, he repudiated the judge in this very House. Not only did he repudiate the judge, but he made some scurrilous accusations &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>We challenged him to repeat those accusations outside and, in fact, one of his newspapers had the audacity to make similar accusations outside of the privilege of this House. What happened? Well, it is a matter of record. We sued them and they paid damages. They apologized to us and paid costs. That is why the hon. the Prime Minister would not follow up his accusations. That, I submit, is the sharp lesson he learnt about judicial commissions. They sometimes produce very awkward findings.</p>

<p>What would a judicial commission be called upon to investigate here? After all, we know there is a prospect of criminal prosecutions, but there is a large area which should be properly investigated which would probably not be dealt with by a criminal court. We have the question of whether the Police should have issued warnings before they had their baton charge; we have the question raised by my hon. leader, of whether the Police should have held a baton charge at all. Nothing we have heard this afternoon has thrown any light on this. I should think that if the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s conduct follows what we have seen this afternoon he is going to steer well away from this very thorny point. While the hon. the Prime Minister was speaking, and he seems to have been the one who in his quaint way has told us more about this even though he seems to know less than anybody else, he asked us a few things. He said &#x201C;Where do we stand,&#x201D; &#x201C;When are we going to decide where we stand,&#x201D; and &#x201C;Where?&#x201D;.

<speech by="#oliver">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026;but this requirement applies as much to the Police as it applies to the public at large. The Prime Minister said that he had gained the overwhelming impression that my leader stood on the side of those who were against the Police. Did he not understand the whole point of this debate? We are vitally concerned about the Police, because after all do they not rely on the goodwill of the public to a large measure for the success of their work? What we are concerned about is the type of leadership that is being given to the Police by the hon. gentleman opposite. That is the real burden of our case. There is one other thing the hon. the Prime Minister mentioned, and I want to touch on the Press a little later if I may, when he talked about &#x201C;trial by newspaper&#x201D;. Does he not believe the pictures he sees in the newspapers? Does he believe that they were fabricated? In his own newspapers he saw pictures that quite blatantly make out a case, a <i>prima facie</i> case, of gross misuse of force by the Police.</p>

<p>In the time available to me I want to come back to the hon. the Minister of Police and deal with a few of the things that he said in relation to the Press, just to indicate what utter nonsense that Minister was speaking when he answered the question put to him earlier this afternoon by the hon. member for Durban North. Among other things, and here that hon. Minister was dealing with the attacks by policemen on newspaper people who were present on Friday afternoon merely to carry out their duties as reporters or photographers, he said that people who do not associate with demonstrations of this kind should stay well away. How can he conceivably expect this to apply to newspaper people, the very essence of whose work brings them very close to the centre of things? He said, and here he addressed himself directly to the newspaper people, that as reasonable people, how could they expect that the Police would recognize them? I do not know what difficulty any policeman should have in recognizing a newspaper photographer, for example. What is the problem there? I should have thought by now that newspaper photographers are readily recognizable if by nothing other than the cameras they are carrying. The fact that a person is taking pictures, I should imagine, probably indicates more than anything else that he is not actually involved in any demonstration. Now what about the reporters who were on the scene? We have been told that some of these reporters displayed their <span class="col_8787-8788" refersTo="page_1349"/>Police identity cards, but that this did not help them in the least. They were still assaulted by the policemen, and of course we also have <i>prima facie</i> evidence of women, one photographer and one reporter, having been assaulted in the course of their duties. That hon. Minister seemed to have relied very heavily, as far as the attack on the Police were concerned, on an anonymous message that was transmitted to the <i>Cape Times</i> yesterday and published in their edition of this morning. If I may say so, it makes interesting reading; but it is stretching journalistic ethics to a very far point when a newspaper in trying to present both sides of the story is prepared to publish at that length allegations by an anonymous telephone caller. I think that, if anything, the <i>Cape Times</i> must be complimented for the manner in which they have gone out of their way so far to try to present both sides of a most unsatisfactory picture.</p>

<p>There has rightly been a reaction from journalists about the attacks made upon them on the scene. The president of the Society of Journalists, Mr. Strydom, was perfectly right when he criticized the Police in very severe terms for the action they took against journalists on the scene, when he pointed out that cameras were confiscated, films whipped out of them and some journalists assaulted. Sir, I think, in fairness to the Police, that they themselves must have known, as they did this, that what they were doing was illegal. You see, there is an agreement between the Press and the Police, an agreement that sets out in very clear terms what is expected of both sides. I might say here that I was a party to the negotiation of this agreement a good number of years ago with the Commissioner of Police, and in a very co-operative atmosphere. The agreement states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Police realize that the Press has a duty to inform the public fully, precisely and as speedily as possible, of all newsworthy occurrences &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is the duty of the Police&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and the Press realizes that in the performance of its duty, the administration of justice should not be prejudiced and the Police not impeded in their investigations.</block>

<p>Now, Sir, I think it can be said quite safely and fairly that the Press last Friday stuck to their side of the agreement; but I am afraid that it cannot be said that the Police stuck to theirs. There seems to have been a disturbing tendency over the years&#x2014;and we have seen it highlighted in this event&#x2014; on the part of policemen to believe that Press photographers should not take photographs at the scene of disturbances. Down the years I have been concerned with a good number of these cases. We have had instances of policemen beating newspaper photographers, of policemen confiscating their cameras, and destroying or spoiling their films, but never have I known of a case quite as serious as this, and I think it can be fairly said that this incident on Friday represented a low water mark in the relations between the Police and the Press. I hope that the Commissioner of Police and the hon. the Minister of Police will now do their utmost to try to repair the damage that has been caused.</p>

<p>We have just seen an exceptional display of bravery from the hon. member for Kensington. He himself acknowledged that he was not present at the time of the incident, and on pure hearsay evidence he has made all kinds of accusations against the hon. member for Stilfontein. In addition he said that the Prime Minister is afraid to appoint a judicial commission of inquiry. Sir, the Prime Minister stated very clearly that lawsuits may in fact be instituted; complaints can be made and evidence can be submitted. Sir, what more does one want in a democratic state? Charges can be laid; evidence can be furnished, and if need be an appeal can be lodged. This is as democratic, even more democratic than a judicial commission. [Interjection.] That hon. member knows nothing about legal matters; he must keep quiet. Sir, the hon. member for Kensington followed a typical United Party pattern here today. It is true that he did speak each time of <i>&#x201C;prima facie</i> evidence&#x201D;, but he had already found the Police guilty, because he spoke of &#x201C;undisciplined Police behaviour&#x201D;. The whole trend of his speech lacks any sign of <i>prima facie</i> evidence; the whole trend of his speech was convicting the Police.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to go further and say that the United Party&#x2019;s display here this afternoon is typical of the pattern they are following these days. In their enthusiasm to decry the National Party Government they do not care what methods they employ and what they say in this House to decry <span class="col_8789-8790" refersTo="page_1350"/>the National Party and its administration of the country. But, Sir, there is one thing they do not take into account; they do not take into account how in the process, they are besmirching South Africa, locally and abroad. What did the hon. the Leader of the Opposition do here today? He gave a long list of evidence here&#x2014;it is also hearsay evidence, because he was not present&#x2014; about what the Police are alleged to have done, about violations they are alleged to have committed. He did say in one sentence, it is true, that he did not know whether this was so because he was not there. Sir, what will the outside effect be? The pressmen, the &#x201C;stringers&#x201D; in South Africa who send news overseas, will just mention these allegations of Police violations and make no mention of the fact that the Leader of the Opposition said he had not seen it with his own eyes. But, Sir, I have a much more serious charge than that against the United Party. The United Party is definitely adopting tactics whereby they wish to intimate to countries abroad that there is no longer a democratic Government in power here in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg also says that is right. I am sorry she is now leaving the Council Chamber, because I specifically want to come back to her. Here the hon. gentleman states&#x2014;I am sorry, he is not honourable&#x2014;here Mr. Donald Woods states the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But many of the methods of Nationalism are more like the methods of Communism than those of any other political party in the world.</block>

<p>Further on he states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That Liberalism is the enemy of Nationalism in South Africa is obvious; that it is the enemy of Communism is even more obvious, if one studies world events.</block>

<p>Sir, it is of course very clear that this gentleman knows absolutely nothing about history. How did Communism take root in Russia? After the Tsar was overthrown a Liberalist called Karensky, not a Communist, came into power in Russia early in 1917, and it only took a few months of liberalistic government before the Communists came into power. Sir, today I want to say this to the people of South Africa: If you hand over the reins of Government to the United Party, then you are handing over the reins of government to a Karensky rule. It will be a liberal government, a government that is weak at the knees, and South Africa would then go the same way Russia went. Sir, how does the United Party tie up with Donald Woods? The United Party has purposely followed the same pattern this sitting. The hon. member for Wynberg, who has now left the Council Chamber in spite of the fact that I asked her to stay, made untrue, serious accusations against a policeman in this House. She made use of the privilege of this House to do so. She would not say those things outside. The Police therefore have no chance as far as she is concerned. I do not want to dig up all the old scores, but the main speaker on justice on the Opposition side said here this year that the courts are now the only fortress against chaos in this country, a clear insinuation that this government consists of a lot of fascists and that the Police use Gestapo methods. In the Justice debate I read the quotations of the main speaker on the Opposition side from the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 31st October, 1971, in which he intimated and insinuated that the Police use Gestapo methods. This debate is supposed to be conducted in the light of the fact that everything is <i>sub judice</i>. It was clearly said to us that court proceedings are to be instituted or have already been instituted, but in spite of that hon. members on that side came along with nothing but complaints against the Police. That is why I say that <span class="col_8791-8792" refersTo="page_1351"/>as far as that side of the House is concerned the Police have no chance at all. Although it is camouflaged by saying that it is <i>prima facie</i> evidence, the whole tone of the Leader of the Opposition and all his speakers indicates that the Police are guilty of the grossest atrocities. I want to say from this side of the House that we are grateful to the South African Police Force for what they are doing in these distressful days. In spite of provocation, and in spite of danger to their lives, on this specific day they protected life and property at several spots in the most exemplary fashion. From our side we thank the Police very much. This does not mean that members on this side of the House are saying thank you to every policeman. There have been cases in the past where individual policemen have perhaps committed offences, and this side is not condoning that. But this side is not prepared to associate itself with the creation of a general feeling against the Police, as the Opposition has done here today.</p>

<p>The allegation, which is of course totally unfounded, that this side of the House wishes to create the impression that the Government of South Africa is no longer democratic but in fact fascist, is one with which I intend to deal in my speech, and I want to say only this at this stage. If anyone is trying to create that impression about the Government of South Africa, then it is the Government itself by its deeds. Nothing that we say could do it better. Nothing we say on this side of the House could do more to create the impression of a fascist Government than the deeds and words of the members of the Government themselves. What we are trying to do is to show the world that South Africa is in fact still democratic. That is why it is so important to us that when something happens which shocks the conscience of thinking people, we feel and believe that it should be properly and impartially investigated, that the details should be examined and exposed for the world to see. If there has been a fault or mistake it should be dealt with, and if there has not been then the world can see there has not. It is this attempt to hide things, to cover things up which does so much to harm the good name of South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member knows you cannot bring out the facts of a total incident in the sort of court case which will flow from this incident. I have no time to deal with that at length but common sense should show the hon. member that there is no sort of charge which can be laid which will bring out a decision from the magistrate on whether there was a warning before the charge, or whether the amount of violence used was excessive or more than was needed to deal with the situation. Those are not things on which a court must decide. These are issues which can only be decided on a broader field by investigating the incident as a whole. The issue, and it is a simple issue, is whether too much unnecessary force was used where other methods could have achieved the same effect. The answer came from the hon. Minister of Police who said: &#x201C;Ons wou die studente slaan; ons wou hulle straf.&#x201D; In other words, the object of the exercise was not to break up a gathering, was not to stop an illegal act and was not to clear a crowd, but it was to punish people. That is something which will do more harm to South Africa and the good name of South Africa than anything which we on this side of the House can ever say.</p>

<p>This has been a sad session for South Africa, a sad session which started in hopeful speculation. There was hopeful speculation that we were to enter a session of &#x201C;uitwaartse beleid&#x201D;, of &#x201C;verligtheid&#x201D;, a new era in politics. The Government had won the election, they were powerful and now we were going to see a &#x201C;verligte&#x201D; approach. South Africa looked with hope to the six months that are now behind us. At the end of it, instead of seeing those hopes fulfilled, we end this session in the shadow of the truncheon, the truncheon that has brought joy to frightened little men, to frightened little minds which see the weapons of violence and force as a substitute for policy and reason in governing a country.</p>

<p>When you substitute force and violence for reason and policy and argument you are admitting that your case is bad&#x2014;that you have no case to argue. You are then exhibiting the signs of fear&#x2014;of your inability to carry out the responsibility of government. We have for nearly six months been trying to concentrate the attention of this House on the problems of governing South Africa. We have tried to bring Parliament back, over <span class="col_8793-8794" refersTo="page_1352"/>and over again to the issues of government, to the failure of Government policy, to Cabinet weaknesses, to maladministration and to the lack of control by Cabinet Ministers over their departments, of which the Agliotti affair was an example. We tried to show the failure of the Government to take corrective action when things were in fact found out and brought to light. We have pointed to their failure in the economic administration of South Africa, to the problems of the ordinary man, the cost of living, of housing, to the struggle of the ordinary worker and family man to exist, to the problems of the pensioner and the problems arising from the lack of compassion of this Government. This is a government with no compassion towards people. We have pointed to their failures in the field of policy, the policy of the Government towards the urban Bantu, the policy towards the Coloureds, towards the finding and the creating of jobs for people of all races in South Africa. We have pointed to the collapse, in reality, of the Bantustan policy and the dangers which it is creating in sowing, inspiring and stirring up Black African nationalism. These and more issues of this nature are what we have for week after week, for nearly six months, been throwing across the floor of this House, seeking an answer from the Government. Instead, we found first of all, a Government obsessed by by-elections, a Government placing short term votes for their party before the welfare of South Africa. It is a government which lost its head over by-elections and which reverted to elemental Nationalism, which revived dead and buried issues, issues which we believe should have remained dead and buried. It revived racialism between White and White, &#x201C;Afrikanerhaat&#x201D;; it revived the worst of the old &#x201C;swartgevaar&#x201D;, the fear policies of the Government, the &#x201C;gogga-maak-vir-baba bang&#x201D; policy and even got back to reviving from the grave the memory of Jopie Fourie. So we have had a debate with two angles to it. [Interjections.] This is not a soap-box, for the information of the hon. the Minister of Sport and Recreation. This is the Parliament of South Africa. I am trying to show how when we deal with the issues affecting South Africa, a frightened Government, frightened because of by-elections, got back to Jopie Fourie, stripped from itself the mask of unity, the mask of &#x201C;uitwaarts&#x201D; and &#x201C;verlig&#x201D; and showed itself exactly what it is, namely a Government afraid of itself. Nationalist Ministers spoke from the heart this session. I am doing just that now. If I speak with feeling, it is because we have as much a right to speak from the heart &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026;to speak of the things that matter to us as any Minister on that side of the House has. I believe that much of the political fight in South Africa is unreal, because many good and sincere people are missing the fundamental issue. They are missing the cold hard fact of life, which is that there is only one real political fight in South Africa. That is between the authoritarian approach of the sectional political party now in Government and the conservative South Africanism of the United Party. All the rest is idle theory. The hon. the Prime Minister said this afternoon that he was &#x201C;sat en moeg&#x201D; of all sorts of things.</p>

<p>*There are many things I am also sick and tired of, and I want to mention a few of them. I am sorry the hon. member for Houghton is not here. There are many things I am also sick and tired of, and one of them is the theoretical debate which is being conducted in clubs and in so-called intellectual circles about the so-called problems of South Africa&#x2014;debates which have nothing to do with the reality of South African politics, because the real fight is between that Nationalist Government and this United Party. It is between the conservatism of this party as against the sectionalism and the radicalism of that party now in government. But the greatest friends of that side of the House are those who advance these idealistic arguments. What is more, the extremists of South African politics &#x2026; [Interjections.] Yes, the longhaired exhibitionists are the best friends of that side of the House, because they help to keep them in power.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I want to say quite clearly that I am talking about the long-haired exhibitionists. I am not talking about the genuine young South African who follows current fashion. I am taking about the sort of people the hon. the Prime Minister talked about today, the sort of people my leader talked about today&#x2014;the people who are trying to <span class="col_8795-8796" refersTo="page_1353"/>stir up trouble and unrest in South Africa. They are taking with them innocent and decent young people. It is not a question of how a man wears his hair; it is how his mind works. When I refer to the exhibitionists, I refer to how their minds work. Those people are the greatest friends of the Nationalist Party. I am also intolerant and angry when I hear talk of revolution, talk of destroying the social structure of South Africa and talk of overthrowing everything we know in South Africa. That annoys me as much as it annoys any Nationalist. What happens, therefore, is that, when the average South African hears this and he hears the Nats saying &#x201C;Ons sal julle beskerm&#x201D;, they tend to move towards the Nationalists. Therefore what these people are in fact achieving, this lunatic fringe of politics, is to strengthen the hand of the Nationalist Party. I want to say to them that they have the right to their opinions, but I am tired of the supercilious superiority which many of them exhibit. Their ill-mannered intolerance towards anyone who disagrees with them and their intellectual arrogance is part of a new cult that is the &#x201C;in-thing&#x201D;. It is the &#x201C;in-thing&#x201D; to be a &#x201C;thinker&#x201D;, a &#x201C;moulder of thought&#x201D;, a &#x201C;rugged individualist&#x201D;, a person who is prepared to stand above&#x2014;to stand by his principles. As long as their names are in lights, it makes them happy, but it is not helping to solve the fundamental problems of South Africa, because these lie between that Government and this United Party. As long as all their theoretical poppycock, as if at a high school debating society, can be talked in a nice cosy atmosphere and they can have a lot of underpaid servants waiting for them with a meal when they get home, they can talk in between of how badly the Black people are treated. That will never solve anything. What will solve the problems of South Africa, is when we get rid of the arrogance of that Nationalist party&#x2019;s thinking. That is all that matters for South Africa because, until we do that, we are going to go on and on along this road.</p>

<p>The Nationalist Party has no monopoly on patriotism, no monopoly on loyalty to South Africa and no monopoly on being good South Africans. Whilst they hold out this &#x201C;We will protect you&#x201D; banner, I believe that they are in fact undermining our security at every step. They are undermining our security, and there are times when I get desperately worried. I am not one of those who have said South Africa is a police state. I have always been one of those who have denied it. I have always been one of those who have said that this country will change its Government through the ballot box, through a democratic process. I have always been one of those who have appealed to South Africans who do not like this Government to back us through the ballot box so that we can have democratic change of Government.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>When I see the look on the faces and hear the expressions of members who sit here this afternoon, when I see the way in which some members reacted to the debate this afternoon, it sends a cold shiver down my spine. I promise you there were faces on that side which frightened me this afternoon with their hatred and total subjection to the emotionalism of the issue that was before us; people who were unprepared to accept or tolerate any question that was asked or doubt that was expressed.</p>

<p>The trouble is that there are no members on that side of the House who saw the history of the last 25 or 30 years being made. They have read it, they have studied it, but in a purified form. We on this side of the House watched most of it being written. We were there ourselves; we were in countries like Italy, where from top to bottom, you could never find a fascist. There Was never a fascist in Italy; they had all been anti-fascist and anti-Mussolini. I was in Austria and there everybody had been against the Anschluss; not a single Austrian ever wanted to join up with Germany. In the house in which I was billeted, in Klagenfurt I, listened to the tears of the mother of the house whose son had been killed on the Eastern front, but who had never been a Nazi. But I happened to open the trap door in the roof and there was not just a Nazi, but an SS uniform hanging, an SS uniform which was not just a form of simple indoctrination, but one worn of choice by one of the &#x201C;herrenvolk&#x201D; of the Nazis. In Germany you could never find a Nazi. The point I want to make is that we saw this history being written. I believe there were originally very few people who were truly Nazis, who in their hearts were truly <span class="col_8797-8798" refersTo="page_1354"/>Nazis. But they allowed themselves to drift along, because they believed everything they were told. They lost the ability to question. They had lost the ability to question their own leaders. They had lost the ability to doubt the direction they were following. What makes me afraid is that we too are becoming blind yes-men to an ideology and we are losing the ability to question ourselves, our direction, the things we are doing, or above all the way we are doing them. When I hear people who can cheer over the beating of women and say &#x201C;Serves them right&#x201D;, and when I hear people who say these things are good, that it is a good thing that this happened, I begin to wonder whether we have lost the ability to question where we are going. Nobody ever believes that it can happen here. &#x201C;It cannot happen to us&#x201D; and &#x201C;it could never happen to South Africa.&#x201D; It will not happen as long as we are awake to self-criticism, alive to the ability to test and question ourselves and each other both here in this House and outside this House. That is why we on this side of the House believe that the right of opinion, the right to express an opinion, the right to peaceful protest, are things that must be protected and not destroyed. When you destroy those things you destroy the ability of a nation to question which way it is going. In heaven&#x2019;s name, have we not a better choice before South Africa than these two fearful extremes that are held out to us, namely the total disintegration, the splitting up policy of the National Party, the division of South Africa on the one hand or the abandonment of leadership of the Progressive Party and those to the left of it. Two impossible and unacceptable directions.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>But there is a better road, and only the United Party is on it. The reason we have it is that ours is an evolutionary policy, able to keep up with the events and the changes of the times. I do not know what all the excitement is about when somebody talks about change in the United Party. We are a party of evolution. We have fundamental principles, but the machinery which applies those principles must be modernized and kept up to date. The trouble with that Government is that it never moves with the times. It is anchored in outmoded and outworn policies. At our national congress last year my leader appointed committees to investigate aspects of policy to bring them up to date. I myself moved a resolution, which was accepted, emphasizing the direction of the United Party towards a race federation. That is the difference. We in the United Party continually think and we are continually thinking about the problems and the modifications of detail which must be made to make the application of principles realistic. We have basic fundamental principles which have never changed over the years. The first of them is the maintenance of White leadership and with it the acceptance of a common destiny for all the races in South Africa under the control and authority of one central government. We strive for self-administration for each racial group within its own area, dealing with its own affairs; representation in a central Parliament; a voice for all race groups with consultation through statutory Standing Committees and consultation at all levels with all races at all times. This is why we in the United Party offer South Africa a practical road, because we are practical and realistic. We think all the time, and we apply to these principles the necessary practical adjustment of policy which is necessary from day to day and from year to year. This is the only road which offers an alternative to the hopelessness which flows from either the Government or the extreme left. That is what South Africa will yet realize, as long as we learn not to lose our ability to criticize.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the hon. member for Durban Point lauded the United Party in his speech last night and told the House what a wonderful party the United Party is, there was a look of amazement on the faces of some of his colleagues; other colleagues of his looked at him very dubiously and hon. members on this side of the House, of course, completely disbelieved him. It reminds me, Sir, of a story I told my 10-year-old granddaughter. I told her the story of the princess and the golden ball. I told her that the princess was playing with the golden ball when it fell into a well and that she was very sad, but that a little frog jumped in and rescued the golden ball. She was so grateful that she allowed the little frog to remain in her room that night. When she awakened the next morning the frog had changed into a handsome prince. They were married and lived happily ever after. My little granddaughter looked at me very dubiously. I said to her, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you believe the story?&#x201D;. She replied, &#x201C;No, I <span class="col_8801-8802" refersTo="page_1356"/>don&#x2019;t, and I bet the mother did not either.&#x201D; As I say, Sir, we do not believe that story of the hon. member for Durban Point. What really brought me to my feet was the fact that the hon. member for Durban Point really excelled himself in vituperation. Contrary to what he usually does, he spoke about members on this side having reverted to primitive nationalism and having resorted to Boer and Afrikaner hate during the two by-election campaigns. He accused hon. members on this side of hate and intolerance. Mr. Speaker, I am going to deal with that, and I am going to do so by dealing with what I said in a speech at Brakpan on the 10th May. My remarks were distorted and twisted by the English-language newspapers, which attacked and vilified me, especially that muck-raker in South African journalism, <i>The Sunday Times</i>. As usual, the attack was under a pseudonym&#x2014;the pseudonym of Hogarth de Hoogh. I do not know whether the hon. member for Kensington is responsible for that article. I do not think so, Sir, He still has a sense of decency and he knows that if he wants to attack his political opponents he can do it across the floor of the House. The editor of this newspaper, Sir, has the impudence to instruct the Leader of the Opposition as to what he should do in regard to his policy. He is much too big for his boots. He makes the most vicious attacks on people in public life. We need only recall the attack which he made on the hon. member for Orange Grove. I think it was a despicable attack, although I do not agree with that hon. gentleman&#x2019;s political views. Then, Sir, there is also a vicious little twerp, who is the editor of an insignificant little newspaper in East London. His name is Donald Woods. I hope that he has a reporter in the gallery and that the latter will report what I say about this gentleman. Sir, this gentleman attacks and slanders his political opponents in a most scurrilous and malicious manner, but when he himself is attacked, in spite of haying the whole of the English Press at his disposal, he runs squealing to the courts for protection. Sir, these editors are quite safe in their offices with their doors closed. They dip their pens in vitriol and then slander their opponents, knowing full well that they will never be called upon to meet their opponents on a public platform face to face.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Sir, in regard to my speech at Brakpan, I kept my notes, and I think it is very essential that I should put the record straight. Heaven knows I am not a racialist, and I think hon. English-speaking members on that side of the House, who have known me for many years, can bear witness to that. As a matter of fact, national unity and co-operation between the two language groups have been a confession of faith as far as I am concerned, co-operation and national unity based on a common love of and loyalty to South Africa, whilst each group retains its identity and its pride in its language and culture. That has been my confession of faith throughout my political career. Sir, what I want to say here today I want to say in all sincerity, and I hope that hon. members on the other side of the House, especially the English-speaking members, will realize that what I say I mean honestly and sincerely. I said at Brakpan that the United Party and the English-language Press were conducting a scurrilous campaign of racialism, namely Boerehaat.</p>

<p>Sir, that hon. member is really being very foolish. I think a member of his standing, a front-bencher, should know how to behave himself; he should make an effort to do so.

I say that the usual tactics when an English-speaking person joins this party or supports the National Party openly, is that he is ostracized, he is attacked and vilified, and I pointed to the late Mr. Trollip and Mr. Waring and Senator Horwood and Mr. Lewis; and the <i>Sunday Times</i>, this very newspaper which I said was the muckraker of South African journalism, made a despicable innuendo when Senator Horwood was appointed a Senator, the Trollip/Horwood innuendo, as hon. members know. The tragedy is that the overwhelming majority of English-speaking people in South Africa do not read the Afrikaans newspapers. They never hear the other side, and they believe what they read in the English newspapers. When I spoke at Brakpan I dealt with and explained the origin of this &#x201C;Boerehaat&#x201D; campaign. I said that the Minister of Defence stated in a speech that there were certain elements in the United Party which hated the Afrikaner.</p>

<p>As I say, we were accused of beating the tribal drum. That is a caricature of the Afrikaner. Sir, it is really unbelievable that 60 years after Union we should still have to demand equality for the Afrikaans language, but when we do that we are accused of beating the tribal drum. Sir, we have never asked for the superiority of Afrikaans; we have only asked for equality. We have never taken exception to the English-speaking persons in this country when they demand equality for English. I say unequivocally that Afrikaans is not receiving equal treatment in South Africa. [Interjections.] Sir, there was a book published less than two years ago by a very well-known South African, not a supporter of the Nationalist Party or a member of this party. I want to make some quotations from what he said. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hoewel die taalregte van albei groepe plegtig in die Grondwet verskans is, het daar van daardie tyd tot vandag weinig, indien enige, blyke gewees dat dit die Engelse groep erns was om Afrikaans ooit tot sy reg te laat kom.</block>

<p>He said further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As dit nie so was nie, waarom is dit vandag werklik nog nodig na 60 jaar dat die Afrikaner gedurig op verskeie ge-biede in &#x2019;n dispuut gewikkel raak om sy taal en kultuur te handhaaf?</block>

<p>He said further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Terwyl Afrikaners sedert 1912 onder mekaar twis oor wat hulle verhouding met die Engelssprekende moet wees, het die Engelse deur die jare &#x2019;n feitlik homogene politieke blok gebly. Vir die Afrikaner se taal en kultuur het hulle in 1912 net so min omgegee as vandag.</block>

<p><span class="col_8805-8806" refersTo="page_1358"/>He also said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Kortom, nog nooit op enige tydstip, seifs nie nou nie &#x2026;</block>

<p>and this is less than two years ago&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; het &#x2019;n groep Engelse ooit hulle daar-voor beywer dat die Afrikaner se taal-regte, wat gruwelik misken word en is, eerbiedig word &#x2026;As elke Afrikaner oral in Suid-Afrika, ook op plekke waar hy verreweg in die meerderheid is, elke dat op sy reg tot beantwoording in sy eie taal moet aandring, sou daar nood-wendig elke dag tienduisendtalle taal-insidente wees &#x2026; Ek wil graag weet of daardie Engelse politici, kultuurleiers, redakteurs, kerkleiers en ander wat tereg gedurig bedag is op allerhande ongereg-tighede wat aan die kaak gestel moet word&#x2014;waar is hulle wanneer hierdie on-geregtighede teenoor die Afrikaner ge-pleeg word?</block>

<block name="quote">Ironies, dat dit vandag juis die &#x201E;ekstre-mistiese&#x201D; Nasionale Party-leiers en -pers is wat die regte van Engelssprekendes verdedig teen die HNP&#x2014;iets wat van feit-lik geen Engelssprekende leier in die af-gelope jare ges&#x00EA; kan word nie. Ek wil beweer dat as die Nasionale Party nie in 1948 aan bewind gekom het nie, &#x2019;n mens maar net kon wonder wat die toestand van Afrikaans vandag onder &#x2019;n V.P.-regering sou gewees het, en hoe aanstel-lings sou geskied, in die lig van die V.P. se politieke verlede, waarin aanstellings miskien nie volgens taalmaatstawwe geskied het nie, maar volgens &#x2019;n stelsel van &#x201E;baantjies vir Afrikaner-Sappe&#x201D;.

<p>Only a short while ago, on 22nd May, a report appeared in <i>The Star</i> of Johannesburg. It was a letter from the secretary of the Federale Raad van Skakelkomitees in Johannesburg, Mr. M. J. Kruger, under the heading &#x201C;Equal Treatment for both Official Languages&#x201D;. He invited the financial director of this particular firm, Mr. Pieter Soal, to contact the F.R.S. about a complaint he had received regarding the firm&#x2019;s telephonist. He did not know it was a British immigrant. Apparently it was. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The F.R.S. inquired whether the firm had experienced any problems in this regard, as complaints of this nature damaged its business operations and the good relationship between the two language groups.</block>

<p>And this is what Mr. Soal said to the newspaper&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I phoned Mr. Kruger on receipt of the letter and told him to forget this &#x201C;Boerehaat&#x201D; nonsense. I also asked him who paid him to write this sort of letter, said <span class="col_8807-8808" refersTo="page_1359"/>Mr. Soal. He replied that I had misinterpreted the spirit of his letter. After this exchange I asked him to speak English. The conversation was conducted in Afrikaans.</block>

<p>Apparently Soal can understand Afrikaans very well indeed&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">After this exchange I asked him to speak English, said Mr. Soal, but he merely carried on in Afrikaans. He put the phone down while I persisted in using English.</block>

<p>I am going to make another quotation. This time I do not think that the hon. gentleman will laugh. Morris Broughton was a distinguished editor of <i>The Argus</i> for 11 years. I met Morris Broughton in the thirties at the home of a very personal friend of mine, Col. Jack Blaney, who became a Senator. I have known Morris Broughton for many years. He has never been a Nationalist and he has never supported my party. After he retired as editor of <i>The Argus</i> he wrote the book &#x201C;Press and Politics of South Africa&#x201D;. I am only going to make two or three quotations from what he has said in this book. If there is one man that knows what goes on in the editorial offices of the English-language newspapers, it must be Morris Broughton. He was the editor for 11 years, and I do not think that hon. members are going to laugh at him or are going to make disparaging remarks about him. He wrote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is also the need to get rid of the invisible man who sits on the other side of the editorial desks in nearly every English newspaper office. There he is, exasperating, silent and solemn&#x2014;the ghost of Paul Kruger. It is against him and his image that, fundamentally, the vials of inky scorn, irony, wrath, eloquence and repudiation are still poured out. Failing exorcism, it is probable that the liberating act would be to let him rest in peace or get up and, metaphorically, shake hands with him.</block>

<p>He said further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Their political thinking, constantly dramatized and reinforced by their Press &#x2026;</block>

<p>These are the English-speaking people&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; mainly takes the form of seeking out and defining the sins of the &#x201C;enemy&#x201D;. In consequence, they have become strange to genuine discourse and are shocked when it is occasionally put before them. They feel that they are being &#x201C;betrayed&#x201D;. The expectation is one of being served with opinions formulated in 1890 and offered with only the packaging changed. This generates a dislike of genuine discussion and a preference for sales talk in which familiar views are endlessly reiterated and those of the Nationalist enemy continuously ridiculed.</block>

<p>He further says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The habit of hostility to the Republican Afrikaner is deep-rooted. From 1880 to, roughly, 1896, the English Press was in bitter conflict with President Kruger.</block>

<p>This at least can be accepted. During my speech at Brakpan I also reiterated what the Prime Minister said, namely that our policy had always been, under all former Prime Ministers, a policy of co-operation and national unit. The Prime Minister also said in a speech during this session of Parliament that even if not one English-speaking person voted for the National Party, that would still be our policy. What can be clearer than that? When we talk about <span class="col_8811-8812" refersTo="page_1361"/>national unity, it is not the type of national unity to be found in the United Party. In the United Party we have a bloc of English speakers with a few detribalized Afrikaners. [Interjections.] That is their brand of national unity.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister, who has just resumed his seat, has tremendous status in this House owing to his seniority, owing to his long years of service and also owing to the fact that he is probably the oldest Cabinet Minister and the only remaining member of the Nationalist Party Cabinet of 1948. We on this side, and I want to say this to the Minister this afternoon, have always had respect for him owing to the fact that he has this seniority and also owing to his political experience. However, this hon. gentleman rose to his feet this afternoon, and what did he try to do? He tried to justify a speech he had made at Brakpan, on which occasion he had said, and he repeated this this afternoon, that it is in fact the United Party which began with this Boer hate campaign in South Africa, that that was what we stood for because we supposedly do not want to accord complete equality to both languages in South Africa. All that the hon. gentleman then said was that they demand bilingualism in South Africa. He said that they demand this because their language, the majority language on that side of the House, is supposedly not coming into its own. But what makes the hon. gentleman think that we on this side, since there are Afrikaans and English-speaking persons here, and since the minority group in South Africa, the English-speaking persons, comprise 40 per cent of the population, can discriminate against 60 per cent of the population speaking the other language? Is it possible that an hon. gentleman can advance an argument like that in the year 1972? He also asked what the condition of Afrikaans would have been if the United Party had still been in power, that is, since 1948. I want to tell the hon. gentleman that if the United Party had been in power these past 24 years, Afrikaans would have come into its own to exactly the same extent as it has done in South Africa today. This is so because the United Party does not protect only one language in South Africa, but because we are prepared to protect both languages in South Africa. As long as there are representatives of both language groups in the United Party the guarantee will remain that both languages in South Africa will come into their own. Both will be protected to an equal extent.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Oh please, Sir, there you have that simple question again: &#x201C;What school are your children attending?&#x201D; I could probably put the same question to the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs, just as one could have put this question to people like Dr. Abram Jonker, who was a supporter of that party, and to a man like Dr. Eric Louw. Those people did precisely the same as many Afrikaans-speaking people are still doing today, people who are supporters of that party, who send their children to English-language school after the primary stage in order to make them properly bilingual. I take my hat off to such Nationalists. That is the reason.</p>

<p>But the hon. the Minister tried to imply here that we started this Boer hate story and secondly, that it involves only the question of bilingualism. But I can understand the uneasiness of the hon. the Minister of Transport. What he was actually doing here was to make a covert defence of the hon. the Minister of Defence. That hon. gentleman, whose speech I have here, did not say a single word about bilingualism in his speech at Ceres, according to <i>Die Burger</i> of 20th March. What did he say on that occasion? This (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There are elements within the United Party which hate and despise Afrikanerdom.</block>

<p>Not only hate, but &#x201C;hate and despise&#x201D;. In this whole speech of his not a single mention <span class="col_8815-8816" refersTo="page_1363"/>was made of bilingualism. Subsequently of course, because he realized that he had made a mistake, he ostensibly returned to the idea that this was all as a result of the bilingualism issue. For, Sir, this party has after all been in power for 24 years now in South Africa. If Afrikaans, and bilingualism, have not come into their own, is the Opposition to blame for this? Are not those people who in their education policy want to separate children and prevent them from becoming bilingual in South Africa to blame for this? If there are people who discriminate against the Afrikaans language, was it not the duty of this Government to point this out repeatedly? But was it not their previous leader who told us that with the establishment of a Republic there would be unity between Afrikaans- and English-speaking persons? Let me say today, and admit, that South Africa has made great progress in that direction. But that was only until Oudtshoorn, until the H.N.P. came forward with their propaganda. After all, they are the old pre-1948 model National Party. Because they had been forced back to that position the hon. gentleman came up with this idea of theirs that there was so-called hatred on the part of the United Party for the Afrikaner. That was the aim. The aim was that they had to outdo the Hertzogites. They had to show that they were the old Nationalists. They had to show that they had never departed from the course of the Afrikaner. That is the reason they started this propaganda. It is so transparent that any child can see through it. That is why they did it, so that they could come and tell us that it was all the fault of the United Party. I want to refer the hon. the Minister of Transport to his Brakpan speech. After he had made it. a report on it appeared in <i>Die Transvaler</i> the next day. After all, it was he who asked the H.N.P. to return to his party. Was it not the hon. the Minister of Defence who had gone to Oudtshoorn to make his speech a few nights before? Then <i>Die Burger&#x2019;s</i> headlines were: &#x201C;Mr. Botha says: Take one another&#x2019;s hand.&#x201C; This speech received a good recommendation from ex-Senator Smit. who thereupon wrote a letter to <i>Die Burger</i> and said to the H.N.P.: &#x201C;This is what we should do, as Minister P. W. Botha has said to us&#x2014; extend to each other the hand of friendship&#x201D;. This was the reason for the so-called Boer hate story which the National Party started. Sir, they were prepared, for the sake of a few votes, to mar relations between Afrikaans and English-speaking persons in this country. Let me tell them this: No one in this country will believe them any more when they speak of national unity in this country, because they have chosen one road, and they have chosen it quite clearly. It was very clear that that side of the House was in favour of Afrikaner sectionalism in this country, and nothing else. It means absolutely nothing to the hon. the Minister of Transport to rise to his feet here and say: &#x201C;Let us stand together.&#x201D; That is what he says, while he himself sides with those people who want to preach and promote only sectionalism among a certain group in this country. Let me tell him that he finds himself in a further dilemma: No one will believe him when he speaks of national unity; if he does not continue with this Boer hate story then the Nationalist Party will find that the H.N.P. will once again find new life in this country. That is their dilemma. Because they chose to be on the side of Afrikaner sectionalism they have done South Africa the greatest harm as far as the future is concerned. That there should be a feeling of resentment and regret and disappointment among English-speaking persons in this country I do not take at all amiss of these people, for these were people who were prepared to stand by the Afrikaans-speaking people in times of difficulty. These were the people who were prepared, together with the Afrikaner, to build South Africa, and that there should be that feeling among them today is the fault of those hon. gentlemen on that side. They will have to do everything in their power to restore this damage which they have done. Their Press are now, when it is too late, saying to South Africa: &#x201C;You must please abandon this word &#x2018;hatred&#x2019;.&#x201D; But, Sir, when the hatred story was at its worst, their entire Press, <i>Die Volksblad, Die Burger, Die Transvaler</i> and also <i>Die Vaderland</i> did everything in its power to boost this matter, namely that there was so-called hatred for the Afrikaner in South Africa. I repeat: Nobody will believe them in that respect.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister said: &#x201C;Look at the English-speaking persons on my side. Every time an English-speaking person joins us, the United Party has reviled and mocked them.&#x201D; Sir, What is this now? To what extent are the Afrikaners on this side of the House not mocked? Sir, we do not mind; it does not make any difference to us how much they mock us.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>No. That hon. gentleman once said that all Afrikaners are good South Africans, but not necessarily all English-speaking persons. Let me say something to those hon. members today, and I am not trying to teach them a lesson, Sir, That is the last thing I want to do. But let me say this to them: Those hon. gentlemen do not know the English-speaking people of South Africa. I have tried to explain matters, I do not know how many times&#x2014;when talking to individual Nationalists and they had told me the same old story&#x2014;that as far as most English-speaking persons in South Africa are concerned, the only difference between them and us was the language, and nothing else. In other words, Sir, there is precisely the same feeling of South Africanism; there is the same spirit of dedication to South Africa; there is the same spirit of tolerance that one finds among Afrikaans-speaking persons in this country. After all, those hon. members cannot have more experience of English-speaking persons than the Afrikaans-speaking persons on this side of the House. Sir, I know why they do it. You see, Sir, they are to a certain degree practical politicians; they know that 60 per cent of the population is Afrikaans-speaking, and all one has to do is this: Simply identify yourself with the Afrikaner, with his language and with his culture, and you will stay in power for all time. It is not in the interests of South Africa that they do this. No, they think in terms of how many seats they have. They are only concerned about how long they are going to remain sitting on the green cushions. The other reason for their starting this Boer hate story is because the people of South Africa are beginning to become more and more critical, and because the people of South Africa are becoming more sophisticated in their political views. It is because they did not take into account the fact that the people are becoming more critical and that the views of the people, particularly those of the Afrikaner, have changed completely, that they had to find a new emotional flame to keep burning within the National Party and so keep them in power. Sir, this story of the so-called hatred in the United Party was thrown up as a smokescreen, because they do not want people to discuss matters like the Agliotti incident; they do not want people to talk about the Minister of Transport, whose Railways showed a deficit of almost R40 million this year, and which in the new financial year will show another deficit of R40 million. Sir, they do not want us to discuss the lack of competence of this Government when it comes to agriculture. They do not want us to talk about the failure of their apartheid <span class="col_8819-8820" refersTo="page_1365"/>policy. They do not want us to talk about the fact that instead of having fewer Black people in our cities, we today find that there are more and more Black people in our White areas. They do not want us and the people to talk about the demands which are being made by the Black leaders, which they themselves created in South Africa. They do not want us to talk about the economic situation. They do not want us to talk about the fact that we have a Government in power which is taxing the public so heavily. They do not want us to talk about matters such as company tax which they have increased by 1 per cent per annum. No, these things they want to keep back from the people of South Africa. They do not want us to look at their record as a Government. That is why they had to say to the people of South Africa: &#x201C;Look, there are a tremendous number of things which you can blame us for; we make many mistakes; there is the Agliotti scandal, etc., but, look out, if the United Party comes into power, your language and your culture are in danger.&#x201D; Sir, this is simply the way it is, but what they do not take into account is the fact that the people will keep on being critical and that the views of the Afrikaner will change more and more. We on this side of the House know that it is merely a question of time, and then the people of South Africa will reject them and their ruinous policy and give their support to a political party which will in the first place bring true national unity to South Africa and which will govern the country with efficiency and competence; for that is the test which the people of South Africa put a Government to under modern circumstances. If hon. members on that side do not give attention to these two points, then all these Boer hate stories, which are built on figments of the imagination, will be rejected by the people of South Africa, and the voters of South Africa will vote for the United Party to an ever-increasing extent, just as they did in Brakpan.</p>

<p>Sir, I should like to raise a few other matters here, for I think that the people outside will deal with the hon. the Minister of Defence and others on that side concerning this question of Boer hate. I therefore want to confine myself to certain practical problems which in my opinion deserve the attention of this House. I want to concern myself with what the hon. the Minister of Agriculture and his Deputy have recently been doing with our farmers. I want to say at once that we on this side of the House have never viewed agriculture in isolation from any other industrial sectors. We have always realized that when sacrifices were called for and had to be made by the entire nation of South Africa, then the agricultural industry was never unwilling to do its share. But I must emphasize today that in the economic circumstances in which we find ourselves today, it is necessary, if we want to improve our balance of trade and keep it sound, to consider this agricultural industry of ours. With devaluation it was expected that we would be able to give agricultural exports a great boost. It is also a fact that South Africa internally is completely self-sufficient when it comes to its agricultural requirements, but when that situation is prevailing, we must see where the consumption of agricultural produce can be encouraged even further internally, or where it can be changed, so that we can render a far better service to South Africa by means of agricultural exports. If surpluses have developed and competition in a difficult world market is inevitable, those products can be converted into something else, which could either be used here profitably, or in turn exported profitably. If the possibility of surpluses exists&#x2014;and it seems as if we may once again be entering such an era&#x2014;in what capacity are we going to take the agriculturalists in South Africa into our confidence to prevent them from making fools of themselves in future?</p>

<p>I want to take the wheat industry in particular as an example. For years the prices of winter grain have been announced early, even before the season began, but this year the hon. the Minister of Agriculture saw fit not to do so. I want to ask the hon. the Minister: Is this going to be the procedure now, in the case of winder grain, to announce prices at the end of the season, when it has to be harvested, or is he going to announce the prices when the grain is planted? And when this happens at the end of the season, after the farmers have already incurred fantastic expenses, and perhaps expect a good or average crop, will the price of the product then be reduced? I think the Government must be warned, and also the hon. the Minister of Agriculture, that the financial position of the average farmer is so sensitive that it is not possible to gamble with it further. The same unenviable position in which the maize farmer finds himself today &#x2026;</p>

<p>The same unenviable position in which the maize farmer finds himself, is now staring the winter grain farmer in the face as well. This means once again that the more efficient one becomes, the more one is penalized, and when the farmer finds himself in financial straits, he is labelled as being inefficient and uneconomic. The same as the hon. the Minister is doing to the maize farmer. Because there is a surplus now, he wants to do the same to the wheat farmer, the winter grain farmer of South Africa. He already has this difficulty among the maize farmers who feel that they are being financially penalised. And now that hon. gentleman wants to do the same to the wheat farmers of South Africa. When interest rates remain high and profit margins are shrinking, it is alleged that the farmer must improve his managerial ability and lower his standard of living. The Government is not able to break the vicious circle in which most farmers find themselves. If you cannot get enough out of your farming enterprise you have to increase the size of your unit. When this is done with borrowed capital, and the farmer finds himself in a fix, it is alleged on the other hand that too much has been paid for the land, and that the net ratio as compared with capital assets of the farmers is too high. These are the replies those hon. gentlemen usually give us. Under this Government the farmer of South Africa simply cannot win. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. BADENHORST</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to discuss agriculture. What I do in fact want to discuss is the Boer hate, about which the hon. member who has just resumed his seat had so much to say. If one has suffered a very heavy defeat, one does not like being reminded of such a defeat. The hon. Opposition came to Oudtshoorn with great enthusiasm. They thought that after Brakpan they could come to Oudtshoorn and that they would conquer and overcome Oudtshoorn as well. However, the result is well known and it tells us that the stories with which they came to Oudtshoorn did not work out and did not produce the results for them which they expected. The hon. member who has just resumed his seat will still remember very well how tremendously enthusiastic they were, for they even had three candidates in the field. They even needed quite a few days to decide who their candidate in Oudtshoorn would be.</p>

<p>But I think that we should get our facts straight in regard to this matter. The hon. member for Newton Park said that we are protecting the hon. the Minister of Defence. I want to tell that hon. member that the hon. the Minister of Defence needs no protection. He is quite capable of holding his own. If we marshall our facts correctly, we shall see that the hon. the Minister made that so-called Boer hate speech in this House on 12th April, which was a Wednesday. On Thursday evening, 13th April, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, had an opportunity of stating his case before a large meeting in Oudtshoorn, as he was also able to do here this afternoon. He had a tremendous turnout. At the end of the meeting, when an opportunity was given for a motion of confidence, that member received a tremendous motion of no confidence. I want to tell him that in that audience there were not only Nationalists or Afrikaans-speaking persons. There were also English-speaking persons who voted for the motion of no confidence. I want to go further, and we must get our facts straight. Consequently I want to reply this afternoon on behalf of the voters of Oudtshoorn. On Monday evening, 7th April, the hon. the Minister of Defence addressed a very large meeting at Oudtshoorn. There he stated the policy of the National Party very clearly. At that meeting there was not only one or two English-speaking <span class="col_8823-8824" refersTo="page_1367"/>persons, but many. I saw with my own two eyes how they cheered when that hon. Minister spoke. At the end of that meeting we were given a tremendous motion of confidence. On 19th April we went to the polls, and we know what the result was.</p>

<p>I shall tell that hon. member what my message is. They referred to the people of Oudtshoorn as people from the &#x201C;deep platteland&#x201D;. On behalf of Oudtshoorn and its people, Afrikaans- and English-speaking, I want to record in this House this afternoon my strongest objection to our being labelled as people from the &#x201C;deep platteland&#x201D; by the hon. Opposition and its Press, or anyone else for that matter. [Interjections.] I just want to tell them that Oudtshoorn&#x2019;s people, Afrikaans- and English-speaking, have taken cognizance of this and I challenge them to come to Oudtshoorn again and state their case in three years&#x2019; time, when another general election will be held.</p>

<p>This hon. Opposition, when it was unable to make the grade in Oudtshoorn, went to South Africa to say that Boer hate stories allowed the Nationalists to win in Oudtshoorn. I want to tell them this afternoon, and I want to remind the hon. member for Newton Park of this, that it was not the Boer hate stories which gave us the victory; it was because we went to the voters and stated our policy. We stated our relations policy, from which the hon. Opposition has, up to this stage of the debate, been consistently running away. They have availed themselves of this opportunity, and they did so very well, to talk about, as they call them, an &#x201C;innocent&#x201D; group of students who came to stand on the steps of the Cathedral. This afternoon they have seized upon this opportunity to come here and hide behind the Boer hate stories. I want to mention to them that when Oudtshoorn lay ahead for us, we spoke, and we went and stated our policy. I want to tell them this afternoon that I also did canvassing in Oudtshoorn. I also visited voters, and I want to tell them please to state their policy to their people, so that there is no need for me to do it. [Interjections.] I want to tell them that I visited United Party supporters in their homes, and that I asked them whether they knew what the policy of the United Party was. I was very honest, and I had that yellow pamphlet of the United Party in which everything is stated in black and white. I did not tell any lies, but I did tell them that the Party which they support wants, as soon as they come into power, to give the non-White peoples in this country representation in this Parliament. Those persons said to me: &#x201C;That is not the truth.&#x201D; When I showed them what I was reading from, these people were tremendously upset. That is why the hon. Opposition was only able to obtain 1 800 votes, and not the 3 000 which they had hoped to get.</p>

How <span class="col_8825-8826" refersTo="page_1368"/>can this relations policy bring about peace in South Africa if this Party does not even have peace among its own members in regard to its own policy? Every day there are people from among their number who come forward and say that the policy should be adjusted in this way and that a change should be made in that way. Eventually we are all casting about in the dark and do not know any more what the policy of this party is. I want to challenge them this afternoon on behalf of the voters of Oudtshoorn and tell them that they did not come and state their policy in Oudtshoorn. They must now avail themselves of this debate for that purpose, and forget about the Boer hate stories they are talking about. They must forget them, in this debate as well, and state their relations policy so that South Africa and its voters can know precisely what they want.</p>

<p>What we have rejected, is that power bloc. We have rejected it, for we cannot for one moment allow representation to be given in this House to the Bantu, the Indian and the Coloureds, to a total of 16, as the hon. Opposition has determined. We must go to the polls, and the White voters will decide who should govern this country. Suppose a party is voted into power with a majority of five seats. That party will not yet be able to say that it will govern this country because it has gained the victory, for that power bloc of 16 will eventually determine who will govern this country. This we have refused to accept.</p>

<p>I also want to tell the hon. members this afternoon that we are not ashamed of what the Afrikaner has accomplished and established in this country, that we are not ashamed of the enterprise which the Afrikaner has displayed and that we shall continue to display that enterprise. We are grateful to be able to say this afternoon that there are many English-speaking persons who have recognized this enterprise in the Afrikaner, and who support us in this struggle. I want to tell them this afternoon that we will continue with our policy of equal treatment for both languages, that we will continue to say that every language group in this country must be granted and allowed to have rights, and that they must be treated correctly. We do not want to deprive anyone of anything, and we do not want to prejudice anyone. We must all think and work together in the interests of this country and in the furtherance of the country and its welfare. That is why we referred in this House yesterday to students who came and stood on the steps of a cathedral, and who stood there and demonstrated. In one of the newspapers which supports them the following question was asked: What will the ministers of the Dutch Reformed Church say? Now I, as a former minister of the Dutch Reformed Church, say that we will not allow such things at our churches. I also want to say this afternoon that we should not hide behind the sanctity of a Cathedral if we want to allow such things. We must determine in advance what sanctity is and what sanctity is concerned with.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that the voters of Oudtshoorn expressed their confidence in the National Party. The voters of South Africa will continue to do so. I want to tell the hon. Opposition that that majority of 4 848 could perhaps be symbolic, because twice 24 is 48.</p>

<p>&#x2026;the hon. member who has just sat down, which is described by some of the less discerning in this House as a very good speech, proceeds on the assumption that Government Bantu policy has been successful so far. Unless one could take that assumption into account, one could not very well validly criticize the policy of any other party. I assume that the hon. member has just spoken, is ignorant of a recent statement by a very prominent Nationalist&#x2014;I speak of Mr. Willem van Heerden&#x2014;which appeared in <i>Rapport</i> of 28th May this year. Amongst other things, he said this. I am quoting from an extract which appeared in the <i>Daily News</i> of the following day&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In contrast, among the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s most fiery supporters, there were isolated signs of scepticism regarding the implementation of certain aspects of the policy, or rather the way in which it baulked this implementation, and as far as the non-Whites are concerned, we <span class="col_8827-8828" refersTo="page_1369"/>must face the fact that the tendency is towards increasing enmity and obstruction rather than towards acceptance and helpfulness.</block>

<p>A greater condemnation of the successful implementation of the policy of a party which has been in power for almost a quarter of a century, is difficult to find. There is no doubt that what he says is true. I have become increasingly concerned with the reports that I have read recently of the ferment, if not the open hostility, towards the Government which is becoming apparent at every non-White institution of higher education in the country. In addition to that, there have been utterances from leading Bantu politicians holding positions of authority in the various Bantu territorial authorities of this country, statements and utterances which, if made by a professor at an English-language university or if made by a clergyman of one of the English-language churches in this country, would have brought down upon the head of the person making that statement, at least a violent attack from the Prime Minister. if not a banning order under the security legislation of this country. Made as they are by persons holding office in terms of the Bantu policy of this Government, the Government remain silent, totally silent. It is time. I believe, to review the progress made, if you can call a steady decline in racial attitudes &#x201C;progress&#x201D;, in that period of nearly a quarter of a century which this Government has been in office.</p>

<p>The policy of apartheid is a policy of partition, the intention originally having been to move the bulk of the Bantu into their own areas so that states could eventually be created in which not only the political rights of the Bantu would be centred, but in which the majority of the Bantu would have their being and would find their economic fulfilment. There was originally a sensible acceptance that it was the physical presence of the Bantu in the White areas that constituted the problem; not merely a place where they exercised their political rights, but their physical presence. In the years that have passed there has, however, been an increasing conflict between the requirements of the economic progress in the White areas of South Africa and the requirements of Nationalist Party political philosophy, with the inevitable result that philosophy has given way to economics. The policy was changed to the extent that any idea of physical separation and large-scale consolidation was thrown overboard. It is now said that all that was required was that the political and civil rights of the Bantu would be exercised only in their own areas. To that extent the policy was changed. The magic year 1978 went by the board, and there came to be an acceptance that there would be an ever-increasing flow of Bantu to work in the White areas, together with an acceptance that young Bantu could bring their wives to the White areas. In the year 1972 what has the policy of separate development come to mean? It means, in practical terms, the spending of hundreds of millions of rand on roads, housing, sewerage and electricity in the White areas to provide accommodation for an ever-growing and increasingly more permanent Bantu working population in the White areas. It means the encouragement of the Bantu people to ask for independence in their so-called homelands at a time when these areas are neither economically developed nor geographically consolidated to the extent necessary to establish the basic requirements of a viable independent state. The question arises: What direction is this situation likely to take in the course of the next five or ten years? Let us be perfectly clear about where matters stand at the present time. The leaders of the two most numerous Bantu groups, Buthelezi and Matanzima, leading almost half the total Bantu population of this country, have made their respective positions perfectly clear. They have no intention of asking for independence unless certain conditions are met. Buthelezi wants vastly more land than the reserves of Natal consist of at the present time. I should be surprised if he will ever accept independence without Richard&#x2019;s Bay. He has said as much himself.</p>

<p>Do you mind my answering the last question before you put yours? There will quite obviously be additional land purchased in terms of the 1936 legislation. The principal difference between us and the hon. members opposite is that they believe that land should be purchased purely for the sake of creating independent states, creating nice, round geographical areas on the map which look like viable independent states. That is the sole object of the purchase of land by this Government. In Natal there is more than sufficient State land to provide the whole of the quota in terms of the 1936 legislation. There is no need to buy from White farmers one square inch of land in Natal to fulfil the requirements of the 1936 legislation. That is what I believe should be done and that is what the Natal Agricultural Union stands unanimously in favour of.</p>

<p>May I now put my question to the hon. member?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Please, if I have time when I have finished my prepared speech, I will invite the hon. member to ask me his question.</p>

<p>Now. Sir, I have indicated that I do not believe that Buthelezi will accept, indeed ask for independence, except under certain conditions.</p>

<p>I have indicated what they are, because he has said as much himself. Matanzima has stated clearly that he will never ask for independence unless he gets the East Griqualand farming area and Port St. Johns. Both leaders have explained that these demands are prompted by the Government&#x2019;s policy of returning urban Bantu to the homelands and refusing the Bantu in the White areas any of the rights which flow from an acceptance of their permanence in those White areas. That is why they demand more land. The Government, in its turn, has made it quite clear that none of these claims by the Bantu leaders will be met.</p>

<p>What then is the outlook for the next five or ten years? I can see no likelihood whatever of the Bantu leaders asking for independence&#x2014;none whatever. The Government cannot, as it were, turn them into the street, by just disclaiming sovereignty over those areas. Until these Bantu governments ask for independence, this Government is saddled with them and their increasingly outspoken utterances. These utterances will, to an ever-increasing extent, be directed towards redressing the grievances of the urban Bantu.</p>

<p>Now. Sir, what is the position of these Bantu leaders? They are hereditary chiefs, who already have and will retain the support of the tribal Bantu in the Reserves by simply demanding more and more White land. It is their support in the White urban areas which is problematical. We must remember that this Government has anchored the political rights of the urban Bantu to the legislatures of the Reserves, It is the votes of the urban Bantu which the Bantu leaders will increasingly watch; because it is only here that political opposition is likely to emerge. So, Mr. Speaker, what will be the likely direction of the political utterances of the Bantu leaders? They will be in the direction of an amelioration of the problems of the urban Bantu, the urban Bantu in the White areas. They will be in the direction of acquiring for those urban Bantu those civil and civic rights which anywhere in the world are claimed by permanently settled, urban communities. I mention a few of them, Sir: For example, the right to have ownership of your home; the right to have your family live with you; the right to educate your children where you live; the right to find work where you live; the right to live with or near your children when you are old and no longer working; the right to qualify yourself for a say, no matter how limited, in the authority which governs you. These are the things. Sir, which I bring under the term &#x201C;civil or civic rights&#x201D;. We shall find that the policy of separate development, far from insulating us from the pressures and the demands of the Bantu people in our midst, will to an ever increasing extent provide to the spokesmen of the Bantu people an immunity from Government pressure and control, which they would never have enjoyed had they not been artificially elevated into the position of leaders of embryonic independent states. Indeed, Sir, they are under Government policy in a uniquely privileged position. They can campaign politically and can utter the grievances of their people at mass rallies in <span class="col_8831-8832" refersTo="page_1371"/>our metropolitan urban areas without bearing any of the responsibilities inherent in the redress of those grievances. In other words, they will to an ever increasing extent, in my view, espouse the cause of the urban Bantu, voice their grievances, and gain their political support, whilst the White authorities will have to bear all the burdens of financing and administering the urban Bantu townships. What Gen. de Gaulle was forbidden to do in Quebec our Bantu leaders are encouraged to do in Soweto. Having got political rights and a voice in the affairs of South Africa&#x2014;because the Bantu areas, urban and rural, are still South Africa, and their leaders are still South Africans&#x2014;what pattern is likely to evolve for the future? There will unfold, I believe, a pattern very similar to that which unfolds in any country where you have ever increasing educational and economic advantages accruing to a group of people without commensurate civil and social rights. There will be ever increasing demands, backed up by political pressure from the Bantu leaders, for civil and civic rights for the urban Bantu in the areas where they live. And as those people become more permanently established with the passing years, so will it become more and more difficult for those rights to be withheld.</p>

<p>Similarly, in the social sphere, legal barriers will to an ever increasing extent be replaced by conventional or voluntary barriers, or they will disappear altogether. We have seen the beginnings of the process already in the field of what we call &#x2018;foreign or international relations&#x201D;, or what we call &#x201C;international sport&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I have attempted to show that despite the creation of the vast and costly edifice of apartheid, events in South Africa are likely in our lifetime to follow a course very close to that of any other similarly situated community elsewhere in the world. But there will be some important differences. In our internal relations the policy of apartheid will have left immense reservoirs of distrust and, in some cases, even animosity&#x2014;I speak of internal relations, Sir&#x2014;principally amongst those who are in a position to exercise most influence because of their education and their advancement. And in our external relations the policy of apartheid will have created for us barriers of isolation which it will take decades to break down.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, what was it all intended to achieve? To what end was all this effort, money and ingenuity directed? It was intended to ensure that White South Africa should be able to carry on indefinitely living out its existence with all the economic advantages which flow from being in a multiracial country, without ever making the slightest concession to the fact that South Africa is a multi-racial country, and that that fact demands a constant adjustment of attitude on the part of both Black and White. Mr. Speaker, how much better off would we all have been if all the thought and effort which has been directed towards the pretence of keeping us apart had been directed towards devising a formula aimed at easing the process of learning to live together. I say again, Sir, what was the original concept of apartheid designed to achieve? It was intended to achieve two things; firstly, to remedy all the problems of petty apartheid by removing from the White State the physical presence of the Bantu. You do not have to worry, Sir, about where a Black man will live, what school his children will attend, on what trains and buses he will travel, and who will play sport with him if he is living and working in a separate State. Those problems are automatically solved. Likewise, you do not have to worry about devising a formula to accommodate his political aspirations in your constitutional set-up if he is living in and voting for a Government in a separate State. In theory&#x2014;and I emphasize the word &#x201C;theory&#x201D;&#x2014;the original concept of apartheid had a philosophical and a practical merit, if one assumes that it was capable of implementation. If one assumes that it was capable of implementation, the theory was theoretically sound and it had practical merit. But when once the Nationalist Party placed economic development before the implementation of its philosophy, when once the magic year 1978 was thrown overboard, when once the party was prepared to compromise on the question of the removal of the Black presence from the White areas, the whole policy of apartheid was doomed, and South Africa was left with the worst of both worlds. I say that because in the White areas you have at the present time, and you will continue to have, all the problems of a multi-racial State&#x2014; every single one of them&#x2014;just as they would have been if the policy of apartheid had never been thought of. Indeed, Sir, I believe those problems have been accentuated because you have had no gradual conditioning <span class="col_8833-8834" refersTo="page_1372"/>of the Whites to an acceptance of this permanent Black presence. You have had the reverse; you have had them accept the myth that the Black presence is not there. In addition to that, Sir, you have in the Black areas all the problems attendant upon the creation of an embryo Black State in Africa, and at an ever-increasing tempo, plus the added factor that most of our Black States have still to be given their essential geographical foundations. As Willem van Heerden says, all we have done is to establish the principle of independent homelands.</p>

<p>Sir, on the basis that a state of confrontation has arisen between the Black leaders and the Government, which I believe to be the case, or rapidly approaching the case, what is South Africa to do? There is only one possible solution in these circumstances. Politically and constitutionally there must be an immediate acceptance of the federal principle with priority at the level of a maximum devolution of power to the various races. Secondly, there must be an immediate acceptance by the electorate of South Africa of the principle of a multiracial federalist State with a gradual implementation of the consequences of that acceptance.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the principle of White leadership should be maintained as the only vehicle through which a federalist State could be brought into being and effectively worked. I believe, Sir, that sufficient time has passed for the country and the world to draw the conclusion that the policy of apartheid has been an expensive failure. It has failed not only as a policy to be implemented by a Government&#x2014;and I believe that we can say that with all justification, because we have had this Government in power for almost a quarter of a century, dedicated to this policy, a Government which claims that the policy has the full support of the electorate which backs it, and a Government with one of the largest parliamentary majorities, sustained over a period of time, that this country has ever known&#x2014;Sir, not only has it failed as a practical policy, it has failed as a philosophy; it has failed as a theory which one can debate. When your policy has failed and the philosophy on which it is based has failed, then you must look for an alternative road, and the sooner the better. I have tried, Sir, to outline the alternative philosophy and policy which I believe is the only one which can replace the path which we have taken. I believe that that is the path for the future, and I believe that propounding that policy, and eventually implementing it, will be the service which the United Party can render to this country.</p>

<speech by="#van_wyk">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. VAN WYK</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, up to now this has been a disastrous Session for the Opposition. The hon. member for Newton Park made the accusation against this side of the House that it was running away from economic affairs. The hon. member, who is such a champion of the agricultural industry, devoted more than two-thirds of his speech to all kinds of nonsense. Then he went on to deal with the price of wheat and the interests of the agricultural industry, but I must say he did not sound very enthusiastic. I find it a pity that television has not yet been introduced here, because if the voters outside were to have seen him on the television screen today, they would definitely not have gained a favourable impression of him. Sir, the hon. member also referred to national unity and co-operation, and I should like to speak to him about that. The hon. member for Zululand will pardon me for not following him up, because I do not really participate in debates on Bantu affairs. But, with reference to what the hon. member for Newton Park said, I should like to express a few thoughts on national unity. When we speak about national unity, I want to put it to you that it is a matter which we should discuss coolly and calmly. It is not a matter about which we should work up emotions. Now I should like to give my views on this matter as objectively as possible. But before proceeding I should like to explain what I understand national unity to mean. In this regard I want to endorse the course advocated by a person such as the late Gen. Hertzog, and I want to lay this at the door of the Opposition on the opposite side who stabbed him in the <span class="col_8835-8836" refersTo="page_1373"/>back in those days. Gen. Hertzog put it as follows. He said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In South Africa the Afrikaners are in charge and they will rule the roost.</block>

<p>He went on to explain that he understood Afrikaners to mean Afrikaans-speaking and English-speaking people who were rooted in this country. It is important to know this. He defined this statement further and he put it as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Clearly there is the Afrikaans stream guided by the Afrikaans language along a course of its own. This stream must remain separate and proceed along its course in this way. Next to it flows the English stream, at some places close to and at other places very far removed from the Afrikaans stream. They flow in one state, but they are different. Fate and common experience may, in the distant future, cause them to flow into one another, but in that case I have no doubt that the stream which has risen from the South African soil, history and traditions, will ultimately determine the course and be the stronger.</block>

<p>Of the Afrikaans language he then said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">My feeling towards Afrikaans is that it was born in this country. If we return after a thousand years, we shall still find Afrikaans just where it is today, a language of the majority of the people of South Africa, a people born out of a common love for the country and its citizens.</block>

<p>Then he encircled these ideas of his by the following significant statement he made. He put forward this unequivocal standpoint&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Under no circumstances will I ever give my co-operation in politics to people who are not ready to admit and to accept the principle of complete equality between and equal treatment for our Afrikaans-speaking and English-speaking national groups.</block>

<p>That was the train of thought of Gen. Hertzog and because he firmly believed that he now had the basis for national unity, he i came forward with the great experiment of fusion in the thirties. [Interjections.] In his hour of crisis, after the years of sacrifice and abuse he had to live through, he pointed his finger reproachfully at those in whom he had had faith, and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I do not think I deserved to be left in the lurch at the last moment. I said South Africa shall not be plunged into a war, and I shall stand by that to the end. If this were to happen, a situation would arise which would not be solved in any period of 50 years.</block>

<p>Now, I want to say that the breeze which the United Party sowed in 1939 brought forth a tempest for them in 1948, one which is still raging over them. Gen. Hertzog said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Two attempts have already been made to get the two sections of the population to co-operate. If this second attempt were to fail, the people would lose all confidence.</block>

<p>Now those on the opposite side of the House must not take it amiss of us on this side of the House for harbouring some suspicion when they offer us the hand of friendship and of co-operation. That attempt by Gen. Hertzog failed because he was left in the lurch by those who gave him false hope and created a false expectation. Mr. Speaker, it did not end there. In 1961 after we had become a Republic, the former Prime Minister, Dr. Verwoerd, again put this very clearly in the State President&#x2019;s address of 1961. To me it is significant that these words were spoken in English. That was done because it was meant for the English-speaking section of the population. The excerpt from the State President&#x2019;s address reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Fourthly, it is the heartfelt desire of my Government that this nation will become fundamentally more truly united than ever before, notwithstanding the existence of such political differences as are natural to all nations.</block>

<p>It is as the Leader of the House said here this afternoon: We are not looking for political unity; political unity-and national unity are two different concepts. That was made very clear. And what has been the experience? It has already been mentioned repeatedly, and I do not want to enlarge on it any further. What has been our experience <span class="col_8837-8838" refersTo="page_1374"/>in this regard? I just want to refer to a few examples. I want to refer to the disregard of the other side of the House for that which is precious to the Afrikaner people. There was the opposition of the opposite side of this House when the hon. the Minister of Justice demanded that the two languages be given equal treatment in the hotel industry and that everyone be served in the language he spoke. In this regard we had opposition from the opposite side of this House. The hon. member for Durban Point objected to a departmental circular in which the Minister asked for submissions to him to be made in Afrikaans Even today it is still necessary to wage a struggle in order to see justice being done to Afrikaans in the English-language business world.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Newton Park asked why we were running away from economic affairs. I am very glad the hon. member for Newton Park is in the House. Now I want to challenge the Opposition to say at least something about the Budget and the taxation proposals. In the economic sphere things are going so well for the country that the Opposition is running away from that. Things are going well in the economic sphere, firstly because we have a good, strong and stable Government. Secondly, things are going well with the Republic of South Africa in the economic and financial sphere because we have a good Minister of Finance. We have an extremely capable and dedicated Minister of Finance, He is a man with vision, courage and a sound, balanced judgment. He is the man who has guided this country through deep waters to a haven of peace and quiet in the monetary and financial sphere. He is the man who, last year, pronounced the prophetic words when he said: &#x201C;1972 may possibly be a golden year for the Republic of South Africa. Now that the gold price has increased so fantastically, it is literally going to be a golden year for South Africa, The signs of a golden year already exist. In the first half of the year they are already perceptible. The fiscal and monetary measures announced in the Budget are already bearing fruit for us. From the May edition of <i>Tegniek</i> I now want to read the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">While, as recently as five months ago, virtually nothing but pessimism prevailed about the immediate future of the country, the picture has now changed drastically. This pessimism has now made room for optimism, optimism which virtually increases daily.</block>

<p>The <i>Standard Bank Review</i> endorses this by saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The South African economy is now set for a year of more rapid economic growth.</block>

<p>The latest opinion poll of the Bureau for Economic Research of Stellenbosch confirms the about face there has been in the attitude of businessmen, and the latest economic indicators also point to an unprecedented recovery. The confidence in South Africa&#x2019;s economy does not prevail in South Africa only, also abroad confidence in South Africa&#x2019;s economy has increased. At the moment so much foreign money is pouring into the country that some observers are becoming concerned about the position. The country&#x2019;s reserves of gold and foreign exchange show a sustained increase; already they exceed R600 million. There are those who expect them to reach the R900 million mark by the end of the year. Our export endeavours seem to be bearing fruit. We also read that in the first quarter of this year exports increased by 16,3 per cent on those of the final quarter of last year. Exports are anticipated to be 24 per cent higher in the second quarter of this year than they were in the first quarter of this year. Even a person such as Dr. H&#x00FC;pkes, an economist of stature, says, after he has made calculations, his conclusions are that the inland revenue of the country can increase by not less than 10 per cent. These achievements have been possible because the man at the helm, our Minister of Finance, has guided our country through deep waters to a safe place.</p>

<p>At the moment there is also a revival on the Stock Exchange. Significant sales are made on the Stock Exchange in contrast to the poor conditions of the past few years. When one speaks about the Stock Exchange, it is significant that there were many people who did not heed the warning issued by the Minister of Finance a few years ago when he said, &#x201C;Take care not to have your fingers burnt on the Stock Exchange.</p>

<p>Wait a moment. Therefore it is significant to me that the <span class="col_8839-8840" refersTo="page_1375"/>Minister is of the opinion that the downward trend on the Stock Exchange has now reached its end. What is also significant, is the fact that the Minister expects rates of interests to drop in the foreseeable future. This view is also endorsed by other bodies and persons. In this regard the <i>Standard Bank Review</i> says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Conditions in the money market changed dramatically during April. The high interest rate and the shortage of money experienced during March gave way to a declining short-term interest rate and easier conditions.</block>

<p>The prophets of doom on the opposite side who even said devaluation was an act of bankruptcy, today have to admit shamefacedly that they are completely out of touch with what is going on in the country, and that they do not have that special sense to determine and evaluate economic tendencies in the country. That is why I make the statement that the criticism levelled by the Opposition at this Budget is belied today by the results already achieved in the first few months of this year.</p>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Virginia, who has just sat down, indulged in a paean of praise for my hon. friend, the Minister of Finance, which I do not begrudge him at all, and took a very optimistic view of the economic future of South Africa. It is perfectly true that much has happened in the area of finance and economics during the past three and a half months. The price of gold on the free market has risen steadily up to very nearly $60 an ounce. Prices on the Stock Exchange have surged upwards fairly rapidly. Our gold and foreign reserves, I should imagine, stand at something of the order of R700 million at the moment as against plus or minus R550 million in December, 1971. Imports for the first four months of 1972 were R920 million, compared with R962,3 million for the same period in 1971, some R40 million less. But figures can be very misleading. I am a little bit nervous of these import figures, because it would seem to me that a great deal of the drop in import figures is due to the fact that capital goods are ceasing to come into the country. This only means that there is less demand by our industrialists for capital goods to go for more production.</p>

<p>We ought to look at these things a little more carefully to see more than that which we find on the surface. Exports for the first four months of this year were R595,5 million. They bettered the figure for 1971 of R466,2 million by R129 million. This is very good. Fortunately we have had an amazingly good agricultural season. There is also a spirit of optimism in the air and the psychological backlog of 1971 has to some extent been demolished. We welcome these things; we welcome this move away from the unhappy days of 1971 created by this Government. We were concerned last year with the Governments&#x2019; inability to really assess the economic situation, an assessment which was clouded by distortions in the economy caused by a multiplicity of controls. We are equally concerned this year that the Government may well be misreading the signs once again, that it is being mesmerized, as perhaps other people are, by numerous illusions.</p>

<p>The chairman of the U.D.C. Bank said last week&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The possibilities of a real business upturn during the current financial year are perhaps stronger in the minds of the authorities and economic forecasters than in the minds of businessmen at the moment.</block>

<p>There is a lot of truth in this. I believe that to get as true a picture as possible, we must look at the take-off point, December. 1971. The growth rate of our gross domestic product in real terms had continued to drop from 6,8 per cent in 1969 to 4.8 per cent in 1970, to 3,7 per cent in 1971. Our real gross domestic product on a <i>per capita</i> basis had declined from 2.1 per cent in 1970 to 1 per cent in 1971. The crude trade gap had reached R1 349 million, 35 per cent bigger than in 1970. Government spending had increased by some 20 per cent over 1970. Output per man-hour which had declined in 1970, declined further in 1971. In the manufacturing sector production was only up by 2,1 per cent, and employment by only 3,3 per cent. All three national Budgets, the Railways, the Post Office and the Central Government&#x2019;s Budgets, showed large deficits against estimates. The consumer price index as at December, 1971, showed an increase over the figure in December. 1970, of 7 per cent. In short, what we had in 1971 was a large deficit on our current account balance of payments position, a fall in growth rate and a rising rate of <span class="col_8841-8842" refersTo="page_1376"/>inflation. As was said by the Chairman of the Handelsinstituut at its annual general meeting in May last&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This is probably the first time in our history that we have had all three of these problems at one and the same time and with such intensity.</block>

<p>This was our position, our take-off point in December, 1971. The Government could obviously not allow this state of affairs to continue. So, we had the devaluation of 12,28 per cent and the intensification of import control. Then came the deficit Budget for 1972-&#x2019;73 to stimulate the economy. We had a sharp drop in Government spending, the raising of the bank credit ceiling, and an overall so-called programme of action. These steps were all designed to indicate the intention of the Government to move away from its dampening down policy of 1971 which led us into the position we found ourselves in in December 1971.</p>

<p>I have dealt with some of the whys and wherefores, because they are important to us in trying to assess what future trends might be. At the moment there is a fairly wide divergence of opinion on the precise course the economy is likely to take over the next 12 to 18 months. Perhaps the events of yesterday are a little too close to us to be seen in proper perspective and to have an opportunity to crystallize; but a consensus of opinion is beginning to develop in a number of areas.</p>

<p>It is generally accepted that neither productivity nor investment is rising at the moment. In spite of efforts in the Budget to restore credibility, in spite of massive devaluation, in spite of heavy import control. and in spite of Budget concessions industry is just not responding. While opinions vary as to whether or not there is substantial spare capacity in the economy, there is general agreement that firms are at present not ready to commit any spare capacity because orders are presently slack and profit margins are being squeezed. This is the factual situation under the sort of ice-cap of optimism which has spread throughout the country. There is little improvement in the building industry. The difficult, if not serious conditions in the motor industry and in the furniture industry have been acknowledged by the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs. Last week he reduced the initial deposit on hire-purchase sales and lengthened the instalment payment period. Why? Because the economy has not reacted to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Budget to the extent that obviously the Government would like it to have done. Therefore it has had to take off the screws again and to lift the lid of the damp-down policy of 1971 a little more.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs never ceases to amaze me. He is perhaps an even better stop-go exponent than the hon. the Minister of Finance. For some two years he has been restricting both the motor trade and the furniture trade by making their selling conditions, both as to deposits and as to terms more difficult. He has also allowed the hon. the Minister of Finance to make life more difficult for them by increased excise and sales duties. What has the result of this been? The result has been that both these industries have gone through very bad times, as anybody who had any knowledge of these two industries whatsoever would have expected. Then to try belatedly to change the direction of these industries and to improve the position, the hon. the Minister of Finance announced in his Budget that a minimum down payment on cars would be reduced from 40 per cent to 331 per cent. But what happened? How effective was it? It was so effective that 2&#x00BD; months later the down payment has been further reduced to 25 per cent and the term extended from 24 months to 30 months. The down payment on light commercial vehicles has been reduced from 40 per cent to 331 per cent. To try to resuscitate the furniture industry, the down payment has now been reduced to 10 per cent and the instalment period has been increased from 24 months to 30 months.</p>

<p>What staggers us is the apparent inability of the Government to be able to assess the consequences of its actions. This is what frightens us. Its assessment is always wrong. It is forced to backtrack time and time again. No sooner has an assessment been made and decisions made as a result of those assessments, than the Government has to change its policies. Company profits which have been announced recently are not in the main encouraging and company failures, unfortunately, have spread to some of the biggest companies in the land. I will be the first to admit that this is probably the back-lash of the events of 1971, but it does illustrate the absolute and <span class="col_8843-8844" refersTo="page_1377"/>vital necessity of the Government having a proper understanding not only of economic conditions in the country, but an understanding of the consequence of any action it takes. What is causing the greatest concern, the greatest fear in the country, is what we are seeing at the moment as the beginning of another situation as we had in 1968-&#x2019;69.</p>

<p>The money illusion and the high rate of inflation on the one hand, with poor performance in the real economy on the other hand, led us eventually to a repetition of the 1971 situation. It is the old story of the cycle, in the years 1968, 1969, 1970. 1971. from the top right down to the bottom. You see, Sir, the economy is beginning to float again in the sea of liquidity. Funds are flowing in from abroad and we are all very grateful that this is the case. They are encouraged to come in by high yields, relatively high interest rates, and once again fears about the dollar and fears, perhaps about sterling. We appear to be at the bottom of a cycle of an increasing money supply, a rising stock market, a strengthening balance of payments position, a movement towards high cost-push and demand-pull inflation, a strong upward trend in the cost of living and very soon, a new bout of wage demands. This is the repeat of the 1968-&#x2019;69 position. These are signals calling for constant adaptation of policy. The hon. the Minister failed to make these adaptations in 1968 and 1969. and it led to the debacle of 1971.</p>

<p>There are particularly two areas which require constant watching: Import control and exchange control. The way import control and exchange control are handled, plus proper utilization of labour, will determine our economic success or failure over the next few years. The efficiency of handling them will determine the rate of inflation, which will be the dominating factor, as the hon. the Minister knows, in our economy. We are probably only now moving into the stage when the full effect of devaluation is going to be felt when the full impact of import control is going to be made. Industries will be exhausting their stocks of raw materials and will have to replace these stocks at much higher prices. Stocks of imported consumer goods will become in short supply and disappear from the shops, removing the price discipline of importations from locally manufactured goods. New machinery and equipment and the replacement of existing machinery and equipment are going to be considerably more expensive. We have a variation today of some 24 per cent in our currency values to those which we had prior to devaluation. At the same time, our bumper agricultural crop, the hardening of commodity prices abroad, plus the higher prices in terms of rands, as a result of devaluation, will add to domestic liquidity, and therefore to the total monetary demand in the economy.</p>

<p>What does this mean? The overall effect is likely to be as was summed up in a recent economic survey of the Standard Bank&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It would thus appear that inflationary pressures of both demand and supply nature, will continue to exert pressure on prices in South Africa in 1972.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the objective which we would all want on both sides of the House is a steady upward trend in the GDP, the only difference between the hon. the Minister and ourselves is the question of degree, plus inflation control at an acceptable rate of some 2 per cent to 2&#x00BD; per cent. Well, we are not going to reach this objective if we continue the way we are going, and if we do not realize that the factors that influenced the economy in the cycle of 1968-&#x2019;69 still remain with us. How many of them have been eliminated? The hon. the Minister of Finance did take a few hesitant steps forward in his Budget speech. In so far as it was a statement of intent, he assumed, as in fact he did in 1971, the overall responsibility for the total economic policy of the Government. Mr. Speaker, the $64 000 question is: Is the hon. the Minister of Finance once again going to be frustrated by his own colleagues, as he was frustrated, for example, in 1971 by the hon. the Minister of Labour?</p>

<p>I only have time to deal with one component of our economic policy where I believe the objective of the hon. the Minister is being obstructed, and this is on the question of import control. In the previous debate we had this session I said that devaluation and import control were incompatible. The hon. the Minister interjected and said: &#x201C;We all know that.&#x201D; Correct; we all do know that. But what has happened <span class="col_8845-8846" refersTo="page_1378"/>and is happening to import control in the meantime? Simply intensification of import control at the end of last year. We have had a number of statements, both from the hon. the Minister of Finance and the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs. In substance, the statements boiled down to this: Import control is not intended as a permanent instrument of protection for local industries. Industrialists, however, will not be left unprotected against foreign competition. Adequate protection is essential to promote confidence and growth in the economy. Customs tariffs must remain the principal instrument of protection. The Government&#x2019;s commitments under GATT, entered into, of course, by that wicked United Party Government, prevent the present Nationalist Party Government from extending effective tariff protection to industries. Import restrictions will have to be retained, until we obtain the necessary freedom under GATT. The Government does not like import control, and the position will be reviewed in May. Finally, the last factor in this story as regards the intensified restrictions imposed on the 25th November last&#x2014;the Government will give consideration to possible relaxations when the current balance of payments position shows a significant improvement. This is the credo of the Government in so far as import control is concerned.</p>

<p>But two criteria have already eventuated. Firstly, the month of May has come and gone. Secondly, the current balance of payments position has shown a significant improvement. I think probably the period of benefits from the leads and lags would seem to have ended, and there is now a steady flow of new capital into the country. What have we had from the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs? Is he now frustrating the hon. the Minister of Finance? On Friday he issued a statement on import control, couched in terms that at first blush seem to indicate that the hon. the Minister was relaxing import control. This is the way in which it was reported by some of the newspapers. Of course, the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs was doing nothing of the kind. If anything, he was tightening import control. In November there was an import permit issue of 20 per cent in respect of general merchandise and textile piece goods for sale in shops, as well as 15 per cent for clothing, based on the 1969 imports. In what is in fact the second round of permits for 1972, the hon. the Minister has made a further issue of 10 per cent for general merchandise, bringing the total issue to date to 30 per cent of the 1969 imports. There was a further 15 per cent for textile piece goods to make a total issue of 30 per cent of the 1969 imports in that category, as well as an additional issue of 10 per cent for clothing, bringing the total issue to date up to 25 per cent of the 1969 imports. So, permits issued for these three categories are 25 per cent, 30 per cent and 35 per cent of the 1969 imports. This is not relaxation, Sir; this is rigid control. That is what we are facing at the moment, particularly in view of the fact that the increase is not automatic&#x2014;importers have to apply for this increase&#x2014;and in the statement issued by the hon. the Minister there is a warning that any new permits issued must sparingly be used because it could not be indicated with any certainty at this stage that it would be possible to make further permit allocations in respect of consumer goods later in the year. In other words, there is a possibility that this is the last round, and there may be no further issues in August of 1972. What has become quite clear, is that the Government has become wedded to a policy of import control of imported goods with all its implications. I want to know from the hon. the Minister, when he replies to this debate, whether he subscribes to this policy. Now, we accept that this will afford protection to local industries, but will it induce greater productivity? Will it create more job opportunities in the most productive sectors, and will it create greater efficiency? If not, we are playing with fire. If not, it is back again to our Square One. Is the hon. the Minister being forced into this policy by his colleagues? We have acknowledged before, and I acknowledge again, that in certain growth industries, in some intensive job industries, and in some export intensive industries, continued protection might well have to be given. Like the hon. the Minister, we believe in protection by tariff, but if this is not possible, we go along with import control, but only in hard core cases and not general import control. I am speaking of hard core cases requiring special treatment. You see, Mr. Speaker, the danger of import control as we are operating it now and as a philosophy, is that we set the 1968 cycle in motion again, and what is this cycle? A rising liquidity, excessive spending, a rise in prices, more wage demands, rapid inflation, more and more controls, moves to damp down the economy, and back to <span class="col_8847-8848" refersTo="page_1379"/>December, 1971&#x2014;and I doubt whether the hon. the Minister wants to go back to December, 1971; we certainly do not.</p>

<p>We also found trouble on the Railways and with the fiscus. I wonder what the hon. the Minister of Transport says about this import control. He is already in deep enough trouble with his Railways, as a result of the high volume of low-rated export traffic, which is his main traffic. He is also denied the high-rated traffic from imports. What is his position going to be? An increase in railway rates, another cost inflation factor created?</p>

<p>And what about the hon. the Minister himself? His revenue is going to fall, because he is going to lose customs and excise duties. Mr. Speaker, we all acknowledge that devaluation is both a challenge and an opportunity, as the hon. the Minister has rightly said. If we take the opportunity, if we accept the challenge, if we adapt our policies quickly and intelligently to meet ever-changing circumstances, then we have enough strength in this country of ours for it to give to us freely of its bounty. But if we read the signs incorrectly, as we have done so often in the past, if we ignore the signals that are coming out of the economy day by day, if we are without a full understanding of the ultimate consequences of the actions we take, if we do as we have done in the past, namely too little too late, then it is the policy-makers, the Government, who will have to be blamed if there is any fall in the strength of our economy. I hope there will be no need for this, but of one thing you can be assured; if the policies the Government is going to follow bring with them a high rate of inflation and further rises in the cost of living, then the well-being and the security of every single person in the Republic of South Africa will be placed in jeopardy. With our racial structure, the low standard of living of many of our people, the wide gap between the haves and the have-nots, South Africa cannot afford to make economic mistakes. One profound thing the hon. the Prime Minister has said in this House is this: The one thing he fears is economic recession in South Africa. There is no need for any recession in South Africa. We have a good take-off point, as a result of devaluation, to strengthen our economy, but we shall only do so if the Government sees factually what is happening, digs down beneath the outward signs which sometimes are so misleading, and acts intelligently, strongly and quickly, remembering what happened in the last cycle of 1968-&#x2019;71. If they do this, South Africa can prosper; if they do not, we shall run into the same trouble again.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. HEUNIS</person>:</from>

<p>In his judgment of the Budget proposals the hon. member for Parktown chiefly discussed certain fragments. Sir, it is a fact that for the past few months our detailed scrutiny has focussed the Government&#x2019;s monetary and fiscal proposals and economic policies. Initially I want to make the general remark that it appears to me as if the hon. member for Parktown and his colleagues totally neglected to judge the Budget proposals and the Government&#x2019;s economic policy in terms of macro-economic objectives. We have repeatedly had evidence here of the obsession of the hon. member for Parktown and others with growth. Sir, no one will dispute that growth is a very important economic objective, but in our specific circumstances, and in our specific South African society, I immediately want to say that growth ought to be disciplined. In my opinion the hon. member and his colleagues reveal in their judgments a complete lack of financial discipline. Sir, there is a fundamental difference between the approach of hon. members on that side and hon. members on this side in respect of the economic policy that must obtain in our country. I immediately want to repeat an old truth by way of emphasis, i.e. that when we judge growth as an economic objective we cannot do so in a vacuum; we must see it against the background of the growth potential of our country and in the light of our labour position, our available infrastructure, capital and raw materials, etc. I think the hon. member agrees with this argument, but there is one important argument the hon. member does not want to agree with, i.e. that our growth rate in this country must also be determined against the background of the social, economic and political structure of this country. When the hon. member says that in this country we actually need a &#x201C;retreat from apartheid&#x201D;, what is he actually saying? He is then alleging, as he did again this afternoon by implication, that there is an unlimited reservoir of labour which, if it were not for the restrictive thinking of the Government, would be available to be employed immediately in our economic life. Sir, of course the labour situation, the availability of labour and the quality of labour are tremendously important factors <span class="col_8849-8850" refersTo="page_1380"/>in the development process in our economy. Of course I agree with the hon. member that one of the most important production factors specifically lies in the labour potential, not only because of the role it plays in this development process, but because the labour potential consists of people, who frequently react in an organized fashion to specific situations and to political events in the social framework in which they live. My complaint against hon. members opposite, in this particular context, is specifically that they merely see the available labour as a cog in a production machine, that they do not see the labourers as people who have to live in a specific social structure and that they are prepared to ignore these other factors completely. There they are revealing, in ray opinion, a completely wrong understanding of the South African situation. It is easy for the hon. member for Parktown to come along and say that the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration is responsible for our not having maximum utilization of available labour, but, Sir, has he ever referred to the dualistic composition of our labour potential? Has he ever regarded its dualistic elements, with a monetary economy on the one hand and a primitive economy on the other? I want to reiterate, and this is correct, that our economic prosperity depends to a large extent upon the available labour and the employment of that labour. But if one looks at the mass-unrest in the world the question arises as to whether the prosperity that people have obtained really serves the purpose it is supposed to serve.</p>

<p>Let us just for a moment analyse the labour situation as it exists at present. According to estimates the labour force in the seventies will increase by 190 000 workers per year, 40 000 of whom will be Whites. It will be the Government&#x2019;s task, in the first place, to create the necessary employment opportunities for these workers, but our ability to do so will also be determined by the availability of sufficient trained White workers in this country; this means being able to staff the top structure in the professional field. That is why the hon. member reveals a total lack of understanding in connection with the resultant twofold problem we are faced with, because on the one hand there will always be sufficient employment opportunities for Whites, but on the other hand, giving the other mass of people employment will depend on an increasing number of top-structure White managers. Therefore it is no use talking in abstract terms about the utilization of labour, and therefore I want to tell the hon. member that our standpoint continues to be that when one is speaking about this specific aspect one is speaking against the background of a specific social and political structure that must continue to exist in our country. When the hon. member then says that as far as they are concerned we need a &#x201C;retreat from apartheid&#x201D; he is revealing, in my opinion, the basic point of departure of hon. members opposite, i.e. that they are prepared to sacrifice all these things for ephemeral, short-term and fancied short-term benefits at the expense of long-term stability which we ought to make the prime objective in the economy. I want to say that we will have to realize that in future the strategy against our country will increasingly be aimed at its internal security and stability. One would expect all hon. members in this House to be prepared to co-operate in perpetuating and reinforcing that stability. It is true that a sound economy is one of the pillars on which this stability must rest, but my accusation is that the whole trend of thought of hon. members opposite is not that the economy must serve a purpose, but that the economy is a purpose in itself. I want to warn against this. If we do not do this we lapse into a blatant spirit of materialism, as hon. members opposite are doing.</p>

<p>There is another important aspect I want to refer to&#x2014;I want to ask whether the hon. member does not realize that this is one of the most important facets of government finance, that it must be keyed to macro-economic objectives and the effect this has on the country&#x2019;s economy as a whole. In this specific connection&#x2014;and here I think the hon. member will agree with me&#x2014;a Budget is seen today as an important stabilizer that must ensure our stable economic growth. I want to emphasize that there must be properly disciplined economic growth. In the formulation of this stabilizing fiscal policy it is consequently of tremendous importance for a proper analysis to be made of the present and the expected future economic conditions in so far as it is possible to make that evaluation.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. HEUNIS</person>:</from>

<p>I shall do so. I shall at least be more concrete than you were yesterday evening. On the grounds of this <span class="col_8851-8852" refersTo="page_1381"/>diagnosis the Government can then determine a fiscal policy and employ the available instruments. What are these instruments, and how have they been employed in this Budget? I now want to be concrete in terms of the hon. member&#x2019;s request. The first is a change in the composition and extent of the State&#x2019;s expenditure. I allege that in the present circumstances this has been done with the Budget proposals and the fiscal policy that has been proposed. The second is a change in the method of financing Government expenditure. I hope this is also concrete enough for the hon. member for Von Brandis to understand. This applies particularly in respect of the change in taxation rates, which again have been adapted in the present circumstances specifically to fit in with the evaluation of the circumstances. Also in respect of a change and the percentage of Government expenditure that has to be paid out of the Revenue Account, chiefly out of taxes. The hon. member for Parktown criticized this, but it has obtained a place and been incorporated in these Budget proposals. Lastly there are also the sources and the conditions of government loans to finance capital works, for example whether they will be negotiated locally or abroad, or whether they will be paid out of revenue. Therefore I want to tell the hon. member that in these specific circumstances the hon. the Minister of Finance formulated his policy as a stabilizing instrument within the estimated and expected circumstances.</p>

<p>What is the basis of the criticism of the hon. member for Parktown and other hon. members? The basis is the deviation of the economy&#x2014;and let me say that the hon. member for Parktown must concede, in all fairness, that he cannot judge the economy according to the 1968-&#x2019;71 period and lift this out of the overall pattern. But what does the hon. member chiefly say in his criticism? He says that the deviation in our economic activities is attributable to the steps the hon. the Minister of Finance took. But is the hon. member for Park-town totally unaware of the fact that according to calculations, which were made by the economists of the Reserve Bank, we have had nine smaller conjuncture variations in South Africa since 1945? The hon. member ought to know, after all, that these variations in economic activities are inherent and belong to the structure of the capitalistic economy. But in their opportunistic drive the hon. members want to create the impression, as he tried to do again this afternoon, that these variations are attributable to the action taken or not taken by the Government in specific circumstances. But what is strange in his approach is that he wants to ascribe all the recessions or downward trends to the Government, while ascribing all the upward trends to the private sector, particularly the important upward trends. But that is surely untrue; the opposite is true. Was the period of economic progress in the sixties, which was unequalled and unparalleled, not specifically the result of the climate the Government created in the specific circumstances? But why I object to this attitude is because there is no acknowledgement, on the part of the hon. member and his colleagues, of the interpretation of the circumstances and of the means being employed to act within the context of these specific circumstances. I think the hon. member will agree with me that it is the Government&#x2019;s responsibility to discipline the economy and economic activities within given circumstances when there is overspending, when there is inflationary pressure. when there are balance of payments problems and when there is unwarranted overspending. But what has been happening in the past few years, to which the hon. member referred. Is it not specifically true that in the past two years the Government has responsibly placed the emphasis on the right spot? The hon. member will agree with me that it is important that the emphasis in the economic policy must shift according to the circumstances prevailing from time to time. The hon. member for Parktown, now and in his previous speech, has evidenced no understanding whatsoever of the unfavourable effect on the South African economy of the policy change in the U.S.A. on 15th August, 1971. Let me now say that any person who speaks about the South African economy, particularly during the 1970, 1971 and 1972 period. without having an understanding of the unfavourable effect exercised by events abroad, is not a very responsible person. He does not. in any case, have a sense of proportion. [Interjection.] Oh, please, Sir, in this country we do not have an inherited or testamentary economy. Any economic policy in this country must inevitably be sensitive as far as the foreign sector is concerned&#x2014;and the hon. member confirmed this in his speech. In that connection the hon. member will agree with me. The hon. member knows that the foreign sector, and events abroad, exercise an enormous influence <span class="col_8853-8854" refersTo="page_1382"/>on the South African economy as a result of international trade and the net inflow of capital into our country. Therefore I ask the hon. member, when one is formulating a fiscal, monetary of economic policy, to have an understanding of those factors that influence it. How are we affected by international trade and the inflow of capital?</p>

<p>What are the characteristics of our trade? The first characteristic, which the hon. member will agree with, is a greater inclination to import. This is an old truth and has been mentioned here before. Our imports, as a percentage of our gross domestic product, represented 21,2 per cent in 1971. But let us look at the import set-up and the effect it has. In 1927 consumer goods represented 20 per cent, and intermediary and capital goods about 34 per cent and 45 per cent of an import package of R2 888 million.</p>

<p>Let us look at our exports in that specific connection. Our export of goods in 1971 totalled R1 481 million, including the net gold production of R918 million. The export of goods, together with the net gold production, represented 17,6 per cent of our gross domestic product. Now, the hon. member knows, as I have already said, that a large part of our imports consists of intermediary and capital goods. The hon. member knows that on a long-term basis the import of these goods makes a tremendous and important contribution to the development of the Republic&#x2019;s industrial and export potential. It is true&#x2014;and the hon. member is correct&#x2014;that it is important to bear in mind that South Africa must pay considerably more for the imports, apart from the price increases of goods in the countries of origin since the readjustment of exchange rates. However, this is not the only side of this picture. On the other hand the more expensive imports afford a considerable measure of protection to the private manufacturing sector&#x2019;s local competitive ability. This also applies to the inflow of capital which exercises an influence on our local economic policy. It goes without saying that in the process of formulation one would take note of certain trends in the economy. And which of these trends had to receive attention in the Budget proposals? And what attention was given to them? I think hon. members will agree with me that one of the most important is the already existing greater tendency towards spending and the local demand for goods. The second is the relatively lower growth rate in local production in general and in the industrial sector in particular. There is another important tendency, which the hon. member apparently does not accept, i.e. the existence of surplus production capacity in our industrial sector. What the hon. member does not accept either is a less rigid labour situation in our country. There he is correct; we are always being threatened by relatively high inflation. What was the balance of payments position prior to the Budget? That was one of the matters that had to receive attention in the Budget proposals and in the fiscal and monetary policy. Lastly there was the effect of import control and devaluation of the rand. All these factors were taken into account in the Minister&#x2019;s policy statement. A policy had therefore to be formulated against this background. Firstly, it had to be the promotion of an economy that consisted at that stage of the stimulation of economic growth, a curbing of the pressure of inflation and the improvement of our balance of payments position. The hon. member has stated before that the hon. the Minister and his colleagues were gambling with a lot of uncertainties in their Budget proposals for the Railways and the Post Office. I want to say that it is strange to hear that view from the hon. member for Parktown. I find it strange because for years the hon. members were prepared to gamble with a higher growth rate without regard to the growth potential and without realizing the socio-political and the stability implications of this. I want to tell the hon. member that it would be difficult for us to obtain a more calculated and more responsible shift of emphasis as far as policy is concerned than we have had. The emphasis has shifted to stimulate stable growth. Therefore I believe that the hon. the Minister, disciplined in his proposals, has specifically aimed at activating the economy&#x2019;s growth, that we must counteract the inflationary force and that we shall thus give our economic life a shot in the arm. I find that with a view to economic growth the choice of the steps in the given circumstances has already had the favourable effect which the hon. member for Virginia referred to. The effect has been to change a depressive attitude into a spirit of relative optimism. Therefore I also believe that the relatively low spending in the Government sector, where spending has increased this year by 6 per cent in comparison with 20 per cent last year, will also have a favourable effect and make a valuable contribution <span class="col_8855-8856" refersTo="page_1383"/>to the economic stability as one of the most important economic objectives we must strive for. The hon. members opposite, and the Press that supports them, have always advocated an economic policy that could bring them short-term benefits and serve vested interests. As yet they have evidenced little understanding or acceptance of National interests. I want to say that in the complex South African society it is irresponsible to look through spectacles tinted with visions of vested and group interests.</p>

<p>I should not like to analyse the hon. member&#x2019;s speech any further. In summing up I just want to allege that the Budget proposals are in accordance with the trends in our economy to which I referred, that in the fiscal policy the available instruments are being effectively employed, more to realize stable growth, to ensure foreign balance of payments stability and to supply employment for our people with due regard to the dualistic composition of our South African social structure.</p>

<p>In the first place, he charged the hon. member for Parktown with allegedly having dealt fragmentarily with the Budget as he had allegedly dealt only with certain fragments of it. Then he spoke of macro-economic objectives which ought to have been discussed, and said that things ought to have been seen in that light. Now I want to ask him where the overhead policy is which reveals the macro-economic objectives of this Government. Surely there is no grand overhead plan from which we can deduce what the hon. the Minister of Finance has in mind. The one year he makes certain financial arrangements and the next year he makes completely different ones again. There is no consistent policy or and during statements of policy and objectives with a view to long-term planning. It is on this very aspect in particular that I want to concentrate in my speech.</p>

<p>&#x2020;First of all I should like to say that it is my belief that after 24 years of its administration, the Government faces in this debate an imposing charge sheet, because, in the first instance, they have rent asunder the fabric of justice for all. They have manhandled the principles of fair and frank government and they have broken the terms of the social contract to govern the people only for the benefit of the people. They have taken charge of a very healthy country and a healthy people with perhaps the greatest potential in the world today. We have great manpower resources and potential in the world today. We have great manpower resources and potential. We have great mineral resources and potential. We have great power potential, not only electrical and steam but even nuclear power. We have at our disposal still untapped resources in this regard. But they have mismanaged all these so badly that growth today is still lagging behind and is lagging dangerously behind. In fact, the whole economy is in jeopardy. That is the charge-sheet that this Government is facing.</p>

<p>Furthermore, this Government claims to protect us again terrorists and communists, but who, might I ask, protects us against the Government? Who protects us against its incompetence, its arrogance and its ham handedness generally? There is only one answer: The only protection that we have is the ballot box. That is Where we must go and that is what the people of South Africa today must make use of to protect themselves against the arrogance and authoritarianism of this Government. My charge is that they have disregarded the potential of our people. They have lavished on our labours and they have scorned it. They have squandered our resources, because they have failed dismally to plan our future adequately.</p>

<p>The Government&#x2019;s whole Bantustan policy, parallel development&#x2014;or whatever euphemism you wish to use&#x2014;is quite irrelevant to any problem facing South Africa today. What are the real basic needs of a people before anything else? Before anything else. I venture to say, the basic needs of a people are food, shelter, security, education and a future. A people who are hungry, who have no housing and no future, are not a people who can attain great heights in any sphere of activity whatsoever. <span class="col_8857-8858" refersTo="page_1384"/>History abounds with proof that economic prosperity is a precondition for the flowering of all that is great and worthwhile in human existence. There has been one great society on this earth that did not, before anything else, attain economic prosperity and economic security. That is the very first pre-condition, because it is only when economic security and prosperity have been attained and assured that the arts flourish and philosophy and law are debated and a great people and a great culture became truly great. That is the reason why we on this side of the House are always concentrating on economics and economic matters, because this is the first priority in South Africa if we want South Africa to become a great country and a great society. We know it has the potential to become that. That is why we concentrate on economics and economic problems, because we realize its great value. It is not, as is sometimes scurrilously thrown at us from that side, a sense of materialism; it is exactly &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. M. STEPHENS</person>:</from>

<p>I am arguing that it is not done out of a sense of pure materialism as is sometimes unreasonably thrown to our account by hon. members on that side of the House. It is because we realize that before anything really great can be established in South Africa, we must have economic prosperity. After all, all of us in South Africa are the descendants of pioneers and we have a great pioneering spirit. I think that that spirit has civilized the whole of South Africa. That pioneering spirit must live with us and we must carry this pioneering spirit not only to the physical ends of South Africa which has been done, but we must use it to build a truly great, strong and truly noble society here. I believe that this can be done. Therefore, our first priority is not Bantustans, but economic prosperity and security for people of all races. We must ensure that the greatest possible measure of economic prosperity is built into our system.</p>

<p>The present economic difficulties are multifarious and much vaunted. The previous speaker, and those to come. I am sure, are going to deal with them. I am more interested in the future than in the past and today even more interested in the future than in the present. The main question which bothers me, which bothers hon. members on this side of the House, and which I believe bothers the majority of people outside this House, is how the Government is going to prevent a recurrence of the present economic difficulties. One wonders what plan this hon. Minister has got to ensure that such a situation will not arise again? We already see a buoyancy in the economy and we hope that the short-term benefits of devaluation will not be short-lived, that we will be able to build on this and that we will be able to make something permanent of it. But then something has to be done now. After all, we have previously seen economic prosperity of this country. It is not something new. But what was the result of the economic prosperity we enjoyed? The result was eventual devaluation, because this Government could not handle a boom. This Government has proved itself incompetent to govern South Africa while there is economic prosperity in this country; that is the greatest problem. We hope that we are going to right the economy and that everything will be all right again, but we now know from experience that this hon. Government cannot handle such economic prosperity.</p>

<p>They come with the argument that inflation was brought about by influences from outside, and that they had absolutely nothing to do with it. They say that completely outside influences brought about inflation because most Western countries suffer from the problem of inflation. But then I put the opposite to them. At the time South Africa was experiencing economic growth, the rest of the world was also experiencing economic growth. Is it then not also because <span class="col_8859-8860" refersTo="page_1385"/>of outside influences that we grew? How can they claim credit for the one and not for the other? I think the problem is that they have never been able to control the South African economy, that they never had the South African economy in their hands. That is the problem. That is why the whole thing ran away with them when we had a boom. I want to ask the Minister how the Government will ensure economic prosperity, stability and equanimity. We believe that this can only be done through long-term planning.</p>

<p>Any individual, group of individuals, company or other business enterprise wishing to have financial success must set its long-term objectives and must establish ways and means and a policy towards those objectives. This is surely equally true for an entire country. Our whole socio-economic structure is daily becoming more and more involved and we must ensure that an effective balance and interplay among all the factors of our communal life, namely, political, social, economic and the factors within the economy itself are maintained. In these days this calls for thorough planning. not only economic planning, but, I believe, socio-economic planning as well. But, and this I want to say very strongly, planning and regimentation is not synonymous. Planning must be indicative and incentive and must protect free enterprise through the security and prosperity it brings and not strangle it through controls and regulations which we have seen too often from this Government. Furthermore, planners must maintain the closest co-operation with employers, employees and entrepreneurs alike.</p>

<p>In the light of what I have just said, what has the Government done? It has instituted planning, but, I dare say, on an unplanned basis. Small planning bodies proliferate throughout each department of our monolithic state bureaucracy. They abound throughout our provincial administrations and local authorities. That is only in the public sector; in the private sector we equally have planning bodies. We are being overrun by planning bodies with no correlation, co-ordination, co-operation, rapport or even communication, <i>inter se</i>.</p>

<p>How can you have planning on an unplanned basis?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#stephens">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. M. STEPHENS</person>:</from>

<p>All their activities taken together do not amount to a comprehensive or even a comprehensible whole. This cannot constitute long-term national planning. To pose one question: Taking into account the population increase and what the total population of South Africa will be in 1980 and if it is our objective to house everybody by 1980, I wonder if this Government will be able to tell me how many bricklayers we will need to build all the houses. This is obviously a basic question. How many artisans are going to be needed? If they can tell me how many artisans are going to be needed, they should also surely be able to tell me how many new schools and how many new teachers there will have to be to be able to train those artisans. These are the basic questions which must be answered before one can plan. I am of the opinion that nobody can give us the answers to those questions.</p>

<p>The Department of Planning is even worse, because its activities are more like scheming than true planning. They are scheming how to make the unworkable work, because all work is done from a preconceived hypothesis. Thoroughly detailed social and economic planning is not to be confused with the so-called planning of the present Government, because we have no use for ideological planning. Planning must be based purely on social needs and economic realities which have been scientifically ascertained. Another result of the whole situation, which is in fact characteristic of the present Government&#x2019;s planning, indeed of the Government administration as a whole, is the bureaucratinization of our lives.</p>

<p>At present we are threatened by the rule of bureaucrats and dictatorship by the experts. To an extent, one might argue, it would be unavoidable in the haphazard type of administration of this Government; but the social life and structure of today and the stresses and strains of our society today are becoming so involved and intricate that experts I think necessarily abound as specialization increases and bureaucrats flourish, to mend the fabric of this gargantuan structure. Unfortunately, understanding of today&#x2019;s true problems in most cases go beyond the comprehension of the layman. Vastly intricate measures to deal with these problems are virtually all drawn up by experts in every conceivable field. The problems and their <span class="col_8861-8862" refersTo="page_1386"/>solution are therefore getting beyond the control&#x2014;and this is the danger&#x2014;of our normal democratic institutions in the present type of system. Adequate technical information, the details and the background are not readily available to our democratic bodies, and not soon enough. Therefore we find that on some of the most important matters concerning our future and our communal life in this country we have no meaningful debate. I believe that this results in the fact that effective government is done by generally unknown experts in what one might almost call &#x201C;secret backrooms&#x201D;. No control is possible over them. Their deliberations are in the nature of the matter secret, unknown and inscrutable&#x2014;their confusion is not. I think economic and technical measures, such as those which are going to be taken concerning our environment and pollution, are vital for our future and communal life in South Africa and which, out of the technical nature and the way matters are handled at present, are not adequately subject to democratic control. This is why I say that there is no adequate control over these matters through the normal democratic process. I think matters are going to become worse; because after all, South Africa is still a young and growing country. We must learn from the mistakes of others.</p>

<p>Other countries have had the same sort of experience and I think we can learn very well from their mistakes. I believe that we can now, being relatively, at the beginning stages of our greatest development, create a planning system which can be adequately subject to democratic control, whilst being effective and streamlined. Every field and facet of planning in our national life on every level must be inter-related and correlated, each segment with the other and eventually integrated at the top. The experts and planners in their deliberations must be brought out of the backrooms on to the public platform and into public debate.</p>

<p>On these general guide-lines we can have, not a technocratically controlled society under the cloak of democracy, but a true democratically planned free enterprise South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Zululand has indicated why it is important to maintain an unfragmented South Africa and what the solutions of the United Party are in this regard; the United Party foresees a federal South Africa. Such a system as I have out lined would fit ideally into a federal structure, where you have a devolution of power, but where everything, in other words the local content, is a priority. Everything at the top, however, is correlated and brought together. I believe that this would be the greatest safeguard for our future because, after all, we are now busy building the future South African society and we must determine the structure of that society. What is more important is that we are also busy determining the values of that society, the aims of that society and the ultimate process of that society, which I am convinced must be a federal process.</p>

<p>I am of the opinion that the main difference between that side of the House and this side of the House is that we do not believe in a fixed structure, a fixed pattern, into which the whole of our society must be pressed as hon. members opposite do. We do not want to fit society into a certain static structure because, after all, one of the great commentators on federalism, C. J. Friedrich, has said&#x2014;and I think this is generally accepted today&#x2014;that federalism is not a situation, it is a process; it is something which dynamically evolves all the while it exists, and this is what we want for South Africa, Mr. Speaker&#x2014;not a Utopia, not an absolute solution in absolute terms. When we are talking about the relations between people, this is the basic problem which has existed since the original sin, and we are not going to have a solution, but we want a process through which the forces of society can be channelled, a process which will ensure the rights of all groups and which will ensure that all groups, instead of working against each other, will work for the benefit of each other. Sir, this is why I believe that South Africa can no longer afford to sit with hon. members on that side within the ruins of their policy. They have tried to build a city at the side of the road of South Africa because they have tried to give a solution; they have tried to create a static structure; they have tried to build a city at the side of the road instead of travelling on, and they are now sitting within the ruins of their policy &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026;and they have dragged the rest of South Africa with them into those ruins. The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development <span class="col_8863-8864" refersTo="page_1387"/>is still trying to put a few bricks on top of each other to create the impression that something is going on, but he has not got any mortar. That is why the whole structure is shaking and I believe that we can no longer afford to sit in these ruins with hon. members on that side, because the United Party knows and sees the road for South Africa, and it knows how to travel that road, and whilst we point to the ruins to which this Government has led us, I believe that we are at this moment showing the people of South Africa the true road of South Africa and we invite them to walk this road with us.</p>

<p>Sir, I think the hon. member for Florida, speaking quite pathetically, condemned himself in the words he addressed to the hon. member for False Bay at the start of his speech when he said that in making his well-thought-out speech, the hon. member for False Bay had adopted a swaggering and haughty attitude here today. Sir, if there has ever been a na&#x00EF;ve demonstration of haughtiness and swaggering, then it is what we had from the hon. member for Florida. I watched the hon. member for Parktown to see what his expressions and reactions were while the hon. member for Florida, quite authoritatively, swung into action on economics. I am glad that the hon. member for Park-town does not have any hair on his head, for they would all have stood on end with excited fear, because the hon. member saw that a new full moon had appeared on the horizon of the United Party to speak on economics. But the hon. member for Parktown was quite justified in very soon adopting a calm attitude once again when he noticed what the quality was of the contribution made by the hon. member for Florida. Sir, what I found terribly amusing, was the sceptic and laughing manner in which all the other members of the United Party sat listening to what the hon. member for Florida had to say about the economy.</p>

<p>Sir, we have now come to the end of a session of Parliament. We are dealing here with a Third Reading debate on the Appropriation Bill, a debate which has taken up considerably more than 100 hours, and if we have to make summaries and give main impressions, I think you will agree with me, Sir, that at the end of this Session of Parliament the United Party are in a far greater state of confusion than they were at any stage during this Session. If they have ever been in a state of confusion, if they have ever found themselves in a political maze, in a far greater state of confusion than was the case at the beginning of the Session, then it is now. Today we once again found proof to that effect here, <i>inter alia</i>, from the lips of the hon. member for Zululand and other speakers. I shall come back to the hon. member for Zululand in a moment. At the outset I just want to say the following about him: Amongst other things, he spoke here of &#x201C;large-scale consolidation thrown overboard&#x201D; by our side. I wrote the hon. member a note, asking him to let me have his exact words, but the hon. member was so carried away with his speech that he wrote back to me that he thought he had said this and that.</p>

<p>Yes, and he could not remember what he had said.

Sir, what a cruel irony is it for the hon. member for Zululand to have to say this on this very day, this very day on which I announced to the Press and the public the proposals of my department on the consolidation of Northern Natal, where this hon. member&#x2019;s constituency is situated.</p>

But a cruel irony attaches to the fact that the hon. member made such a foolish statement here, after we had, in the first instance, come forward during this Session with the Ciskei proposals, which were adopted by this House, and after we had on this very day made this announcement in regard to <span class="col_8865-8866" refersTo="page_1388"/>Northern Zululand.

<p>Interim proposals.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, not interim proposals. It is the party opposite that is suffering from &#x201C;interim&#x201D;. Sir, the hon. member for Zululand also said here today that even more land would have to be surrendered than had been laid down in the 1936 Act. I shall come back to this thought, because this is one of the things on which a Babylonian confusion prevails in the United Party at the moment. In the third place, the hon. member said&#x2014;and this is a rather significant admission&#x2014;that there was merit in the thought, in the philosophy, as he calls it, of political say for the Bantu in the homelands, but he claimed that the economy had wrecked our policy and that we were now believing in a myth, namely that there were no Bantu in the White area. Sir, we do not believe in a myth. If there is one party which founds its policy squarely on the real facts of South Africa, the reality of multi-nationalism in South Africa, then it is this very party. We are not trying to wish together and to forge together and to force together an artificial unit out of totally unassimilable people into one biological unit, or, if it is not a biological unit, into one political unit in this central Parliament. Unlike the United Party, we do not indulge in such wishful thinking. Now, I say that during this Session the United Party has proved to us that it finds itself in a bigger political maze than it did at the beginning of the Session. Yesterday we witnessed a search for policy in the ranks of the United Party. Everybody in the United Party has now become a &#x201C;leading Opposition thinker&#x201D;. This is the latest name which the hon. member for Von Brandis, for instance, was given the other day&#x2014;&#x201C;a leading Opposition thinker&#x201D;. I suppose it is necessary to have &#x201C;leading Opposition thinkers&#x201D; since the leader as the policy-maker is not one. In the newspapers supporting them we read from day to day about the one &#x201C;re-think&#x201D; after the other. The hon. member for Wynberg had a &#x201C;rethink&#x201D; in Natal. There she underwent a whole metamorphosis, and then they imposed silence upon her here, so much so that she has already started thinking about retiring from politics, and that on the eve of the reins of government being assumed by their party, as they ostensibly believe. It is a very serious manifestation of frustration which leads to something of that nature. The hon. members themselves would be well-advised to have a little &#x201C;re-think&#x201D; on these matters.</p>

<p>There are three points in particular in regard to which the United Party have recently, in their own minds and also in the editorial offices of their newspapers, been engaged in a &#x201C;re-think&#x201D;. I want to mention and deal with these three points hurriedly. In the first place, we have the 16 representatives in Parliament. We know now how they take fright at it. It gave them a tremendous fright during the two by-elections, and it is attributable to those two by-elections we had that they are now having a &#x201C;re-think&#x201D; about the 16 representatives.</p>

<p>But the second topic in regard to which they have had such a tremendous &#x201C;rethink&#x201D;, is the acquisition of territory for the Bantu of South Africa. It started with our Ciskei proposals, and if one is now going to have a double &#x201C;re-think&#x201D;, it will be pursuant to our proposals which have now been announced in regard to Northern Natal. At first we heard from them that the 7&#x00BC; million morgen was the maximum that was to be purchased. Then again we heard, &#x201C;No, they may buy more than 7&#x00BC;<i></i> million morgen for the Bantu of South Africa&#x201D;, especially if such land is situated near the cities and the industrial complexes, as the hon. member for Transkei said, and this afternoon we also heard this from the hon. member for Zululand. But we also heard of other alternatives. This was particularly the case in the vicinity of the constituency of the hon. member for Albany, where people came and said to us: &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t buy any more land for the Natives; instead of doing that, assess the value of the land and give them the money, or give them the interest on that money, but for heaven&#x2019;s sake, just do not give the Bantu any more land.&#x201D; This &#x201C;re-think&#x201D; has now swung from nothing to more than the 1936 quota. I should like to know whether more alternatives are not going to be suggested as well; I would not bet a sixpence or an empty bottle of whisky on them.</p>

<p>The third point in regard to which there was such a tremendous &#x201C;re-think&#x201D;, is the question of the form of the federation. Previously we always heard them talking about a race federation. Apparently the <span class="col_8867-8868" refersTo="page_1389"/>racist approach of the United Party to this point is fading away at the moment, but now we only hear of the federation all the time. The reference to &#x201C;race&#x201D; has now been omitted. Originally they wanted to federate races, and now some of them want to federate territories, as is the case with the hon. member for Von Brandis, whilst others want to federate races and territories. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout admitted in the House that he recognized the existence of peoples, and when one deals with the Bantu, peoples are totally different from races, for the Bantu consist of one race and a number of peoples. But he has even started to recognize peoples, and so a Babylonian confusion prevails among them, and I can understand that a &#x201C;re-think&#x201D; is necessary, extremely necessary.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I thank the hon. member for the assistance he has just offered me. What I mean, is that there is a Babel of confusion, and now I am not referring to the Babel down in the Southern Free State.</p>

<p>I want to deal quickly with the hon. member for Transkei, with reference to what he said recently in a Press statement on the land question. The hon. member said that since confusion prevailed &#x201C;he wants to clarify the confusion&#x201D;. This &#x201C;confusion&#x201D; prevailed nowhere else than in the United Party itself; i.e. after our Ciskei proposals. At the time the hon. member said that even much more land could be purchased, at places such as Langa and Soweto; land could be transferred to the Bantu and they could obtain ownership there; he spoke about much more than the 1936 Act quota, but a short while before that the same hon. member had said from his own bench here in Parliament that it was not even necessary to purchase all the land mentioned in the 1936 Act, and the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town said the 1936 Act merely laid down a maximum and it was unnecessary to acquire everything. In the space of a few weeks they went from less than the 1936 maximum to an area exceeding that maximum, and today, of course, we heard from the hon. member for Zululand again. I want the country and the public of South Africa to take very good note of the fact that at present the policy of the United Party is to surrender much more land to the Bantu with a view to land-ownership than was laid down in the 1936 Act, and that they want this to be done near the White cities and major industrial complexes, i.e. near places such as Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Johannesburg, and so forth, even if it is true that some say that we should not give them land, that we should give the money. Then the hon. member for Transkei referred to the &#x201C;urban and rural areas&#x201D;. In other words, this is not only in the urban complexes such as Cape Town and Port Elizabeth and Johannesburg, but also in the rural areas. I want to tell the hon. member now that he should tell us without mincing matters&#x2014;I think this will take something of a &#x201C;re-think&#x201D;&#x2014;that if wants to grant the Bantu land-ownership of plots in the urban areas, what they mean by the rural areas. Do they want to allow the Bantu to get even more Black spots and to purchase farms in the rural areas? They must tell us.</p>

<p>The hon. member should not bother me now. He will get a turn; he can &#x201C;re-think&#x201D; in the meantime, and then he should give us clarity on that point, for it is necessary. As I have said, the hon. member came forward with the very drastic idea that they now wanted to grant more land than was laid down in the 1936 Act, but at the same time the hon. member said that consolidation of the homeland areas was not essential, not under their policy. But today the hon. member for Zululand levelled the reproach at me that we did not want to promote consolidation. Who are we to believe in a party in which such confusing statements are made? It is a Babel of confusion. It looks more like Egyptian darkness to me. When they say consolidation is not essential, I recall that in their own race federation policy they said the race federation policy had a &#x201C;geographical content&#x201D;. What does that mean? Does it mean a few hundred spots all over South Africa, or will their geographic content no longer be meaningful <span class="col_8869-8870" refersTo="page_1390"/>if it consists of a few consolidated units? I think it is very necessary for them to have a &#x201C;re-think&#x201D; on this question. In that article of his the hon. member told us that the Bantu were entitled to everything the Whites had, and that they would not use the 1936 Act for keeping the Bantu out of the homelands. I ask the hon. member, and I ask the hon. House, to read the 1936 Act, please. Then they should tell me what its main objective is other than trying to keep the Bantu in the homelands and out of the White areas. The delimitation of additional areas and even the labour tenant system are dealt with in that Act. Numerous other matters are dealt with in it too. Everything is aimed at trying to increase the number of Bantu in the homelands. Now the hon. member says that they are not using that very objective of the Act.</p>

<p>I want the hon. member to remember that the people outside are not as stupid as that. The people outside will realize how the United Party are blatantly undermining the basis of this 1936 Act in the &#x201C;re-thinking&#x201D; they are engaged in at the moment.</p>

<p>Now I want to refer to the hon. member for Von Brandis. I simply want to interrupt myself, as the former hon. member for Standerton used to say. I want to interrupt myself by saying that the hon. member for Von Brandis dealt with such a host of points in that recent speech of his that I shall really not be able to do justice to all of them in the space of the remaining few minutes that I have at my disposal. Really, it is pathetic that <i>The Cape Times</i> described his speech as a &#x201C;carefully worded speech&#x201D;. I must tell hon. members that it is by no means worded carefully enough for a person with a diplomatic background, and this came, no less, from a &#x201C;leading Opposition thinker&#x201D;, as he was styled.</p>

<p>Yes, not &#x201C;speaker&#x201D; but in fact a &#x201C;thinker&#x201D;. In that speech of his the hon. member for Von Brandis revealed more than anything else that the United Party with its Bantu policy is a sorry party. The hon. member said, amongst other things, that they did not believe in any mixed unitary state. If that is the case, what is their race federation? At the same time he said they believed in a stable, democratic community, but apparently this is not a mixed unitary state. That speech of the hon. member contains more contradictions than I have ever found in any speech. I read through it very carefully, and I should like other hon. members to approach it that way as well. He said quite a number of very important things in that speech, and then he said at the same time that the United Party could not give a blueprint of its policy for the future, as this was impossible. Then the hon. member simply delivered himself of a lot of things.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Von Brandis is one of these people, and he said this in that article, which stated that the Bantu had to be persuaded to accept things other than extra land. He does not want to give them the full 1936 quota; he wants to give money or something else in exchange for it. The hon. member for Transkei, on the other hand, said we had to give more than the land granted in terms of the 1936 Act. Now, one still finds people who say that confusion does not prevail, that they are not blowing hot and cold and that they are not at loggerheads as far as their policy is concerned.</p>

<p>The hon. member did at least pay the National Party one major compliment, and I want to thank him for that, just as I thanked the hon. member for Wynberg the other day for the same good things she said. The hon. member said good things had been accomplished up to this stage and that they should not be abandoned. After 24 years of National Party Government I think that hon. member will have to agree with me that those good things to which he referred are achievements attained by us on this side of the House. The hon. members opposite opposed in this House everything that could be ascribed to us as achievements and tried to block them outside this House. The hon. member also said in that speech of his that the statements he was making there, were aimed at safeguarding race groups and rendering the race bomb harmless. I am pleased that he has admitted that their policy, the race federation policy, is a bomb and that they are now &#x201C;re-thinking&#x201D; in order to get away from their race federation policy, and also <span class="col_8871-8872" refersTo="page_1391"/>that they now want to pursue a policy of federal systems with various possibilities. As I said a moment ago, they have various systems for their race federation. Some say that races must be federated and some say that areas must be federated. Some say that both must be done, and then they are also talking about communal councils. They are also talking about South-West Africa. The hon. member also said that South-West would be persuaded to join the federation. I want to ask the hon. member why we should still be subjected to hearing him tell us that South-West will have to be persuaded to join the federation. Are the members representing South-West not sitting in this Chamber already? Has South-West not been incorporated politically into this Parliament already? Do they first want to take South-West out of our political system, detach it and then persuade it again to join the federal system? It would seem to me as though such things are possible with the United Party. The hon. Senator Horak has already announced that under their race federation policy they will also invite Lesotho, Botswana and Swaziland to join it. This has already been said. I suppose they will also go so far yet as to ask the four provinces of our country to join the race federation. Now I want to know how they want to achieve this. After all, as it is those four provinces and South-West Africa are integrally interwoven in our political system in South Africa. What does the hon. member mean in this &#x201C;carefully worded speech by a leading Opposition thinker&#x201D;? No, there must at least be better thinking than that.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said he believed that the territorial concept was the stronger and had to be emphasized much more. In other words, he is not very pleased with the race concept, with race federating. No, he talks about the territorial concept. Very well, that may be sensible; I do not know. He also said a few other things. He said it was in fact sensible to have the non-White groups represented here in Parliament. But. he said, should this appear to be prejudicial to us, we would have to take that matter into reconsideration, &#x201C;then we must rethink&#x201D;. Do the hon. members of the Opposition want the people of South Africa to regard them in all earnest as an alternative Government for whom they may vote at a next election if they continually want to &#x201C;re-think&#x201D; on such basic things and have an alternative to everything? And then, after all these things, they still say: Although we have so many possibilities, an alternative to everything, we also want to add that we do not have a blue-print for the future. And then they want to go to the polls with that. In that case, as I said a moment ago, there ought not to be any members who will differ with me if I say that at this stage, as far as its policy in regard to relations amongst peoples is concerned, the United Party finds itself in a much bigger political maze than it did at the beginning of this Session or at any stage during the past number of years and the period of almost 20 years during which I have been in this House of Assembly. We are all looking forward to that congress which is going to be held this year.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Von Brandis also said in that speech of his he admitted that the National Party was justified in having a fear of being overwhelmed in this Parliament by the non-White representatives who could be here. This is what he said. But I want to remind the House that not so long ago the hon. member for Yeoville asked me from his bench whether we had so little faith in our own policy that we could not accept that the representatives of non-Whites in this House could also support us in this House. My reply to him was &#x2014;and I repeat it today&#x2014;that we never wanted to have the support of the representatives of non-Whites in this House, because we did not want them here. What is more, we do not want any support from them there, because it would be wrong for non-Whites to be the balance of power between two White political parties in this House or outside this House.</p>

<p>No, it is not out of context; it is quite in context.

It would not be possible to put it into operation? Only recently we witnessed this once again. Last week it was announced that the second Bantu homeland in South Africa was becoming a self-governing territory within the Republic, namely Bophuthatswana. I may also tell the hon. member that I signed the last set of proclamations for the Ciskei today. They are on their way to the State President. The Ciskei is also going to be granted self-government this year, probably at the beginning of August if everything can be attended to before that time. During the course of this year the North Sotho, too, will be granted self-government in the same manner. Therefore we hope to have in South Africa four self-governing territories on the model of the Transkei by the end of this year. The others are competing with one another as to which of them will be the next one. And then that hon. member said our policy could not be implemented. I want to remind him at the same time that this year we put forward the extremely important and very striking and imaginative proposals in regard to the consolidation of the Ciskei and the other territories to which I referred earlier on today. Then the hon. member still says that our policy cannot be implemented.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, that hon. member is committing slander by appealing to Dr. Eiselen. If that hon. member at his best knew as much about our policy as Dr. Eiselen does at his worst, it would be good for that hon. member. The hon. member told us that we could not implement our policy successfully. In that case, why are those members still quarrelling about our policy amongst themselves? The hon. members of the United Party are quarrelling amongst themselves about whether the good things in our policy should be accepted and whether the inevitable should be accepted. That is what the hon. member for Wynberg recently said in Natal. She said that the good things in our policy, the inevitable, what we established and what was good&#x2014;such as the three or four things she mentioned&#x2014;had to be accepted by the United Party. Then they gagged her because of that. Then they made her take a dislike to politics because of that. Is this proof that we are struggling to implement our policy, or are they the people who are quarrelling amongst themselves about accepting certain aspects of our policy as inevitable and as good, even within the framework of their race federation plan? I think the hon. member did himself a disservice through that article which he wrote, a greater disservice than the hon. member for Florida did himself this afternoon through his little speech.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the few moments I have left I just want to say that the United Party is a pathetic party. It finds itself in a bigger political maze than has ever been the case before, and this is so because it does not want to realize the futility of its own efforts&#x2014;how futile it is for it to deny and reject multi-nationalism in South Africa. The United Party should stop talking about a race federation. I notice that to a certain extent they have already started to break away from that racist bias of theirs. We are not dealing with the Bantu as a race in South Africa as far as the political statements are concerned. Nowhere in the whole world will hon. members show me a country which has established a government for itself on the basis of race; this is done on the basis of a people, the cultural unit. It is on that basis that our policy is adapted to realism. As long as the United Party does the futile thing of disregarding this and of denying and disregarding the aspirations of the Bantu peoples, they will, in the political sphere in South Africa, sink down in a bigger maze and in a bigger desert.</p>

<p>As against that the National Party stands out as a party accepting to an increasing extent the multi-nationalism of South Africa, modelled on the lines of the real facts as we experience them every day in regard to the various Bantu peoples in South Africa. That is why one people after the other are getting this political self-government and forming their own governments and designing their own systems in the Bantu homelands, by means of which their citizens <span class="col_8875-8876" refersTo="page_1393"/>who are in the White areas are also integrated politically with those people and even feel physically attracted to those homelands, to such an extent that they want to move there.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, one can quite understand why a Minister of Bantu Administration and Development should get so agitated in this House and confine his entire speech to dealing with the policy of the Opposition. One can quite understand that when one realizes that his own policy has collapsed around him in ruins. Not only is this said by this side of the House, but also by the deepest thinking people that support the Nationalist Party at present, as I shall presently show. He said several things which I want to answer shortly, before I revert to the whole question of the failure of his policy and the policy of his Government.</p>

<p>Dealing with our attitude towards land, we made it perfectly plain that we do not propose that land should be made available for Bantu in order that it may be ruined under the practice of communal grazing, and so forth. We said in regard to that land that we can well visualize using that land on an individual basis of ownership, because then the Bantu would use that land productively and not as now. For the rest, in regard to land, we have stated that in the urban areas and in areas surrounding our urban areas where at present there are acres and acres of housing schemes for Bantu people, growth will take place and we have said that other areas of a like kind will grow where they will have houses and in many cases ownership. He also referred with great pride to the fact that in this very year there would be four Native authorities which will reach the stage which the Transkei has reached today. So often do we hear from him of this constitutional development and how he is rushing from one authority to another and conferring greater powers on them, but this does not mean that it is solving anything. Indeed, the very opposite is clear. Some members on our side referred him to the great father of apartheid. Dr. Eiselen, in this regard, and let me remind the hon. the Minister what Dr. Eiselen said in regard to this aspect. He said:</p>

<block name="quote">Ek glo nie dit is moontlik om in Suid-Afrika volkome onafhanklikheid aan die Bantoestate te gee nie, al wil hulle er al wil jy dit graag sien.</block>

<p>But the hon. the Minister is rushing ahead and thinks that by moving to this conclusion he will have done a service to the Native people and to South Africa. It is one thing to set up constitutional authorities, but it is another thing for them to be of service to the people of this country. Let me remind the Minister, and I will dwell upon this later, that already in these areas which are most advanced we have a considerable confrontation with the Government. I will return to this during the course of my speech.</p>

<p>Lastly the Minister said that he did not want the support of non-Whites in this Parliament. But what this party&#x2019;s press organs have been saying, and he himself, I think, before, is that he would not secure the support of any of these peoples for his policies in this House. This is a most important admission, because when the hon. members opposite tell us that the Bantu peoples are all in support of their policies and that no support can be found for our policies, what more acid test can you have than the test as to how the representatives of those peoples would use their vote if they had it in this House? It is obvious and quite clear that if by a quirk of fate this great heaven was removed from them at the last moment and the United Party came into power before they achieved it, then if indeed it was such an attractive proposition, one can be quite certain that they would wish to use their vote in this House in order to secure this heaven at the earliest possible future date. Consequently, this is the most &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>This is not the question. This is not the point. The hon. the Minister is endeavouring to avoid the point. The point is that he says that these people want his policy of independence and other policies. If they were given the chance to say so in this House, his side now tell us that they would not vote for these heavens which they are promised. That is the point, and it is time he remembered this when dealing with this question.</p>

<p>I am going to leave the hon. the Minister there. I want to come back shortly to the hon. the Minister of Transport and the speech he made today. I do so, partly because I want to correct something upon which I think he misunderstood me, and <span class="col_8877-8878" refersTo="page_1394"/>partly because I would like to say a very few words about it before getting on to the main thing I do want to say in regard to the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s Bantu policy. I interjected while the hon. the Minister of Transport was speaking that in our party you had a fifty-fifty situation. I was meaning by that that you had in our party 50 per cent of the support coming from Afrikaans-speaking people and 50 per cent from English-speaking people. This is what is so vitally valuable to the people of South Africa. That party opposite at one time enjoyed a certain amount of English-speaking support, but because of its bad and indifferent policies, that support drained away, with one result, which we saw of course at Oudtshoorn. But this party can offer, not only the sanctity of its utterances of fair play to both sections of our country, but the complete equality of its support and of composition of its public representatives amounts to a guarantee thereof, This is a most significant matter; because hon. members opposite can try as much as they like, but they will be tugged at by the claims and the other strains of party-political advantage in this regard, as has been shown only so recently at Oudtshoorn.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister endeavoured to pass off the speeches of the hon. the Minister of Defence and others on that side in this House and other places as merely defending and standing up for the Afrikaans language. This was not so, Mr. Speaker. I would like to have seen the hon. the Minister of Transport speaking more strongly to some of his Ministers in this regard. Had he done so, I would have been more impressed with his plea for national unity. I do indeed know him as a completely bilingual and fair-minded man, and I should think he would approach matters in this way. But there are plenty of colleagues on his side who do not have the same approach and whom he, by his speech today, did not adequately check. If we had had more of that, one could have thought that there was more repentance on his side now in this regard; but I am afraid that without that background, we are not so impressed.</p>

<p>He also referred, but only in general terms, to alleged injustices to Afrikaans and seemed to suggest that some of them came from this side. He quoted none of these instances. He should know that his Government has been in power for 25 years&#x2014;it cannot therefore be from the Government sector that any of this comes. He did not cite any private institutions who were responsible for this and give any examples. I do not see how he can possibly place those at the door of the United Party.</p>

<p>But, Mr. Speaker, I can give countless examples where, in my view, there has been an injustice done to the English language and so forth, but I do not spend my time doing this, because I stand for tolerance in these matters. I believe that we must be tolerant in these matters. I will give a couple of examples of cases where I know how hon. members opposite would have reacted had it befallen to them, and I will start with Oudtshoorn. In this great victory at Oudtshoorn we had a candidate standing who was using a poster, one of his main posters, which used completely wrong English. How many elections have I not fought where, if there has been a mistake in the Afrikaans used by the United Party, we have been told that this is because the United Party people have no time for Afrikaans. The hon. member for Oudtshoorn is a man from Oudtshoorn, and his poster read, &#x201C;Badenhorst from Oudtshoorn&#x201D;, but you do not say that in English; you say, &#x201C;Badenhorst of Oudtshoorn&#x201D;.</p>

<p>No, I have a photograph of that poster, because I was interested in it. Sir, the point is that it would never have occurred to me to take that matter any further because I believe in tolerance. I believe that there should be the greatest measure of tolerance. I believe that the two language sections should be careful not to hurt each other, even in matters of humour. I believe that perhaps each language group should direct its humour against itself, rather than across the language line. That is perhaps going a bit far, but I believe that we should be very careful in this regard out of concern for people&#x2019;s feelings.</p>

<p>Sir, there are countless examples that I could give. How often when I phone a Government department is the call not answered in Afrikaans? It is not always <span class="col_8879-8880" refersTo="page_1395"/>answered in Afrikaans, but very often, but I do not object to that; I say to myself: &#x201C;Let us have tolerance.&#x201D; What do I hear from national servicemen? I have been told by English-speaking national servicemen whom I have asked what language is used in the army camps: &#x201C;Dit is alles in Afrikaans.&#x201D; But I do not raise these matters. These are Government departments, Mr. Speaker. This is not a case where some immigrant working in a hotel cannot speak the sort of Afrikaans that you might wish to hear. Take some of the Select Committees of Parliament. Countless of our members get most of the documents in Afrikaans. Do they object? These are Government departments. The hon. the Minister and other members opposite base their alleged case against the United Party on the fact that some person in a hotel, who is probably an immigrant and possibly a German, does not address them in Afrikaans. What control has the United Party over these people? But I do not believe in bringing up these matters. I do so now under some provocation because I do not see why the hon. the Minister of Transport in this debate had to make a speech that was similar to the speech that he made in the election campaign. I believe most sincerely&#x2014;indeed, it is so obvious that one need hardly state it&#x2014;that in a country which finds itself in our situation we need the greatest measure of national unity, and this whole party is a 50-50 party, as far as its supporters and its public representatives are concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to come back to what I regard as a future question, as indeed this other one is, too, and that is the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s race relations policy. I am sorry that the hon. the Minister has departed, but his Deputy is here. I should have liked to talk to the hon. the Minister as well. Sir, a further year has passed since this Parliament was prorogued last year, and one year at this period of our history is a precious period of time, and I believe that today we are no nearer to a solution of our race relations problems than we were a year ago. Indeed, I believe that we are further away from the solution. I believe that in this past year further goodwill has drained away. I believe that in this past year tensions have been rising and can be seen to be rising between the various race groups, including&#x2014;sad to relate&#x2014;the English speaking and the Afrikaans speaking. There have been growing confrontations too numerous to mention.</p>

<p>Many of these institutions, of which the hon. the Minister was boasting a moment ago as representing tremendous achievements by the Government, are institutions which are certainly underlining the very differences which exist between us. One has only got to think of the statements by the leaders of the two main Bantu groups, the Zulu people and the Xhosa people. Chief Buthelezi says that if all the land that the Government is going to give them is the land as set out in the 1936 settlement, then this policy is a fraud. The Government, on the other hand, says, &#x201C;That is all the land we are going to give them&#x201D;. Chief Matanzima says virtually the same thing; he says that he is not going to ask for independence unless he can have certain White areas to which he has laid claim. Sir, there is an absolute confrontation between the Government and these new bodies brought into being by the Government and about which the Minister boasts. This is nothing to boast about. Take the Coloured people. We cannot be happy with the trend in regard to the Coloured people either. I do not, however, propose to elaborate upon that now. I say, Sir, that there are many people on the Nationalist side who agree that the Government has no policy whatsoever in respect of a major part&#x2014; perhaps the major part&#x2014;of our problem. I refer here, of course, to the urban Bantu. There was a long time when hon. members opposite were convinced that the Bantu would disappear from our White urban areas. The permanence of the Bantu in our urban areas was never foreseen or taken into account in the policies of hon. members opposite. Their whole policy was constructed on the basis that the Bantu would not be permanent here.</p>

<p>Indeed, Sir, apartheid can be said to have been designed to avoid the very existence of the Bantu in the White urban areas, but this has failed completely. The Bantu in the urban areas are more numerous now than ever before. I believe that <span class="col_8881-8882" refersTo="page_1396"/>the most interesting thing about the Budget of the hon. the Minister of Finance is that this Budget is the final admission that the Government has stopped trying to achieve what their policy set out to achieve in that respect. I will come back to this point later on. Sir, there are countless Nationalist verligtes who are saying that they have no policy in regard to the urban Bantu. I could quote countless numbers of them and perhaps I shall do so. But the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration completely ignores that whole issue and spends his time&#x2014;he thinks successfully &#x2014;in attacking United Party policy. He should be doing some thinking on his own policy. Indeed, all members of the Government should be doing some rethinking on their policy, starting from the ground up.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, let us look very briefly at the history in regard to this aspect of the permanence of the urban Bantu. We were told that the ideal was complete territorial separation and that you should ideally be reducing the numbers of Bantu in the White areas. I may say that conceivably, if you could get all the Bantu out of the White urban areas, the idea of sovereign independence might make some sense. But then in the &#x2019;sixties the cry arose that &#x201C;Ons bely apartheid, maar ons praktiseer integrasie&#x201D;. That cry arose in the middle sixties. Then we had the classic statement from the hon. the Minister of Labour. I am so sorry he is not here, so that he could correct me if I go wrong in any respect. What did he say? He used words to this effect, that &#x201C;by the development and prosperity of South Africa the opponents of apartheid would try to destroy apartheid&#x201D;. That is the effect of what he said in about the middle &#x2019;sixties. I believe it was at about that time that we got these various last-ditch efforts from the Government to give some content to their apartheid. You will remember, Sir, that we had the five per cent reduction of Bantu in the Western Cape annually. We had the Physical Planning Act, and how drastic, we were told, that was going to be in what it would do. We had the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development himself talking in this House precisely three years ago, and these are some of the things he was still able to say in those days. He said in column 8379&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; every individual should make a positive contribution, take steps and undertake planning in order to reduce the numbers of the Bantu in our white areas in every sphere, including our Bantu domestic servants, farm labourers and factory workers. We must accept, propagate and support this idea in every respect. If we want to implement this policy, and we are going to do so, each and everyone of us should be inspired with this aim.</block>

<p>That was the sort of thing he was telling us three years ago, and the hon. the Minister of Health was assisting this aim at one stage by doing his own washing up. I do not know whether he is still doing it.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Then above all, I believe that the hon. the Minister of Finance was pulled into this great last-ditch effort. I believe that his Budgets were designed to buttress and support this whole last-ditch stand on apartheid. Sir, you will remember very well how for several years the hon. the Minister of Finance used to read us a lovely lesson about a lucky party with a great ideology. He used to tell us, when he came with his Budgets in those days, that this party had an ideology and this was so important, but we did not understand it. It was those words and the framework of his Budget in those days which were undoubtedly designed as a last-ditch effort to achieve the very same aim that the Physical Planning Act and the five per cent Cape reductions and everything else was designed to do. In this year of grace, I suggest that also this barrier has been thrown down. The five per cent reduction in the Western Cape has completely gone. I asked the Minister of Bantu Administration for the figures in this regard and the increase in Bantu labour in the Western Cape in the last two years, for which figures are available, was of the order of 30 000 or practically 25 per cent. We know that the Physical Planning Act has been watered down and emasculated until it really means nothing now and finally this year, under the pressure of events, we have seen the Budget of the hon. the Minister of Finance also trimmed and tailored to meet the new situation and sharing in the abandonment of the whole policy. I <span class="col_8883-8884" refersTo="page_1397"/>do not pretend to be a financier or a man of financial affairs, but it is quite obvious that in the middle 1960s the idea was to use our high exchange reserves and gold supplies to allow imports freely and thus damp down to some extent our industries. There may have been other factors involved to make them decide that this was a good course, but basically, it was the hope that by damping down our own factories, you would draw fewer and fewer people into the metropolitan areas, and so you would support the Physical Planning Act and these other measures. Now what do we see? We see now that this policy has gone out of the window, and as the hon. member for Park-town said not long ago, in fact there is now a tight import control and there is the promise of adequate, more than adequate, protection for local industry; in other words, they are now reversing that policy and accepting the inflow of Bantu labour into our industries on a big scale I was saying that there are countless &#x201C;verligte&#x201D; Nationalists, some of the best thinkers on their side, who accept that the Bantu is permanent. I think <i>Rapport</i> can claim the honour of having had the courage first to come out with such statements. They asked: Who still believes that the Bantu is not permanent in our urban areas? Several others have followed and I salute them, because it is not so easy to speak up in this regard. So many of them, amongst whom we find Adv. De Villiers and I think I am right when I say even &#x201C;Dawie&#x201D; of <i>Die Burger</i>, say that the Bantustans at most can be only a slight help in the question of their policy. I say that they have no policy for this most important section of our population, the urban Bantu. They have no policy other than a blank denial of rights. They are &#x201C;van burgerlike regte verstoke&#x201D;&#x2014;that is the way it has been put so classically by the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. Then there were one or two fearful little steps this Session, little steps in regard to family life which we welcome. There have been little steps towards relaxing the availibility of houses in the Bantu urban townships and we welcome this too. But how belated they are and what goodwill has it not cost us that there has not been proper accommodation all these years? Basically there has been no policy for them and there is no basic rethinking to be seen.</p>

<p>I must hurry to a conclusion. The economy has been throttled and our growth per capita is tragically low. Hon. members can read what Mr. Oppenheimer has said in the annual report of the Anglo-American Corporation. It was quite tragically low for us to be among the back-runners among the Western countries when it comes to income per head of population, it is too pathetic for words. I hope the hon. Minister of Finance will keep his eyes open and that he will talk to us about this figure in future, and not about the general growth rate Where our great and fast growing population and its high birth rate have such an effect upon the situation. I said that if one could have got the Bantu back into the Bantu areas, there might have been a case for sovereign independence. As it is now there is none whatsover. They are only dangerous. Therefore the answer is more and more seen to be the answer of a federation. Our policy is a race federation, and it also has the geographic aspect in it too as it has been stated so often. This is the answer to the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. More and more people are coming around to this. Our principles are so well known for that federation that White leadership shall be accepted and protected in the interests of Western standards among all races. The non-Whites must have a say in matters of mutual concern and a predetermined share in Government. Through the introduction of our federal elements there will be a real measure of protection to each individual and to race groups. Above all, there must be human goodwill as Chief Buthelezi said: &#x201C;Why can my staff not drink a cup of coffee in a pleasant friendly way with me &#x2026;&#x201D; or words to that effect. I say that this growing Nationalism negates that. We must realize that with their growing awareness of civilization, the Bantu people will more and more appreciate that in terms of our civilization they are suffering indignities. This will mean more and more that they will not be prepared to tolerate those indignities. The sooner, therefore, that we get to this appreciation, the better.</p>

<p>Sir, in conclusion, another year has passed, another year of precious time has passed and we are no nearer to meeting this need for goodwill, to meeting this need of all our people to proceed in harmony.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. DE K. MAREE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Pinelands spoke about bilingualism; he spoke about the <span class="col_8885-8886" refersTo="page_1398"/>multi-national aspect&#x2014;in other words, about their federation policy. He will excuse me if I do not reply to him immediately as far as that is concerned, because in the course of my speech, which will actually be dealing with the same matters, I shall come back to what he said at the start.</p>

<p>I have sat through this Session, as in the case of the previous one; I have spoken very little, but I have listened a great deal. I was almost always in my seat. That is why I want to give a quick summary today of what I have witnessed during these two Sessions and during the two elections that preceeded them. Throughout we had an absolutely striking continuity. I now want to tell the Opposition frankly that in the elections, as in these two sessions, we have had common gossip-mongering and character assassination. I regret this; it was truly characteristic of these two elections and of the two Sessions. What it all amounted to was nothing less than character assassination and gossip-mongering. Those hon. members were of the opinion that they achieved some success with that in the elections. That is why they continued with it on such a scale.</p>

<p>The second aspect that constantly revealed itself during this session is the scandalous disparagement of Afrikaner sentiments and Afrikaner feelings. Now those hon. members will again say: There he is starting with his racism again. No, I want to tell them that they are the ones who are the racists. We have always had a policy, all these years, of co-operation on the basis that our English-speaking friends may speak nothing but English as long as they put South Africa first, and that we, as Afrikaans-speaking people, are completely Afrikaans; we are prepared to respect and value each other in our diversity. What did we witness here? We saw people of Afrikaans extraction, with Afrikaans surnames. being used, even in last year&#x2019;s election. There was. for example, the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town who said that his father taught him that we should not be so terribly Afrikaans and that we should throw our Afrikanerhood overboard, because then the English would also stop being English.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. DE K. MAREE</person>:</from>

<p>Oh. did he not? That hon. member was sleeping at that moment. I know that he sleeps quite frequently in this House. Perhaps he was also asleep at that moment. If he had been awake he would have heard it. He may also go and read it himself in Hansard. This year we have had a similar instance. They said at the time that he is a young man and that we should be a little forgiving as far as he is concerned. But did we not again this year see the hon. member for Sea Point stand up here and did we not hear him say, with great bravado, that he wanted to repeat what the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town had said? Yes, two Afrikaans-speaking Afrikaners are used to discredit Afrikaans sentiment and tradition. I now ask anyone in this House to bring me an English-speaking United Party member who has already said: Please do not be so English, because then the Afrikaners will not be so Afrikaans either. I do not expect this from them. They are a self-respecting people, a self-respecting component of the South African people. But why do they use Afrikaners to make such statements in this House? Of course it would upset the Afrikaner nation and cause discontent in its ranks. Of course our hon. Minister of Defence can say that there are those on that side of the House who hate Afrikaans.</p>

<p>But I want to go further and say that we have English-speaking people on this side of the House. Has this House ever heard them say that one may not be English if one wants to be a Nationalist? Of course not; they are self-respecting people, people that we also respect. We say to them: Retain your identity; just be good South Africans and endorse the policy of the National Party. I want to say here today. with the utmost firmness, that the disparagement of Afrikaner sentiment and Afrikanerhood has been one of the characteristics of the past session. And frequently &#x2026; I do not know whether I shall be allowed to use the word, and therefore I shall rather say that they frequently make use of Afrikaners. But. Sir, a further characteristic of this session was the way in which the hon. gentlemen on that side have incited the Coloureds and Bantu. I am perhaps using a very strong word, but in their speeches there was talk of &#x201C;frustration&#x201D; and &#x201C;where can the people be satisfied&#x201D;. It has now become necessary for us to ask each other a few relevant questions. We believe that South Africa is a multi-national country. The hon. the <span class="col_8887-8888" refersTo="page_1399"/>Minister, who spoke before me, again stated this very clearly. The National Party does not hesitate to say this anywhere. I have tried repeatedly in this House to get a reply from the United Party to the question of whether they believe that South Africa is a multi-national country.</p>

<p>No. Because the United Party conceals certain aspects, I want to know from that party whether this is not so. Of course they cannot say no, because the hon. member has just told me that they only believe in one people. These individuals also say that there is only one people. In their explanation of this policy they also use the following words (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Government of all races, by all races, for all races.</block>

<p>I now want to ask those hon. members: If they believe that there is only one people in South Africa, how could it be otherwise? There can surely be no greater immoral aspect in the world, if there is only one people, than to have first, second, third and fourth class citizens that cannot jointly constitute the Government of this country. They surely know that is their policy. They do, it is true, have a retarded policy with which to reach their objective, but matters will be speeded up a great deal once they come into power. The hon. members surely know that they have to say exactly the same things as the Progressive Party. They say there is one people, and if there is one people there can only be one Parliament, and if there is only one Parliament all the voters must be given equal treatment in that Parliament. After all, we are living in the year 1972 and cannot go back to old ideas. The National Party, on the other hand, has a very clear standpoint. It says we are not one people. We are different peoples and therefore we can be separate. Therefore each people has its own Parliament; that is why we are giving each of the Bantu peoples a separate homeland where they can develop themselves into a people. And we are going to help them. That is our policy.</p>

<p>Of course they are being developed by a parallel basis. Why not? The Coloureds have control of everything in the world that relates to Coloureds. The Whites have control of everything that relates to Whites. What is wrong with that? If some matters perhaps do overlap at some spots, they surely know that this is settled by authority. This is not authority that rests on conquest or other aspects, but authority that rests on achievement. What can be more ennobling and less frustrating than the policy of the National Party? It is surely a fine policy; it <span class="col_8889-8890" refersTo="page_1400"/>is surely an honest policy, a policy with which the party can look the world in the face and say &#x201C;I am not afraid of you.&#x201D; But then the hon. members opposite must come along and tell us what their policy is. They must consequently tell us whether their policy is that of the Progressives, that of the National Party or no policy at all. Unfortunately it is no policy at all. It is a mere obsessive fantasy from time to time. I cannot neglect to refer to the conduct of the hon. Opposition. The results of those two elections, one after the other, completely stunned them. They tried to follow the same path here in Parliament as they followed in the election. They thought it was wonderful. Then came Brakpan No. 1 to take them further along that path and give them greater courage. Then their big mouths betrayed them, as they have so many times in the past. The Opposition then sat in this House as if they could be taking over the Government the next day or the day after, speaking uninterruptedly of how they were going to constitute their Government when their turn came to do so.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. DE K. MAREE</person>:</from>

<p>That is where they made the mistake of their lives. The people never realized that in actual fact there was such a possibility, and I also think there never really was such a possibility. However, they presented it so realistically that the people probably believed in such a possibility. The people consequently turned, and then we had Oudtshoorn. It was a result such as we have never had in any year in any by-election. Clearly and unequivocally it was apparent that the people did not want them as an alternative Government. Then came Brakpan No. 2 and what happened? Exactly the same thing. The people of South Africa told them that if their mouths are really that big and if there really is a danger of their obtaining a United Party Government, they would vote the United Party completely out of existence in that election. That was the moral of this Session. Immediately afterwards we heard the United Party growing more silent. I have been sitting here now for a long time, but I have not heard any Opposition speaker even once speaking of &#x201C;when we are in power&#x201D; and &#x201C;when we come into power&#x201D;. Of course not, because it would be foolish of them to say so now. The people would laugh themselves to death.</p>

<p>During this Session we also had a situation that caused one great anxiety, i.e. the conduct of some of our youth in South Africa. It was the conduct of young people who were bent on trying to overthrow the existing situation and the existing order by means of anarchism. I like our young people very much, and I have a great deal of respect for them, but I think that if they are mislead they must be set right. It is consequently the unmistakable duty of a Government and an Official Opposition, if it is a responsible Official Opposition, to tell those young people that these things cannot go on and that if they allow them to go on, very strong action will be taken against them. They must be told the way a parent would tell his own child: &#x201C;My child, I love you very much, but if you continue as you are now doing I shall have to take very serious action; I will have to be very strict with you.&#x201D; Then we had a debate here, a debate that was absolutely shocking for the way in which the Opposition acquitted itself of its task. It was an absolutely &#x201C;yes, but&#x201D; attitude, a sloppy policy. If they think the country will consider them, with so much spunklessness, as an alternative Government, I want to tell them they are being very funny and that they have very strange ideas. We could still, if we wanted to become liberal, regard the Progressive Party as an Opposition, because we at least know where they are heading. They are taking us straight to our ruin, and they say as much. But those hon. members are also taking us straight to our ruin, but they do not say so. That is the difference between the two. With the two Opposition parties we are on exactly the same road, but only one of them tells one, while the other one tries to conceal it and to mislead the people into believing the things that suit them.</p>

<p>I now want to refer to an argument used by a very prominent member of that side of the House. I am referring to the argument of the hon. member for Durban North. He says the young people came to him. He then took a certain pamphlet and asked them: &#x201C;Do you know about this pamphlet? These are ugly things you are stating here, not so. You are now surely advocating complete anarchy.&#x201D; He says those young students then said: &#x201C;But we know nothing about that pamphlet.&#x201D; Sir, what does this mean? It means one of two <span class="col_8891-8892" refersTo="page_1401"/>things: Either those students told him a lie, and he was soft enough to swallow it; or, alternatively, those young students are not acting on their own behalf, but at the instigation of forces backing them up, people who are not young people at our universities, but who are engaged in anarchy by egging the people and the youth on to commit that anarchy. Otherwise, how did they chance to know so exactly what the youth would be doing, where to be with their pamphlets in order to distribute them? Come, the hon. member for Pinelands can tell me. In other respects he is a friendly man. Does he not think it possible that those people knew that the students would be taking such action at that moment? They have nothing to do with each other. They are completely aloof from each other. But the moment those students came to stand here in Parliament Street and demonstrate, those people were on the spot to distribute pamphlets of that nature. A wonderful combination of circumstances! A wonderful naivety on the part of the Opposition, particularly on the part of a legal man like the hon. member for Durban North, to accept without any more ado that those people did not know what would happen! They did not know of that policy. I am now prepared to leave it to you to accept one of the two statements. Either the young people knew about that, and told lies, and now strong action must be taken against them; or the young people did not know about it and are under the whip of agitators that are not students, but foreign agitators who are disrupting the order in South Africa and abusing our boys and girls at our universities. If that is the case, has this Opposition not obviously proved itself too weak as a Government for this country?</p>

<p>But. Sir, I feel very heartsore about their conduct in connection with our Police. Today those people are positioned on our borders to protect us against terrorists. Sir, some of them have already given their lives. Some of them have already died for this country there on the borders. Others are still there, subject to great dangers every day. I think we owe them some thanks.</p>
