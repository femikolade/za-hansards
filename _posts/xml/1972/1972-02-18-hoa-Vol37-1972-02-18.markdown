<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>Yesterday evening, when I said here that the average butcher handled six sheep and three-quarters of a carcase of beef, the hon. member for Colesberg told me that it could not be and that I knew it was not true. Thereupon I told the hon. member for Colesberg that I would produce the proof to him today. Now I want to refer him to the annual report of the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing of June 1970, the latest report, and I want to refer to page 50. There they give the numbers of animals slaughtered. In the controlled areas 6 244 000 sheep were slaughtered and in the uncontrolled areas 2 518 841. This gives a total of 8 762 973 sheep slaughtered. The number of cattle slaughtered was 1 480 305. If you turn to page 54 of the report you will see that there were 2 931 butchers in the controlled areas 2 518 841. This gives a total of uncontrolled areas. To make it easy for the hon. member for Colesberg, if you divide the 8,7 million sheep slaughtered by the 5 922 butchers, you find that each slaughtered 1 479 sheep a year, and if you divide that by 12, you find that 123 were slaughtered each month, and if you divide that by 4, you find that 30 were slaughtered each week, and if you divide that by 5, you get 6 a day.</p>

<speech by="#van_den_heever">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>If you make the same little calculation in regard to cattle you arrive at approximately one a day. Sir, I am not going to ask the hon. member for Colesberg to apologize. He was so astounded at these figures that he could not believe them, but now that he knows them, I want to ask him whether he is going to do something about this Minister of Agriculture, who has ruined the consumer and the farmer. What is he going to do about it&#x003F; Because I know how near to his heart the farming community was in the days before he lost his feeling for them.</p>

<p>Sir, I was pointing out last night what had led to devaluation, that we find ourselves with a deficit of R1 350 million on the balance of payments, an inflation rate of 6,9 per cent and a growth rate of less than 4 per cent. I mentioned the reason. It is an obsession with that side of the House to slow down the economy of South Africa. This is supposed to be the only way in which they can combat inflation. They define inflation as a situation where there is too much money for too few goods. But, after all, if there is too much money for too few goods, there are two ways open to you.</p>

<p>You can increase the goods by encouraging the farmer, the producer, the industrialist to produce more. Then there will be more goods on the market and they will become cheaper, and this is the policy of the United Party. It is as simple as that. But the National Party says that if there is too much money for too few goods you must withdraw the money from <span class="col_1335-1336" refersTo="page_0685"/>the people. But then you lower the standard of living of the population and you impoverish the population and then, of course, you also lower the growth rate. In this way the people of South Africa have been bled to death by the hon. the Minister of Finance over the past seven years; because what methods has he applied to combat inflation&#x003F; In the first place he has reduced bank credit. But if you reduce bank credit you inhibit the industrialists and the farmers, for they cannot produce because they cannot obtain the capital to produce. And you have an increase in population, and you are producing a relatively smaller amount of goods, and if there are fewer goods on the market they become more expensive, not cheaper. This is what has happened. And you slow down your growth rate, and that is why it is as low as it is. Now, after seven years, the hon. the Minister of Finance is also discovering this, for the first time. Now he has at least discovered that there are unsatisfactory aspects in having a ceiling on bank credit. But how the industrialists and the farmers of South Africa have had to suffer in the past five years!</p>

<p>A second step which the hon. the Minister then took was to increase taxation. How can you combat inflation by increasing taxation&#x003F; Taxation is the largest single factor in any person&#x2019;s cost of living. If you increase taxation, surely you are raising the cost of living; you are not lowering it, and you are inhibiting expansion because you are depriving the industrialist and the farmer of the incentive to produce more, and that is why our growth rate has dropped to its present level. And then the hon. the Minister came forward with the third point and he increased interest rates.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>Fine.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_den_heever">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says &#x201C;Fine&#x201D;. Is it fine to increase interest rates, to ruin the farming community&#x003F; That hon. Minister has increased interest rates. If you increase the interest rates, surely you are once again inhibiting production, because why should a man invest and expand if he gets these high interest rates without doing anything&#x003F; And how can you lower the cost of living when every farmer has a mortgage bond on his farm and every house owner has a mortgage bond on his house&#x003F; By increasing the interest rates, surely you are hitting him below the belt. Then you are increasing the cost of living; you are not lowering it. How can you lower the cost of living by enriching the rich man, the man who gets that high interest rate, and by impoverishing the poor man who has to pay it&#x003F;</p>

<p>Sir, this is how the people of South Africa have had to suffer. But have they really combated inflation&#x003F; The rate of inflation was 2 per cent from 1960 to 1964. From 1964 to 1969 it was 3,6 per cent and last year it rose to 4,3 per cent, and now it is as high as 6,9 per cent. But still not satisfied, obsessed with this idea of withdrawing money and impoverishing the people, what did he do on 18th June, 1969&#x003F; He said that if we wanted to intensify the fight against inflation we had to drain the money out of South Africa, and he encouraged the investors to send their money overseas. The money must leave the country. Instead of using the money for our infrastructure, for increased growth, he wanted to get rid of the country&#x2019;s money, and in the meantime, just in passing, he ruined the share market as well. [Laughter.]</p>

<p>Yes, they may laugh&#x2014;to them it is a big joke&#x2014;but I want to say that the man who saved in this country is ruined. When, do you think, will those people ever get that money back&#x003F; But the hon. members on the other side laugh. It is as the hon. the Minister said at the time. What did he say&#x003F; He said: &#x201C;What does it matter, because the people who have lost their money are the typists and the clerks.&#x201D; They had no business to invest in the industries of the country. The typist and the clerks had no business to do so&#x003F; This is the feeling the hon. the Minister has for the man in the street. No, the typist and the clerk do not have the right to invest; this is reserved for the 400 people who became millionaires overnight. [Interjections.] But then, in August, he reintroduced exchange control. Now if he was right in June, could he have been right in August&#x003F; [Interjections.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>To summarize the whole attitude of the hon. the Minister I want to quote from a speech he made in the Senate on 15th June, 1967&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1337-1338" refersTo="page_0686"/>Now I want to put it clearly that we are living in a time of rising rates of interest &#x2026; The rise in the rates of interest is due to the fact that money is now becoming scarcer on one side. That shows that our measures to control inflation are beginning to take effect. That is what we wanted &#x2026; High rates of interest are eventually their own cure, for when the rates of interest reach a certain level &#x2026; at which the entrepreneur, in view of the uncertainty of the future awaiting him and because of the higher price he has to pay for money and because of the scarcity of his own funds because his money is taken from him by way of taxes and loan levies, he reaches a stage where he thinks twice whether he should start a new enterprise or not. That is what we want&#x2014;a slower expansion of new enterprises.</block>

<p>In other words, he made it his object to smother the economy to death. [Interjections.] And he has succeeded remarkably well, because what entrepreneur will invest when he can get 11 per cent or 12 per cent on his capital without doing anything&#x003F; But has he combated inflation&#x003F; The rate of inflation is higher than ever before in the history of South Africa. What he has done is to ruin the farming community of South Africa. The farmers now owe R1 340 million, R400 million more than in 1969. Mr. Van Wyk, the chairman of the National Woolgrowers&#x2019; Association, says that the farmers are paying out more money in interest than they are making.</p>

<p>The railwayman cannot live; already there are demands for higher wages. Last year we had a deficit of R788 million on the balance of payments and this has now increased to R1 350 million. Last year our growth rate was 5,3 per cent, and this after we had had an average growth rate of 7 per cent during the sixties. At the moment the growth rate is under 4 per cent. Our imports have increased by 28 per cent, but our exports have dropped by 5 per cent. We have nothing to export! [Interjections.] We have no manufactured goods to export. [Interjections.]</p>

You cannot get bricks for building a house. Young people cannot get houses. But the hon. the Minister of Community Development says: No, but people&#x2019;s houses are too luxurious; they must live in R6 000 houses. He, however, can spend R16 800 in public money on making his luxurious house still more luxurious.

<block name="quote">Prevent a catastrophe. The dramatic restrictions of recent months have led to a wave of bankruptcies such as after Sharpeville.

<p>Mr. Speaker, that hon. member said in his wild fantasizing that the hon. the Minister had smothered the economy to death. I think the hon. member has talked it to death. If ever you want to know of a man who has talked it to death in this House in the shortest possible time, he is that man; he has talked it stone-dead. I do not know where he stands either. Last year he told us his father had taught him to lay down his Afrikanerhood.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>Even better! &#x2014; To lay down his Afrikaner nationhood. His father taught him that he should ask the English to lay down their nationhood. As far as I know, the Afrikaners have not decided as yet to lay down their nationhood, nor have the English. Where does he stand now&#x003F; Where is the hon. member floating about now&#x003F; He tried to speak about growth, but he is a real bush economist. I want to say without any further ado what I have to say to the hon. member. Yesterday afternoon he devoted only a few minutes to a few butcheries and then proceeded to deal with the economy. He elaborated on growth. I listened with an open mind to the hon. member and I want to say in all honesty that he did not have the foggiest idea of what he was talking about. I want to teach him a few lessons. The policy makers do not look at the real growth achievement, because a growth achievement has no influence on the gross domestic product. This is an economic law and an economic truth.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Now there we have a bush economist.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#greyling">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>The growth achievement has to be measured in terms of the growth potential. Hon. members opposite do not realize this. One cannot speak of a direct growth achievement and then proceed to measure the gross domestic product in terms of that direct growth achievement. This is the mistake which hon. members opposite make, <i>inter alia,</i> the hon. member for Parktown, whose financial thinking I respect very much. My proof that they make this mistake is to be found in the fact that they link their growth rate cry directly to capital and labour. Surely capital and labour are production factors which determine the future growth potential. The growth achievement of the Republic of South Africa can be measured only in terms of its growth potential. The growth potential of any country is not a factor in respect of which one can speculate wildly. It is a process which is subject to many factors. Specifically in South Africa it is subject to certain definite socio-political factors, a framework within which the growth rate has to be determined. The policy maker may not allow himself to be misled by wild cries of greater growth and of &#x201C;Bring in the labour&#x201D;. He has to be guided by the socio-political framework in which he moulds his policy. This is the principal <span class="col_1341-1342" refersTo="page_0688"/>mistake hon. members opposite make. That hon. member does not have any notion of what I am speaking about now. From this fact, from the vital difference between us and hon. members on the opposite side of this House, one cannot get away. Theirs is a capital mentality. They suffer pre-eminently from a capital mentality. I have never, in all the years from way back, seen a Party and an Opposition so possessed by a mentality centralized on an idea of capital as that party is. As yet it has not built any principles into its whole vision of the economy. If one listens closely, one discovers that everything they say here is instinctive. It is not the result of a policy based on principles. It is simply rough and ready and speculative, to say the very best one can of it. I want to reply to that by mentioning two examples to hon. members on the opposite side. These two examples I take from the most recent history. From 1959 to 1963 we had a period of slow growth. From 1964 to 1968 we had a period of what may be called rapid economic growth. What happened in those two periods&#x003F; Let us compare the period of slow growth to the period of rapid growth. In the period of slow growth from 1959 to 1963, consumption expenditure of the people as a whole, including Government expenditure, came to an amount of R2 000 million. As against that consumption expenditure increased to R4 400 million in the period from 1964 to 1968, the period of rapid growth. What was the result of that&#x003F; In the period of slow growth we had nearly R800 million left for the redemption of foreign debts, whereas, in the period of rapid growth from 1964 to 1968, with increased consumption expenditure, we did not have one cent left for the redemption of foreign debts. What was the result&#x003F; The result was that we became more and more dependent on foreign capital. It is not a blessing to any economy to lean chiefly on the inflow of foreign capital. This is what those hon. members fail to see, because capital, from whichever quarter it may come and whatever its corrupting or economic influence may be, has no meaning for them. To them there is no sense in capital movement. They attach no value to capital; to them it is solely a profit factor. The profit motive is the only light in which they see capital. I repeat: Rather give me the slow, controlled and managed growth period, such as that of 1959 to 1963, when we could save something from the net surplus for redeeming our foreign debts and for making us less dependent on foreign capital, than the period of rapid growth such as that we had in 1964 to 1968. I would much rather walk into a bank manager&#x2019;s office to ask him for money without my hat in my hand than with my hat in my hand. But hon. members opposite want us to walk hat in hand for all time.</p>

<p>I want to mention a second fact in connection with these two growth periods. Hon. members opposite speak ceaselessly, constantly and <i>ad nauseam</i> of growth and want labour to be brought in. Growth requires capital. I want to ask them bluntly where all the capital is to come from to make South Africa grow as they suggest here&#x003F; Last year, I think, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition spoke here of a growth rate of 11 per cent.</p>

<p>In the past decade we maintained a steady growth rate of approximately 5,5 per cent. This compares extremely favourably with standards abroad. We struggle to acquire capital. As yet I have not heard one of them say that we should have a limited growth achievement. It is a wild speculation about growth and the stronger their vision of capital growth, the stronger and the louder the cry: Bring growth and bring labour. From where&#x003F; From the ranks of the Bantu! What kind of labour&#x003F;&#x2014;Unskilled! To train an unskilled labourer costs money.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#greyling">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>I promise the hon. member that I shall come to that in a moment. As I have said, it costs money. If one wants to train a labourer, he has to be taken, as they want him to be taken, to a metropolitan area. They have never calculated the cost. It costs virtually R800 today to bring one man into a metropolitan area where he will share in the whole infrastructure. They do not realize this. These are not factors which they take into account when they speak of labour. They are guilty of wild speculation. I want to say, however much those hon. members may shout, that the economy of South Africa will continue to rest on the shoulders of the White man for years to come, because the labourers they want to bring in cannot be obtained <span class="col_1343-1344" refersTo="page_0689"/>at the moment within the ranks of the Bantu under our circumstances. This is the fact of the matter.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>The real shortage of manpower does not exist on the lower unskilled or semi-skilled levels, but on the higher technological levels. These people necessarily have to be drawn from the ranks of the Whites. The policymaker has to make sure of these facts, as the hon. the Minister of Finance does in fact do. He cannot allow himself to be led by wild speculations or by a mentality which does not fit into the socio-political framework of the country. He should allow himself to be led by a prospect, a long-term view, which must be projected on the growth potential of the country, and in his calculations he must include the amount of capital required to guide the growth potential of the country in such a way that a steady growth rate can be maintained. We have the best of evidence, i.e. that we have had a steady growth rate in South Africa over the past 20 years. The growth rate has not been subject to the fluctuations there were in the 1930&#x2019;s and in the years preceding 1930. In consideration of the fact that our growth rate was a steady one and was based on a projection of our growth potential, there was the guarantee which proved to be a fact, i.e. that we could maintain this steady growth rate. The hon. member should kindly distinguish between the growth rate and the growth potential.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as I stand here, I speak from a strong fortress, from a position of strength. This position of strength consists in the fact that I am surrounded here by a number of characters who, in total, constitute the character of the people. When I look at the number of characters sitting on the opposite side, I cannot picture to myself an organized, purposeful and single-minded people. From this position of strength I am able to speak on a high moral level and a high political and intellectual level. Into this side there is built, and here I find, the same characteristics which were to be found in the old Roman Empire in the days when it used to be strong.</p>

<p>Yes, in the days when the Roman Empire was strong. That hon. member does not know what I am speaking about. He does not have any idea. That was the time when each individual in the Roman Empire still clung to the stoic principles of austerity and chastity. When they used to speak of the fortress of the eagle. Those hon. members sit in the fortress of the vultures. I speak here from a position of strength because here sits a party that holds its head high in the midst of a world which demands that it must crawl and that it must bend to what they want to do. I speak here from a position of strength, because this party has always been true to its principles since the time of its founding. I should like to read to hon. members from the constitution of the National Party of the Transvaal of 1915. It is the principles, the constitution, the statute of the National Party. I just want to read a few things to the hon. members and they can test those things against the National Party of today. I quote (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The party acknowledges the necessity of cultivating a powerful realization of national self-dependence, and declares emphatically that it puts the interests of the Union and its population above the interests of any other country and people.</block>

<p>The position from which I speak is a position of strength, and I am pleased that I am able to do so. I am also pleased because the trumpet against the dangers threatening our country, has been sounded from these ranks. The trumpet has been sounded. I want to read to hon. members from Ezekiel 33, from verse 1 to verse 6&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Again the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, when I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of the coasts, and set him for their watchman: If when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet and warn their people; Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head. He heard the sound of the trumpet and took no warning; his blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul.</block>

<p><span class="col_1345-1346" refersTo="page_0690"/>But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman&#x2019;s hand.</p>

<p>From this fortress from which I speak, the watchman, our Prime Minister, has repeatedly sounded the trumpet. It is an honour to me to speak from such a fortress, but they who should have heard the trumpet, have made a mockery of it. They twist his words, they make political capital from his words and, like the vulture with its bare neck and its small head, they peck deep into the carrion. To me it is a pleasure to speak from a fortress such as this.</p>

<p>Yesterday the hon. member for Houghton told me she had spent many pleasant hours, in fact, more pleasant hours, with Kaunda than with Cas Greyling. I want to refer the hon. member to the old German proverb which says rather with the wolf or wild boar in the forest than with a quarrelsome woman in one house. [Interjections.] I imagine to myself what pleasant feelings washed over her lithe body and her evil political spirit when she was in the company of Kaunda. I can well imagine this because she was satisfying her desire&#x2014;her biggest political amorous desire&#x2014;to see realized before her eyes &#x201C;Black is beautiful&#x201D;. Mr. Speaker, pleasant hours! If he is a &#x201C;Black beauty&#x201D;, then, upon my word, I am a &#x201C;White beauty&#x201D;! They say love is blind, Sir. I accept that, because I have experienced this, and everyone ought to experience it. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I said a moment ago that I was speaking here from a fortress of strength. This fortress from which I speak is fertile soil from which a strong people may be born. This party of ours is not the only fertile soil in this country from which a great people is to be born. There is another factor in this country which can exercise much influence. I want to tell you today in all sincerity that we cannot build a great people just out of the party alone. We need the support of our Press. In saying this I do not want to reproach anyone. I do not want to offend anyone; I do not want to offend the Press, but I just want to say that our Press has a duty in this respect &#x2014;a bounden duty. When readiness to serve stands in the sign of commercial gain, then it is the labour which, as the Preacher says, one will still come to hate. As the Roman used to be before the fall of the Roman Empire, when he leaned on and derived his strength from virtue, from moral austerity and moral integrity, and in that way offered himself, the individual, to his people and to the authorities, at that time the Roman Empire had strong foundations. But when they started an exchange transaction through which they allowed greed to take the place of austerity, when they started exchanging those characteristics, the typical stoic principles, at that time the Roman Empire started to collapse. They may laugh, but I know I am right. I know that the eternal values are the ones on which a people may become and remain strong. Sir, let us have no illusions; severe financial tests await the people in the future. No, it is nothing; it is all vanity, as the Preacher said; all is vanity if you take something as your due. Here the greatest test is awaiting the people, and it is the test which is related to and which will have to be supported by the people&#x2019;s moral strength and its integrity. The test will be whether the people exchange those principles for commercial gain. This lust which is openly advertised in our Press is eating into our people. I speak on behalf of thousands when I say this. I am serious when I say I speak on behalf of thousands of my people. A resistance is building up in our people. They will take this up with the National Party in the future; I know they will come with requests in this regard to the National Party, because in the eyes of the people the National Party is the fortress of moral strength and of moral conviction. They will come to the party.</p>

<p>I ask the Press to adhere to those principles which are of value to a people and which make a people strong. I ask the Press this morning not to have commercial obligingness as their prime consideration, but to adhere, along with the National Party; to facts instead of speculation, to adhere to austerity instead of to the stimulation of lust, to adhere to what is of eternal value and cannot be scattered about like the wind.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to conclude by saying this: The eagle is a noble bird. Its body is covered by feathers. Its habitat is the high mountains. It soars in the blue sky. Throughout the ages it has been the symbol and the emblem of fighting forces and of countries. This is the fortress of the eagle. The neck of the vulture is bare, its head is small and its feet are long. It has no habitat; that, that side of this House, is the fortress of the vulture. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, early last year I received, from an anonymous source, Dr. J. P. A. Lochner&#x2019;s analysis of the pilchard resources of South-West Africa, dated November, 1970. The findings were that the resources of South-West Africa were still collapsing, just as in the case of California and the West Coast, and that the pilchard catch of 1970 was once again within 1 per cent of the theoretical collapse curve which Dr. Lochner had forecast; thirdly, that it could be expected that in 1971 approximately 365 000 tons of pilchards would be caught off South-West Africa.</p>

<p>&#x2020;In this report it is said that the critical catch for 1971 was 257 000 tons, and Dr. Lochner warned that it would be dangerous to exceed a tonnage of 200 000.</p>

<p>*Sir, this was in 1970. What was the pilchard quota allocated for 1971&#x003F; It was 298 000 tons, 40 000 tons more than Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s critical figure and 100 000 tons more than the recommended figure. What was the pilchard catch last year&#x003F; It was 295 613 tons, according to the reply to Question No. 82 this year, 3 000 tons less than the quota, and the total catch of the <i>Willem Barendsz</i> was almost 90 000 tons. The above figures were given to me officially as a member of the House of Assembly. <span class="col_1349-1350" refersTo="page_0692"/>Sir, also anonymously, I recently received Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s report of October, 1971 as well, and according to his report the 1971 pilchard catch was 311171 tons, as reported by the Division of Fisheries, and not 295 613 tons as given to me officially.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Then Dr. Lochner mentions in his report of last year the <i>Willem Barendsz&#x2019;s</i> pilchard catch of 56 304 tons, according to figures given to him by the fishing industry in his capacity as a member of the Fish Commission, in other words, a total catch, according to his report, of 367 475 tons; i.e. within 1 per cent of his estimate of 365 000 tons. But according to paragraph 3 of Question No. 82 this year, I received the following reply: That Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s prediction was 365 000 tons&#x2014;that is correct&#x2014;while the actual catch was 295 613 tons. In other words, the impression is deliberately created that Dr. Lochner made a tremendous mistake of almost 70 000 tons, and, by implication, that his theory is absolutely unreliable.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Sir, I want to say that the <i>Willem Barendsz</i> figures were not given in the official answer to me. Very well, perhaps that was a mistake, but that would substantially have reduced the error in calculation alleged to have been made by Dr. Lochner. But worse still, and what is more important, the catch figures given to me were different from the catch figures given officially to Dr. Lochner. He claimed that they were given to him by the Director of Sea Fisheries. I could hardly believe. Sir, that a man of Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s reputation would falsify figures in his report and use spurious figures, so I wrote to him and asked him what was the source of his official figures.</p>

<p>*Sir, I received this letter, dated 14th February, from Dr. Lochner. Dr. Lochner wrote (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I can assure you that the catch figures and correspondence with my prediction of the above-mentioned report, which you have obtained, are correct. In order to confirm my data, I include photostat copies of the following documents herewith.</block>

<p>&#x2020;He then gives me a photostat letter, dated 19th October, from the Director of Sea Fisheries, Dr. De Jager, to Dr. Lochner, and there the total figure given for the pilchards catch in South-West Africa was 311 171 tons, but the official figure given to me in this House was 295 613 tons. He then annexes a further document, which contains the official factory ship figures given to the members of the Fish Commission, figures which show that the <i>Willem Barendsz</i> catch was 56 304 tons, as depicted in Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s report of 1971. The two figures total 367 475 tons, not 295 613 tons.</p>

<p>*Sir, it is a very important thing I am saying here this morning, and I am saying it without fear of contradiction: The reply I received in this House as a Member of the House of Assembly, was deliberately given to me erroneously.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>I withdraw it, Mr. Speaker.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Those figures omitted the factory ship figures, and I say that a deliberate attempt is being made by some person or persons in authority, either with or without ministerial knowledge, publicly to discredit Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s theory and to throw doubt on the accuracy of his figures. And this, Sir, is a very serious charge indeed.</p>

<p>*What is going on&#x003F; Here we have a well-known researcher who has developed a theory about the extent of marine resources, something of world importance, a systematic analysis according to which control can in fact be exercised over marine resources, a theory which has not yet been accepted or tested by the Government. Let us take a look at the history of this theory. It was first handed to Minister Haak early in 1969, but late in 1968 Dr. Lochner had given it to the Fish Commission, the one appointed by Minister Jan Haak. The terms of reference of the Fish Commission were, <i>inter alia,</i> to inquire into and report upon the extent of the living marine resources of South Africa and South-West Africa. This Fish Commission received Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s theory more than three years ago. The Fish Commission appointed a subcommittee consisting of Prof. C. A. du Toit and Mr. R. Stander in order to <span class="col_1351-1352" refersTo="page_0693"/>evaluate the theory. The Minister himself told me last year that two professors at Stellenbosch had been appointed to evaluate the work on behalf of this subcommittee. As far as I know, no report has ever been made on their findings and the subcommittee concerned has not reported either. But in the meanwhile Dr. Lochner made predictions for 1969, 1970 and 1971 which were proved to be correct to within 1 per cent every year. Incidentally, together with the hon. members for Langlaagte and Vasco, Prof. C. A. du Toit has been a director of Suiderland since 1966 (with 2 000 shares). Who were the other directors of Suiderland when that company was established&#x003F; Mr. P. G. S. Neethling, Mr. A. P. du Preez, Mr. Bailey Bekker, Mr. J. A. Delport of Port Elizabeth, Adv. D. P. de Villiers, Prof. C. A. du Toit, Mr. S. Frank, the then member for Omaruru, Mr. P. J. Malherbe of Windhoek, Mr. P. A. Meyer (the hon. member for Vasco), the late Mr. P. R. R&#x00F6;rich, and the hon. member for Langlaagte. Sir, I understand that Suiderland is a company which has a large investment in the fishing industry, including a direct and an indirect interest in Buitesee. I also understand that all the members of the board of directors in Suiderland received preference shares in Buitesee. Buitesee is the A. P. du Preez-Ovenstone factory ship company and in 1968 their factory ship, the <i>Suiderkruis,</i> together with the <i>Willem Barendsz,</i> took 640 000 tons of pilchards from the South-West African territorial waters and fishing zone, which is more than is available to the entire fishing industry at present. The <i>Suiderkruis</i> made a profit of millions of rands. In 1969, the following year, the <i>Suiderkruis</i> and the <i>Willem Barendsz</i> received a joint quota of half a million tons. In actual fact they caught 530 000 tons.</p>

<p>The other subcommittee member is Mr. R. Stander. He is a consulting engineer serving on the board of Fishcor and has various interests in the fishing industry. If this subcommittee had accepted Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s theory and recommendations, the factory ships would have had to leave, which would have meant tremendous losses for the companies concerned. Could it therefore have been expected of Prof. C. A. du Toit to make such a recommendation&#x003F; I now come to a pertinent question, Sir. I should like to ask whether the Chairman of the Fish Commission knew that Prof. C. A. du Toit had interests in the factory ships. When I asked the hon. the Minister last year why Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s theory had not been tested, Minister Muller&#x2019;s reply was that agreement could not be reached with Dr. Lochner on who should test his theory and the impression was created by the Minister that Dr. Lochner was refusing to have his theory tested. But is that true&#x003F; According to an article in <i>Die Burger</i> of 4th November, last year, Dr. Lochner wrote that the impression which had been created in the House of Assembly was not correct and that he was quite prepared to submit his theory to persons, provided they could understand it and did not have a personal interest in the matter. Sir, I cannot believe that there are not such people in the Republic who can understand his theory and who do not have interests in the fishing industry either. On the opposite side, yes, but not outside! In reply to Question No. 85 this year, the Minister told me that he had recently appointed four persons to test Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s theory. They are Dr. C. R. Jansen, Mr. S. du Plessis, Dr. H. J. Goldner and Dr. M. Milner.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Now I want to ask the hon. the Minister a simple question. Is Dr. Lochner satisfied that these four people appointed to the subcommittee to test his theory are people falling in the category of not having an interest in the fishing industry and being able to understand his theory&#x003F; I also want to ask this question: Is the person who, in an official reply, gave me different figures from the figures given to Dr. Lochner in an official letter, the same person responsible for assembling this subcommittee to test Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s theory&#x003F; I sincerely hope that this is not the case.</p>

<p>I want to move on briefly to the new quotas for 1972. The new S.W.A.&#x2014;quotas of 338 000 tons are far in excess of those recommended by Dr. Lochner. In the 1971 report he says that he expects 225 000 tons of pilchards to be taken this year, but to exceed 150 000 tons is to cross what he calls the critical line. We have this situation, Sir, that the Government has given excessive quotas for each of the last three years in the face of warnings from Dr. Lochner, who has forecast the total collapse of the pilchard industry. He has also forecast the actual catch accurately for each of those three years. Can it still be assumed, Sir, that this prominent scientist is talking nonsense&#x003F; The Government has not tested his theory. I do not think it need be tested any further because if it has proved <span class="col_1353-1354" refersTo="page_0694"/>itself right in practice for three years, there is no need to test it any further. Unless this Government can prove that Dr. Lochner has fabricated his theories and his calculations after the event, the Government must accept full responsibility for the entire pilchard industry collapse, if it takes place, because it will have taken place as the result of the granting of excessive quotas in spite of warnings from Dr. Lochner, and no one else besides the Government is to blame. This industry is worth R50 million per year to the inhabitants of South-West Africa. I want to ask: On what scientific basis have the 1972 quotas been issued&#x003F; Who has made the final decision&#x003F; Was it the majority report signatories to the Fish Commission&#x2019;s interim report last year, Mr. C. G. du Plessis, Mr. M. C. Botma (the hon. member for Omaruru), Prof. C. A. du Toit and Mr. R. Stander&#x003F; They were wrong in 1971. In the interim report at the end of 1970 they recommended a maximum annual catch of one million tons. What happened in 1971&#x003F; There was a catch of over 295 000 tons, according to the figures given to me, over 363 000 tons of other shoalfish and over 89 000 tons from the <i>Willem Barendsz,</i> a total of 750 000 tons, in other words, 250 000 tons less than they recommended, and 125 000 tons less than the quotas that were granted.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>I want to ask how these quotas were calculated. Were they based on the crash research programme last year&#x003F; They cannot be because the crash research programme said that the pilchard industry was under severe threat. Were they based on the further crash research programme now taking place&#x003F; They cannot be because what is now being researched has been researched for the last 25 years, and the strength of the marine resources still cannot be estimated with accuracy by existing methods except, it seems, by Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s theory.</p>

<p>*Mr. Speaker, it is well known that the Division of Sea Fisheries has no methods of determining safe catches. Who in the Division of Sea Fisheries determined scientifically that the pilchard resources of South-West Africa have a carrying capacity of 1 million tons&#x003F; The Deputy Minister, the Leader of the National Party in South-West Africa, was described in the <i>Financial Mail</i> in 1971 as being an &#x201C;obsessive conservationist who is in complete agreement with what Dr. Lochner propounds&#x201D;. Why, for safety&#x2019;s sake, did he not adhere to Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s figures&#x003F; Sir, any baboon can recommend that more quotas be allocated. The art is to determine where the safe limits are. Sir, what would the public of South-West Africa say, what would his reaction be, if the sardine resources of South-West, their second most important source of income, were ruined&#x003F; He, the Deputy Minister, has left his people in the lurch; he has not looked after their interests. And what would the inhabitants of Walvis Bay say if they knew that the decisive vote on the Fish Commission to expose the pilchard resources of South-West Africa to the danger of being destroyed, was that of their own representative, Mr. Botma&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. member for Omaruru is the same hon. member who met Minister Jan Haak on 10th March, 1970, at a secret meeting held in Room No. H.410 in the Forum Building, and he requested the appointment of a judicial commission of inquiry into the fishing industry of Walvis Bay because, according to him, there had been serious complaints of problems, corruption and bribery over many years.</p>

<p>But in this House, when I pleaded for a judicial commission, he remained completely silent. At that same meeting, you will remember, Sir, the hon. member for Omaruru said that the licences of the factory ships should be withdrawn and that land-based factories should receive them instead. He warned at the time that there would be reaction from South-West Africa; and it may be expected if it does happen. His own words were (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; a reaction of, let me put it very bluntly&#x2014;that yes, Aap du Preez is getting away with crime now; he did what he liked, and now the State is paying him because they can do nothing else to him.</block>

<p>On 4th February this year, only a few days ago, the Deputy Minister withdrew <span class="col_1355-1356" refersTo="page_0695"/>their licences and granted each of the two factory ships, the <i>Willem Barendsz</i> and the <i>Suiderkruis,</i> a land-based quota of 55 000 tons per year just as the hon. member for Omaruru had proposed on the occasion of the secret meeting. However, there is one very big difference: he said at the time that the factory ships should erect their own factories if they received a land-based quota, because the erection of factories would yield additional income for South-West Africa as well as more employment opportunities and other local benefits for the inhabitants of Walvis Bay. What does he say this morning, while he knows that the two factory ships&#x2019; quota of 55 000 tons must be processed by the existing industry at Walvis Bay, in other words, without any financial benefit to his own constituents&#x003F;</p>

<p>&#x2020;Now, Mr. Speaker, let me ask the hon. the Minister of Finance what he has to say about this &#x201C;compromise&#x201D;. After all, he was the one who flew to Windhoek in the first instance in 1966 to persuade the South-West African Executive Committee not to make a fuss about his granting of a factory-ship licence to the <i>Willem Barendsz.</i> After all, he was the one who thereafter granted two factory-ship licences to South Africans against the wishes of South-West Africa. Did he sit in the Cabinet and did he himself advocate this compromise that has now been reached or did he have the grace to recuse himself&#x003F;</p>

<p>Let me conclude this very sad saga with an absolutely inevitable ending. Hon. members who have been listening to what I have had to say will not be in the slightest bit surprised when they hear me say that this compromise solution to the factoryship problem whereby the factory ships get quotas without having the capital expenses of erecting factories, was advocated by none other than Prof. C. A. du Toit, a director of Suiderland and a member of the Fish Commission, on page 8, paragraph 17, of the majority report on the pilchard resource, dated August, 1970. Where will all this end&#x003F; The Government has granted licences and quotas to political pals and business buddies, as I have said before, and already they have had to subsidize the rock lobster industry in Port Nolloth. Now it has had to pay compensation for the withdrawal of the <i>Willem Barendsz</i> and the <i>Suiderkruis</i> licences, the compensation being in the form of land-based quotas. Next they will start, I forecast, with a boat withdrawal scheme that will cost the taxpayer millions. Patrolling, the carrying out of special crash research programmes, appointing special commissions, committees and subcommittees in South-West Africa and in the Republic have already cost hundreds of thousands of rands. The loss of income from the partial collapse of the South-West African and the West Coast fishing industries, resulting from greed and over-fishing, must run into countless millions. I have said before, I have said publicly, that the Government must subsidize a collapsing industry. I say this again today. Subsidize the industry if you must, but do not do so if your sole object is to permit continued over-exploitation and not to save the resource from extinction.</p>

<p>*Mr. Speaker, I shall conclude now. These marine resources belong to the nation and to posterity, not to the already too many people living on them. The resources which this Government has exposed to danger so recklessly and so carelessly, must be saved by the same Government.</p>

<p>I do not intend to follow up the hon. member for Simonstown&#x2019;s fish stories, except to say that he demonstrated the United Party&#x2019;s ability to occupy every available position at all times; and not only that, but also to carry out all kinds of manoeuvres. The hon. member who spoke before him quite strikingly referred to that party&#x2019;s &#x201C;vulture techniques&#x201D;. And you know, Sir, that there have recently been good rains throughout the length and breadth of our country, and consequently there is no food for the vultures. That is why there is such scant discussion of agriculture in this debate. When the vulture cannot play its role, the Opposition has something else that can play the role, like the hon. member &#x201C;who cries stinking fish&#x201D;, as one says in the English language. The hon. member dragged into this debate the names of honest people, such as Prof. C A. du Toit of Stellenbosch, who is an academician of high standing. I wonder whether the hon. member took the trouble to confirm, with Prof. du Toit himself, <span class="col_1357-1358" refersTo="page_0696"/>the allegations he made here this morning about the professor. He chooses this place to attack a person who cannot defend himself. But I believe that on a later occasion the hon. the Deputy Minister or the Minister will deal with him.</p>

<p>I should like to come back to the hon. member for Yeoville, who yesterday alleged here that a National Party pamphlet distributed in Brakpan is &#x201C;vile, sordid and mean beyond all description&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville is a man who lives in a glass house and he must be very careful when he makes this kind of accusation about what is being done by others. Unfortunately I do not have it at my disposal today, but I should like to read it to the House on some occasion. I could perhaps have it here on Monday. I shall continue speaking on Monday. I have a recording of what the hon. member said at Upington during the last election, and hon. members would shudder to hear what the hon. member said there out of earshot of the Press. The hon. member is someone who lives in a glass house and he must not come along and make statements of this kind, of &#x201C;vile, sordid and mean&#x201D;. I want to challenge the hon. member to prove to me whether any of the statements made here is untrue.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>The pamphlet brings facts to the fore. The hon. member there in the comer may consult with the hon. member for Yeoville about whether these facts are correct or not. The American Congress appointed a committee which in 1947 made a list of the 500 most important communists in the world. Forty-nine of them were in South Africa. Not one of them was in gaol. At that time the Soviet Union had an embassy staff in South Africa bigger than that of any other country. As in other countries of the world, we also know what their role here was. Their role was not to carry out diplomatic work, because there was nothing for them to do. They came to do other work. I want to say again that in no way do I accuse hon. members opposite of being communist sympathizers. However, I want to reproach them for having been too spineless to take action against communism when action should have been taken. The hon. member also spoke of Sam Kahn. In 1950 the National Party introduced legislation to fight communism. At that time I did not suspect hon. members opposite of being communist fellow-travellers either. Their problem, however, is that they want to be everything to all people at all times. They were too afraid they would offend people whose votes they could perhaps obtain. We have not forgotten that the Communist Party mouthpiece, the <i>Guardian</i>, wrote at the time of the 1948 election ordering members of the Communist Party <span class="col_1359-1360" refersTo="page_0697"/>to vote for members of the United Party where they were not nominating a candidate themselves. I think that is something of the background to the matter.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>Oh no. I think that was part of what lay behind the United Party&#x2019;s opposing vote when the Government passed legislation against communism in 1950. When legislation was introduced to unseat Mr. Sam Kahn, who sat here in the cross-benches, and Sam Kahn himself said before the commission of inquiry that he had in no way changed his views and had been and was a communist, the United Party said that he was not a communist and should remain here. These are the statements being made in this pamphlet, and now the hon. member for Yeoville says they are vile, sordid and mean.</p>

<p>I now come to Mr. Fred Cameson who was a member of the Provincial Council at the time. The United Party then played the same role, not because they were communist sympathizers, but because they were afraid of possibly losing the votes of people who did sympathize with them. They want to be everything to all people at all times. They played the same role when Mr. Solly Sacks was at issue. When the United Party was in power there was clear proof in their security documents that he was a communist. They say, however, that Solly Sacks was not a communist.</p>

<p>So could one run down the list of statements made in this pamphlet, statements the hon. member described in that language yesterday. I want to challenge the hon. member to prove an untruth in one of these statements or to prove what he said here yesterday, i.e. that the purport of this pamphlet is tantamount to the United Party supporting communism. The hon. member said this yesterday. However, in this pamphlet he will obtain no proof that the United Party is being reproached &#x2026;</p>

<p>No, the hon. member said that the pamphlet alleged that the United Party supported communism. The hon. member must remember that yesterday the hon. the Minister of Police said that he is very much like a buffoon. He and his party cause people to subsequently feel unhappy about his party&#x2019;s actions. According to the <i>Argus,</i> the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said at a meeting on 3rd November &#x201C;Mr. Vorster had misread the mood of the people of South Africa on the alleged suicide of Mr. Ahmed Timol&#x201D; in his demand for a judicial enquiry. I want to state this morning that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the members of his party underestimated the mood of the South African population in respect of terrorism and communist activities. As a result they transgressed by statements that gave justification for a paphlet such as this. On 1st November at a meeting in Durban the hon. member for Port Natal made a statement which was reported as follows in the <i>Star</i> of 2nd November:</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Eric Winchester, United Party M.P. for Port Natal, warned today that the Government may ultimately allow the Security Branch to turn its attention to members of the official Opposition.</block>

<p>When action is taken in the interests of the security of South Africa, the hon member for Port Natal and his party help the Police in such a way by insinuating that action might be taken against hon. members of the Opposition. [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, those words the hon. member addressed to me I shall cast back into his teeth by saying: &#x201C;He was talking nonsense&#x201D;. However, that is not the worst of it. Not only are suggestions sown amongst the population and the less educated nonwhite population of South Africa, to the effect that the motive of the Security Police is actually to counter free speech and exorcise opposition, but also to besmirch our country abroad. I now want to tell the hon. member for Port Natal, and the other hon. members who did the same things, that whether this was calculated to promote terrorism and communism or not, such action so perfectly fits the purpose of those seeking the subversion of South Africa&#x2019;s freedom. Go and read the documents and instructions of Bram Fischer. It would then be seen that he told his people how they should infiltrate organizations, how they should influence public feeling.</p>

<p>What else was the hon. member for Port Natal really doing&#x003F; I say again that it was perhaps not calculated, but in his undue haste to create feeling against this Government, he created a breeding ground, he cleared the field for those people seeking South Africa&#x2019;s downfall.</p>

<p>But the hon. member for Port Natal is not alone. There are probably greater minds than the hon. member for Port Natal on that side of the House. The hon. member for Durban North regarded it as his calling and his task, when action had to be taken by the Security Police in the interests of South Africa&#x2019;s security, to issue a statement which appeared in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 31st October in which he stated:</p>

<block name="quote">Rightly or wrongly, the man in the street has reached a state of mind where he strongly suspects that the detainees are being tortured in dark little rooms and fears that methods of the Gestapo have been used by the Security Police.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, no normal thinking South African can accept something like this. But the hon. member for Durban North thought fit to plant this in the thoughts of people who are perhaps less informed, people who are perhaps less educated. What would the result of this be amongst the Bram Fischer followers who received orders to provoke such a stimulus in order to clear the road for them&#x003F; Would Bram Fischer&#x2019;s followers have lamented over the utterances of the hon. member for Port Natal and the hon. member for Durban North, or would they have laughed up their sleeves about it&#x003F;</p>

<heading>COMMUNIST INFILTRATION INTO SOUTHERN AFRICA</heading>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House expresses its concern about the increasing infiltration of Communism into Southern Africa, as well as the increased military activities on the part of Russia and China as revealed by (a) terrorist action inspired by them and (b) activity in the air and at sea.</block>

<p>In looking at the map of the world, one will notice that the twentieth meridian, east of Greenwich, passes near Cape Agulhas. From that point it runs in a northerly direction to form the border between the Republic and South-West Africa. Further north it passes through Angola, past the Sudan, through Libya and from Benghazi across the Mediterranean Sea to the border between Greece and Albania. From that point it passes further north through Hungary, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia and Poland. Then it runs across the Baltic Sea and, passing through between Finland in the east and Sweden and Norway on the western side, it eventually links up the South Pole with the North Pole. That twentieth meridian is roughly the dividing line between the East and the West. It is roughtly the dividing line between two mighty ideologies opposing each other in the world. Geographically our location is amongst the most strategic ones; it is, to be specific, the southernmost point on that dividing line. In the course of history a great deal of blood has flowed on both sides of and backwards and forwards across this dividing line, and, if we follow the pattern of history, it seems as though in years to come much more blood will flow across that very same line. Because of our geographic location, our outspoken anticommunist attitude in South Africa and the level of development we have reached on the continent of Africa, South Africa is a much sought-after prize in the present world struggle. In looking at Africa to the north of us, we are immediately struck by the fact that more than half of the population of Africa is already under military r&#x00E9;gime. Incidentally, one wonders whether many of those people are not worse off than they were under the former colonial regimes.</p>

<p>Recently I conversed with a high-ranking person from an Oriental country. He told me something shocking about his own country. He said that there was one thing in his country to which he would never be able to become accustomed, namely the large lorries passing through the streets of his city early in the morning, before dawn, in order to pick up the corpses of people who had died in the streets that night. In the East, with its teaming millions, there are people who are born in the <span class="col_1363-1364" refersTo="page_0699"/>streets, who grow up in them, who grow old and eventually die without having had a roof over their heads for one single day. Those people&#x2014;pre-eminently the Chinese, to mention them by name&#x2014;look to South Africa and to Africa as an absolute paradise. To them we on the southern most point of Africa must seem like a crown jewel on display, which can be desired for occupation.</p>

<p>On this occasion I should like to analyse the development of Chinese communism in Africa, and draw certain conclusions. In looking at the pattern as it has developed up to the present, one sees that it follows painstakingly the directives of Mao Tsetung on revolutionary development. I do not have a red booklet with me now, and unfortunately I must in that respect accept the superior knowledge of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. There is a secret Chinese army document in which the position is summarized as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The centre of anti-colonial struggle is Africa. The centre of the struggle between East and West is Africa. At present Africa is the central question of the world.</block>

<p>In 1963 Chou En-lai, the Prime Minister of China, visited several countries in Africa accompanied by his bodyguard consisting of 60 people. He spoke with 10 heads of state and approximately 200 cabinet members. After his visit he gave the following verdict&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An excellent revolutionary situation exists in Africa.</block>

<p>As far back as 1956 the Chinese established an embassy in Egypt. The development followed until, on 23rd April, 1964, Tanganyika and Zanzibar merged, with Nyerere as president and Karuma of Zanzibar as vice-president. Incidentally, it is interesting to note from photographs that in recent years President Nyerere has been wearing Chinese dress whenever he appears in public. A tremendous amount of Chinese aid has been flowing into Tanzania since this development. I shall mention a few examples of this aid. The following has been granted: a R32 million interest-free loan for a five-year plan; a R4 million interest-free loan and a donation of R2 million for projects envisaged by Peking; R10 million for developing the Ruvu Government farm; R7 million for a textile factory just outside Dar-es-Salaam; R2,8 million for a very powerful radio transmitter, and a R338 million interest-free loan for the construction of the Tanzam railway line. This aid amounts to more than all the other aid, taken together, that has been granted in Africa. This Tanzam railway line will be 1 770 km long when it extends from Dar-es-Salaam to Kapiri Mposhi in Zambia. Towards the end of last year 502 km, approximately one-third of it, had already been completed, and it is being envisaged that it will be completed in 1974, two years ahead of schedule. What is significant, is that this railway line is going to be 3&#x2032;6&#x2033; wide, and that it will therefore have the same gauge as the railway lines of the South African Railways. Fifteen thousand Chinese are allegedly working on that railway line at the moment. Almost without exception each of them has received military training. According to Mrs. Pam Hansen, the lady chairman of the Portuguese Soldiers&#x2019; Amenities Fund of Durban, 20 000 women also entered this territory recently via Dar-es-Salaam.</p>

<p>Zambia has received aid in the same way. A sum of R12 million was given to them for the construction of three powerful radio transmitters for broadcasting communist propaganda. Russia is engaged in building a tarred road in Zambia from Lusaka through Livingstone to Mambowe between Kazungula and Katima Mulilo on the Zambesi. In looking at both this Tanzam railway line and the tarred road, one finds it striking that they have very little economic value, but very obvious military-strategic value. Military aid has not been lacking either. A large naval base has been built at Dar-es-Salaam by China, and up to the end of 1966 as much as 11 000 tons of arms had entered Tanzania through Dares-Salaam. Recently China made Tanzania a present of two squadrons of Mig-17 fighter aircraft, which, means that at the moment the Tanzanian Air Force has more striking power than has the Air Force of Rhodesia. Some of these Mig Jet aircraft have already been observed flying over Portuguese territory, and they are manned by Nigerian and Algerian pilots. They are being used in Guinea, and the PAIGC along with 600 Cubans are fighting the Portuguese. These people are using the 122 mm cannon given to Nigeria by Russia. They are firing across the Portuguese border, and when the Portuguese fire back, they lay charges against the Portuguese at UNO, saying that they are committing acts of aggression.</p>

<p><span class="col_1365-1366" refersTo="page_0700"/>That is the pattern which is developing there. Gen. Gowon is saddled with an unstable army of 250 000 people in Nigeria, and he dare not discharge them from the army since they will cause chaos in his country. On the occasion of the OAU meeting in June, 1970, he proposed the raising of an African Army, to which he would make a considerable contribution, to be used further south. I want to read to hon. members a quotation taken from a source entitled the <i>Intelligence Digest,</i> which was published in December, 1971&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Although no Nigerian troops have yet been drafted to an anti-imperialist war zone, this has often been mooted in Nigerian political circles. Apart from Nigerian military aid already in Senegal and the Guinea Republic, weapons, ammunition and materials &#x2018;which could include Migs&#x2019; have also been offered to Zambia for use on the southern front with Rhodesia, South Africa, South-West Africa and Mozambique.</block>

<p>Russian ships are regularly circling the Cape coast. In their reconnaissance flights the maritime squadrons of the South African Air Force have already observed that those ships are heavily laden with equipment on their decks, which are covered with tarpaulins. Those ships eventually discharge their cargoes at either Mtwara on the Tanzanian coast or at Dar-es-Salaam, and when they leave those harbours, they lie high in the water, obviously empty. One does not need great powers of deduction to guess what can be secret enough to be covered by tarpaulins on a ship&#x2019;s deck, and what is too big to be housed in a ship&#x2019;s hold. Large quantities of arms entering Africa in that manner, have already changed owners. We have seen several examples of them. I could mention to you, Sir, a whole series of armaments which have already come into the possession of South Africa, and for which proof exists. The pattern unfolds itself gradually, in accordance with the communist precept. I want to read out a few quotations in order to illustrate Russian thinking in this regard. I shall quote from another publication, the <i>Intelligence Digest</i> of January, 1971&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Similar to Western Governments, Russia too has a number of key back-room men of whom the public or the outside world hardly ever hear, but who exert tremendous, sometimes decisive, influence on policy and its implementation.</block>

<p>Then they mention one of them, Prof. Ulianovski, who studied with Brezhnev. They go on to say that he lays down the policy for the Communist Party and for Russia in Africa. Here he gives a decision to the effect that one of the most important programmes which they are going to undertake, is the penetration into Africa and the military development which has to take place in Africa now. In order to state the position more clearly, I want to read out another quotation. It deals with the mobilization of the Tanzanian army, which is now being developed on the basis of a people&#x2019;s militia, according to the communist pattern. The entire nation of Tanzania must, according to Nyerere, be absorbed into a liberation army which may be used both internally and abroad, and which must, in addition, play a role in wiping out the &#x201C;enemies and traitors of Tanzania&#x201D;, as they are called. The quotation reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The people&#x2019;s militia will apparently be in addition to the youth militia, called the green guards, and patterned on China&#x2019;s red guards, which has the task of safeguarding Tanzania&#x2019;s socialism. It may, however, be decided to incorporate the green guards in the people&#x2019;s militia.</block>

<p>Sir, it ought to become apparent that these directives are being applied one after the other, and I want to deal with the terrorists themselves, who are being used against our borders. Some of the terrorist leaders and political refugees from South Africa have expressed very clear views on this matter. I want to quote one of them, i.e. Oliver Tambo, of the African National Confess. When he recently paid a visit to Russia in the company of members of MPLA and Frelimo, the terrorist organizations, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is under the banner of international socialist solidarity that the African National Congress is leading our country&#x2019;s popular masses into the battle to meet the revolution for the overthrow of the Fascist r&#x00E9;gime, for the conquering of power and for the building of a socialist society. Long live the great party of Lenin. The mighty USSR is currently in the centre of the world&#x2019;s socialist community of peoples and is marching in the vanguard of the struggle for international liberation and for peace throughout the world. Our people, the ANC, are <span class="col_1367-1368" refersTo="page_0701"/>one of the important detachments of the world anti-imperialist movement. It is the international policy of the CPSU (the Communist Party of the Soviet Union), which renders us the support in our struggle.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, on 11th July, 1963, the South African Police exposed at Rivonia the underground den of communism in South Africa. On that occasion they obtained certain documents revealing the directives for Operation Mayibuye, the military operation which had to be launched in South Africa. I shall read out to you, Sir, a paragraph from that document, paragraph 1 of Part 4 of that plan&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our task is that on arrival the external force should find at least 7 000 men in the four main areas ready to join the guerrilla army in the initial onslaught.</block>

<p>Then they go on to furnish a list of where they were trained and the kind of training they were receiving. Amongst other things their curriculum included &#x201C;booby-trapping, home bomb manufacturing, sentry strangulation, vehicle ambushing, map reading, machine-gun techniques, bazooka firing&#x201D;, etc. Those people were taught to kill, and one of the directives of Mayibuye is the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If you see a child at a vantage point, kill. European adults were once children.</block>

<p>This is how Prof. Murray, one of our greatest authorities on communism, describes people of that kind (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Two points become apparent from Mao&#x2019;s work: We are not dealing here with sporadic terrorism, but with a well-co-ordinated, systematic military attack on the country, and we are dealing here with an absolute struggle against man, woman and child and not with war against the army of a state.</block>

<p>One of their leaders granted an interview to an Afrikaans newspaper, <i>Dagbreek,</i> and on 24th March, 1968, a certain George Vilendeka of ZAPU had the following to say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The eventual objective of communist-trained terrorists is to invade Pretoria, to murder inhabitants and to unseat the Government. That will be done after</block>

<p>Salisbury has been conquered, the Rhodesian Defence Force has been paralysed and Mr. Smith and his Cabinet have been hanged.</p>

<p>He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Local leftist groups in Rhodesia and South Africa who have gone underground and are smouldering at the moment, will be involved in this plan of invasion. War is war, my friend. Women and children will not be spared. If you and others think that the war will abate in intensity because so many of our soldiers have died, you are deceiving yourselves.</block>

<p>Sir, we saw the further development of the pattern when a start was made with raids on the northern borders. One of the first incidents was the road block in Rhodesia on 4th July, 1964, when Mr. Oberholzer was attacked in the presence of his wife and child. This was followed shortly afterwards by small groups penetrating South-West Africa. On 26th August, 1966, we had the first clash between the South African Police and these groups at Ongulum-bashe. On 26th September, 1966, they set fire to the buildings at Oshikango. Mr. Sauer, his wife and children, escaped miraculously, but one of his servants was wounded. Eventually&#x2014;on 12th June, 1967&#x2014;we were obliged to pass in this House the Terrorism Act, Act No. 83 of 1967. That was the first step that had to be taken to enable our authorities to cope with these base and treacherous sneak attacks. Sir, some of the reactions to this step are interesting, and I just want to refer to a few of them. I shall quote to you from the book entitled &#x201C;Terrorism&#x201D; written by Michael Morris, who used to be a policeman; he says that in 1967 John Sprack, a former president of Nusas, appeared with the Young Liberal Southern Africa Committee on a platform shared by SWAPO, ANC and other members of the so-called &#x201C;Task Force&#x201D;, and there they passed a resolution of solidarity with communism in Southern Africa. It is interesting to see from this book that on a certain occasion the University of the Witwatersrand held a meeting where the following resolution was adopted&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Student assembly believes that the implementation of the policy of the Government fosters acts of terrorism, since it oppresses large sections of the population <span class="col_1369-1370" refersTo="page_0702"/>to such an extent that they are driven to such acts of violence as a solution to their problems.</block>

<p>But we could go on mentioning to you numerous examples of both internal and external activities supplementing the pattern of communist penetration. I want to proceed to pointing out to you the activities of the Russian Navy in the Indian Ocean. According to official NATO documents this Navy is increasing in size. In order that you may gain an impression of their extent, Sir, I shall quote to you from <i>Survival,</i> a publication of the International Institute of Strategic Studies&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A large Soviet fishing fleet is maintained in the Indian Ocean and off the West Coast of South Africa. In pursuit of shoals of fish, ships from it frequently transit the Cape in both directions. On 25th February, 1971, for example, a S.A. Air Force reconnaissance flight along the West Coast sighted 42 ships, 14 of them Soviet and eight of these trawlers. Since closure of the Suez Canal in 1967 Cape transits have grown to an average of 75 a day, of which, on the South Africans&#x2019; figures, Soviet flag shipping accounts for about ten. This would mean that at any given time there are, very approximately, a hundred Soviet merchant ships in the Indian Ocean plus the large fleet of trawlers.</block>

<p>Sir, these trawlers off our coastline are very interesting. I have here with me a photograph of one of them which shows clearly that in apperance it is a trawler but that it does not carry any fishing equipment. Instead of that it has on board very sophisticated equipment, electronic equipment, some of which is kept covered under trapaulins. These disguised fishing trawlers are engaged in laying navigation mines in South African fishing waters, outside our territorial waters, for subsequent use by submarines and other purposes. They are making a survey of all the electronic intelligence that can be obtained from South Africa. They are taking readings of our radar, of our navigation systems, of our radio-communication systems, frequencies, localities, and so forth. They are drawing up a very thorough plan of each of the pieces of electronic equipment within reach of their sources of intelligence.</p>

<p>I shall make haste to continue by telling you, Sir, that the penetration of the Russian navy in the Indian Ocean has also started to dismay others. Therefore, what is involved here, is not primarily South Africa, but something that is much wider in scope. It is important that the world should also take cognizance of this matter, because to my mind Europe and the Free World would be doing themselves a very great disservice if they failed to take cognizance of this threat in the Indian Ocean. I shall quote to you from an English translation of an article that appeared in <i>Ons Zeewegen,</i> a Dutch authoritative naval publication. This is what they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Africa under Soviet control means a deathly threat to the Europe west of the Iron Curtain. It is the signal for which the Russian armoured divisions and their air squadrons behind the river Elbe may be waiting to decide to crush Western Europe&#x2019;s defence in conventional warfare, or at least to shackle the Western European countries&#x2019; freedom of action internally and externally in order to pull them behind the Iron Curtain. Africa under Soviet control also means a serious upset to the development process of the African peoples. Striving for full emancipation it will bring them perpetual serfdom on the Soviet model.</block>

<p>In other words, this threat is against the whole of Africa and also against Europe. Apparently the United States of America have also come to realize this. I shall quote from an issue of the <i>American News Digest,</i> an information publication of theirs, dated 9th February&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United States has approached the Soviet Union about mutually limiting naval strength in the Indian Ocean and elsewhere, but there has been no response from Moscow.</block>

<p>I want to give you a study in the contrasts in approach to the communist struggle in the South. As you know, a meeting of UNO was recently held in Addis Adaba, and there Emperor Haile Selassie and the delegates from other countries passed one resolution after the other against the south. I shall quote one of them from <i>Hoofstad</i> dated 15th February, (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ten African countries, supported by Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, want the conference of foreign ministers of member states of the Organization for</block>

<p><span class="col_1371-1372" refersTo="page_0703"/>African Unity, which is deliberating in Addis Ababa at the moment, to do something positive about Rhodesia in particular, but also about South Africa and Portugal.</p>

<p>I want to contrast this with the views expressed by another African leader, President Houphouet-Boigny, and I shall quote from <i>The Argus</i> dated 13th May, 1971. The report from which I shall quote, comes from Paris&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ivory Coast President, Mr. Felix Houphouet-Boigny, believes South Africa should be the protector of the continent against any future Chinese take-over. The man who leads the dialogue campaign, hinted clearly that he would like to see a mutual defence pact signed eventually between Pretoria and the Black African states. Here interviewed by the weekly, <i>Paris Match,</i> Mr. Houphouet-Boigny says that the real danger is communist expansion; it is China. He adds: Against this danger there is no better rampart today than South Africa with its military power and technical capacity. The Ivory Coast President said that Chinese penetration in East Africa was proof enough of the reality of the threat that China posed to Africa. This was to use the continent as a dumping ground for Asian multitudes.</block>

<p>They are going further than that. In this dangerous world in which we are living, they have also come forward with a next step in the programme they envisage. I shall quote from the German publication <i>Hannoversche Allgemeine,</i> dated 25th January, 1972, in which the following was stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Peking&#x2019;s aims were firmly fixed in the direction of the third world. Foreign Minister Chen-Yi, who died not long ago, declared that China hopes that the Afro-Asian countries will themselves be in a position to produce atom bombs with or without Chinese assistance.</block>

<p>We have reached a stage which compels us to take cognizance of these things that are happening. We must take cognizance of a threat which fits into the communist world pattern, and every action taking place on the African scene, forms part of the world communist struggle and must therefore be seen in that context. Each of the directives of the communist programme is gradually being implemented in Africa, and in looking at the rest of the details of the programme, and at what is being held in prospect, we must realize that we are dealing here with a major programme, a programme of which only a minor part has been implemented up to now, but that during the seventies we ought to observe gradually the rest of the development of this pattern. On an occasion such as this it is my wish that the population of South Africa should take cognizance of this matter; cognizance of the development that is taking place should be taken, not only by our population, but also by our friends in the West, who are being threatened themselves&#x2014;it is not only we who are being threatened. May we, and the Free World along with us, pause to reflect on this matter in a stage of development such as this, before this communist canker will have penetrated so deeply into the essence of Africa that no remedy will be able to eradicate it any more.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Middelburg has gone to a great deal of trouble to document the case which he has put before the House in support of his motion. I want to say at once that I&#x2014;and I can speak for my colleagues on this side of the House&#x2014;accept the motion. We intend to move no amendment to it because we, as I believe does every responsible South African, recognize and realize that there are threats and dangers to South Africa and that it is necessary that not only our own people but our friends in the outside world should also be aware of the reality of these dangers. I believe it is necessary that we should assess and analyze these dangers in a calm atmosphere, as the hon. mover of the motion did, and give to them a realistic assessment, unflavoured by exaggeration or panic. It is therefore a pity that we should be dealing with this motion today, a matter on which both sides of the House are fully agreed, against a background and in an atmosphere such as that which marked the end of the debate immediately prior to this one. Here we are dealing with the reality of an issue facing South Africa, an issue where the Government has the full support of the Opposition. I want to quote from a speech I made on the 20th October, addressing the United Party Durban and Coast Women&#x2019;s Council in Durban. I want to place on record here what I said then. I said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1373-1374" refersTo="page_0704"/>Mr. P. W. Botha, Minister of Defence, was correct in his attitude, and I thank him for saying so in public, that the defence of South Africa transcends parties and that Nationalist and United Party supporters are doing their duty shoulder to shoulder, and that he will tolerate no party politics in the South African Defence Force. I wish here publicly to express my appreciation to the Minister for the co-operation between the parties and for the information made available to us.</block>

<p>That is what I said and I should like to record it here, so that there can be no doubt about our attitude. I put it to tile hon. the Minister that what he said in public then is still the case now. I would like to ask him, because of the unfortunate atmosphere and the outside background against which we are debating this issue, to place on record&#x2014;which I believe he will do &#x2014;the fact that he has not any cause to doubt the loyalty or the integrity of any supporter of this side of the House serving in the South African Defence Force in the defence of South Africa. He has said that before, but I hope he will repeat it now, and repeat his confidence in the men from all political parties serving in our forces. I am sure that the hon. the Minister of Police would do the same and say that on our borders men from United Party and Nationalist homes are standing shoulder to shoulder in defence of South Africa. If the Minister had reason to doubt their loyalty on political grounds, then he would have said so, or he can say so in this debate. Therefore we approach this motion as common cause, but I would like, frankly, to have seen the motion go further, because what is before us is simply an expression of concern. It expresses our concern at the infiltration and the dangers of Communism; but I do not believe it is enough just to be concerned. I would like to have seen the motion placed on record the appreciation of this Parliament to the young men who are helping to make South Africa safe and secure. I would like to have seen it have a positive leg, a positive expression, not only of thanks to the men who are serving South Africa in the forces, Police and Army, but what is more important, I would like to have seen this motion have a leg expressing the complete confidence of this House in the ability of those forces to keep South Africa safe and secure. It is important that those who seek to undermine and destroy us should know that they face in South Africa not simply a deterrent but a force which will destroy any attack on us and which will defend South Africa against all comers. I think we would have done better if we had said that in this motion, rather than simply to have expressed concern.</p>

<p>When you express concern it may be interpreted as an expression of fear or as an expression of insecurity. I do not believe that South Africa needs to be afraid or to feel insecure. When one analyzes the forces which are ranged against us today one can see that, as they are today, there is no threat of a take-over of South Africa by force. That it could escalate and develop into a greater threat is something which I think we all recognize. But equally, we would have notice of that escalation and we, in turn, would be able to strengthen ourselves. It is my conviction that with what we have available to South Africa today there is no force on the continent of Africa, nor any African sea force, which could launch an invasion with success. Our message must therefore be one of confidence in our strength, whilst we recognize the reality of the dangers that face us.</p>

<p>I believe that we have to emphasize, in any consideration of our security, the part which the loyalty of our people plays in giving us safety against undermining and against attack. Every single expert on guerrilla and communist tactics accepts as a matter of unarguable fact that the greatest weapon against terrorism and against communism is the loyalty of the local population, and that an invasion force which does not have support, logistics, access to supplies, people who are prepared to hide them, and people who are prepared to give them information, has little chance of success. It was the lesson of Malaya, it is the lesson of Rhodesia and it is also the lesson of South Africa. I believe that we have to give great emphasis in our thinking to that aspect of retaining and strengthening the loyalty of all the peoples of South Africa. That means our civil administration and the reaction of our people to civil government. That is why it is important that when a Government plays politics, fights elections, or simply runs its internal administration, it should think further than the mere effect and consequence of the policy on political administration. It should think of the effect of that policy on the loyalty of the people and their willingness and determination to stand together with and behind the Government in the defence of <span class="col_1375-1376" refersTo="page_0705"/>their country. I fear that some of the things which happen in our country tend not to strengthen, but to weaken that security which is so vital to us. That is why it was with tremendous regret that I read, for instance, that our Prime Minister indicated that independent Bantu states developing in South Africa could turn to Moscow or Peking if that was their choice, and that though we could warn them, we could not stop them. We should think of the security of our country in the political policies which we follow. It is therefore important that statements like that should not be enabled to weaken and undermine our security.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to see it go further than just confidence. In this connection I agree with the hon. the Minister who mentioned the value of possible agreements when he referred to the possibility of a &#x201C;Southern Defence Pact&#x201D; on 29th August, 1970. I think we must think in terms of closer ties with our friends.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I visualize that we could have agreements with friends which could greatly strengthen our position and our security against attacks from either Russia or China. Therefore we back the Government in any action taken to try to create such friendships, to try to strengthen such bonds preferably to the extent of formal treaties.</p>

<p>As I have said, when we look at this question of concern for the dangers that face us, let us balance it. I appeal to the hon. the Minister and the Government not to sabre-rattle without giving the other side of the picture. I had cause during the recess to comment on what I believe was exploitation of the dangers against South Africa. I believe that it is being exploited in that filthy pamphlet to which reference was made. In this pamphlet appear pictures of terrorist weapons and burnt-out vehicles. Our security was used for political ends. I believe that that is not in the interests of South Africa. It is not in the interests of our security as a country or as a nation. When a political leader says that we are in danger of an attack and that the people must therefore support them, the leaders of that political party, then that too is using security for political purposes. We are all guilty at times, but let us keep the possibility of that to an absolute minimum. Let us try to look on security, as the hon. the Minister of Defence does, as something above party politics.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Only three months later I had the privilege, at the invitation of the hon. the Minister, of attending the opening of the Devon Radar Centre. It is a magnificent set-up on which we have spent many millions of rand and which, I believe, gives to South Africa greater security than we have ever enjoyed before, as far as defending ourselves against air attack is concerned. Without going into any details, the fact is that we have a radar screen&#x2014;this is public knowledge&#x2014;with a headquarters which can not only control our Air Force and aircraft, but can also employ Cactus, of which we are so proud, and which is accepted today as one of the world&#x2019;s strongest low-level, all-weather antiaircraft defences. I believe it would do South Africa more good if, when dealing with the danger of an air attack, we say in the same breath and at the same time that we warn anyone who thinks along these lines, that an air attack will be met by a radar defence screen, that we have modern planes which can deal with any aggression and that we have Cactus. In other words, when we deal with danger let us emphasize our strength.</p>

<p>Let me refer to other threats and sources of danger. In October the hon. the Minister also spoke at Goudini Spa, where he used what I think was an unfortunate expression&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If these forces succeed in forcing a military confrontation on the Republic, South Africa will for the first time in 70 years be compelled to fight on her own soil.</block>

<p>The danger is there; we are, in fact, facing dangers on our own soil, but we are coping with this threat. We are dealing with it and containing it. I think that the hon. the Minister will agree that if there is one person who is really reluctant, it is the terrorist facing the possibility of having to cross our borders. Let us emphasize that point. Let us emphasize our strength and not our weakness. Above all, let us not play politics with this issue of our security.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. member for Stellenbosch, who spoke in another debate immediately before this one, a simple question, viz. whether he approves of the sort of pamphlet from which he was quoting, which exploits the dangers of Communism and terrorism for party political ends.</p>

<p>Yes, all of us; every member on this side of the House. But, in our fight against Communism, we are not prepared to use weapons or methods which will undermine or weaken the Western approach and the Western thinking, the fundamental Western concepts of democracy and freedom. We say that if one wants to destroy Communism, one must destroy it at its grass roots, but that, when one uses the methods of totalitarianism, one is then in fact acknowledging that there is something good which one is prepared to take over from them and use oneself. Therefore we have always taken the line: Fight ruthlessly, fight unequivocally and without hesitation, but do not use methods which discredit or in any way can harm the picture of the Western way of life, so that those who believe in that way of life will know that they can continue to believe in it. It does then not become a choice between two systems, in both of which there is evil.</p>

<p>This is a motion which has been put forward by a Government member and it is a motion dealing with the fundamental security of this State, but look what we get from a member of the Cabinet. I hope the hon. Prime Minister is watching and takes note of the attitude of one of his Ministers, who has joint Cabinet responsibility for our security. I hope he is watching the way this Minister regards the safety of South Africa. We on this side of the House today accept this motion. As I have said, we would have liked to see it go further. I have one appeal I would like to make to the Government. When we talk of danger, let us talk of our strength at the same time.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think the House owes a great debt of thanks to the hon. member for Middelburg for this motion he has brought along to the House and which has again given us the opportunity to look at this problem of communist penetration as a responsible representative body. We are also glad of the opportunity, through the channels of this House, of conveying to the ears of the Western world the determination of the whole South African population to oppose communism with all its might. I shall not allow myself to be led astray by the hon. member for Durban Point, nor shall I be tempted to continue a speech I was making when another debate was interrupted. I shall conclude that speech on Monday, and I shall therefore not let myself be mislead by that temptation.</p>

I have already said that this morning. I now want to reiterate categorically that I have the utmost confidence in the loyalty of all South Africans as regards our common opposition to communism. What I do object to on occasion is the kind of attitude representatives of the United Party adopt in this House. I do not want to dwell on that any further.</p>

<p>I said that I shall continue with that speech in Monday&#x2019;s debate. I want to tell the hon. member for Durban Point that this afternoon he spoiled the opportunity he had of discussing a very topical matter at a high level by also referring to the standpoints the hon. Prime Minister adopted in respect of the non-White peoples within our borders when they have developed to the point of independence. I do not know how the hon. member can involve such a matter in this because, in the first place, the communistic threat against South Africa bears no relation to what political party is in power in South Africa and what its particular policy is. What is involved is that South Africa is the Naboth&#x2019;s vineyard in the modern world. Here before me I have an article written by Gen. H. J. Kruls, editor of the official journal of NAVO. About this aspect he says, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa is rich and the minerals of the country and its other natural resources are very much desired by countries striving after the further strengthening of their dominating positions. In this connection it is quite clear that Soviet Russian and Communist Chinese influences are developing more and more in a number of African countries.</block>

<p>I can also quote from an article that appeared in the Dutch newspaper <i>Ons Zeewezen,</i> in which the writer states the following, apart from the importance he attaches to the sea-routes and the protection of air-routes through South Africa&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But Africa, and Southern Africa in the first place, is not only a coveted object in the military and strategic sense, but also from the economic point of view. To <span class="col_1383-1384" refersTo="page_0709"/>begin with, there is Southern Africa&#x2019;s great wealth in minerals. But next to that there is the industrial development which has made particularly rapid progress in the last ten years.</block>

<p>The writer then continues by saying that in the strategic sphere, in the greater part of the world, Communism is focusing its attention on Africa and on Southern Africa because South Africa is, in point of fact, the Naboth&#x2019;s vineyard in the modern world. We must take that into account. I want to appeal to hon. members of the Opposition. While saying that I do not doubt for one moment the loyalty and unanimity of every South African, nor that of the people at large who support their party, when it comes to the protection of our country, I also want to ask them to comprehend the essence of the problem of the communistic onslaught against us.</p>

<p>I say that we are grateful for the opportunity we have gained to discuss at a high level the problem that is an international problem, because for many years South Africa&#x2019;s official voice was a solitary one in conveying to the world at large the importance of these quotations I have just used here. When one talks to bodies abroad that are involved with security in their countries and in the world at large, it strikes one repeatedly that they speak the same language as you do and see matters in the same light. However, when one is dealing with certain government bodies the element of expedience unfortunately comes strongly to the fore, and not that of realism about the communist threat to the world. Recently other voices have been raised. From several regions in the Western world we have obtained proof that the lengthy endeavours of South Africa, not to make itself objectionable but to show the world that it is engaged in fulfilling a task that is not only in the interests of its own security, but also in the interests of the whole free world, are making an impression. I refer to what Pres. Nixon said a few months ago to the Australian Prime Minister. He said that America would not, with their eyes open, allow the balance of power in the Indian Ocean to be disrupted. I consider these words to be of particular significance, because for the first time in the past few decades an American president, the president of the biggest country in the free world, has intimated that the Indian Ocean on the coast of Africa has become important to him as well, to his country and to the entire Western world in whose freedom and security he has an interest.</p>

<p>There are further proofs. Recently news has also come of a certain Western power intending to send a task force to the Indian Ocean. Thereby that power will, by action, indicate that it will not allow communism to penetrate the East coast of Africa from the sea. In that article to which I referred earlier, the same Gen. Kruls re-emphasized this point very strongly. He said:</p>

<block name="quote">The threats to the NATO countries are of a global nature, they exist everywhere. The loss of the African continent would be disastrous. A cutting-off of the round-the-Cape-lifelines would almost kill the NATO countries. The same applies to South-East Asia and many other parts of the world.</block>

<p>In this vein he continued and advocated that NATO should extend its field of activity and thereby include South Africa. He said, <i>inter alia:</i></p>

<p>In the military field it must be decided which part of the task can be left on South Africa&#x2019;s shoulders. The necessary ships, weapons and equipment will have to be supplied to South Africa by the countries of NATO.</p>

<p>It is significant that such voices are emanating from an organization such as NATO. I think we owe it to this Government, and specifically to the Minister of Defence, to convey the thanks of the entire South African population for the persistent manner in which he has tackled this matter at every turn. He did so in public and privately so that now we are getting all these results. We have the proof that yesterday a White Paper on defence was submitted in the British Parliament in which attention is drawn to this same problem. Reference is made to the fact that the route around the Cape is not only of the utmost importance to South Africa, nor only to Britain, but also to the free world, and that the activities of the Russian fleet in the Indian Ocean embody a substantial problem for the free world. They recommend that attention be given to this problem. The time at my disposal unfortunately does not allow me to elaborate further on the motion so substantially initiated by the hon. member for Middelburg. I just want to say that we are grateful for the opportunity of discussing the matter here, but that we are also grateful <span class="col_1385-1386" refersTo="page_0710"/>for the knowledge&#x2014;and I want to repeat this for the edification of the hon. member for Durban Point&#x2014;that the South African population is determined not to allow this substantial danger to penetrate its borders.</p>

<speech by="#wainwright">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, in discussing this motion we must accept that everything that is said in this House this afternoon about the great dangers which face our country, is said and meant in all sincerity. Those of us who have studied Communism to the best of our ability in the time at our disposal will have seen how it has been working through the ages. I recall the years 1940-1945, when I had the privilege of &#x201C;visiting&#x201D; states such as Egypt, Libya and Cyrenaica, and at that time I could see and many of my friends could see the seedbeds of Communism were being cultivated in those areas. The cultivation was going on very well indeed, all that had to be done was for the seeds to be sown and a good germination could be expected. In point of fact, subsequently there was a very good germination of the communist seeds in those areas. It is quite apparent, Sir, that Communism will only thrive when people suffer from poverty, hunger and frustration and when people live in a depressed state. It is under those particular conditions that Communism thrives. It is interesting to see what Lenin said about the price of the conquest of Communism in the world. When speaking on the price of world conquest, he said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What does it matter if three-quarters of the world perish if the remaining one-quarter is communist&#x003F;</block>

<p>One sees that at no time has Communism deviated from Lenin&#x2019;s philosophy. We saw it in North Africa; we see that Communism has taken hold of those North African states where there is a war raging at the moment. We see that Egypt, Libya, Cyreraica are countries firmly in the grip of Moscow&#x2019;s hands. We have seen what Peking has done in Central Africa. Make no mistake about it, Peking has already a firm grip on many little states in Central Africa. The stage of cultivating the seed-beds for Communism in many Central African states has passed; germination is already taking place, and here, today we find that we have a motion before us in which this House is asked to express its concern about the increasing infiltration of Communism into Southern Africa. Sir, over the years Communism has been spreading down to the borders of our own country. Ministers of the State have repeatedly expressed their views in this regard. Unfortunately their views have been conflicting from time to time and there has not always been consistency in ministerial statements dealing with this danger. Some Ministers have repeatedly given the assurance that all is well within our borders. As I say, these statements have not been consistent. They have varied from time to time, depending on the occasion. We find that when Nationalist congresses are held, Government supporters virtually go to town, if I may use that expression, on Communism, and we also experience this when there is a pending election. It is tragic, Sir, when our country is faced with this dangerous and serious situation that political parties should be tempted to use propaganda against another party merely for political expediency and nothing else. Nothing is solved by this process at all. This is done whenever the occasion demands it. The hon. the Prime Minister at one of the recent congresses mentioned the dangers of the Caprivi Strip and what South Africa&#x2019;s intentions were there. We believe that it was a strictly confidential matter as far as our Police Forces were concerned in dealing with this problem in the Caprivi Strip, but, of course, it was also an urgent matter of dramatizing the issue as far as his supporters at a Nationalist congress in Pretoria were concerned. Sir, let us ask ourselves whether we are capable of dealing with this problem. We should be, because surely we have enough laws by now on the Statute Book to combat Communism. I cannot think of any amendment that we can bring about to these laws and Acts to improve them and to increase the strength and the power which has been placed in the hands of those responsible in dealing with this problem. Sir, it is regrettable&#x2014;and I want us to get this quite clear&#x2014;that spokesmen of the Cabinet and even the Prime Minister have seen fit to say that the Opposition are being used as the tool of the communists. This statement is so serious that one cannot overlook it. We, the Opposition, the people who represent approximately 45 per cent of South Africa&#x2019;s electorate, have been accused not only of being used as the tools of Communism but, as the hon. the Minister of Justice has said, also of helping the <span class="col_1387-1388" refersTo="page_0711"/>communists. His words were: &#x201C;Daar is die mense wat hulle nog help&#x201D;. [Interjection.]</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member making that noise, well I would not like to know where he wears his medals, he would do far better to rather keep quiet. This is an important subject which we are dealing with. The hon. member for Odendaalsrus is not here, I will not say much about him, except to say that what he said really does not deserve comment. I know the people of his constituency, I know some of them very well indeed. I know Nationalists in his constituency as well, but they do not deserve a member who makes the sort of speech which the hon. member made here a few days ago. It was a shocking exposition of Government propaganda. Last, but not least, there is this disgraceful Brakpan pamphlet. I am sure the voters in Odendaalsrus and Brakpan, the majority of whom are Nationalists, are wondering what it is all about. I am sure they are asking themselves: &#x201C;Why must my member tell these stories in the House of Assembly&#x003F; Is this necessary&#x003F; What is wrong&#x003F; Is my member worried&#x003F; Is he getting panicky&#x003F; Do not let us imagine that the Nationalist supporters all believe that the Opposition would ever stoop to anything of this sort. This is indeed a sign of panic and despair. What is more, Sir, it does not only fail to impress members in this House but many of those people outside too. I would suggest to this Government, while we are on this motion, that they sweep before their own doorstep before they look to others. The old English phrase has it that the bad workman always blames his tools. Surely they are today looking for some tools to blame because they find they cannot combat the communist problem. Let us again look at what Lenin said in regard to Communism when he was discussing communist methods of subversion. What he said was interesting, i.e. &#x201C;When one enjoys an overwhelming majority of forces one can succeed by direct frontal attack, but when one&#x2019;s forces are inadequate; detours, waiting periods, zig-zags, and so on and so forth may be necessary.&#x201D; Let me remind this hon. House, that this is the pattern the communists are taking. If we as White people want to give the lead on the continent of Africa, then we must take a look at ourselves in the mirror and see just how stupid we look and what example we are setting to the rest on the continent of Africa. Words and platitudes are not going to help us; it is deeds which will help us, we must set the example to all the people on the continent of Africa. Unwittingly&#x2014; and I repeat unwittingly&#x2014;we White people are cultivating the seed beds for Communism right on our own doorstep here in the Republic of South Africa. Coming from the Eastern Cape I am naturally very concerned about the Government&#x2019;s policies which they intend carrying out in this country of ours. After the development of the Reserves, which we support&#x2014;and not only the Reserves but many of those unfortunate less privileged small states in Central Africa&#x2014;after we have developed these Reserves to sovereign independence all that the independent Bantustans will be able to export from their countries to our country, is their labour. We are concerned at what the hon. the Prime Minister said when he was asked the question by the reporter of the magazine <i>To the Point,</i> i.e. &#x201C;And suppose the Independent Bantu States go the way of Moscow or Peking&#x201D;&#x003F;</p>

<p>I am not going to be diverted from this motion by any interjection. This is what the hon. the Prime Minister said and what concerns us&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have said it more than once. I should not find it attractive nor wise, but if they want to be left-orientated, well, it is their concern.</block>

<p>The Prime Minister has conceded this and this has been worrying us for many years i.e. 80 per cent of South Africa&#x2019;s Labour force. On the other hand the hon. the Minister of Defence came under fire during the last General election when he was quoted by his candidate for Zululand when asked the question on this very problem by the voters of Zululand. Mr. Pienaar explained what the Minister of Defence said he was prepared to do, to combat communism, remember there was an election being fought which incidentally Mr. Pienaar lost. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Pienaar last night told a lively meeting at Stanger that the Minister had informed him that South Africa would move in, whether the homeland concerned was independent or not, if South Africa was threatened.</block>

<p><span class="col_1389-1390" refersTo="page_0712"/>This conflicts with the statement made by the hon. the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, my time is up. I am not despondent and I am not depressed provided we as White South Africans stop this uncalled for mud-slinging which gets us nowhere. I do not believe that Peking will take a hold of our country, at least not for the next ten years. The communists will avoid it, but I must warn this House that time is in their favour.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, since its birth, Communism has been pledged to the devil; therefore the road of Moscow and of Peking is spreading across and face of the globe by means of deceit, violence, revolution and bloodshed. As far as the world is concerned, we are facing a new situation, namely that as a result of the great powers cancelling each other out in regard to the utilization of nuclear power in war, there is fear throughout the world that a nuclear war should not be started; everybody is cowering away from it. For that reason there is no question at this stage of a large-scale confrontation between the great powers of the world, and they are trying to prevent that confrontation. But precisely because of these circumstances, Moscow and Peking and their satellites have the opportunity to take advantage of the fear of a nuclear war by waging local wars and achieving their goal through subversion. By means of revolutionary warfare they want to achieve what they might otherwise not achieve it there were a confrontation. For that reason I should like to thank the hon. member for Middelburg sincerely for this motion he has introduced. I think that this motion, read in conjunction with the motion dealing with another aspect of Communism, which was introduced by the hon. member for Stellenbosch and unanimously accepted by this Parliament last year, can only contribute towards strengthening our position in the Western world and bringing our people and our country into readiness for the challenges they may have to face. But I am sorry to have to say that the level to which the hon. member for Durban Point and the other speaker on his side brought this debate, was bitterly disappointing. The hon. member for Durban Point said only once that he endorsed the motion, and then started attacking the Government, followed in the same vein by the back-bencher behind him. We are discussing the dangers of communism in Southern Africa. If the hon. members do not realize this, we cannot help them. The hon. member at the back there has a pamphlet complex and I want to advise him to look beyond pamphlets at the dangers lurking on our borders. The hon. member for Durban Point should realize one thing. He said here that he thanked me for keeping the armed forces of South Africa out of party politics. That is true. We administrate the Defence Force in such a way that we try not to incorporate party-political prejudices in forming a Defence Force which is in constant battle trim. But what is required in conjunction with this is that there should be the highest motivation from this House to our young people in the Defence Force, and one cannot motivate them if one section of one&#x2019;s Parliament acts in the way they acted today. I blame the hon. member and shall deal with him in a moment in regard to a few other aspects.</p>

<p>I have said I welcome the motion of the hon. member for Middelburg because although this motion is concerned more specifically with Southern Africa, the activities of the Russians and of the Chinese and of their satellites in Southern Africa should also be seen against the background of their overall world strategy and not merely as an isolated onslaught on Southern Africa. It would be a mistake to deal with this problem only as a South African one. We are not involved in an isolated struggle against communism. In this struggle we are merely an outpost for the free world. Another truth we must realize is that the foremost aim of Russia, China and their satellites is not merely, as my hon. friend opposite seems to believe, to try to sell Marxism which feeds on poverty and misery. Their strategy, no matter how it may differ in these days, is calculated to increase their influence by indirect or direct methods in order to attain eventual domination of the world and to exercise their power. It is a power struggle; it is a military power struggle. It is an economic struggle and a struggle for domination. It is not concerned in the first place with spreading a so-called faith. They are trying to surround the West. A world strategy is revealing itself. They are trying to control Africa by, <i>inter alia,</i> acquiring bases on both the East Coast and the West Coast of Africa. Russia&#x2019;s policy is still aimed at dominating the world She is striving to achieve this by means of direct or indirect methods, according to what suits her. <span class="col_1391-1392" refersTo="page_0713"/>China, on the other hand, is searching for a place to off-load her millions, and in her striving she often places more emphasis on the methods in which the Communist Party is involved than perhaps Russia does.</p>

<p>In this regard I want to read out to this House a very significant pronouncement contained in a recent book by an expert. I am referring to Sir Robert Thompson&#x2019;s book &#x201C;Revolutionary War In World Strategy&#x201D;. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The great myth that China was no more than a willing obedient satellite of Russia was about to be exploded, but not to the West&#x2019;s advantage as statesmen have believed. China has achieved a positive position where the West can derive little benefit from the split and where Russia on any issue with the West must reluctantly and in the last resort support her.</block>

<p>In other words, the so-called difference in action, the so-called split between Russia and China may, for technically and temporary other reasons, make them appear to the world as an ostensibly divided pair, but eventually, when the vital decision is to be taken, Russia and China will make a combined onslaught on the Western world. It is interesting how both have caused a new phenomenon to come to the forefront recently, i.e. the use of satellites. Russia and China today both sit in the assemblies of the nations. They sit around the tables of consultation. At table they have to wear the cloak of decency, even though that cloak is so transparent that everyone can see the nakedness. But now they use satellites such as Cuba, North Korea, Algeria, Rumania, Czechoslovakia, Tanzania and Zambia to do their dirty work for them. As the hon. member for Middelburg said, we know from a document issued by the Chinese army, that it is explicitly stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The centre of anti-colonial struggle is Africa. The centre of the struggle between East and West is Africa. At present Africa is the central question in the world.</block>

<p>This is their real standpoint. It agrees with what the great General Napoleon said in his day, namely: &#x201C;Europe can be overthrown in Africa&#x201D;. What is taking place in Africa today is part of the strategy to overthrow Europe.</p>

<p>In addition we know that the struggle in Africa coincides with the Russian ideal to control the oceans. This is a new awakening in Russia which was expressed as follows by Admiral Groscho of the Russian Navy&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the past our ships and naval aviation units have operated primarily near our coast. Now we must be prepared for broad offensive operations against sea and ground troops of the imperialists on any point of the world territories.</block>

<p>Therefore the action in Africa, the action in the Indian Ocean and the action to start controlling or to try to control other sea-routes, all form part of one great world strategy which is not aimed at Southern Africa alone. It is aimed at the West. For this purpose Russia has approximately 6 000 aircraft and approximately 350 submarines. In one of the latest military journals a table is furnished to prove by way of comparison to what extent Russia is overtaking America in respect of certain arms supplies. I need not find this in that military journal alone; I can find it in the latest speeches of the American Minister of Defence and President Nixon in which Russia was warned that she should stop arming herself in such a way that it seemed she wanted to effect world domination militarily.</p>

<p>A few days ago Sir Alec Douglas-Home said the following words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Let us get the facts about the Indian Ocean right. The fact is that our presence has declined while the Russian presence has greatly increased. They have for example doubled their navy in the Indian Ocean in the last year.</block>

<p>These are the words of the Home Secretary. We know now that it is not only an operation at sea and not only infiltration overland. It goes hand in hand with the creation of certain air bases everywhere in the world as well. In this way there are air bases in Africa over which they have gained partial control or where they have influence and from where they may operate. Without verifying his facts, the hon. member for Durban Point referred to a so-called speech I had made at Stellenbosch. What are the facts&#x003F; The facts are that I gave a lecture at Stellenbosch to a group of students who had requested me to do so. I indulged in no party politics that evening. My speech dealt with the military threat in Africa.</p>

<p><span class="col_1393-1394" refersTo="page_0714"/>One of the things I said there was that the African states could form no threat on their own strength. I said also the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But if they were to be given the active assistance and guidance by a power such as Russia or Red China, the picture would change altogether. With Red planners and so-called Red technicians to man their aircraft and to handle modern equipment, they obtain Red logistic support as well.</block>

<p>That was my point. Must I not do that&#x003F; Must I not divulge the reasons why a threat may arise there&#x003F; Now the hon. member comes here and reads out a slanted report from an English-language newspaper whose reporter was not even present at that meeting.</p>

But I continued immediately by saying that for that reason we were spending millions in order to establish an air defence system. Since the hon. member wants to talk party politics, let me tell him that nobody has done more than this Government to put in order the air defence system of South Africa.</p>

<p>Really Sir, as far as I am concerned, the report may as well come from the hon. member&#x2019;s pocket. I have just told him what I said at Stellenbosch, and those are the facts. Here is the speech from which I spoke.</p>

<p>Against this background I have outlined and against the background of communist strategy in the Middle East, the Far East and South America, we should see the activities in Tanzania, Zambia, Congo Brazzaville and some other African States. Hon. members may examine the techniques merely by reading one magazine, i.e. the December edition of the <i>Readers Digest.</i> There they will find a survey of what happened in Mexico until the Mexican Government had to take certain steps. Let them go and read that and compare it with the pattern which is developing in Southern Africa. The relevant elements in this process of Russia&#x2019;s and China&#x2019;s entry into a theatre or an area of combat, always follow more or less one pattern. It starts by infiltration through subversion, for which they use persons, who have been trained in Russia, China and in certain satellite countries, from numbers which have been drawn from the country concerned. After infiltration through subversion, entrenchment follows by means of economic aid or the granting of credit. After that, indispensability is achieved by economic, political, technical and military steps. This is the usual pattern this entry into a theatre usually follows.</p>

<p>In the light of the knowledge we have, there can no longer be any doubt as to the objectives of the communists in Southern Africa. I want to summarize them briefly. The first objective is to penetrate and undermine a traditional Western sphere of influence. To that end they use not only military means, but also those of subversion and they infiltrate into so-called innocent organizations, crawling around even under a cloak of Christianity and religion. The second objective is to convert the South African stability into tension and conflict for their own purposes and to apply a struggle of exhaustion to us. The third objective is to create a breach from Dar-es-Salaam to Pointe Noir in Congo Brazzaville or in Angola in order to obtain a foothold on the East Coast and on the West Coast. The fourth objective is, by means of the eventual isolation or control of Southern Africa, to make the important sea route around the Cape unsafe for the West through intimidation, blockades or military action, if necessary. In this regard it is interesting to note that the route between New York and Bahrein in the Persian Gulf is 4 000 sea miles shorter around the Cape than through the Panama Canal. The transport of oil in big tankers around the Cape is much cheaper than the use of small tankers through the Suez Canal. The question which may be put in this regard is why Russia wants to have the Suez Canal open and at the same time wants to lend a hand in the sea route around the Cape. When one studies Russia&#x2019;s world strategy, the answer is obvious, and that is that she <span class="col_1395-1396" refersTo="page_0715"/>wants be able to intimidate, blockade and take military action on both routes if it suits her. Attempts at belittling these dangers and at explaining them away, remind one of the words of the poet, &#x201C;Who can understand the language of the blind mole&#x003F;&#x201D; General Merchant, a well-known strategist, said quite rightly in respect of this point: &#x201C;Marxism, Leninism is an inflexible guide to action, but its dialectics lend itself to any innovation, any change, even to a paradox.&#x201D; With this pattern of infiltration, entrenchment, making themselves indispensable and eventual control, Moscow, Peking and their satellites are progressing in Africa at the expense of the West. I should like to reveal this process a little. Firstly, there is the granting of credit. In 1961 they granted credit to 12 countries in Africa, and in 1971 to 19 countries. In 1961 there were military agreements with three countries in Africa, and in 1971 with 14 countries. In 1961, Russia, China and their satellites had diplomatic missions in some form or other in 13 countries of Africa, and in 1971 in 35 countries. I should just like to mention a few examples of how this takes place: Through the Tanzam railway line, through Zanzibar harbour, through ammunition factories, through Russian-manufactured radar, through road construction programmes by China and other satellite countries in Zambia, through radio transmitters in Lusaka, through Red Chinese guidance in the construction of a shipyard in Congo Brazzaville, through Rumanian development projects in the Congo, through Bulgarian aid and through the development of several air bases, in respect of which the hon. member for Durban Point takes it amiss of me when I speak of them. As far as advisers and technical aid are concerned, I can mention that at present there are more than 20 000 Chinese in Tanzania and Zambia who have been trained economically, politically and militarily, and in addition there are hundreds of north Koreans doing one thing only, i.e. providing training in revolutionary methods. Some communistic state or other, particularly Russia and China, is involved as advisers in virtually all terrorist groups. All the Chinese in Tanzania are soldiers of the People&#x2019;s Army. These countries render military aid as well. Terrorist arms which are clearly of communistic origin (Russia, China, Czechoslovakia) are found on terrorists. Chinese presence in terrorist camps has been proved. Cubans have repeatedly been caught during terrorist operations. Furthermore, Russia supplies air transport to certain terrorists from East Africa to West Africa, and <i>vice versa.</i> Communistic organizations render financial aid to terrorists, sometimes under the cloak of Christianity. We know now that the Organization for African Unity openly associates itself with this aid and that only last year it said. &#x201C;The OAU congratulates the liberation movement in the territories under foreign domination and urges these movements to intensify their struggle &#x2026;&#x201D;. This is where co-operation is brought about. The plans against South Africa, the unconventional onslaught we are experiencing at present and the conventional onslaught being planned for the future, are being executed under communistic leadership, by Russia, China and their satellites. There can be no question about that; they are not fighting for the liberation of people, but for the enslavement of people. They are fighting for the enslavement of black people and for the extermination of White people who can help to bring about a high standard of living in South Africa. In this regard I should like to refer to another witness. We should all accept this witness. He is an internationally renowned surgeon who conducted an investigation in the Portuguese areas last year. He let me have a report of his impressions, of his findings and of his conclusions. I just want to quote a few sentences from this. They read as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">It was my privilege to visit all the areas concerned, to examine patients and to inspect equipment and to have conversations with doctors at all levels, and commanding officers &#x2026; One thing is clear without any doubt and that is that the communists are behind the entire terrorist activities and in this part of the world they are mainly Chinese communists. The tactics employed by them are to carry out a war of attrition whereby the Portuguese Government is to be exhausted by virtue of the expense and drainage of manpower &#x2026; It is obvious that the policy of the Chinese communists is to eliminate the Europeans by using the Black tribes for this purpose. If this were to succeed there would be inter-tribal warfare fanned by the Chinese in order to remove those Black Portuguese who are still loyal. Finally, the Chinese would wipe out the Blacks entirely or use them as slaves. In this way <span class="col_1397-1398" refersTo="page_0716"/>the Chinese hope to take over the entire country and eventually to work into Southern Africa as a whole &#x2026; The Western world need not wait in fear and trembling for the Third World War. It is with us now. When the Chinese railway between Tanzania and Zambia is completed, Africa will be swamped with the overflow of the Chinese. The coasts around Southern Africa are already patrolled by the Russians.</block>

<p>He went on to appeal to the Western world not to see this struggle as an isolated one against Southern Africa, but as a struggle in which the whole of the Western world was involved and to regard Southern Africa as an outpost of the West. This man gave me the right to use this report of his. In addition he gave me the right to mention his name. He is Dr. Jack Penn, a well-known surgeon whom all hon. members know.</p>

I believe that we should prepare ourselves not only in the military sphere, but on every other front, because it is a total struggle against Southern Africa. Furthermore, where the going has become heavy and where it sometimes seems as if things want to smother us, I believe we shall pull through with the united will of a people that wants to make of this country a bastion of freedom and strength against these powers closing in on us.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we looked forward with interest to the contribution of the hon. the Minister of Defence, because naturally he, as Minister of Defence, has better access to information than any hon. member on either side of the House. I am only sorry that the hon. the Minister saw fit, at the very beginning of his speech, to attack two speakers from this side of the House. One of the previous speakers, the hon. member for Durban Point, devoted three-quarters of his time to matters concerning defence and gave the very strongest support to the mover&#x2019;s motion. One of the relevant questions the hon. member put to the Minister was whether the latter had the fullest confidence that this side of the House was as opposed to communism and terrorism as that side of the House. He still owes us a reply to that question.</p>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the mover of this motion covered a very wide front. Naturally, every person on this side of the House supports what he said in connection with the dangers of terrorism and communism and their infiltration into South Africa. The hon. member covered a wide geographic area, and I do not want to repeat this all again. The point of discussion concerns the threat to Southern Africa. Naturally one must therefore deal with Southern Africa and not only the Republic of South Africa as such. The hon. member for Durban Point specifically mentioned that we long for the time when we shall conclude military treaties with the friendly elements to the north of us and when we shall have a South Atlantic deence treaty that we shall also be a member of. As the hon. the Minister mentioned, we all feel that Africa as such, and the southern point of Africa, is extremely important, strategically and otherwise. And this is inevitable. Continents are still separated at this stage by canals. Thus, for example, Europe and Africa are separated by the Suez Canal, which is still closed at this stage, and likewise North and South America are separated by the Panama Canal. Therefore the sea route round the Cape is the only one that can be used in times of war and peace, because the canals can easily be closed in times of war. In fact, the canals are so small that even if the Suez Canal, for example, were opened tomorrow, tankers of 100 000 tons and more could not pass through at all. This is therefore a strategic sea route.</p>

<p>I want to reiterate that in time of war this is the most important area of all. This area is not only a geographic dividing line, as the Minister indicated, it is also the dividing line between the East and the West. This has been the case throughout the centuries and will remain so.</p>

<p>As far as terrorism is concerned, it has struck those of us who are frequently in Rhodesia and Mozambique and have taken the trouble to go to their borders and see what is going on there, that to a very large extent they make use of their Black citizens along their borders for the defence of their country and the combating and fighting of terrorism. I purposely mention their Black citizens. If one travels along the Rhodesian borders one finds that a battalion consists of 120 Black Rhodesians under four White officers. According to reports these are the best defence methods they have throughout Rhodesia. Black citizens are used to a lesser extent in Mozambique, but even there a great deal of use is made of them. Naturally, if the Black population is roped in for this kind of defence, they will ensure that they glean the best information about, and form the best defence front against, any sort of terrorism there may be, in order to protect their homes, families, etc. The Black population is as much in danger from terrorism as the Whites, if not more so. Their homes and families are involved; naturally they will defend them. This brings me back to the Republic of South Africa and the policy of the present Government. When I speak of the policy of the present Government the hon. the Minister must understand&#x2014;and he also knows this&#x2014;that it is the right and the duty of the Opposition, in an important debate such as this, to point out to the Government aspects in its policy that can promote terrorism and communism. When I speak about aspects of that nature, hon. members may accuse me of promoting communism if they want to. The fact remains that it is the Opposition&#x2019;s right and duty to warn the Government. I want to come back to this Government&#x2019;s policy of disenfranchising every Black South African or Bantu, as we are requested to call them here in our country. When each one of the millions of them have been disenfranchised, they cannot and will never have the same loyalty and fidelity to the Republic of South Africa as they would have if they had not been disenfranchised. This is one of the reasons giving rise to the United Party&#x2019;s policy that these people remain citizens of South Africa. They must retain their loyalty to this country so that they will also want to defend it because their families and their property are involved. They must not all be disenfranchised and be allies of peoples that are far away from them and can never have the fidelity and that loyalty to the country that a citizen of this country has. It is incorporated in the policy of the Nationalist Party and the Government that the breeding ground for communism can be created because the Black population is disenfranchised. Hon. members opposite can argue just as much as they want to; the facts I am speaking about are familiar facts. If a country is not one&#x2019;s own, is not a part of what is one&#x2019;s own, and if one is not protecting one&#x2019;s own home and family, particularly if one&#x2019;s family is separated <span class="col_1401-1402" refersTo="page_0718"/>from one, it is surely logical that one will never have the loyalty with which to defend the country. That would surely be the breeding ground for communism. It cannot be otherwise. The population that is treated in that way will, in the first instance, become the breeding ground for the germs of communism. The best breeding ground for communism that one could possibly get is, as the hon. member for East London North said, a frustrated population. Frustration in the sphere of housing, salaries, employment opportunities and any basis that creates frustration amongst a population must necessarily be the best breeding ground for communism. As long as the Government follows this policy, the policy of the disenfranchisement of all Black people in the country&#x2014;I am not speaking about the Indians and the Coloureds&#x2014;and as long as the Bantu are made fellow citizens of another country, it is no use our saying that we shall follow terrorists right across our borders. The Prime Minister said we would follow terrorists right across our borders. Neither would it be any use saying that the Government reserves the right to grant assistance to any friendly State to the north of us which asks for it. Here, within our ranks, we are creating the position whereby foreign states are established. These states become independent states that carry within them the germ of communism or possible communist infiltration. Where does all the communism come from&#x003F;</p>

<p>Sir, we do not want to move an amendment. No one is more in favour of the combating of communism in Africa than this side of the House. The proof of that is that this side of the House is indicating to the Government in what respect its policy is dangerous and how it can take better action against communism. No one can argue against the fact that if the Government did not do what it is doing in terms of its ideological policy, one would not have the same dangers from communism in this country. Sir, we on this side are against communism, and this is incorporated in the policy of this Party. Every citizen of this country would like to see the situation under better control and would like to see us able to depend upon the loyalty of every citizen. It is because we want the loyalty of our people and because we want to combat communism more vigorously than the Government is doing, specifically because it has incorporated this disastrous element into its policy, that it is very easy for us to support this motion more strongly than any member opposite; we can do so because it is incorporated in our policy.</p>

<block name="quote">The danger of Communism to South Africa is obviously in the imagination of the Nationalist leaders.</block>

<p>&#x2026; about which they ought to be ashamed. Sir, here I have an extract from a document written by the Russian Academy of Science. The title of that document is &#x201C;The Political Parties of Africa&#x201D;, and I want to quote it as a comfort to the hon. member for Durban Point, because what does this academy of science of the Russian Government state&#x003F; It states (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">According to the new Russian evaluation of politics in Africa, the prohibited South African Communist Party has become the foremost revolutionary force in South Africa, and all other groups that have dedicated themselves to the idea of overthrowing the South African Government have joined forces around it.</block>

<p>And then these significant words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Parties such as the National Party in South Africa can only disappear from the political map of Africa by revolutionary violence.</block>

<p>That is what they are striving for. They want to break the National Party, and even the Russians tell them that the National Party is the only party that is a bastion against communism in Southern Africa.</p>

<p>While I was listening to speakers in this debate, the words of the late Adv. Eric Louw came to me and I went and wrote them down. He said this in 1961&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The aim of communist penetration on the continent of Africa is to create conditions of unrest and greater chaos in the emergent African states.</block>

<p>And we know how this earlier leader in South Africa fought there in foreign parts to state our case. He said he had evidence that people from South Africa had already beseeched Russia for military interference in South Africa. Communism does not only want to have possession of the country. At present they are active in Southern Africa, as another writer expressed it, &#x201C;to shape or warp minds, to touch or taint hearts, to douse and emploit emotions&#x201D;. Do you know, Sir, that Russia and China jointly broadcast to Africa for 2 500 hours a week to flood the minds of the inhabitants of Africa with communism, to penetrate their hearts&#x2014;Do you know that the Russian communist propaganda machine has spent R1 428 million per year in the past five years on propaganda in Africa via the radio, books and magazines, etc.&#x003F; Here in my hand I have a book. I do not know how it entered South Africa. It is a book about the North Korean communist leader, in which he rails at imperialism. It states, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1405-1406" refersTo="page_0720"/>There should be no illusion about imperialism.</block>

<p>You know, we of the Western world are &#x201C;imperialists&#x201D;, according to them&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There should be no illusion about imperialism. It is necessary for us to continuously intensify our anti-imperialist struggle, holding aloft the banner of revolution until imperialism is finally defeated.</block>

<p>Sir, I tell you we have the evidence of a man, the previous vice-president of America, Mr. David Newsom, who said after he had toured in Africa, that he had summed up the situation and observed three ideals in Africa, i.e. &#x201C;isolation, economic measures and the use of military force&#x201D;. And then there are many writers we could quote who say that there is one goal these people pursue, i.e. to overthrow the South African Government and, in their own words, &#x201C;to replace it by communist or popular front type r&#x00E9;gimes&#x201D;. Sir, let us rather ask the world at large, instead of telling each other, or instead of the Opposition telling us we are not doing our duty, what do the communists aim at&#x003F; In Southern Africa they aim, <i>inter alia,</i> at jeopardizing the Cabora-Bassa scheme and the Kunene scheme, two schemes costing more than R600 million, schemes where more than 5 million acres of land and industries can develop and be established. We struggle against the Frelimo danger that wants to create a second Vietnam in South Africa. We are striving to keep the communist danger out of Africa, a danger which would again make our continent a dark Africa, politically speaking.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am told my time is up. I say to you that we have a great word of thanks for this Government and the hon. the Minister of Defence for the competent, timely and vigorous action they are taking to safeguard us in South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#stephens">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. M. STEPHENS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I really want to try my best to come back to the motion. I do not want to react to what the hon. member said at the end of his speech. There is not much to find fault with there. But I do want to react to what he said in the beginning, i.e. that even the communists are now saying that the National Party is the only bastion against communism in South Africa. I fear the National Party and hon. members opposite are now making the same mistake Pres. Nixon almost made. It was clear, when they began with the politicking during the presidential elections, that Pres. Nixon had tried to smear the Democratic Party, and his opponents, by saying that by their actions they were in favour of, and actually the cause of, the licence, lawlessness and infiltration that took place in America. He had to drop that very quickly because he found that the people immediately turned against him. I know that hon. members opposite will possibly not stop carrying on in that manner because I do not believe they have the insight to know when the people are turning against them. I do not believe that the people are interested at all in those trash and smear stories of theirs.</p>

<p>The hon. member&#x2019;s motion states that this House expresses its concern about the increasing infiltration of communism into Southern Africa, etc. That is all true, and we do have reason for concern. By way of many examples and many arguments several hon. members indicated to us this afternoon that Russia and China are both very interested in South Africa. If I must mention a point of criticism on the motion as such it would only be that the motion is limited to the concern about the infiltration in Southern Africa. Yet it is very clear, <i>inter alia,</i> from what the hon. the Minister said that the infiltration is not only taking place in Southern Africa, but throughout the whole of Africa. Our concern should therefore extend to the infiltration anywhere in Africa, because our lot is involved in that of the whole of Africa. Any infiltration into Africa is therefore reason for our concern.</p>

<p>The communists also know that Southern Africa, particularly the Republic, will be the most difficult part for them to conquer. And I think that is consequently the only reason why we are receiving special attention at this stage. That is why I want to associate myself with what the hon. the Minister said, i.e. that we are only an outpost in a world-wide struggle.</p>

<p>I recently met a person who had, up to five years ago, lived in Hong Kong. He told me that the Chinese communist youth spoke openly there about their strategy in Africa. Hon. members must remember that these things were said five years ago. They said that as communists they must try to get a country in Central Africa for <span class="col_1407-1408" refersTo="page_0721"/>them to take over, through their influence and help. They were to try and draw a belt from West to East Africa and obtain a harbour on each side of the coast. That was before Tanzania and all the other countries came into the picture. From what they said then, it is very clear that this is their policy exactly, and that is precisely what they are doing. They thus began in Tanzania, where they already have a harbour on the East coast of Africa. Now they are shifting to Zambia, and it appears to me as if the next point will be Zaire. If they capture Zaire they have their strip across Africa. Their tactics then will be to infiltrate further to the South and the North from this mid-base, i.e. the belt they have drawn across the middle of Africa. We therefore have enough reason for concern.</p>

<p>And yet I want to assure the hon. member for Middelburg that if it merely remains a matter of concern, it would be of no use to us. In this House we can pilot through motions about our concern and speak about the seriousness of the situation until we are blue in the face. This would not delay the attack on us one second. It would not reduce the danger one little bit. The hon. member for Middelburg quoted a tremendous number of facts to indicate to us the degree of our suggested concern; but that is merely basic. The important question is what possible steps can be taken for the prevention and combatting of this danger. That is what is important, not the fact that we are concerned, because that we have been for along time. Regarded from that point of view the question arises as to what we are going to do to combat it and what our actions in this connection are going to be. In this we unfortunately received no guidance from the hon. member or the Minister.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. M. STEPHENS</person>:</from>

<p>I am going to make a few suggestions to the hon. member. We have sent troops to the border, but that alone cannot be the solution; that is only the minimum we can do to check the real physical infiltration. I believe that there are several other channels of action that are open to us and must be properly investigated. Hon. members on this side of the House have already mentioned several measures for the consolidation of our internal security and in connection with the actions of the people. However, I also want to say that the firmer our foreign relations are, the stronger we stand against the aggressors. Therefore the outgoing policy of the hon. the Prime Minister is indeed a good one; but one would like to see it implemented more dynamically at present. At the moment we see nothing more happening. The hon. the Prime Minister said he was ready for dialogue, but as far as one can see nothing more is taking place as far as the dialogue is concerned.</p>

<p>I venture to say that we shall always be able to handle terrorist activities that are taking place on our borders, as they are at present, provided we do everything to consolidate our internal position. If an internal guerilla war takes place, i.e. a war with the support of the internal population, it is extremely difficult if not impossible to combat such a war. We must therefore always retain the support of our internal population. That is very clear. In Spain even Napoleon could not overcome that internal guerrilla warfare. As a result of that consolidation we shall be moving on a firm foundation.</p>

<p>However, we must guard against an escalation of the struggle and lake precautions against that, and in this connection particularly with respect to Peking. When its position in Africa is consolidated in terms of its stated policy and it feels itself to be on a firm foundation, a more direct confrontation could&#x2014;I do not say will&#x2014;develop between Peking and other Africa states, particularly ourselves. In this connection we must bear in mind that Peking is now a nuclear power. Other nuclear powers are very wary of escalation in such a case. We saw what happened in Korea and Vietnam: that where America, openly intervened, they were reluctant and in reality did not come openly to the assistance of their allies in North Korea and North Vietnam. That is because these nations, as the hon. the Minister also said, are afraid of a nuclear war escalation. The same could happen here if Peking takes open action against us, i.e. that the other nations of the West, which are well-disposed to us, would possibly not openly and positively hasten to our aid in the light of possible escalation. We have only one way out. We must make an open confrontation extremely unattractive to Peking. Such a confrontation must be too costly and impossible for Peking.</p>

<p><span class="col_1409-1410" refersTo="page_0722"/>&#x2020;Such a state of affairs can be ensured by strengthening and improving our own arsenal, but especially through collective security. Here we have what I feel is a very great opportunity to take the initiative in canvassing for an organization for the collective security of all the anti-communist states in the Southern Hemisphere. We need to create and protect a southern polarity.</p>

<p>After the Second World War the old policy of the <i>status quo</i> was impossible to maintain and an East-West polarity ensued with a built-in balance of power. Actually it was not a balance of power as much as a balance of fear, because of the ultimate weapon, nuclear power, which both possessed. Even if parity does not exist between the two polarities, there is still the mutual fear of second-strike capability which ensures peace to the greatest extent, because of this balance of fear. On the other hand I believe that the term &#x201C;East-West polarity&#x201D; is actually a misnomer, since in both cases all the power overbalanced into the Northern Hemisphere. This left the Southern Hemisphere virtually unprotected and almost fair game, as it were. I believe that we need to call upon all nations of the Southern Hemisphere that are anti-communistic to stand together and to take action for our collective security, to create a southern-hemispherical polarity of power to balance the monopoly of power in the Northern Hemisphere. I believe that we in South Africa at this stage are in a unique position to take the initiative today, and every thought in this direction should be welcomed and encouraged to the greatest extent. I believe that it is in the collective security of such an organization that we will be able to get the sort of power together on our side which will have the necessary deterrent effect towards any aggressor, whether it wishes to aggress in South Africa or in any part of Africa.</p>

<p>As I have said, it is obvious that acts of terrorism on our borders as such can be contained. I believe that we have the necessary moral strength, arms, equipment, knowledge and know-how to contain any such aggression. Our greatest problem lies in an escalation and in an open confrontation. I do not believe that there is any possibility of this now, but that is why we must prepare now, because we need time, and time is on our side at this stage. But we must now decide what steps must be taken and can be taken for any possibility. We must try and keep all possibilities in mind in future, and we must try to see what steps can be taken and take them while we still have the time, while we still have our options open. I believe that in collective security lies our only salvation for the future.</p>

<heading>LAW RELATING TO ABORTION</heading>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move the motion standing in my name, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That a Select Committee be appointed to inquire into and report upon the law relating to abortion, the Committee to have power to take evidence and call for papers and to have leave to submit legislation.</block>

<p>Firstly, I would like to give the House a definition of what abortion is. The law applicable to abortion in South Africa is set out in <i>South African Criminal Law and Procedure,</i> Gardiner Stansdown, Volume II, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The crime of procuring abortion is committed by any person who, with the object of defeating the ordinary course of gestation, wilfully, applies to a pregnant woman any means by which the untimely expulsion of the foetus is effected.</block>

<p>There is comment on this definition, and this comment can be found particularly on page 308 of the same volume. In South Africa there is no specific Act dealing with abortion. In our country abortion is dealt with as a crime against a person or potential person. The prohibitions regarding abortion have in the main been based on religious beliefs, particularly on the sixth Commandment, &#x201C;Thou shalt not kill&#x201D;. From time immemorial abortion has been a problem and is dealt with in the Hippocratic Oath. Medical opinion has, however, never been considered, until recently, in the drawing up of legislation dealing with abortions. It is not my intention to argue the case for or against religious beliefs, religious instruction or the religious faith of a person. Any change in law must on no account interfere with the religious beliefs of any individual. If the law is changed and if abortion is considered by <span class="col_1411-1412" refersTo="page_0723"/>this House to be less than totally prohibitive, the person who has deep religious beliefs will have the option to adhere to his religious beliefs or to take the opportunity that is offered by any change in the law.</p>

<p>Prohibitions can be very stringent and can cause great hardship. It is felt that the hardships which can be brought about by this prohibition should be aired. The famous gynaecologist Alec Bourne informed the authorities in England in 1937 that he was going to procure an abortion on a girl of 13 who had been raped by some soldiers. Following on this operation, he was arrested and tried. He was tried by Justice MacLachlan and found not guilty and discharged. But Justice MacLachlan posed another question. He said that if a doctor refuses to perform the operation when it is necessary to save the mother&#x2019;s life and in consequence she dies, the doctor could then be convicted of manslaughter. This was the problem.</p>

<p>In most countries, certainly not in all, some degree of break-away from this strong prohibition now exists. I will give the House some of the changes that have taken place in various countries, so that we can see how the thoughts on abortion are changing. There is absolute prohibition in Belgium and Ireland. If there is a threat to a woman&#x2019;s life, abortion is allowed in Albania, Austria, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. On medical grounds it is allowed in France, the German Federal Republic, and Switzerland. On medical, eugenic and/or humanitarian grounds it is allowed in the German Democratic Republic, Greece and Rumania. For medical social and eugenic reasons it is allowed in Great Britain. For medical social, eugenic and humanitarian reasons it is allowed in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden; where social grounds as well as the above are found as a contributory reason for abortion it is allowed in Czechoslovakia, Poland and Yugoslavia. On request, or as they call it now &#x201C;on demand&#x201D;, it is allowed in Bulgaria, Hungary, the USSR, New York State, Washington State, Hawaii, Alaska and also in Japan and Hong Kong. The changing attitudes of persons concerned in studying this problem is illustrated by an investigation that has been conducted through the Society of Clinical Psychiatrists. This society sent out a questionnaire to all its members throughout the world. This was done in 1967 and repeated in 1971. They asked certain questions, e.g. whether they were in favour of free choice,</p>

<p>&#x201C;on demand&#x201D;, if a woman comes during the first three months of pregnancy. The second question they posed was if a woman&#x2019;s life or health was seriously threatened, plus other social and economic circumstances. The third question was termination for health or life reasons only without any other circumstances being taken into consideration. Lastly, complete prohibition. To illustrate the changing attitude of the people, we notice that in 1967 24 per cent of the people voted in favour of abortion on demand. In 1971, four years later, this figure had risen to 42 per cent. Termination, if the mother&#x2019;s life or health is seriously threatened&#x2014;56 per cent in 1967. This percentage fell to 49 per cent in 1971.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. DE V. MORRISON</person>:</from>

<p>Where was this survey done&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>The survey was done by this organization at the headquarters in England, but the members who were asked to participate were members who were practising throughout the world. In the third case 16 per cent were for termination for health reasons in 1967. This figure dropped to 7,25 per cent in 1971. Lastly, 4 per cent were in favour of total prohibition in 1967 as against 1,5 per cent in 1971. It is quite clear therefore that there is an increasing feeling amongst psychiatrists throughout the world that abortion should be allowed in the first three months of pregnancy. That does not mean to say that I agree with this. But I want to illustrate to the House that there is a change of thought about what was once totally prohibited. There is now a greater liberalism in thought in this regard. We have recently been made aware in this country of the problem that abortion poses in South Africa, by the facts and findings of a case that recently took place in the Transvaal where a doctor was charged with procuring an abortion on a child who was raped by her brothers. The family history was one of mental retardedness throughout. The doctor performed the abortion in good faith. He was acquitted of the charge against him. We feel this was done on therapeutic grounds. Therapeutic grounds in this case meant not only danger to the mother, not only the bringing into the world of an unwanted child, but also the danger that a child might be brought into the world who would mentally be so retarded that it would be unable to fend for itself at any time and hence become a burden on the State. The State apparently <span class="col_1413-1414" refersTo="page_0724"/>is not satisfied with the findings. I understand that there will be an appeal. In any event, it brings to light the difficulties with which we are faced when even one or more doctors suggest in good faith that it is dangerous for a woman or unreasonably risky for a woman to have a child. When they recommend that such a woman&#x2019;s pregnancy be ended, the doctor who does the operation may still be charged.</p>

<p>What do we find&#x003F; Let us consider the position as we who are in the profession know it. When a woman falls pregnant we consider whether there are any abnormal circumstances associated with the pregnancy. We think about her and any concurrent illnesses she may be suffering from at the time of her pregnancy. What do we do if a woman is suffering for instance from incurable cancer and falls pregnant&#x003F; What do we do when she is seriously mentally deranged and falls pregnant&#x003F; What do we do when her heart and kidneys are so affected that continuance of her pregnancy may cause her death&#x003F; What do we do when there is such mental stress that the woman herself may attempt to commit suicide if abortion is not done&#x003F; What do we do when there is a risk of permanent damage to the woman, often inflicted by herself in an attempt to procure an abortion on herself for one reason or another&#x003F; We know that such a woman attempts that abortion in the full knowledge that she may permanently damage herself, that she will certainly attempt, perhaps successfully or not, to kill the child that she does not want. Lastly, she is prepared to take the risk of dying in the attempt to procure the abortion. There are figures which show that in Johannesburg from the year 1959 to 1964 there were 302 deaths from abortion. This is a large number of people that have died as a result of this. We know what has been happening lately. Very few women are not aware of the risks that they take when they fall pregnant and wish to continue the pregnancy. They know full well that they may bring into the world a child who may be permanently deformed, physically or mentally. This could happen, if a woman took or was given certain drugs, especially those in the tranquillizer group. We know the case of the thalidomides and the results of that. A woman may become infected with a virus such as German measles. A woman may have to be X-rayed for one reason or another, knowing that the baby may be affected by the X-rays. Are we going to stand by and let these children come into the world&#x003F; Are we going to stand by and let these mothers live under all that stress and strain because abortion is prohibited&#x003F; Whatever article you read today which deals with such a subject, most plead that the women who fall pregnant at such a time should be relieved of the anxiety of continued pregnancy. There is chapter and verse to tell us what permanent damage is being done to these women. Besides that, is it fair to bring such children into the world, children born deaf, blind, dumb, without arms, without legs&#x003F; I say to the hon. the Minister that he, with the knowledge that he possesses, with the information in his hands, must consider favourably what I am asking for. I am not taking sides in this matter at this stage. I am only putting the facts before the House. It is not only for me to know what is happening, but those people who are interested in the present state of affairs, especially those in this House where the laws are made and where laws are changed, should also be given an opportunity of hearing from the experts what their views are. After they have heard the evidence and weighed it, they must come to the Minister and say to him: &#x201C;We think the time has come for a change. What can you do to help&#x003F;&#x201D;</p>

<p>In England there is a law which deals specifically with abortion. It was adopted in 1967. Before I come to that, I want to tell the House that I do not think a change in the law of this country will lower the number of abortions that are being carried out. However, what I do know is that if therapeutic abortion is allowed and is as clearly stated as in this Act to which I have referred, then, I know, a number of mothers will live who might easily have died through an illegal abortion. I know that far fewer crippled children, deformed mentally and physically, will be brought into the world.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, those that we know of.</p>

<p>I will not bore the House with further statistics. We all know about the incidence of abortion and can read about it for ourselves. What I want to say again is that where we have these special cases such as I have enumerated and where children have been raped and are pregnant or where children have become pregnant through incest, surely they must be helped. Can we stand by and allow these people to have their children&#x003F; The other extreme is abortion on demand where, for any reason, women want to do away with their babies. I think that that is just as bad as preventing a woman from having an abortion on therapeutic grounds. I want to say to the House that it is not my intention to suggest &#x2014;and I am sure that everyone will agree with me&#x2014;that abortion should become an alternative to contraception. Abortion must not become the means of controlling the population explosion. If that were to be a reason for abortion, we might as well go again to the other extreme of increasing the death rate because there are too many people in the world. That I do not believe in. The fact that more and more people are using up more and more of the earth&#x2019;s resources is not a reason for legalizing abortion. That is a problem for people who are dealing with the population explosion and it is up to them to find ways and means of educating the population of how best to plan a family.</p>

<p>I have said that I do not think legalizing abortion here for some reason or another is going to lower the incidence of abortion.</p>

<p>It will not bring down the figures. However, I do feel, as I have said a moment ago, that it is time for this House to hear the opinion of religious bodies on this matter. I think it is time for this House to hear the opinion of the medical profession. I would particularly like to hear how the legal people feel about it. I want to hear also what the women&#x2019;s organizations have to say. I want to hear the opinion of the ordinary man in the street. For those reasons I move my motion.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. V. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the literature on the pros and cons of therapeutic abortion must by now virtually fill an average-sized library. Every expert in every field has had his say&#x2014; some by invitation, some unasked. Each and every one has had his say and yet we are no nearer to a solution. The legal experts have put their case. The obstetricians and gynaecologists have held numerous conferences. Even the World Medical Association has on many occasions discussed this very same matter. In 1970 the World Medical Association issued a directive, called the Declaration of Oslo. Even that is only a directive and the problem has not been solved. The churches and the humanists have from time to time raised their voices, but to no avail. In some countries the laws against abortion have been abolished. In other countries they have been relaxed and in yet other countries laws against abortion have been steadfastly retained. In these countries all abortions are illegal. The protagonists of therapeutic abortion have made use of the available statistics to try to prove their case. The antagonists on the other hand have made use of the same statistics to try to prove their case, to try to convince people that the moves and laws can never be relaxed or even slightly relaxed. The only fact that seems certain is the law, that law which the hon. member proposes should be examined. The law at present does not reflect the opinion of the public, as he has proved by his statistics. I am sure that it does not reflect the average opinion of the medical fraternity in South Africa. It must be agreed that the law as it stands today sometimes puts the doctor who handles a case in a most unenviable position, a position where he is almost forced to break the law in following approved medical principles. Why then, when it comes to thearapeutic abortion, do we seem to be stymied&#x003F; Where are we going and what is the answer&#x003F;</p>

<p><span class="col_1417-1418" refersTo="page_0726"/>*In order to analyse this problem fundamentally, one has to consider it from three points of view. In the first place there is the religious point of view, in the second place the scientific point of view, and in the third place there is what I want to call the humanist point of view. Under the humanist point of view I include the sociological, the socio-economic and the economic points of view. As far as the religious aspect of the matter is concerned, this is perhaps the easiest aspect of all. Almost all religions accept that man&#x2019;s soul develops at one stage or another and that it has a continued existence in the hereafter. It does not matter whether the religions differ from one another, this fact is accepted and it would serve no purpose to argue about these particulars. The scientific problem is also easy. Medicine has developed to such an extent that they can now determine whether problems may under certain circumstances arise for the mother and other circumstances for the child. Consequently they can even take these various symptoms, send them through a computer, and the answer will come out on the other side. In the third place there is the viewpoint of the humanists. They can discuss what is in the interests of humanity; they can discuss what is in the interests of that person, and they can even consider the economic factors which are involved. In this way some of them have calculated that if a baby is born from a mother who had German measles, he will at the age of 20 have cost the State approximately R76 000 because of two cataract operations, an open heart operation and a bilateral hernia operation which he will have had to undergo. Even calculations of this nature have been made. That is why I say that the problem can be approached from all these different angles. If we had been able to see each of these scientific, religious and humanist problems separately, the problem would have been easily solved, but our problem lies in the fact that every person, every individual, every doctor himself harbours within his own mind, within his innermost thoughts, more than one of these elements, so that he really unleashes a conflict within himself. The church may be dogmatic and say that life may never be destroyed, but I belive that the more intelligent members of the church&#x2014;they may not include the minister&#x2014;cannot ignore science completely. As far as the scientists are concerned, I do not believe that you will find in South Africa that a doctor will get up at a congress and say: &#x201C;Let us forget all these fairy tales of the life hereafter and concentrate on scientific facts.&#x201D; There may be one here and there who feels this way, but I believe that he would in any case be unable to convince the great majority of other people. That is our problem. Almost the same can be said of the humanist. He can argue about all these problems from an economic point of view; he can argue about them from a sociological point of view; he can argue about them from the point of view of a population explosion, and let me say at once that I cannot but agree with the hon. member for Rosettenville one hundred per cent. The plan adopted by the Japanese in legalizing abortion on demand for the purpose of trying to prevent a population explosion in this way, so much so that one or more abortions are performed for every living child born in Japan today, has in any case, not solved their problem of population explosion. But I think these are two things that have to be separated from each other. Even that humanist cannot get away from the idea within himself that there is another side to this matter. Hence this real problem, this threefold problem the various parts of which we cannot consider separately, that within the being of every person there is this conflict which he first has to solve for himself, and if he cannot solve this problem for himself, then you can understand, Sir, how difficult he will find it to persuade outsiders to accept his point of view.</p>

<p>Sir, I am not going to try to suggest a solution here. I think that would be unfair; I do not think I should be competent to do so at this stage either. I can tell you my point of view. But &#x00CF; am going to leave it at that. Sir, I should like to leave it to my colleagues on this side of the House to continue the discussion of this matter.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is quite obvious from what the hon. member for Fauresmith has said that he believes, too, that the time has come when this whole matter should be the subect of investigation, and I want to associate myself with the motion put forward in the name of the hon. member for Rosettenville. I believe that he has made an excellent case this afternoon for the favourable consideration of the Minister.</p>

<p>I believe that when one considers a subject of this nature, it is desirable to bear in mind at least four factors. I believe firstly that one must examine as far as possible <span class="col_1419-1420" refersTo="page_0727"/>the present position, and take into consideration facts and statistics where they are known and where they exist; secondly, that one has to deal with the trend in other countries (and this, I believe, has been adequately covered by the hon. member for Rosettenville) thirdly that one has to consider the attitude of the professions, and particularly of the medical profession which has such a vital part to play in a matter of this nature, the attitude of the churches, of social welfare services, of various bodies, associations and individuals, I believe, fourthly, that one cannot ignore the effects of abortion on the population explosion. Before I deal with these in the limited time at my disposal, I would like to look back to man&#x2019;s wrestling with the problem of abortion which goes back to the pre-Christian era, centuries before the birth of Christ. We have in recorded history the Hippocrates collection and the Hippocratic oath which saw the light of day in the fourth century B.C., and I wish to quote just one sentence from the oath of those days. This is what it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I will give no deadly drug to any, though it be asked of me, nor will I counsel such, and especially I will not aid a woman to procure abortion.</block>

<p>I believe, Sir, it is fitting in these modem times to pay tribute to the medical profession because I believe that they have adopted a responsible and cautious attitude to any suggested changes in legislation affecting abortion. As a pharmacist I can claim to have some knowledge of the tragedies and the mishaps which have occurred through the abuse and misuse of alleged nostrums which in themselves are available from day to day under normal circumstances, but which are abused in the hope of procuring an abortion through these means. I also have some knowledge of the back-alley untrained abortionists and the evil which they perpetrate against society.</p>

<p>I want to come back, Sir, to certain facts and statistics because I believe they have a bearing on the request which my colleague has made to the Minister. I have selected my facts, as far as possible, from a world-wide publication which could be regarded as an authoritative work of reference in most spheres. It is estimated that from 10 to 20 per cent of all pregnancies terminate as abortions, but it is also interesting to note the claim that is made that the frequency of therapeutic abortions is decreasing rapidly with the advances of medical knowledge and with the improvement in medical treatment. But, Sir, when it comes to the question of illegal abortion or induced abortion, it is a question of using estimates. I am told that in the mid-fifties in the United States of America the figure for illegal abortions carried out annually ranged between 500 000 and 700 000. One also reads that in Japan, where induced abortion is practised, the number of induced abortions in the mid-fifties was reported to be approaching 2 million and also that sterilization of women was on the increase. It is interesting to travel west a little, to Europe, and to consider the position in Rumania, where abortions were permitted on demand. The position was that for several years the Rumanian birthrate, as a result of this, claimed the signal distinction of being the lowest in the world, and the authorities in their concern, did away with this form of abortion. As a result the birth-rate more or less doubled, although it was considered, in all fairness, that this increase may not have been of a permanent nature. Sir, we have other facts and other estimates. We are told that in Italy, for example, the annual figure for abortions approaches 1,5 million. My colleague, the hon. member for Rosettenville, has dealt with various aspects of legislation concerning abortion and it is interesting to see that many countries have over the years reconsidered their attitude and that there has been reform and relaxation to a certain extent in the conditions which apply to what is known as therapeutic abortion. Although reference has been made to the factors which entitle the performance of therapeutic abortion, I feel it fitting to refer to them again to make it quite clear to this House what is implied by therapeutic abortion.</p>

<p>Firstly it is permissible when there is danger to the life and health, both physical or mental, of the mother; secondly, when there is a substantial risk that a child may be born with abnormalities which could cause a serious handicap: thirdly, if a mother&#x2019;s capacity is seriously taxed by the care of the coming child or of other children; and, fourthly, in the case of a pregnant woman who is either mentally defective, under the age of sixteen, or who is pregnant as the result of rape.</p>

<p>Reference has been made to the question of religion and the churches attitudes and it is quite apparent that there has been a great deal of soul-searching and rethinking <span class="col_1421-1422" refersTo="page_0728"/>in so far as many of the churches are concerned. The information which I quote is by no means exhaustive, but I wish to refer to some of the churches in other lands to give some indication of the trend of thinking in this direction.</p>

<p>Let us take for example Canada. The General Council of the United Church of Canada decided in 1966 to approve therapeutic abortion, but it laid down specified safeguards in giving that approval. Then we have the Protestant Episcopal Church in the U.S.A. At the church&#x2019;s triennial convention in 1967, approval was given for the removal of legal restrictions against therapeutic abortion in cases of rape and incest. Then in contrast in 1968, in so far as the Roman Catholic faith was concerned, we had a statement by Pope Paul VI in which he announced the banning of abortion and of direct sterilization of either sex but in the same year we had the American Baptist Convention adopting a resolution which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the termination of pregnancy prior to the end of the 12th week at the request of the individuals concerned, be permitted.</block>

<p>According to my information, in so far as the Jewish faith in America is concerned, we find that the American Rabbinate was divided on the U.S. Abortion Laws. The Orthodox section regarded abortion as sinful, whereas the conservative and reformed congregations maintained that the decision should really be in accordance with the dictates of the conscience of the parents.</p>

<p>When we come to consider these various aspects&#x2014;and all of them need very serious consideration&#x2014;I believe we can come to some conclusions. The facts reveal that there is generally a trend towards reform; that in so far as the churches are concerned, and the medical profession is concerned, the steps in this direction are cautious, well-directed and slow. But I believe that some of the factors amongst many others which could influence this concern could be cited as follows: Firstly, there is the question of the population explosion, a matter which is of growing concern to all nations on this planet. Then there is an increase in the incidence of illegitimate births, and I believe too that the more permissive approach to sex is an aspect which cannot be ignored.</p>

<p>Then, from a medical aspect, there is, too, a development in regard to a drug which appears to a large extent to have overcome many of the hazards of therapeutic abortion. I am referring to the report on the intravenous infusion of Prostaglandin&#x2014; which I believe can be conducted without risk to the patient and in cases, where necessary, with reliable and satisfactory results. So when we consider all these facets and aspects I believe that the time has come for us in South Africa to ask the State to carry out an investigation to consider the modern developments and trends and to take cognizance of the opinions expressed and I believe that this request can be well achieved by this motion of the hon. member for Rosettenville. I fully support it and I draw the attention of the House to the opinion expressed by the hon. the Prime Minister last week in a previous debate when he was at pains to emphasize the responsible task which lay before select committees of this hon. House. I have much pleasure in supporting the motion of my hon. colleague.</p>

<speech by="#morrison">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. de V. MORRISON</person>:</from>

<p>Right at the outset I want to express my appreciation of the responsible spirit evinced here in the discussion of this motion. Sir, we are dealing here with a very delicate subject, a subject touching on many moral aspects of our lives. That is why it behoves us as representatives in this House to approach this matter in a very serious light.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville indicated in his speech that since the Second World War new laws regarding the regulation of abortion have appeared on the Statute Books of many countries of the world as a result of a moral revolution and the winds of permissivity blowing throughout the world. Almost without exception all those laws, or most of them, had the effect of liberalizing existing laws which were for the most part of a restrictive nature. Laws were made which had the effect of making abortions far more freely available to people. The effect of many of those laws was to lift all restrictions, as happened in Japan and in certain states of the U.S.A., for example. In many countries the laws were drawn up in such a way that although they were to a certain extent restrictive the provisions of those laws were stated so widely that there was almost no question of restrictions. The hon. member for Rosettenville read out to us the law as <span class="col_1423-1424" refersTo="page_0729"/>placed on the Statute Book in England in 1967, and it was clear from that, when one makes a study of that law, that one could rather speak of regulation of abortions through medical ethics than through statutory provisions. This consequently led to an almost tenfold increase in abortions in England during the last few years. Now, it is not strange that we in South Africa, under these circumstances, also feel ourselves called upon to see what the situation is regarding abortion in this country.</p>

<p>We have no statutory provision or any statutory measure which legalizes any form of abortion. Therefore it is time we had a look at the situation in our country. The spotlight should also fall on what we ought to do in this respect. It is not strange that several symposiums have already been held since 1965, for the most part arranged by medical practitioners, to focus attention on this matter. Although there were calls at these symposiums for the liberalization of our attitude towards abortion, one feels very grateful that the papers delivered at the symposiums testified for the most part to a scientific approach and to the maintenance of high ethical and moral norms, and generally speaking there was no question of the liberalization of our abortion laws.</p>

<p>The question of abortion may be approached from two specific angles or points of view, on the one hand the conservative standpoint or the purely moralistic standpoint, that any form of abortion whatever its nature and for whatever reason, is illegal and wrong and should therefore not be condoned or allowed. Far to the left of this we find the other standpoint, the ultraliberal standpoint that a person should be free to carry out or to undergo an abortion at will. In other words, when a woman, whether she is married or not, falls pregnant she must have the right to undergo an abortion. The choice must be hers and hers alone. The facilities must be readily available. What it really amounts to is that she is entitled to this facility of abortion. That is more or less the situation in Japan today. I do not think that either of these two extreme standpoints is correct or valid. To my mind it is a serious question whether either one of these two divergent standpoints is in any way justified or morally justifiable. It would be a bad day if we, in our evaluation of the merits of abortion legislation, allowed ourselves to be lead by the permissivity of the times and if we allowed ourselves to be dragged along by the powers of evil which are the cause of the moral revolution. Similarly we would be shamefully neglecting our duty if we simply shrugged our shoulders and said that abortion was evil and left it at that. Too many Christian considerations, ethical principles and moral considerations are at stake simply to dismiss the matter with a shrug of the shoulder. I believe therefore that the balanced view, the standpoint which will stand the test of high Christian standards and principles, one which is justifiable on moral grounds and one which will comply with the high ethical norms of the medical profession, most probably lies somewhere between the two extremes I have referred to.</p>

<p>We must not allow the emphasis to fall on the number of abortions which are being performed, legally or illegally, today. The Government of a country can never compromise with what is wrong and remedy it by introducing legislation to condone it. It would in my opinion be a very bad mistake, and certainly not the course we ought to adopt. In our merit evaluation of abortion we must clearly realize, as the <i>Kerkbode</i> of 4th August, 1971, stated it, that we are with this venturing into the realm of medical and Christian ethics, a realm where it is essential that the Scriptural principles and religious convictions should be thoroughly explored, clearly understood and honestly applied. The same leading article in the <i>Kerkbode</i> goes on to state (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; we trust &#x2026; that the Scriptural principles which relate to, and the ethical principles which the Christian churches subscribe to, will not be overlooked when it comes to the consideration and formulation of laws to regulate abortion. We may not allow this phenomenon to be afforded an opportunity of getting out of hand here and assuming the proportions which it has already assumed in other parts of the world.</block>

<p>As has already been said, South Africa has no statutory provision which legalizes abortion. In an article which appeared in the <i>Medical Journal</i> of 20th July, 1968, Prof. Strauss states the situation as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Of all the disciplines that are involved in therapeutic abortion, the law&#x2014;in South Africa as well as in some other <span class="col_1425-1426" refersTo="page_0730"/>countries&#x2014;has been the least outspoken and probably the most negative in its approach. The reason for this must be sought in the nature of law and of the legal profession.</block>

<p>Provision in regard to illegal abortion does in fact exist in our law, as has already been mentioned by the hon. member for Rosettenville. There is therefore no general rule. Every case of therapeutic abortion must therefore be dealt with on its own merits. <i>Gardiner and Lansdowne</i> state it thus&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No crime is committed in those instances in which an obstetrician, under the clear dictates of his science, decides that the removal of a foetus is necessary to save the life of the mother &#x2026;</block>

<p>But unfortunately it is not as simple as that. Therapeutic abortion is sometimes indicated not only in cases of pregnancy where the life of the mother is threatened, but often, too, in cases where the pregnancy could give rise to serious physical or mental complications and permanent damage. As the law reads at present the medical practitioners who perform an abortion under these circumstances run the risk of criminal prosecution, however ethically defendable his action may have been. It is also clear that no provision is made for therapeutic abortion in cases where there is a real danger that the foetus will at birth be seriously deformed or will have a mental deficiency. These cases occur where pregnant mothers contract german measles in the first trimester of pregnancy. In general it can therefore be said that therapeutic abortion is almost in every case a potential crime and is regarded as such by our law. Because this is the situation our medical practitioners frequently find themselves in a very serious dilemma. They are often forced, as a result of the circumstances, to compromise with their conscience. To any rightminded and conservative medical practitioner the performance of an abortion is an extremely serious matter because he, more than anyone else, is deeply aware of the wonder of God&#x2019;s creation&#x2014;life itself&#x2014; and does not lightly want to put an end to any form of life. The conflict between the respect he has for life, God&#x2019;s creation, and the interests of the mother frequently lead to soulrending situations for the medical practitioner. When this element of a possible crime also appears in the picture, the situation sometimes becomes unendurable for the medical practitioner.</p>

<p>The Government therefore has an important duty to regulate this matter of abortion by way of statute, in order to eliminate the present uncertainty. Medical practitioners are entitled to this protection which the law can offer them. But similarly women as well have the right to be protected by the law. For many women it is an emotional and physical disaster when her pregnancy has to be terminated for valid and ethical reasons. When, as is at present the case, the stigma of a possibly unlawful deed attaches to the operation, the position for them as well becomes unendurable.</p>

<p>In my opinion the Government has every right to lead us as members of the public and to indicate to us by way of legislation how far it is prepared to go in this matter. After all, the Government is also the guardian of the morals of the people. It is part of the duty of the Government to indicate to its supporters and fellow-citizens how far it wants to go in such an important matter. That is why I feel that a Select Committee, as requested by this motion, is not necessary at this stage. I want to concede that when the hon. the Minister comes forward with legislation in which he will indicate how far he is prepared to go in this matter, it will be time enough to refer such a Bill to a Select Committee to hear evidence from all the persons and bodies concerned.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I shall take a line somewhat different from the line so far proposed in this House. The hon. member for Rosettenville has asked for a Select Committee of inquiry, and the hon. member for Cradock, who has just sat down, says he does not want a Select Committee. He wants the Government to come forward with legislation which could then be referred to a Select Committee. I think there is a case for an inquiry into this whole bristling question of abortion; but I would want the inquiry to be conducted by an independent judicial commission. Quite frankly, I do not believe that this House is capable of providing the cross-section of experts that I believe should sit on such a commission of inquiry. I believe even the doctors in this House are first and foremost politicians, and thereafter they are doctors.</p>

<p>This has a great deal to do with politics, because the Select Committee will consist of politicians, unfortunately. I might say that I am not alone in this point of view. The Transvaal leader of the United Party has also expressed himself in these terms. He says he wants a committee not consisting of politicians to examine this matter. He is on record as saying so in the newspapers. I want a commission of inquiry which would be an independent commission and would consist of doctors, gynaecologists and obstetricians mainly, of psychiatrists, of women who are qualified in those fields, quite obviously, of sociologists, also including women who are so trained, of representatives of women&#x2019;s organizations and of the legal profession. I think this sort of commission of inquiry would be able to give a much more expert opinion on this whole thorny question of abortion.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, preferably. The women are not to be politicians. I am not keen for politicians of any kind or any sex to investigate this particular problem.</p>

<p>I believe it is necessary to have an inquiry. Incidentally, I want to say that I am talking today in my personal capacity as a private member. I am not expressing the view of my party and I hope that in this respect the debate is in fact non-party-political today. I am expressing my own personal opinion. I do not know if there is, and I do not believe there is, any official view on this matter as far as my party is concerned, and I have not canvassed any such view. I am prepared&#x2014;and I take a different view again from the views expressed&#x2014;to commit myself in favour of abortion in certain cases. The hon. member for Rosettenville said he was not prepared to commit himself. The hon. member for Berea also did not commit himself. The hon. member for Cradock went a little further and, speaking as a physician, said that he believed that it was time that the law was changed, although he did not tell us in what direction. He simply expressed the fears that I believe are held by most members of his profession, namely that they are in a constant dilemma over this matter, simply because there is no statutory law in South Africa which permits legal abortion, even where the life of the mother is at stake. It is true that in common law it is generally accepted that an abortion may be done in order to save the life of a mother.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Only.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Only in those cases, and that is only in common law. It has not reallly ever been properly tested in the courts of law, although legal authorities expect that this is probably the opinion which the courts would express. But again, even this particular question has different sides to it, as the hon. member pointed out. One does not know exactly how far the court&#x2019;s interpretation would extend when it comes to the question of saving the life of a mother. The article by Prof. Strauss, to which the hon. member referred, goes very clearly into the vital question regarding the termination of pregnancy for therapeutic purposes, even under the common law. He mentions several possibilities: Must the mother&#x2019;s life be in imminent and immediate danger&#x003F; Is it sufficient to show that there is a reasonable possibility that the mother&#x2019;s life expectancy would be substantially shortened&#x003F; Would an abortion be justified on the grounds of preserving the life of the woman, or when it is performed in order to avert a serious threat of suicide&#x003F; He mentions various other circumstances as well. Not even the common law as regards saving the woman&#x2019;s life is really very clear in this respect. I want to say that I have <span class="col_1429-1430" refersTo="page_0732"/>thought this matter out for a long time and I have put several questions in this House to the hon. the Minister of Justice dating back to 1968, asking whether he would consider a change in the law on abortion. I asked him again in 1969. He told me that a committee was examining this, but we never heard the result of the deliberations of this departmental committee. Last year in the Justice Vote I asked the Minister whether his attention had been drawn to the resolutions of the Medical Association, and to those of the Van Wyk Commission which, although it did not have the question of abortions included in its terms of reference, nevertheless has, as the Minister of Health told us the other day, considered this question. I also asked whether he had considered the resolutions passed by the society of Gynaecologists and Obstetricians.</p>

<p>I have personally come to the conclusion that a <i>prima facie</i> case can certainly be made out for introducing laws in South Africa to permit legal abortion on certain specific grounds. I think that most people will agree with these grounds, except people who have really deep religious convictions about this. I certainly am the last person to criticize people for that. As the hon. member for Rosettenville rightly said, however, they would have the choice of rejecting the idea of an abortion if it happened either to affect themselves or a member of their family, and so would a doctor if, as a matter of conscience, he did not wish to perform an abortion under those circumstances. The British Law of 1968, which was introduced in 1967 as a private member&#x2019;s Bill, actually made provision for the doctor who, if it is against his conscience, does not wish to perform an abortion. I think that abortion should be legalized in cases where the mother&#x2019;s life is in danger or her physical or mental health will be affected by the continuation of the pregnancy. Secondly it should be allowed where there is a considerable danger that the unborn child, when born, will be seriously retarded mentally, or physically deformed, such as in the case of women who have contracted German measles during pregnancy. Thirdly, it should also be allowed where pregnancy is a result of rape. I think that these are three obvious oases and I myself have made up my mind on this score. Of course, we have had the Van Druten case, which was referred to and into which I cannot go in any detail now because I believe it is <i>sub judice.</i> This is very similar to the Bourne case in England which was mentioned by the hon. member and which eventually led to changes in the British law. It took something like 30 years before the British law was changed after the Bourne case. The judgment in the Bourne case, where the doctor was acquitted, simply served as a guideline for the courts of law meanwhile. I sincerely hope it is not going to take 30 years for the Van Druten case to lead to a change of law in South Africa. I hope it is going to be very much sooner than that.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I think it is even possible that this Government may change the law long before then. I have mentioned the cases where I believe most people in this day and age would accept the legalizing of abortions. I am not going into the position in other countries. It ranges from abortion on demand in Japan, in New York and various other American states, to absolute prohibition. In fact, 13 states of America have now legalized abortion, or some aspects of abortion, in other words where the mother&#x2019;s health, physical or mental, is in danger. Other countries are considering changing the law. Last year, when I was in West Germany one of the main political debating points&#x2014;and it was a political point, may I assure the hon. member for Rosettenville&#x2014;was the changing of paragraph 218 of the German Constitution which allows abortion only under very limited circumstances. There is a very heated debate about this going on in Germany at the very moment. All countries are facing these difficulties but, as I say, I have made up my mind and am certainly in favour of legalizing abortions in the cases that I have mentioned.</p>

<p>That does not deal with the really big problem however. It does not deal with the simple problem of the unwanted child. I would say that if one were to take the total number of abortions that are performed, one would find that the number of those that are performed in order to do away with the unwanted child are probably far in excess of those which are performed in the cases which I have mentioned, cases or pregnancies arising out of rape, cases where mothers have contracted German measles or where the mother&#x2019;s physical or mental health is in danger. What do we do about <span class="col_1431-1432" refersTo="page_0733"/>those cases&#x003F; This is a very difficult ethical and religious problem indeed. I think one cannot simply introduce an immediate change in the whole structure of the law in this country without a proper investigation. It is more particularly in the case of the unwanted child, where abortion is procured by a woman who does not want to continue the pregnancy, for reasons other than those I have given, that proper attention and investigation is required. Here I think we could well learn from the experience of other countries, because in Britain it has been found that the number of abortions has not gone down. In fact, it has gone up considerably. I think the latest available figure is 90 000 abortions per year in England.</p>

<p>I have the figure here. This is as a result of legalizing abortions. These are legal abortions. I am not talking about illegal abortions. Nobody knows how many there are in Britain. Nobody knows the number of illegal abortions that are procured in South Africa. We do not have any idea. We only know that many women die as a result of illegal abortions which are either procured by measures taken by the woman herself or by these dangerous back-street abortions.</p>

<p>These are the people that I am keen to obliterate from the social and medical scene in South Africa. I agree that in England there are still abortions performed illegally. No country has done away completely with illegal abortions by legalizing abortions under certain circumstances, for the simple reason that there are many women, such as those who are having illegitimate children or those who wish to do away with their children without their husbands knowing about it, who still prefer to go to a back-street abortionist and have an illegal abortion instead of going to a hospital and having it done under proper circumstances. By the way, it goes without saying that in the cases where I recommend that abortions be legalized it should of course be done by proper physicians, and there should possibly be two physicians who have made the decision. It should of course be done under proper circumstances in proper hospitals. I am not for simply allowing these abortions, even in the cases that I have mentioned, to be done under just any circumstances and by unqualified people.</p>

<p>No. Please, I want to make that absolutely clear. I should like to have an enquiry into this whole question. I want to know how South Africa will cope with the question of back-street abortions, illegal abortions. We should examine the whole question of legalizing abortions under the circumstances I have mentioned, and perhaps in other circumstances as well. Here, as I say, we can learn from the experience of countries which have gone much further in-legalizing abortion than we have ever considered in South Africa. As I say, I support the idea of an enquiry. However, I want an independent commission headed by a judge and with experts serving on the commission from a wide spectrum of medical, legal and sociological experts, women&#x2019;s organizations and women who are qualified in the fields that I have mentioned. Then I think we will get somewhere in this country and modernize the whole system. For the rest, as I say, I personally am in favour of legalizing abortions in the cases that I have mentioned.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in her speech the hon. member for Houghton covered a far wider field than the wording of the motion under discussion. Consequently I cannot conclude that she necessarily supports every word of it. What I did conclude, is that she wants to legalize certain cases. In no country except Sweden and in certain states in America has it been the approach to legalize a set of cases. The approach in most countries, including Switzerland, Germany, and even England, has always been to retain the common law, viz. that abortion is a crime, that it is a crime against life, but that in the light of certain circumstances exceptions may be made. If the hon. member would look at the Abortion <span class="col_1433-1434" refersTo="page_0734"/>Act of 1967 of England, she would see that it begins as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Subject to the provisions of this section, a person shall not be guilty of &#x2026;</block>

<p>That implies that the common law has remained in force, but that in certain cases persons are then not guilty.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<speech by="#coetsee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>That is the situation there. Hon. members made a comparative legal study of the situations in other countries. I do not want to come back to that now, but it is very interesting, for example, to consider the finding of Rabbi Immanuel Jakobovits of the British Islands in which he interpreted the Talmudic Law as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">While, according to the consensus of Rabbinic opinion, the life of a foetus is not protected by any legal provisions, the artificial termination of a pregnancy is strongly condemned on moral grounds unless it can be justified for medical or possibly other grave reasons.</block>

<p>Therefore, to keep pace with the rest of the world, we must immediately note that, with a few exceptions where abortion may take place at request, as in Japan for example, the approach is to maintain the common law and to make an exception for certain cases. As I shall indicate, the legal approach has been to keep pace with developments in medical, psychiatric and other fields in the determination of these exceptions.</p>

<p>To understand the situation in South Africa we must touch on a few facts, and bear them in mind at all times. In the first place the religious premises of a specific legal community plays an exceptional role in the determination of the common law or the statute law. This applies to almost every law we make in this Parliament. This is to an even greater extent the case where it affects the propagation of a human being. Secondly, we must distinguish clearly between direct and indirect abortion. Indirect abortion has up to now in this debate been called &#x201C;therapeutic abortion&#x201D;. Opposed to it one has direct abortion. That happens when the foetus is destroyed for the sake of the foetus as such. To state it in elegant terms, what this entails is that the living foetus is removed or the undesirable pregnancy is terminated. This is a species of infanticide and we expect it from a permissive society.</p>

<p>Our old writers, for the purposes of punishment, distinguish between a foetus possessed of a soul and a foetus unpossessed of a soul, but I do not think that this is important now. What is important, is that indirect or therapeutic abortion takes place when the fact that the foetus or living foetus is destroyed, is a by-product. This was laid down as long ago as 1664 and it is still today the situation in our jurisprudence. What it amounts to thus is that our common law recognizes an exception when the mother&#x2019;s life is in danger and an abortion is carried out on her. In that case no punishment is visited upon such a perpetrator. The perpetrator may be a second person or even the mother herself. Such an approach is therefore, according to our common law, based on a specific set of rules, and that set of rules is also known in virtually all legal systems, but specifically in Roman-Dutch Law and in English Law. In fact, their Abortion Act of 1967 is also based on it. That set of rules is known as the &#x201C;law of necessity&#x201D; rules. They fall into the same category as the case of a captain who has to jettison a cargo to save the lives of his passengers. This falls into the same category of grounds of justification for an offence where a policeman for example, acting on authority, were to shoot a person who was threatening the lives of others. The South African situation is thus that if the mother&#x2019;s life can be saved an abortion may be justified.</p>

<p>These are then the legal principles as they are known at present. We must now ask whether they have remained static, and to that question we shall soon have to give thought. A great truth which we should bear in mind in regard to this problem, is that the common law is not static. The needs of a legal community develop as development takes place in the medical, technological and more specifically the psychiatric spheres. Public opinion requires and determines that the statute law be from time to time adjusted to this development in so far as the common law is concerned. The question before the House is therefore whether the practice and whether the public, the majority opinion in South Africa, has changed to such an extent that the common <span class="col_1435-1436" refersTo="page_0735"/>law as set out by Matthaeus in 1664, which allowed one exception, today recognizes further grounds for justification. In other words, are there, apart from the justification mentioned, further grounds for justification&#x003F; If so, a second question is implied by the motion of the hon. member for Rosettenville, viz. whether these new grounds for justification should find expression in our statute law. To find an answer to the first question, we must consider the standpoint of the people who work with this matter every day, viz. the medical practitioners. As long ago as 1963 the South African Medical and Dental Council stated it as follows&#x2014;and remember that they are entitled to impose certain ethical prescriptions on their members&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the opinion of this Council abortion is only ethically justified if it is done either to save the life of the mother, or if there is a serious threat to her health.</block>

<p>Here we have the facet of a threat to health, and we note immediately that it is an extention of the common law as it has been known up to now. We note at once that this standpoint implies further expansions, viz. considerations as to what the case would be if the mother, under specific circumstances, were to become mentally disordered, and what the case would be if her life were to be curtailed for only a few years. We note further that in all these years we have not yet had a decisive ruling, apart from the one in the Van Druten case, which is at present on appeal. Let me add in parentheses that in this case the late magistrate Van Wyk gave a ruling which in my opinion is a monumental one in regard to this issue. I think that it would be fitting in this connection to pay tribute to him. If we consult our writers who have to interpret our law, we find that men like Prof. Strauss, the expert in this field, Adv. Hunt, the new writer of <i>Gardiner and Lansdown,</i> all reach the conclusion that the Attorney-General would be loathe to prosecute in the cases I have mentioned. They also add by way of explanation that&#x2014; &#x201C;probably&#x201D; and words like this are frequently used&#x2014;if a conviction is obtained a heavy penalty should not be imposed. Hon. members will therefore see that there is a lack of clarity in a sphere which will give our friends who want to apply therapeutic abortion many problems. Then, too, I want to mention to hon. members that in <i>Medical Jurisprudence,</i> of Gordon, Turner and Price, the following is said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That being so &#x2026;</block>

<p>These are the facts I mentioned a moment ago by way of summary to hon. members&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; it would undoubtedly be a more satisfactory state of affairs if a statute were passed expressly legalizing abortion in such cases and in suitable safeguards against abuse as might be devised.</block>

<p>In reply to the questions we have put so far, our conclusion thus is that the development as far as our common law is concerned and as far as the exceptions are concerned, is such that grounds of justification for abortion are quite different to what they were in the common law of the time of Matthaeus, 1664. It is therefore desirable, for a variety of factors to lay down these exceptions in a statute. The result of such a step would be to bring shady practices&#x2014;the problem with which my hon. friend from Houghton was confronted &#x2014;to the surface. It will have the result that our churches can take over those cases which do come to the surface and rehabilitate them. This brings me to a very important point. As far as South Africa is concerned, such legislation must be guided by the standpoints of the Christian religion, and specifically the Protestant Christian standpoints because this has been written into our Constitution. I shall demonstrate in a moment to hon. members why this is important. These standpoints give recognition to indirect abortion solely when the removal of the foetus is a secondary factor. The primary factor is the saving of the mother&#x2019;s life. This happens when an emergency arises, when there is a threat to the mother&#x2019;s health and the foetus is then removed. In my opinion direct abortion&#x2014; that is, where the foetus as such is removed and where the action is aimed directly at the foetus&#x2014;in contrast to indirect abortion can only be justified in the cases mentioned by the hon. member for Fauresmith and the hon. member for Cradock. They placed such cases under the category of &#x201C;pregnancies as a result of offences&#x201D;. Only in that case can one consider this. I do not want to be dogmatic about this, and I therefore <span class="col_1437-1438" refersTo="page_0736"/>repeat that we can only apply this in the case of direct abortion. This would then be the reply to the problems people see in the so-called &#x201C;abortion on request&#x201D;. I return now to the religious standpoint. Our particular religious standpoint in this country places us in the position where we look at abortion from a specific point of view, as I have already sketched to hon. members. In Japan, for example, it is admitted that the foetus has no life. The view there is that a person only begins to live when the fully-developed foetus is separated from the mother. In that case there is no question of a foetus possessed of a soul; consequently it is not repugnant to their faith that they allow abortion at request; it is not contrary to the dictates of their conscience that they apply abortion for social reasons and because of over-population. Consequently I say that we in this country will find a completely different approach. Now I should just like to sound a word of warning, which is that when we approach this matter, and when we apply the English approach&#x2014;in my opinion the obvious approach if we should ever apply it&#x2014;we should introduce control measures and should learn from the English experience, so that what is being written about England will not be written about South Africa. It is written about South Africa: &#x201C;Doctors move for legal abortion&#x201D;, but the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> of 5th October, 1969, states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and in Britain nurses are in revolt.</block>

<p>This destruction on a tremendous scale is contrary to ethical and other norms. For example the situation in England is being abused. There is, for example, abortion on credit; that is lawful in England. Doctors earn up to R400 000 per year with such practices. We will definitely have to be on the lookout for such practices. Then we note the fact that in certain states of America, where it was already applicable but where it may perhaps have been applied too rapidly owing to bad judgment, considerable movements have been launched to return to the <i>status quo ante,</i> the previous situation. In New Zealand we read in the <i>Star</i> of 25th March, 1970&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Society fights abortion law changes.</block>

<p>For those reasons our approach in this matter will be that our law and our legal principles on this matter are known. We will allow ourselves to be lead by public opinion as it has developed on the basis of experience in the technological, medical and other spheres. I think we will be inclined to consider these aspects if the bulk of the public opinion has developed as has been sketched. I want to suggest that this is in fact the case. Then, I should just like to mention, for decision by the hon. the Minister, that while we are dealing with this matter involving the propagation of human beings, we also note that in England, for example, there have been steps to legalize sterilization under certain circumstances. When one considers that subject and when one notes that these are practices which are in fact being applied, regardless of whether there are health problems or not, then what about castration&#x003F; Would these facets, which centre around the propagation of human beings, also receive attention if the hon. the Minister should decide to give attention to this matter&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to follow on some of the matters which have been raised by the hon. member who has just resumed his seat. I would like to deal with some of the deeper and more difficult legal aspects. I do not want to concern myself with the moral or religious aspects at this stage. The hon. member has rightly said that abortion was a crime in the very origin of our law. It was a crime according to the Roman law and it was a crime according to the laws of Holland. It has come to us as part of our common law and not in our statutory law. It has come to us in the very basis of our legal system, but as with so many other matters that have come into our legal system through the common law, the approach in regard to this has changed over the years with the changing circumstances and the changing environment in which we live.</p>

<p>For instance, one reminds oneself that not many centuries ago marriage without having published banns, was punishable by the death penalty, but it was for a specific reason, the type of relationship and the social living then existing. As medical research has unfolded new truths of human beings and of human life, so I believe there have been new thoughts and new techniques to deal with the circumstances of today. One only has to remind oneself, for instance, that in Holland the killing of a foetus was child murder; it was not abortion, it was child murder. Today, when we look at the question of terminating <span class="col_1439-1440" refersTo="page_0737"/>a pregnancy, I believe there is a considerable difference of opinion as to whether one is in fact terminating the life of a human being when the foetus is still <i>in utero.</i> There has been a recent decision in Australia where damages have been awarded for damage caused to a person before birth&#x2014;damage <i>in utero.</i> Damages have been awarded in courts whose approach has differed from other approaches that a human foetus, however far it is developed, is not in law a human being, while it is still <i>in utero.</i></p>

<p>Sir, I think that question is one of legal nicety which must be decided, and it must be determined what our approach is going to be in this country in our Statutes. When does a human being become a human being&#x003F; At what stage in the gestation, before or at birth, do we look at an unborn child as being in fact a human being&#x003F; I believe that that is why today one finds, when the question of abortion is discussed, more and more, the expression &#x201C;termination of a pregnancy&#x201D; is used and not the word &#x201C;abortion&#x201D;. The term &#x201C;termination of a pregnancy&#x201D; is being used more and more today and it seems to have gained popularity as against the use of the old-fashioned word &#x201C;abortion&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Sir, we have differing opinions and differing approaches in the public sector. The hon. member for Bloemfontein West tried to assess public opinion, and I believe there is a wide spectrum of public opinion in South Africa at the present moment which has not been canalized into any particular direction. Sir, the hon. member for Houghton gave three instances in which she would support the termination of pregnancy. That brings me to the point which I wanted to raise pertinently in this debate and that is the necessity of legal clarity if we are going to introduce any legislation to tamper with or to change the accepted common law on this subject. The hon. member for Houghton mentioned, for instance, that an abortion could be performed if a mother&#x2019;s life or mental health was in danger. I should now like to deal with just the one aspect, where the mother&#x2019;s life may be in danger. Let us assume that a medical practitioner in his judgment says &#x201C;no, I do not think that life is in danger&#x201D;, and he refuses to perform the abortion and the mother dies.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>That is the position under common law now.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>I am assuming now that this is legalized without clarity. If that mother dies, does that medical practitioner not lay himself open to a charge of professional negligence for having made the wrong diagnosis at the time&#x003F; I will come later to certain discussions which have taken place in the United Kingdom on the dangers and consequences when this burden is placed on the medical practitioner to determine these inexact facts. The other point which arises is, when is there &#x201C;considerable&#x201D; danger. As any lawyer knows, it is difficult to define what is &#x201C;considerable&#x201D;. How is it going to be defined&#x003F; I raise these points not to suggest that there is no point in what the hon. member for Houghton says, but to emphasize that I believe that this is essentially a matter where evidence needs to be gathered by a Select Committee, as has been suggested by the hon. member for Rosettenville.</p>

<p>Sir, that brings me to certain comments which have arisen and which I think are also pertinent to the points raised by the hon. member for Bloemfontein West, when he said that at the present moment the justification in our common law is a question of necessity. Here again he will appreciate as a lawyer that there will be many arguments as to when it is necessary and when it is not necessary to perform a particular operation. Sir, that has been the trouble in the United Kingdom since the introduction of the 1967-&#x2019;68 Act. I find in an article published in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> of 25th January, 1969, that the medical profession themselves found&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That although the college aimed to make it legal to terminate a pregnancy only on medical grounds&#x2014;that is because of risk to the physical or mental health of the mother or because of substantial risk that the child would be born deformed&#x2014;we thought that it was a part of good medicine to take into account the patient&#x2019;s total environment &#x2026;</block>

<p>It goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We did not approve of the clause permitting termination of pregnancy for the sake of existing children &#x2026; We thought there would be a slightly more liberal attitude to the problem, for that, after all, was the purpose of the new law. How wrong we were. I am afraid that <span class="col_1441-1442" refersTo="page_0738"/>we did not allow for the attitude of, firstly, the general public, and secondly, the general practitioner.</block>

<p>That was where, as the hon. member for Houghton has suggested, the law broke down in its application in the United Kingdom. On this question of the problems that they are experiencing in the United Kingdom, I would like to refer also to a conference which was held on this Abortion Act in practice and quote in this connection from the <i>British Medical Journal</i> of 15th February, 1969. Some very important and learned gentlemen were present at this particular conference, including well-known people such as Sir John Peel and others, who took part in this discussion. It was pointed out that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; doctors had felt that the Act had come to help them, but somehow, subtly, they had been fooled. No clear interpretation was available, some holding that the Act allows abortion on demand, while others could see no change. Responsibility remained firmly on the individual doctor.</block>

<p>Under the heading &#x201C;Who makes the decision&#x003F;&#x201D; the journal goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dr Tredgold (University College Hospital, London) discussed who should be responsible for deciding on termination of a pregnancy. At present the decision normally rested with the general practitioner, gynaecologist and/or psychiatrist, but there was a case for involving others in the future.</block>

<p>He then goes on to mention other persons who might well be involved in coming to this particular decision. But, Sir, the effect on the medical profession according to this particular conference is this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The increased demand for abortion had forced doctors into a role for which they had no training and little taste&#x2014; and had reduced gynaecologists to the status of tradesmen.</block>

<p>This was the view of these senior practitioners in dealing with this particular matter. The legal consequences of this particular type of latitude which needs investigation, were pertinently referred to at this particular conference and I would like to quote what was said by Sir Geoffrey Howe, Q.C., at this conference. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Act could produce an unforeseen working rule of &#x201C;if in doubt, terminate&#x201D;, since a continued pregnancy might produce evidence which could form the basis of a civil action for negligence. When a doctor believed that termination was not required, he should therefore, always get a second opinion.</block>

<p>He then referred to the other complications and precautions, because of the very liberties which are given to the doctor under the British Act, without a clear definition and at least protection from any liability for his decision not to perform an operation if it turns out that his medical diagnosis was incorrect.</p>

<p>Sir, finally I want to refer to just one further reason why I believe that this inquiry asked for by the hon. member for Rosettenville is so necessary. Reference has already been made to the number of abortions which are now taking place in the United Kingdom. The figures that I have indicate that in the first year there was a jump from something like 6 000 known cases of abortion to 35 000&#x2014;in one year. An interesting fact in passing is that the percentage of single women and married women who underwent abortions was approximately the same in the first year. 55 per cent were single women and 45 per cent were actually married women when they had abortions in the first year of he application of this new Act.</p>

<p>In Japan, as the hon. the Minister will know, the position now is that it is estimated that the number of abortions exceeds the number of births. What is worrying in South Africa is whether our strict laws are the cause of the vast number of illegal operations performed. The hon. member for Rosettenville mentioned 302 deaths in Johannesburg. I want to read from the report of the Groote Schuur Hospital, just one hospital, for 1970. I read from the report of the Gynaecology Department&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The creation of septic abortion unit has been a major advance in the treatment of these patients. The ward in which this unit is housed has the highest <span class="col_1443-1444" refersTo="page_0739"/>bed occupancy, and the greatest patient turnover of all wards in Groote Schuur Hospital.</block>

<p>These are the septic abortion cases. I will give the Minister the figures which I have obtained. Of 6 118 admissions in 1971 in the gynaecological wards of Groote Schuur, 1 687, or 27,6 per cent, were cases showing the septic consequences of illegal abortions or attempted illegal abortions. In 1970 the figure was 1 820, representing 29,3 per cent of all admissions to that department of the hospital. The fact that this number of abortion cases comes to the hospital is, I believe, a very valid reason why the House should agree with the suggestion of the hon. member for Rosettenville to let a Select Committee investigate this matter and find out what the reason for it is. Is the law too strict, or is there something in the law which we apply in this country which accounts for it, or are there other factors which contribute to this vast incidence of septic abortion cases&#x003F; For those reasons I believe that the hon. member for Rosettenville and others who have spoken and who have said that there should be an inquiry&#x2014;I think it is a question of how that inquiry should take place &#x2014;are correct. I can think of no better way than having a Select Committee of this House to go into this matter and then to make recommendations to this House with or without proposed legislation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I cannot think of any subject which is more evocative of human emotions than this very subject of abortion, because it has ethical aspects and religious roots and because it touches one&#x2019;s heart. That is why it is a subject which one has to approach with great circumspection and great level-headedness. I must say that to me, as a doctor who has had to deal with these matters, this is a special day in that we are able to discuss this subject. I must also say that this is one of the most difficult and exacting tasks which I have had to perform in this House, because of the fact that we are concerned with life here. Let me say immediately that we regard the foetus as life in South Africa, and this being the case, this matter brings out the best, but sometimes also the worst, in the people who have to deal with it; because, as you know, love and cruelty are very close to each other. That is why I appreciate the fact that this debate has been conducted on the level on which it has.</p>

<p>&#x2020;May I say to the hon. member for Rosettenville, who moved this motion, that he gave the House valuable information. He did it calmly, with ease and with assurance because he was moving in a field that is well known to him. May I also say that I am indebted to him for putting emphasis on the respect that this House ought to show for the religious beliefs of our people in passing legislation.</p>

<p>*I also wish to express my appreciation to other hon. members on our side as well as on the opposite side for maintaining a high level of debate, for conducting a responsible debate, and for generally conducting a conservative debate. It is good that we should think and debate conservatively on a matter such as this.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Let me first give the House the legal position in South Africa as it is today. Abortion is not prohibited by Statute in South Africa. However, according to our common law, abortion is an offence with only one generally accepted exemption, namely when it is necessary in order to save the life of the mother, as has been stated by hon. members. Abortion could possibly also be allowed if it is necessary in order to obviate serious damage to the mother&#x2019;s health, but this is a moot point; there is no certainty about it. With this legal position, what has happened in practice in South Africa&#x003F; What is the practical situation today&#x003F; Respected medical practitioners, in consultation with other colleagues, openly undertake abortion operations in cases which are probably not allowed under our existing law, but which they undertake within the ambit of medical ethics. I do not wish to go too far in quoting examples, but let me mention just one which has been mentioned in this debate, that of rape, sometimes rape of a young girl by a mentally defective person. In such a case abortion is undertaken with general approval, but the doctor runs the risk if being prosecuted.</p>

<p>The situations which are created by the existing state of affairs are <i>inter alia</i> the following: In some cases there is no prosecution at all. In other cases of a similar nature a prosecution is instituted and the position actually differs from province to province. Thirdly, medical practitioners find themselves in the unenviable position that they are not sure what the law prescribes or, owing to the ethics of their profession, they feel obliged to act illegally. Moreover, <span class="col_1445-1446" refersTo="page_0740"/>the uncertainty may lead to the professional help of a doctor being denied to an expectant mother, with the result that she comes to a tragic end because from sheer necessity she seeks help somewhere else where an abortion without the necessary skill and care is undertaken. Let me say that this is most unfair to the medical profession and also extremely unjust and inhuman to the patient. I think it is our duty as legislators to remedy this undesirable position, and I am pleased to inform this House that good progress has already been made.</p>

<p>What has been done up to now&#x003F; Firstly, the commission appointed to inquire into the Mental Disorders Act of 1960, namely the commission presided over by Mr. Justice Theo van Wyk, investigated certain aspects of abortion and sterilization and has made certain recommendations. The report is at present being considered and will be laid upon the Table of the House. Secondly, the S.A. Medical and Dental Council, which, as members know, is required to advise the Government on medical matters, appointed an <i>ad hoc</i> committee to investigate the matter thoroughly. The confidential findings of the committee have recently been made available to me and I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the council for an outstanding and thorough piece of work. Thirdly, I have had personal discussions from time to time with a view to possible legislation and I have also received certain requests from various quarters. Lastly, the Cabinet has recently considered the matter and has decided on certain steps to be taken.</p>

<p>*I should like to group the standpoint of the Cabinet under twelve heads. The first one is this: As the Government is aware of the great public interest in this matter and is itself very much aware of the religious, moral and ethical aspects involved, it has been decided to give ample opportunity for representations and discussion before legislation is placed on the Statute Book.</p>

<p>Secondly, the present confused and extremely unsatisfactory position will be rectified in separate new legislation, so that (a) a medical practitioner who performs an abortion for valid reasons and in terms of a prescribed procedure, will in fact be protected, and (b) the public and medical practitioners will know precisely what is in fact right or wrong and what procedures are to be followed.</p>

<p>The third aspect I want to mention in regard to the standpoint of the Government is that the responsibility for drafting and administering the new legislation will attach to the Department of Health. In the fourth place, it is desirable that legislation relating to sterilization should be incorporated in this legislation.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize the following two points very strongly.</p>

<p>&#x2020;May I say that I am indebted to the hon. member for Rosettenville and also, in a lesser degree, to the hon. member for Houghton for their attitude in this regard. The hon. member for Rosettenville said that abortion should not become an alternative to contraception or a means to control the population explosion. I cannot agree more.</p>

<p>*However, on behalf of the Government I want to go a little further and say that the Government is completely opposed to general abortion, or &#x201C;abortion on demand&#x201D;, as it is sometimes called. This cannot be allowed to become part of our South African way of life. The proposed legislation must leave no doubt or loopholes in this regard.</p>

<p>I come to the sixth point, which I want to emphasize just as strongly. Having said what I said a moment ago, I want to point out that the Government is nevertheless sympathetically disposed towards those few cases where abortion is desirable on therapeutic grounds. I want to mention a few examples in general. Firstly, where a choice has to be made between the life of the mother and that of the unborn child. Secondly, if continued pregnancy presents a real danger to the physical or mental health of the mother. Thirdly, in cases of rape. Fourthly, where it is likely, in the light of experience, that the child will be born an abnormal one as a result of certain diseases contracted, for example German measles, or as a result of taking drugs such as thalidomide, or as a result of certain kinds of radiation, or where pregnancy resulted from impregnation by mentally defective persons, and possibly in cases of epilepsy. I say &#x201C;possibly&#x201D;, because I am mentioning this in general.</p>

<p>I now come to the seventh standpoint of the Government. In cases where the termination of pregnancy is in fact legalized, it must only be carried out according to clear, strict rules and procedures which <span class="col_1447-1448" refersTo="page_0741"/>should be incorporated in either the legislation or regulations. In this regard I have in mind <i>inter alia</i> the following aspects. Firstly, when a decision has to be taken as to whether a pregnancy should legally be terminated, the patient herself, the husband, the parent or guardian, the doctor, the magistrate and the police, among others, should be consulted; and the legislation should also provide that permission has to be granted by more than one responsible person. You can call it a panel if you wish. The second aspect I have in mind, is that the procedure to be followed must also be laid down very clearly, either in the legislation or in the regulations. In the third place, it must be specifically provided which persons will be vested with the necessary authority in regard to these procedures. In the fourth place, it should be prescribed in what institutions an operation for an abortion may be performed legally.</p>

<p>I want to put the eighth standpoint of the Government as follows: On the basis of these general guiding principles which have already been laid down, and with the aid of, <i>inter alia,</i> experience in the rest of the world, recommendations in the Van Wyk Report, to which I have already referred, the paper by the Medical Council and other representations and points of view, which we can also get from the persons mentioned by the hon. member for Houghton, my Department is already drafting legislation. I can also inform the hon. House further that as soon as the draft Bill is ready&#x2014;I hope it will be before the end of this session&#x2014;it will be published for general information and comment. Moreover, it is intended to introduce the Bill at the beginning of the next session of Parliament and to refer it to a Select Committee. The Government will decide later whether it will be referred to the Select Committee before or after Second Reading. The Government will take that decision on the basis of representations before it after the published Bill has been commented on.</p>

<p>I now come to the eleventh point I want to mention. In the light of the information I have furnished to the House, it is clear that it is unnecessary to appoint a Select Committee at present to investigate matters relating to abortion. I am sure the hon. member for Rosettenville and other hon. members will appreciate this and I want to thank them in anticipation for that.</p>

<p>I just want to tell the hon. member for Houghton&#x2014;she suggested that a judicial commission should be appointed&#x2014;that I have every confidence that we shall get comments from those people who have an interest in this matter; secondly, that I have complete confidence in a Select Committee of this House to deal with a matter such as this; and thirdly, that the persons she had in mind and who will naturally be able to make important contributions, will all assist this Select Committee by stating their views and giving evidence. Since we already have a great deal of information at our disposal, investigations, etc., I therefore do not think it is necessary for this matter to be referred to a judicial commission of inquiry now.</p>

<p>In the final instance, I want to mention the twelfth point. It is also Government policy that <i>inter alia</i> the following&#x2014;I say <i>&#x201C;inter alia</i>&#x201D;, because there may be more&#x2014; should be clearly reflected in the Bill: Firstly, respect for the unborn child&#x2014;the foetus&#x2014;irrespective of the stage of pregnancy&#x2014;in other words, in contrast to the Japanese view; secondly, the Christian beliefs and moral norms which are peculiar to the South African way of life; thirdly&#x2014; and I want to emphasize this, particularly after all the newspapers recently carried reports in which a fuss was made of having extra-marital children as though it were a wonderful achievement&#x2014;that extra-marital pregnancies are wrong and should be condemned most strongly; and fourthly&#x2014;and I conclude with this&#x2014;that severe penalties are prescribed for abortions performed in conflict with the provisions of the legislation; in fact, laying down minimum penalties will be considered.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is encouraging to hear from the hon. the Minister that this matter has already received some attention from the Government and that they have, in fact, already decided upon legislation. I hope, however, that the hon. the Minister will bear in mind some other considerations, apart from those which he has just put before us, in dealing with the list of principles which have been decided upon by the Cabinet.</p>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p><i>&#x201C;Inter alia"</i>; I am glad to hear that, because I should like to say something in regard to his remarks about the moral aspect of this question. He said in that context that the moral aspect would be controlled as much by legislation <span class="col_1449-1450" refersTo="page_0742"/>and regulation as any other. Abortion is without doubt a very tricky problem indeed: it is a source of great social, legal and moral discord and of very great uncertainty also. There is much psychiatric confusion involved in this subject and in most cases a great deal of personal anguish too. The hon. the Minister will appreciate that.</p>

<p>I think it is true to say that there is not a single nation in the world today which seriously believes that it has discovered the perfect solution to this problem. I doubt whether we are going to find it either; in fact, I doubt whether there is any single religious body anywhere in the world which has any degree of unanimity in its ranks on this subject. Judging from the debate this afternoon, there seem to be only two main points upon which everyone is agreed. The first is that it is intolerable to tie the hands of the medical profession in such a way that they are only entitled to carry out this operation if the consensus of medical opinion is that without it the life of either the mother or the child is in danger. As the hon. the Minister and other members have said, if the mother-to-be is a psychiatric case or even if she has a clinical history of haemophilia there are, at the present moment, instances in which members of the medical profession are not entitled to act, and this makes it very difficult for them, depending on the circumstances. The other point on which there seems to be a high degree of unanimity is the medical dangers of underground abortions carried out by quacks or unqualified people. There are no easy answers in this field either, in terms of legislation. Whether the Minister imagines there are, I do not know, but I think probably he must admit that this is going to be very difficult to control.</p>

<p>Now I want to deal with the question of the religious approach to these matters. The Catholics, of course, reduce the whole problem to the philosophical, theological question: &#x201C;When does life, which is God-given, begin&#x003F;&#x201D; That is the basis of their thinking and their whole approach. Others see the whole question of abortion, as has been mentioned this afternoon, in terms of the woman&#x2019;s right to decide these matters for herself. There are some people, of course, who have even crusaded for abortion on demand as part of the women&#x2019;s liberation campaign. I am very glad we have not over-simplified the case and had too much of that sort of argument here today.</p>

<p>If we face the matter squarely, this problem is so complex that it covers a great deal more than some of the fields that have been mentioned here today. If we face it squarely, we find that abortion is at once a moral, a medical, a legal, a sociological, a demographic and a psychological problem. That goes for the women as well as for the professions involved. This type of problem is not readily amenable to one-dimensional thinking. That has become apparent from the discussion today. Unfortunately for humanity, there are only two possibilities, whatever the circumstances are. Once a woman is pregnant, she must either have an abortion or a child. That is axiomatic. Both are traumatic experiences and neither is easily forgotten; so that the range of choices facing women in general, married or unmarried, and facing society and the medical and legal professions, is perilously narrow. That is why I hope the Government is going to give very, very careful consideration to the type of legislation that is introduced. I think it is right that both thought and emotion should be involved in any consideration of an issue of this complexity.</p>

<p>I am glad that we have not had any tawdry references in this discussion today to the desire on the part of certain people overseas to liberalize the abortion laws and the suggestion that, because it is so permissive it is in fact another way of undermining our society. As legislators&#x2014;the hon. the Minister is perfectly correct&#x2014;it is our duty to direct our thinking towards the human complexities of this matter. I am the last speaker today so it is a little difficult to raise a new point, but, as has already been said, the high illegitimacy rate in our own society resulting in the birth of hordes of unwanted children, is a very real problem, indeed. The crux of the moral issue with which we are all faced, even if we are largely unaware of it, the dilemma in fact, in which any woman finds herself in this connection today, is essentially something which is universal. It is essentially the struggle of technological man to decide how to make a moral use of medical skills and techniques which are now so readily at our disposal. As the hon. the Minister knows, abortion can now be procured within a matter of hours, and the patient sent away within a matter of hours as well. One wonders what hope there is of any kind of consensus of opinion in this country any more than anywhere else on this subject. The difficulty is that the average <span class="col_1451-1452" refersTo="page_0743"/>person approaches this matter with a considerable degree of ingrained bias, from whatever point of view they look at it. I would hope that the hon. the Minister, as he has already decided to take action in this matter and has presented us with draft legislation, would quite apart from canvassing a broad spectrum of public opinion, bear certain fundamental things in mind.</p>

<p>First of all, the Department of Health should lay down specific guide lines limiting abortion to well-equipped hospitals and clinics. Obviously, if we have it controlled by statute, I know that will be the case. Then, I think, there should be some legal deadline, depending of course on how liberal&#x2014;the Minister talked about moral justification&#x2014;his attitude is going to be. There should be some legal deadline established in these moral cases where some specific period of pregnancy should be laid down, for example no abortion after 24 weeks of pregnancy. I really think that to perform an abortion, even for moral reasons, after three or four months, could be almost too traumatic for many people who might find themselves in that difficult position.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>I do not agree with you there.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>All right, the Minister may not, but I think these facts should be considered. I think the operation should not be performed upon any minor in law without the concurrence of her parents. I think the hon. the Minister will agree with that. Obviously, we would have to keep a close watch on institutions practising this type of operation on any scale, particularly people who are out to do it for reasons of financial benefit. By the very nature of things, it is most often the very poor or those who are ignorant of modern preventatives who would be likely to become the victims of financial extortioners or the unqualified quack. That is the case today. I think we need to watch that situation very carefully.</p>

<p>Until this question has been carefully investigated and the situation in other countries carefully studied, it is quite impossible for the hon. the Minister or anybody in this House to say how many problems the legalization of abortion under certain circumstances will solve and how many problems it will create. In the long term, of course, if you take a constructive view, family planning associations and some degree of sex education for the adolescent, together with comprehensive provision of birth control methods, would go a long way towards helping to counter any general deterioration in the field of abortion and unwanted birth generally. I do think that we should put a great deal of emphasis upon the constructive, preventive side of the matter as well as on the other side. This means in effect, that apparent from the moral issues with which the individual is faced, there is a very great deal that can be done by means of preventive medicine to ease both the problems of health and of conscience in this regard. I would hope that the Minister and his department would give equal emphasis to this aspect of the matter.</p>

<p>I just want to raise the point about illegitimate children born of single mothers. Before the 1968 reform of the abortion laws in England, in 1967, for instance, of the 832 164 live births in that year, 70 000 were illegitimate. Of these only 3 167 were placed in institutions and 18 000 of them were adopted; which left more than two-thirds to be brought up fatherless by their unmarried mothers. I have taken those figures from a book by Dr. Anthony Horden&#x2014;the hon. the Minister may have seen it&#x2014;called <i>The English Experience of Legal Abortion,</i> published last year. The psychological effects on any child brought up in these circumstances, however well cared for in the material sense, must be profound. I mention that specifically because the hon. the Minister talked about the moral aspects of this matter where cases would have to be decided in various ways. On the other hand we must not make the mistake of thinking of abortion as referring only to single women who want to get rid of an illegitimate child. One of the most important reasons for this motion can be said to be the existence of poor socioeconomic conditions in which the spawning of hordes of unwanted children leads to the vicious circle with which we are so familiar, namely that of greater poverty, overcrowded housing conditions, lack of care and supervision, malnutrition, inadequate education, and then juvenile delinquency and from there to a life of crime, which again can lead to procreation of yet more illegitimmte children.</p>

<p>However, and I want to end on this note, I take the view that if steps are to be taken in law, no attempt should be made by the law to influence a woman&#x2019;s personal decision in matters of this kind. It must remain <span class="col_1453-1454" refersTo="page_0744"/>a matter of privacy and of individual assessment for her. The hon. the Minister talked about a whole group of people helping to make this decision if there were a moral reason for justifying an abortion. It is quite consistent with my thinking on this issue to say that I reject any approach to this matter which savours of the extreme, either the slickness of abortion on request argument or that of an immutable divine right which prohibits any alteration of the law. I cannot agree with the hon. the Minister that where moral considerations only are involved, which he mentioned specifically, that a whole group of people should be consulted in these cases. I think that however the legislation is drafted provision must be made for some other approach as well. Women have an undoubted right to a degree of privacy and personal choice in such matters, married or unmarried. Only the pregnant woman herself can judge the validity her own reasons either for wanting or refusing to have an abortion, unless she is mentally deficient. In the last resort I think the law must take some cognizance of this right of freedom of choice. The law cannot presume, for instance, to judge the validity of a woman&#x2019;s personal motivation in matters as delicate as this. I think that the law must step aside here, even if the grave responsibility for making this decision leaves the matter of life and death in the hands of the woman herself. She should be free to make the decision. There are no circumstances that I can think of in which such a decision would in any case be easy one way or the other, married or unmarried. The emotional and psycological distress, as the hon. the Minister will know, can be very considerable. In that instance the final choice should in my opinion be hers. I would like to plead with the hon. the Minister that this aspect be seriously considered before he presents us with draft legislation.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. VAN B. VILJOEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think we are very grateful to the hon. member for Wynberg for making at this late stage of the debate a serious plea for us to keep calm when we may perhaps feel that we have in fact made out a case for the legalization of abortion. In particular I am also glad that she gave special attention to the moral aspects of this matter, as well as the psychological effects which an act of this nature may have on a woman. We are also grateful to her for having made special mention of the value of education and upliftment in respect of the preventive aspects of this problem.</p>

<p>If one looks at this motion, it seems as though there is in fact no motivation for it, as the hon. member for Rosettenville put it. The question is merely whether this whole matter should be referred to a Select Committee. He did not compromise himself at all in regard to the principle of the matter. Although he did to a certain extent motivate it in the course of his speech, I hope that politically the hon. member is not perhaps a little shy to motivate this motion frankly. As the matter stands and as also became apparent here this afternoon, there is in South Africa no legislation legalizing abortion under the common law. For the sake of clarity and an objective approach to this whole matter, I think we should just repeat briefly a few of the basic points. It is possible that I shall have to repeat some arguments, but in doing so I may also add to what has already been said here. Before doing so, I should like to sound a grave warning this afternoon. This warning concerns the tendency found among so many people, namely that of always trying to apply to South Africa what is happening in other countries of the world. I feel that we do not necessarily apply to South Africa examples taken from other countries, especially where some moral principle or other is involved. That is why I think that, as far as our moral values are concerned, we in South Africa are on a higher level than are most Western countries. I think we are in a position to apply our own moral principles when it comes to a matter such as this one. We must have regard to the fact that, especially in the Western countries, changed values of life have already come into force. Values in respect of the structurally functional components of our social structure are changing. Inevitably our norms are also affected by that process. Values which are not acceptable to us and, as we see matters, may not be accepted either, obtain in many other countries. We are dealing with a permissive world, especially in countries abroad. To a large extent this permissiveness has also made itself felt here, and is in the process of eroding many of our values. If we ever do anything in this regard, we should realize that we are doing so within the framework of our Christian convictions and our national pride.</p>

<p>It was a shock to me to read in the paper this morning about a plea made by a certain group of people in this country for <span class="col_1455-1456" refersTo="page_0745"/>&#x201C;abortion on demand&#x201D;. I did not think that this erosion and watering down of values in South Africa had already progressed so far. All the aspects and factors which are relevant in regard to this matter, were mentioned here this afternoon, namely the sociological, medical, judicial and also the demographical factors. I should like to associate myself with what was said by another speaker, namely that although this is an extremely important aspect of the whole problem, we should not allow demographical considerations to be a decisive factor in deliberating on this matter. However, before we consider these various factors, there is another matter which I should like to emphasize. In respect of the common norms that exist as far as other social structures in the world are concerned, as well as other religions and even agnostic thinkers and atheists, there is one thing which is acceptable to all of them, i.e. that no person has the right to take life. This is in fact very much in keeping with the religious standpoints stated here today. Before dealing with that, I should just like to mention a few other medical considerations. Up to now the emphasis has been put chiefly on the medical considerations. However, there are also social considerations which sometimes carry much weight with the doctor when he has to make decisions on these matters. Important ethical principles are also involved in this whole matter. Just think of the Hippocratic Oath, which specifically lays down that no doctor may take any step which is not aimed at extending life, except under specific circumstances where the mother&#x2019;s life is in danger. That is the only exception.</p>

<p>For many years the medical profession has been faced with this problem, i.e. that it has to make decisions within a very short period of time, for instance, when a patient is under an anaesthetic and he is faced with an accomplished fact. It often happens that the doctor, because of his dedication to the profession, commits an unlawful act as regards certain life-saving actions.</p>

<p>In looking at the classification of pathological reasons under which abortion may be legalized, we see that there is a whole variety of headings.</p>

<p>&#x2020;There is one particular aspect which was not mentioned today, namely the anatomical abnormalities, for example in a contracted pelvis where caesarian section is not possible. I mention this particularly because this is an abnormality which has presented very great difficulties. Just for completeness I want to mention the physiological conditions, endocrine imbalance where abortion is usually inevitable in any way. Various psychiatric conditions were mentioned today. In view of the fact that one is inclined to judge psychiatric conditions rather superficially, I think it is important that family history should be very carefully taken into account.</p>

<p>We are all aware of the congenital abnormalities as a result of an infectious disease, for example German measles, the organic diseases which were mentioned here today, neoplastic disease, nephritic syndrome and the cardio-respiratory diseases which often pose very difficult problems in our profession.</p>

<p>There is another matter which needs careful consideration. I do not think that it will be a factor during the course of this debate. We might as well take note of some very important aspects of genetics. These can require difficult decisions to be made in the future if ever abortion under certain circumstances be legalized in South Africa. I also want to indicate in short the standpoint which was expressed by various religions in respect of the questionnaire which was sent to various people. The Moslems said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Islam does not justify any form of killing for it preaches that life is a Godgiven gift and only God has the right to take back this gift.</block>

<p>The Hindus said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We place our trust in the Almighty God. He alone can decide who is to live and who is to die.</block>

<p>The Christians said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Life is given by God. Man may not take it.</block>

<p>*I think it is also interesting to hear that there is a clear difference between the standpoint of the Catholics and that of the non-Catholics. The Catholics, irrespective of race or colour, condemned abortion as strongly as they did euthanasia, whilst, in this survey that was made, the non-Catholics were more indulgent towards abortion, but felt just as strongly about euthanasia.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when this debate was adjourned on Friday, I had dealt with certain matters which, you will concede, may to a certain extent not be discussed under the present circumstances, perhaps to the disappointment of the hon. members for Durban Point and Yeoville. However, I do not think it would be wrong or out of place, in resuming my speech, to refer to the matter which I touched upon in conclusion last Friday, viz. that there is a heavy responsibility resting on all members of this House, and specifically on members of the Opposition, to do nothing in all their outspoken attempts to drum up support for their party which would make the almost superhuman task of our security forces more difficult. I was referring to the remarks made by the hon. members for Port Natal and Durban North. I do not want to repeat them. I only want to refer to a speech made by the hon. the Minister of Police on 8th December, at a police parade in Pretoria, when he said the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In this situation where influence is being brought to bear on the minds of our people, which drastically facilitates the process of demoralization, it is the unenviable task of the Police to maintain law and order and to protect South Africa, its people and their possessions. The time has come for us to reflect and steel ourselves afresh to combat the dangerous forces from outside and from within. The police cannot accomplish their task successfully without the cooperation of the public. Above all, the Police can rely on the moral support of the country and its people. Of one thing you may be sure: Nobody knows the enemies of South Africa better than the Police. Despite the attempts of our enemies to thwart the Police, they will continue to carry out the task entrusted to them with singleness of purpose.</block>

<p>Sir, I think that every member with a sense of responsibility in this House can endorse every word in that statement. Therefore I do not think it is out of place to make a fresh appeal to members of this House, and specifically members of the Opposition &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; to abide by this serious and urgent request, which has no political implications, but only seeks to safeguard South Africa. I said to the hon. member for Yeoville the other day: &#x201C;People who live in glass houses should not throw stones&#x201D;. I want to quote a short passage today, perhaps out of the distant past, for the edification of members who were muttering a moment ago, so that they can for a change examine their own conscience and take a look at themselves, and see themselves as the people of South Africa see them. I have here a pamphlet which was published by the United Party about 20 years ago. [Interjections.] Sir, there is an hon. member who is very loath to take his medicine, but he is going to take it now. The pamphlet reads as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Why speculate&#x003F; Why should you ponder the question of whether the Nationalist Party (a) will declare a republic; (b) will rob you of your franchise; (c) will establish a fascistic r&#x00E9;gime&#x003F;</block>

<p>Then the pamphlet goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You are acquainted with their black past. So, stamp out Nationalism.</block>

<p>Sir, there is nothing further I want to say on this subject. I just want to repeat: &#x201C;People who live in glass houses should not throw stones&#x201D;.</p>

<p>In the time left to me, I should like to talk to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, but it seems to me he is not here today, nor is the hon. member for Yeoville. During the speech made by the hon. the Prime Minister towards the end of the no-confidence debate, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout interrupted him with these words (col. 407)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Is the hon. the Prime Minister aware of the fact that the Leader of the Opposition states clearly that the eight Whites that are being proposed are an interim measure&#x003F;</block>

<p><span class="col_1459-1460" refersTo="page_0747"/>Then the hon. member for Bezuidenhout went on to say that this was indeed the standpoint of the Leader of the Opposition. In the Press and elsewhere, at congresses, there was a whole hullabaloo over the question: &#x201C;What precisely is the United Party&#x2019;s policy in respect of the representation of non-Whites in this House&#x003F;&#x201D;</p>

<p>No, we learn quite easily. Sir, the hon. member for Pinelands, who made that interjection, was told by his own newspaper that they cannot understand what the policy of the United Party is. It is the task of that hon. member, and not mine, to teach his own people. Before this remark by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, there was a continual public altercation between the hon. member for Yeoville and the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. First the one said the United Party had changed its standpoint, then the other said it had not. After that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout told the hon. the Prime Minister the other day: &#x201C;Are you not aware that this is an interim measure as far as the United Party is concerned&#x003F;&#x201D; If we cast our minds back, Sir, it strikes one that as long ago as 1963 the hon. member for Yeoville, who attacked the hon. member for Bezuidenhout in public, expressed the same standpoint in a television interview, i.e. that this policy is an interim policy. Sir, I am raising this matter today because it has been discussed as a matter of the utmost importance over a long period in this House, and outside, because the United Party is struggling to take over the government. It is this: What is the United Party&#x2019;s plan in respect of the representation of non-Whites which the United Party believes should have representation together with the Whites in this House&#x003F; Hon. members of the Opposition then said that there would be eight representatives for the Bantu, but that these should be Whites, and that there would be six representatives for the Coloureds who could be Whites or Coloureds. The question was then put to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition: &#x201C;But are you going to keep it at that&#x003F; What happens if they subsequently begin to demand that these representatives should be Bantu&#x003F;&#x201D; (The point on which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is now fighting his own party) and then the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said that as far as his party and he were concerned, they would remain Whites. The question was also put: &#x201C;But if they insist that there should be more of them, what then&#x003F;&#x201D; The hon. the Leader of the Opposition adopted the standpoint that the number would remain at eight. This question has been put to him repeatedly&#x2014;I myself have put it to him three times in this House&#x2014;&#x201C;How are you going to guarantee that those numbers are going to remain the same and that the representatives are going to remain White&#x003F;&#x201D; He then said he was going to hold a referendum. Then I, and others as well, asked him: &#x201C;But why hold a referendum if you do not want to increase the numbers or change the representation; what is the sense of a referendum then, and what are your instructions going to be in that referendum&#x003F; Eventually he then said that his instructions under such circumstances would be: &#x201C;Vote against it.&#x201D;</p>

Sir, I do not think there is any hon. member in this House who does not realize precisely what those words imply. Now, Mr. Speaker, we have been given to understand by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout&#x2014; and this has not yet been repudiated&#x2014;that this dispensation is an interim one.

<p>Sir, may I inquire of the hon. member for Pinelands whether his party still intends to hold a referendum in regard to this matter or not&#x003F; [Interjection.] The hon. member says &#x201C;No&#x201D;. I should like to know from the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, or from some or other leading or lesser light on that side, whether it is still the policy of their party to hold a referendum in regard to the question of representation of the Bantu in this House&#x003F; Is there one of the leading lights who could give me a reply to that&#x003F; Sir, what about the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central; what about the hon. member for Transkei&#x003F; He is deeply involved in this matter. Would the hon. member for Transkei not be so kind as to give me a reply&#x003F; Or would the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District give me a reply&#x003F; Sir, in the absence of a reply, I think that on my argument alone I have every justification for stating in this House today that that promise of a referendum is as great a piece of deceit as one could imagine, particularly when measured in the light of what has just happened in these last few weeks when the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, without being contradicted, intimated that it was merely an interim dispensation, and that is why I say that the voters of South Africa cannot take any notice of a promise of this nature from the United Party because it is a party which trims its sails to the winds of expediency and does not serve the interests of South Africa.</p>

<p>He said here last week that he did not accuse the members of the U.P. of colluding with the communists. He said that he wanted to state this quite candidly; he did not accuse them of doing that, but he did have an idea that the U.P. were colluding with the communists behind the scenes. Today he came along here and issued a warning to members on this side of the House that they should be careful in their actions in regard to communism and terrorists. Sir, he was implying something there which this side of the House rejects with contempt. The hon. member then went on and tackled the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in regard to the U.P.&#x2019;s policy, and asked what they would do if a proposal were to be made that the eight Bantu representatives in this House should be increased.</p>

<p>Sir, I do not want to spend much time on that. When it was decided to proclaim a Republic, a referendum was held in that regard, and I assume that any Government would hold a referendum if there is any question of a change in our constitutional system. No, Sir, this is simply the old story all over again. Hon. members on that side decided even before the session to blow up the question of terrorism and communism into a vast smokescreen to distract attention in that way from the real economic problems of the country. They decided to embroil the United Party in a debate on terrorism and communism and on the question of non-White representation in this House. Sir, we know that story. I do not want to argue about it any further. But before I return to the hon. the Minister of Finance and the statements he made here in the debate on the Part Appropriation Bill, I want to refer to certain things which the hon. member for Carltonville, who is fortunately present at the moment, said and which we cannot simply allow to go unanswered. In his speech&#x2014;I do not know whether to call it a moral sermon, an oracle or a debacle&#x2014;the hon. member for Carltonville adopted the attitude that the Nationalist Party is the only party with moral strength and that it would be advisable for the many Van Blerks whom we find outside today, to go running back to the Nationalist Party. The hon. member then went on to describe the integrity and the credibility of the Nationalist Party. I wonder what Nationalist Party he was talking about. Was he not perhaps talking about the Nationalist Party of just prior to or just after 1948, for then I could perhaps concede that he was correct, but if he was talking about the Nationalist Party of today and then went on to speak in the same breath about integrity and credibility, then one must append a very large question-mark <span class="col_1463-1464" refersTo="page_0749"/>to that utterance of his. Hon. members on this side of the House have repeatedly pointed out the credibility gap which applies to that side, and then the hon. member has the temerity to come and say here that the Nationalist Party is a party with moral integrity and credibility.</p>

<p>The hon. member went further. He implied that the Nationalist Party was a party with firm, strongly moral and religious codes. Sir, the hon. member must not imply, as he did, that the party on this side is not a party with credibility and that it has no moral strength. When the voters look for a party in which all democratic White people can feel at home, regardless of their faith or origins, then it is this party. But look at the party on that side of the House. How can all Whites feel at home in that party&#x003F; I should like to turn to the economy and what this hon. member advocated, i.e. a slow growth rate, and not the growth rate we had in 1964 and 1969.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I was dealing with the matter which the hon. member for Carltonville advocated, i.e. that he stands for a slow growth rate or a moderate growth rate, to use his words. Sir, there the hon. member let the cat out of the bag in regard to why this entire Government now advocates a moderate growth rate. I shall come to that later when I speak to the hon. the Minister of Finance about this moderate growth rate. The hon. member asked what is necessary for a good growth rate. It is capital and labour. He then dealt with the question of capital. Where must the capital come from&#x003F; Does he not know that capital comes from an increased turnover in the business world, and does he not know that what is retarding it at this stage is the lack of labour necessary to generate more capital&#x003F; The hon. member spoke quite derogatorily of the non-White labour we have; their labour is of such a nature that one cannot place them in senior positions. Their labour is of a humble kind which is only qualified to do certain things. Sir, that is why I ask in all earnestness whose fault is it that the non-White labour in this country, and particularly Bantu labour, is not capable of pulling its weight in the economy&#x003F; Is it not the Government&#x2019;s fault&#x003F; The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and his Deputies have repeatedly stated that the Government will not allow the Black man in the Republic of South Africa to be trained, to be technically trained, to pull his weight; he can be trained in the Bantu areas to pull his weight there, but not here. As long as they are of that way of thinking, it is surely not possible, for the manufacturers have to make do with a mere a quota of the labour which the country has at its disposal; they cannot use all the labour.</p>

<p>But I should like to return now to the hon. the Minister of Finance who told us last year that he had inflation by the short hairs, that this country would be amongst the foremost ten countries owing to its economic strength, and that there was no question of devaluation. He was still saying that well into the year. Then, within the space of two months the Minister not only devalued, but also applied stricter import control. I want to know what two methods there were which the Minister could have utilized to bring about greater inflation and to cause the cost of living to rise more steeply than precisely those two methods. He devalued&#x2014;and I shall deal later with how this has caused our cost of living to rise&#x2014;and he made import control even stricter, and there the cost of living goes up; you can see no way of halting it, as the hon. the Minister will know. Do you know, Sir, that when I cast my mind back over this hon. gentleman&#x2019;s past, and I have known him for many years, I think of the days when he was the leading light in the Reddingsdaadbond He was the pivot on which it turned. You know as well as I, and the old school knows, Sir, what the Reddingsdaadbond stood for and how he figured in that organization. That hon. Minister was the man who spoke up with a strong voice in the country for the lesser privileged Afrikaner, for the man who was living on and below the bread-line. He <span class="col_1465-1466" refersTo="page_0750"/>tried to work miracles for the upliftment of those people. You know it as well as I do, Sir, and we had great esteem for him, and still have it today, and for the views he held in those days. But if we come to where the Minister is today, we wonder whether he is still of the same opinion and whether he still has the same feeling for the lesser privileged. We wonder whether he is still so concerned about the cost of living and how those people are getting on. After all there are pensioners and other people who have to come out on very little, thanks to the methods he has again applied now, and which will cause the cost of living to soar again. Is the hon. the Minister still thinking of those people whose month is longer than their salaries, and how they must live on that&#x003F; Now that the Minister finds himself in a different environment, is living in a marble palace, does he still look after the interests of these kind of people, as he is expected to do&#x003F; Has the hon. gentleman ever tried to draw up a budget for the man earning R300, from which he must pay his house rent, or interest on his bond, insurances, licences, clothing, staple products, butter, milk, vegetables, fruit, meat, coffee and tea&#x003F; Has the hon. the Minister tried to draw up such a budget to see whether such a person can come out&#x003F; And if he cannot come out, can we afford to cause the cost of living to rise ever higher&#x003F; Or is it time the Government did everything in its power to prevent the cost of living from rising higher&#x003F; I do not doubt that the hon. the Minister knows as well as any other member of this House that devaluation coupled with increased import control can in many respects only cause the cost of living to rise. Imports, for example, are more expensive.</p>

<p>I sometimes wonder by whom the hon. the Minister is being advised in these times in regard to certain fiscal and financial methods. Does their advice still mean anything&#x003F; What about businessmen such as Dr. Jan Marais, Dr. Hupkes, Mr. Van Aswegen and Dr. Wassenaar&#x003F; Does the Government still take note of the advice of these people when they level criticism and want to lead it in other directions&#x003F; Or have they, too, now that they are criticizing the Government, become national enemies of the Government&#x003F; I sometimes wonder who supplies the hon. the Minister with advice, in view of the methods he utilizes.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is for private enterprise to seize this chance, for South Africa has a private enterprise economy. The ability of our industry and commerce to adapt themselves to the new circumstances, to recognize and grasp the opportunity, in rugby parlance &#x201C;to take the gap&#x201D;, will be tested to the full.</block>

<p>I should like to put the following specific question to the hon. the Minister. Does the Government still believe in private enterprise&#x003F; How does it reconcile this with its many State and State-aided projects which could just as well have been developed by private enterprise, i.e. if he still believes in private enterprise. Then one still has the high taxes and the lack of a purposeful incentive to greater production. That is surely retarding private enterprise. In addition, industrialists are expected to get along with only a quota of the available labour, while industries throughout the world are allowed to compete in the entire labour field. If devaluaton increases production costs, how must they compete purposefully with the rest of the world&#x003F;</p>

<p>I want to return again to the question of the availability of labour and the problem we have in that regard. This is a problem which businessmen and industrialists must inevitably have. They simply do not have sufficient labour available. The hon. the Minister encourages them to produce more. They must produce more otherwise our exports will not increase. If that industrialist has to increase production, with the increased production costs as a result of the increased costs of all imported goods, such as capital goods and so on, and with the unobtainability of sufficient labour, I wonder how that hon. Minister would argue in this regard. Even if they are being encouraged, how must they do this&#x003F; The tax pressure on these people is exceptionally heavy. I do not need to mention this; the hon. member for Umlazi has done so repeatedly. The tax pressure on these people is heavy; their production costs must inevitably increase and their labour has been restricted. In fact, they do not know what the Government&#x2019;s policy in regard to labour is; whether it is the policy of the Minister of Transport, which is that they are to be given a little more scope, or whether they will still be under the quota system so that they have to obtain permits to find people who come to work for them for only a while. These people are not permanently employed by them and they <span class="col_1467-1468" refersTo="page_0751"/>cannot be trained and conditioned for the work they have to do. The temporary permits make provision for transportation to and from the place of work and the Bantu states. In one way or another we are all associated with industralization or business enterprises, and I wonder whether the hon. the Minister knows what a brake on, and what a lack of incentive there is for these industrialists, an incentive which could encourage them to greater production. If there were some method by means of which they could be given an incentive after having increased their production, an incentive which provides for diminished taxation as production increases, it would encourage these people more. I should very much like to have the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention. I know that there is a tax incentive for the man who produces more, but the incentive is far from sufficient to encourage the industrialist to produce more and better products. How does the hon. the Minister want to succeed in getting industrialists to produce more if he places three or four brakes on him and gives him no incentive to produce more and better products&#x003F; In heaven&#x2019;s name, is this possible&#x003F; Will they respond to that call&#x003F;</p>

<p>Now I want to return to the appeal which was made to organized labour not to ask for higher wages. The Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We shall need, as I have already mentioned, moderation and restraint on the part of organized labour, but we shall also need enterprise and marketing ability on the part of management and organizing ability to promote greater productivity.</block>

<p>I repeat that greater productivity is dependent upon a number of requirements. The man must have sufficient labour; he must have the methods at his disposal with which he can produce more cheaply and not more expensively as is at present the case, and he must have an incentive. As far as labour is concerned, how many quotations are there dealing with the labour problem&#x003F; In the latest edition of <i>Commercial Opinion</i> I read the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When Assocom, this journal and other commentators warn that all is not well with our economic policy, there are two broad possibilities. Either our criticisms have little or no foundation or in fact we are right. In the former case no one need worry; things may continue more or less as before. If we are right, however, events will prove it so.</block>

<p>What have we been saying&#x003F; We have been saying that it is necessary to make fuller use of our non-White manpower resources; that Government spending has become excessive; that taxation has become burdensome; that the continuing inflation has led to misinvestment and the creation of a pattern of exploitation that cannot be fulfilled; and that certain other Government policies are not conducive to economic growth.</p>

<p>To the man in the street&#x2014;and, we fear, to many officials in Pretoria&#x2014;these are broad generalizations that fail to evoke much response. Their impact is dulled by repetition. But one day the consequences may become evident. And the consequences are manifested in the only possible way, namely by a decline in living standards. Money incomes are not easily cut, so the inevitable adjustment takes place through a rise in the price level &#x2014;what is called the cost of living.</p>

<p>In the latest edition of the <i>Financial Mail,</i> the following is said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">These are just a few of the uncertainties perplexing the men who are supposed to make the economy tick. Above all they want a clear guide about labour.</block>

<p>They realize (and so it seems, does everybody else apart from the diehards inside and outside the Nationalist Party) that continued growth and prosperity require a fundamental change of attitude to the non-White worker&#x2014;to his stability, his housing, his education, his training, his productivity and his pay. The country is ready for it. The management is ready for it. And many of the trade unions are ready for it.</p>

<p>I have asked repeatedly, and I want to ask again now, that the hon. the Minister, when he replies this afternoon, should tell us whether the Government&#x2019;s labour pattern and labour policy has changed or whether it is still the same. Would he tell us whether more Bantu and non-White labour can be made available&#x003F; Would the hon. the Minister tell us whether it is Cabinet policy that they may be given technical training in the Republic of South Africa to enable them to pull their weight in industries&#x003F; Or will we again receive no replies&#x003F; I want to repeat that industrialists as such, particularly <span class="col_1469-1470" refersTo="page_0752"/>in commerce, do not see their way clear to complying with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s appeal that more and better products should be produced so that the gap between our exports and imports can be closed. The Minister&#x2019;s appeal to trade unions, that they should not ask for higher wages, is a farce. Has the House ever heard anything like it&#x003F; The cost of living is rising as a result of methods which are being applied by that Government. If the worker&#x2019;s cost of living rises, and he consequently cannot come out on his salary, what must he do&#x003F; Would it help to make a moral appeal to the labour force in the Republic not to ask for higher wages while we know that there is already agitation for higher wages in many sectors, and also in the sector of the hon. the Minister of Transport&#x003F; Of course these people will want higher wages. The spiral keeps turning; it is the same pattern: Every time wages increase, inflation increases as well.</p>

<p>Lastly, the hon. the Minister made the following statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An increase in the price of imported goods resulting from the devaluation of the rand was inevitable and in some respects even a desirable tendency in that it enhanced the ability of local industry to compete with imported articles.</block>

<p>Surely this is not an accurate and true statement. Does the hon. the Minister really think that when import control makes other articles more expensive, this helps make it easier for our local manufacturers to compete&#x003F; Surely the hon. the Minister knows that the prices of commodities we have to import, are not only affected by the devaluation of 12,28 per cent which occurred here, but that these are also affected by the revaluation of the monetary units of the countries from which we are importing, such as Germany and Japan for example. The difference is therefore not only 12,28 per cent, but in fact 20 per cent. In addition to that, sales tax has to be paid on the prices which are 20 per cent higher. When the hon. the Minister came to light with sales tax, we told him repeatedly that he should make it a purchase tax. Now the term &#x201C;purchase tax&#x201D; is being used, while in reality it is a sales tax. It simply amounts to the same old story again: More money is being paid out owing to devaluation on the one hand and appreciation on the other, higher sales tax and a higher price structure as soon as imported commodities are used. How must the producer produce more cheaply&#x003F; That is the problem. I think it is time the hon. the Minister took the country into his confidence and told manufacturers and traders throughout the country what the policy of the Government for the near future is in respect of the country&#x2019;s labour pattern in the first place. He must tell them whether they can rely on getting more labour and that the labour will be given technical training here in this country or whether it is now and for always the Government&#x2019;s policy that this will not be done&#x003F;</p>

<p>The second point, one which I have mentioned previously, is this: What incentive will there be to produce more and better products&#x003F; The hon. the Minister must indicate to us what incentive there will be apart from what I call &#x201C;minor incentives&#x201D; which exist at this stage for the manufacturers to produce more and better products in spite of all the problems they already have. I want to repeat that there are many countries in the world where this incentive is being given; when they are hard-up for exports of their own products and they want the manufacturers to double their yield, they not only say that more and longer working hours must be worked, they also say that if the manufacturers can double their production quota the incentive will be so much, and if they can triple it, they need not pay tax on the third portion. After all, that is probably what manufacturers here want. It is also probably the incentive the country needs to produce more. We are looking forward to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply in this regard. If neither he nor the Prime Minister nor anyone else in the Cabinet can furnish those replies, or can tell us what the Government&#x2019;s policy is in this respect, I want to say that not only Brakpan, but many other places as well will say: &#x201C;Out with this Government! We have had enough! &#x201D;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens said here a few days ago that this debate would possibly be one of the most significant of this intire session. I do not think the hon. member could have realized how close he came to the truth. This debate which has almost concluded has in many respects been one of the most remarkable I have ever attended in my long experience in this House. I regret to say that it has been one of the most barren, boring and uninspired debates I have ever heard on <span class="col_1471-1472" refersTo="page_0753"/>the part of the Opposition. There has been a boring repetition of statements from that side of this hon. House, statements which have been made over and over again in this House during the past years.</p>

<p>In the second place, I must say that to my regret I experienced a bitterness and an acrimony from hon. members on that side of this House during the past debate such as I have never known in this House. In the two or more decades for which the hon. the Leader and I have been sitting in this House, I have crossed swords on the floor of this House with men such as Mr. Waterson in the debates which have been conducted here. We fought a tough battle with each other, but we could always look each other in the face, because we tried to conduct the debates on a high level.</p>

<p>In recent years, however, the situation has changed completely. I am very sorry to have to say, that since my friend the hon. member for Parktown became the U.P. leader in the economic and financial debates in this House, there has been a complete change in the relationship between the Opposition and the Government. There is now a feeling of bitterness in which arguments no longer count. Because the Opposition know that their arguments no longer count, they are trying to create an impression by using strong language. We could perhaps forgive them this acrimony if it were not so harmful to the country. This acrimony only springs from a feeling of frustration on the part of people who would so much like to come and sit on this side of this House, but know that, in spite of everything, they will never succeed in doing so.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall come to that in a moment. From this side it often seemed as if those hon. members were speaking in a sound-proof room. They rant and rave, but nobody listens to them. Those who do listen to them, do not pay much attention to them. In the past few weeks I made a point of getting in touch with the business world as well. It is my job. I shall not deny that those hon. members have supporters in the business world, because we know this. But I want to tell hon. members that some of the most prominent businessmen told me that I should take no notice of what those people say. Even some of the severest critics of the Government&#x2019;s economic policy still firmly support the National Party. A few days ago I spoke to a prominent industrialist in this country, a person who has been critical of certain aspects of the Government&#x2019;s economic policy. When he asked me what he should do with a Government which refused to do what he wanted, I advised him to vote the Government out of power. He replied: &#x201C;No, not on your life.&#x201D; However critical those businessmen may be, many of them merely in order to see their names in the newspapers, they do not want that side of the House ever to take over the government. A party has never come into power by berating and abusing its opposition. A party has never come into power by repeating dozens and dozens of points of policy. Does the Opposition not remember what happened in 1953&#x003F; In that year the United Party came forward with hundreds of promises and thought it would win the people&#x2019;s votes by that means. However, it suffered a heavy defeat. The many promises they make will harm them rather than help them to make headway.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to say in this connection that no party has ever come into power and remained in power in South Africa by means of pure bread-and-butter politics, with a purely materialistic philosophy such as we have heard from that side of the House. The only party which will govern in this country is one which can look after the material needs of the people, but which also has a message for its people, a message which transcends all material gain. What inspiration have those hon. members given the people&#x003F; What inspiration have they given the youth&#x003F; They say that the youth are becoming estranged and are turning to them. Let us look for a moment at what has been revealed by scientific investigations. I have here a scientific investigation carried out at the University of Pretoria, in which it is stated (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<p>[Interjections.]</p>

<p>An investigation was carried out at the University of Stellenbosch as well, in which <i>inter alia</i> the following is stated (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Eighty-seven per cent of the Afrikaans-speaking students belong to the National Party and 7 per cent to the United Party. Forty-one per cent of the English-speaking students belong to the United Party. According to these data there is solid support for the National Party in the ranks of the Afrikaans speaking.</block>

<p>I should like to proceed to discussing a few matters of policy, but before doing so, I want to draw the attention of this hon. House to a few points to prove how ineffectual and desperate that party is, a party which cannot even form a proper Opposition and is therefore incapable of governing the country. I want to mention a few examples&#x2014;and I can mention numerous such examples&#x2014;which have occurred in recent debates. In the first place, I want to make the statement that hon. members on that side are incapable of making even the most elementary arithmetical calculations. Surely a party which wants to govern the country must be able to do some arithmetic in the economic and financial spheres, but they cannot even do that. Let me mention a few examples. I referred in this debate to the cost of living index actually being 4 per cent. In talking of 7 per cent, we include the 3 per cent in administered prices, which must be dealt with differently. This is the finding of the Reserve Bank. Hon. members did not understand that. I explained it in my Second Reading speech and watched the hon. members over there. I am sure not one of them could understand that calculation. Secondly, the same thing happened when a report of an interview with me appeared in <i>Die Transvaler</i> in which it was said that I had predicted that the cost of living index figure might drop after March. The hon. member for Parktown looked at me with an expression of utter amazement on his face that one could say something like that, and asked me whether I had really said it. The rules of this House did not permit me to reply to that. Subsequently I replied to it in the Second Reading speech, but up to this very moment hon. members have understood nothing of it. I have not received a proper reply to it even now. In the third place, I mentioned in a previous debate that one of the reasons why we had devalued, and had devalued more than the dollar had, was that we would receive more rands for our gold than if we had not done so. I hope you can remember the expression of consternation on the faces of the hon. friends opposite. They simply did not understand that one would receive more rands for one&#x2019;s gold if one devalued more than the dollar had.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville mentioned a beautiful example a few days ago. He said that the old people were not cared for in our country. In 1948 they received R12 per month in old-age pension, and now they receive R38. In the meanwhile the value of the rand had decreased from 100 cents to 45 cents. Then he asked: &#x201C;How can they be better off when the rand is worth 45 cents&#x003F;&#x201D; He cannot do arithmetic. Suppose the rand was once worth 100 cents and now, according to him, it is worth 45 cents, then it has lost 55 per cent of its value. But the pension has increased from R12 to R38, i.e. by 220 per cent.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But one can look at it from the other side as well. The buying-power of the R12 has decreased by 120 per cent, but the allowance they now receive has increased by 220 per cent. The hon. member still understands absolutely nothing of this. In addition, the hon. member forgot that pensions have in the meantime been supplemented with a deferred pension of R11 and an attendant&#x2019;s allowance of R10, so that pension can be R59 per month, or R118 for a married couple.</p>

<p>Hon. members opposite have proved in this debate that they have no conception of economic principles either. In the first place, we explained to them <i>ad nauseam</i> that there is something like fluctuations in the economy. My friends on this side of the House spoke about that. No economy ever remains on an even keel; there are upward and downward movements, <span class="col_1475-1476" refersTo="page_0755"/>there are the cyclical fluctuations. This is the case in every country in the world. If one tells them that things have gone well in South Africa for more than 20 years, but that one of those cyclical fluctuations is taking place now, they simply do not understand it. I am beginning to think that those hon. members, the so-called alternative government, are a lot of scared people and that they have taken fright. Now that a slight deceleration has unfortunately entered our economy, something we should like to change, we find that they are paralysed with fright. If they get such a fright in the Opposition, how would they not take fright and run away if they were the Government&#x003F;</p>

<p>In the second place, hon. members do not understand the economic concept that economics is international, and that we here form part of what is taking place in the economic sphere throughout the world. We are not isolated. Our economy is part of world economy; we are affected by world trends. We repeatedly tell those hon. members this, but their blinkers are closing their eyes. They cannot see farther than right in front of them. They cannot see farther than these benches, in which they would so much like to sit.</p>

<p>In the third place, we have tried to explain that the inflation we have today, is due mainly to excessive consumption and that the methods which must be employed against excessive consumption are fiscal and monetary ones, which are also recommended by the International Monetary Fund in such circumstances. But they do not understand this, Sir. They do not understand it, and that is why we never heard anything positive from them.</p>

<p>I come to the hon. member for Durban Point, who said in a speech in the previous debate: &#x201C;It may be true that the 4 per cent increase in the real domestic product is mainly in the form of wages and salaries, but look at the terrible cost of living.&#x201D; Did the hon. member not know that in that 4 per cent the cost of living had already been taken into account and that it was a real figure which was determined after the cost of living had been taken into account&#x003F; Did the hon. member not know this, or was he merely indulging in propaganda&#x003F;</p>

<p>Sir, that hon. member is not the only one speaking like this. The other day the hon. member for Simonstown addressed a meeting in the Strand together with the hon. member for Yeoville, and referred to the cost of living which was so terribly high. He spoke of the tremendous &#x201C;inflationary rate&#x201D;, and said that the growth of South Africa did not nearly approach and could not be compared with the high inflation in our country. But the hon. member omitted to tell his people that the growth rate may be more than 10 per cent this year, while inflation is 7 per cent at most. He omitted to say that in monetary terms the growth rate was higher than the rate of inflation (<i>ruilvoet</i>).</p>

<p>When I spoke about the rate of exchange in the previous debate, I tried to explain that one of the main reasons why we had had to devalue and why we had devalued more than the dollar, was that the rate of exchange in our foreign trade had changed unfavourably towards us. The hon. members sat looking at me as if they had never before heard of something like the rate of exchange. The hon. member for Constantia mentioned a few dates here and asked what had happened between 22nd October and 24th November, when we introduced import control. Did the hon. member not take note of what happened then&#x003F; Did he not watch what was taking place in the economic sphere&#x003F; Did he not know about the outflow of money from South Africa and of the leads and lags and the other reasons for import control&#x003F; Imports increased because the people were expecting import control or devaluation. As a result, there was a flight of capital from the country, and under these circumstances every responsible Government would have been obliged to do something in November in order to protect its reserves. Now the question is put to me: &#x201C;But did you not know that the Group of Ten were going to meet in December&#x003F;&#x201D; Yes, we knew they were going to meet, but we did not know what they were going to decide or that a decision would be taken. We did not know whether they were going to decide to devalue or to what extent they were going to devalue or revalue. There were rumours that they would reach a compromise perhaps only in February, or perhaps only at the end of this year. Did the hon. member for Constantia and others on that side know what the Group <span class="col_1477-1478" refersTo="page_0756"/>of Ten was going to decide in December&#x003F; On 24th November, when we decided on import control, did they know what the Group of Ten was going to decide in December&#x003F; If they knew, why did they not tell us about it&#x003F;</p>

<p>Sir, a great deal has been said here about the &#x00A3;80 million gold loan which was made to Britain in 1948. I think it is time for us to come forward with the truth in regard to that loan. We are always told here that in those years when we took over, the economy was so wonderfully sound that they could afford to lend Britain &#x00A3;80 million in gold.</p>

<p>In 1947 the deficit on current account was R354 million and the national income was R1 612 million. The deficit on current account was 22 per cent. In 1948 it was 19 per cent and in 1970 it was 8&#x00BD; per cent. This was the wonderfully sound economy we took over in 1948. Every day the greatest surprise is expressed here at the great deficit on our current account and on the balance of payments. This is correct, but in our case it is 8&#x00BD; per cent of the national income; in their case it was 22 per cent. Sir, what happened then&#x003F;</p>

<p>Soon after we had come into power, the entire &#x00A3;80 million gold loan which had been made to Britain had to be used for paying for purchases over there, because our coffers here in South Africa were empty. What else did we have to do&#x003F; We had to decrease the gold coverage from 30 per cent to 25 per cent. When we came into power in 1948, we had to introduce import control at the insistence of members on that side of the House, and in 1949, as a result of the economic position, even after import control, we had to devalue the &#x00A3; by 30 per cent. In spite of this, hon. members ask us: &#x201C;Why did you introduce import control here and then devalue&#x003F;&#x201D; In view of the position we inherited from them at the time, we were obliged to introduce import control and to devalue as well.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked me: What about the national debt&#x003F; The hon. member for Simonstown said: &#x201C;Our national debt is staggeringly high&#x201D;. Sir, in 1947 the national debt was 75 per cent of the national income; in 1948 it was 72 per cent and in 1970 it was 54 per cent. Just look at these figures again. In 1947, when they were in power, the national public debt was 75 per cent of the national income, and in 1970 it was 54 per cent. Yet the hon. member says it is &#x201C;staggeringly high&#x201D; at the moment, but he does not tell our people that the debt of a country such as ours is the capital with which the country works. A country does not issue shares; it borrows, and with this capital which it borrows we build the roads, bridges, railways, schools, hospitals &#x2014;the entire infrastructure. The whole of this &#x201C;staggeringly high&#x201D; debt of our people is represented by positive assets.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for Constantia, of whom it surprises me even more, comes along and says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Since 1965 we have had continually, without any lifting, credit ceilings in the banking sector.</block>

<p>Did the hon. member say this&#x003F; Yes, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Since 1965 we have had continually, without any lifting, credit ceilings in the banking sector.</block>

<p>But surely this is not true, Mr. Speaker. It is everything but the truth. In 1966 there was a &#x201C;lifting of the ceiling&#x201D; by R104 million, in 1967 by R274 million, in 1968 by R280 million, in 1969 by R487 million, in 1970 by R361 million and in 1971, up to September, by R187 million. Over that period credit was increased by almost R1 700 million. But the hon. member asks us to believe that there has been &#x201C;no lifting of the credit ceiling&#x201D;. This is the credibility gap of which the hon. members speak so often. These are the hon. members who condemn us so often for allegedly governing the country in an inflationary way and financing the Budget in an inflationary way. But let me point out to the hon. members that in this period from 1966, the credit of the private sector increased by R1 696 million and that of the State by R212 million, approximately one-eighth of that of the private sector. In spite of this we are told that this inflation has been caused by the State&#x2019;s extravagance and by its making use of bank credit, but <span class="col_1479-1480" refersTo="page_0757"/>these figures prove that the private sector borrowed eight times as much money from banks as the State.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Von Brandis made a few jokes here in regard to the rate of increase. In response to what we said about the rate of increase having dropped, he made several jokes about a motor car travelling over a bad road at 50 miles an hour, then at 65, and then at 60. I am sorry to say that if the hon. member makes such jokes, he simply shows that he does not want to understand the position. I think it was rather flippant of the hon. member to do such things. It was in fact a ridiculous comparison, because he knows this is not the position and that it will not go down with any economist in the world.</p>

<p>Then growth was discussed here. We have heard so often about the growth rate of 4 per cent, that we have fallen so low that we have reached a growth rate of only 4 per cent. Sir, let us take another look at how wonderful things were in their time. In 1946 their growth rate was 1,7 per cent. In 1942 there was a negative growth rate under their r&#x00E9;gime. In the eight years from 1940 to 1948 the average growth rate was 3,2 per cent.</p>

<p>And if one takes the population growth into account, the growth <i>per capita</i> was 1,4 per cent as compared with 2,7 per cent in our case, about which they are complaining today. I want to say that the hon. members have no understanding of our monetary concepts either. The hon. member for Parktown too made the statement here that if it is good for gold that we should devalue more than the dollar, why do we not continue devaluing and devaluing&#x003F;</p>

<p>I think that is an argument which certainly is not worthy of that hon. member. He can do much better than that. If this is the position, we should say that, if it is good to reduce taxation, as they say every day, we should continue reducing taxation until nobody pays tax any more. If we should relax credit, we should simply continue relaxing credit. This is no argument. But the hon. member for Parktown made a much more dangerous statement than that. I said that we had devalued by 12,3 per cent in order to have finality in respect of devaluation, so that it could not be said that we would also be obliged to devalue further if the dollar were devalued again. From this the hon. member then made the deduction that the dollar was a weak currency, as well as the further deduction that the rand was one of the weakest currencies in the world. These were his deductions. But this is nonsense. Does the hon. member not know of the disquiet which prevailed at the Rome meeting of the Ten when America merely hinted that it may devalue up to 10 per cent&#x003F;</p>

<p>The other nations had a fright, because they did not want America to devalue up to 10 per cent. Do hon. members know that the meeting adjourned for that reason&#x003F; Do they know of the disquiet which existed only recently when there was talk that the Bill which is going to be introduced in America, would allow her to devalue by more than 7,9 per cent&#x003F; The other nations do not want America to devalue by more. But suppose America devalued by 10 per cent or 12 per cent. Do hon. members think Germany, Japan and other countries would do nothing&#x003F; They would not do nothing; they would also devalue. They would also reduce the value of their money, because they want only a certain gap between themselves and the dollar. They do not want the dollar to do better and to find things easier on the market than they do. This is an elementary monetary concept. I assume the hon. member understands this; he must understand it. Or does he not understand it&#x003F; [Interjections.] No, he does not understand it. It is as I have said: They do not understand it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia made as outrageous a statement. He said: &#x201C;Devaluation is an act of insolvency.&#x201D; This is not only an insult to South Africa, but also prejudices South Africa in presenting it as an insolvent country which may not fulfil its obligations. How will such a report be received abroad, i.e. if those people who have to lend us money are told by an hon. member from our own country that South Africa has committed an act of insolvency and cannot fulfil its obligations towards its friends&#x003F; I think it is time the Opposition reflected on everything it is doing to South Africa.</p>

<p>After all the sad tales we have heard here, I can at least present something good to hon. members by pointing to what other people are saying about us. There are other people who also know something about South Africa and who make a point of <span class="col_1481-1482" refersTo="page_0758"/>saying something favourable about the country. The hon. member has probably heard of the recent visit by Dr. Lutz, the Director of the Swiss Credit Bank. He toured South Africa for a month in order to examine the investment possibilities here. This Dr. Lutz issued a report of four big pages which appeared in a magazine. The <i>Star</i> of last Thursday contained a short summary of that report. This person is a prominent banker. The heading of the article reads as follows: &#x201C;Put Faith and Cash in South Africa&#x2014;Swiss Banker&#x2019;s bright view.&#x201D; I quote from the article&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Foreign investors would be well advised to put their faith and money in South Africa, according to one of Switzerland&#x2019;s leading bankers. Dr. Lutz, a Director of the Swiss Credit Bank, which is Switzerland&#x2019;s third largest, has analysed South Africa, both politically and economically in a four-page article in his bank&#x2019;s monthly bulletin. He said South Africa is a land of contrasts but despite these contrasts one has always the impression of being in a modern and well-conducted State. Living conditions are good and safety in cities and roads was better than in many parts of Europe and America. Whoever believes that South Africa is a police state, is astonished at the small number of uniform guardians to be seen, he added. He was surprised to see how naturally the different races live side by side &#x2026;</block>

<p>He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The country is extremely exposed in the economic, social and political areas, but the experience of the authorities and heads of industry as well as the efficiency of the South African economy will permit it to develop successfully.</block>

<p>Furthermore, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dr Lutz &#x2026;</block>

<p>The hon. members must please listen now&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; praised the Government&#x2019;s remarkable competence even when compared to certain European and North American examples.</block>

<p>Here we have an unprejudiced view from someone who has made a thorough study of South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to come to points of policy now. Hon. members have asked me in the past to put our policy. I want to say I cannot do so fully, because many matters have to wait until the Budget is presented. However, I want to elaborate on a few points today. In the first place, I want to say to the hon. members that they ought to know what our policy is, because they have been criticizing it for 20 years now. Surely they have seen in the past few months what we have done in respect of import control and devaluation&#x2014;two very brave steps which reflect the Government&#x2019;s policy. They know that policy. Before continuing, I want to ask the hon. members, in the first place, what their policy is in regard to devaluation. No, let us rather start with import control. What is the United Party&#x2019;s policy in regard to import control&#x003F; Are they in favour of it or opposed to it&#x003F; [Interjections.] I am calling all the people of South Africa to witness. There we have a party which wants to govern the country, but in respect of one of the most cardinal issues of the country it cannot furnish a reply.</p>

He said it was insolvency. We have here two different points of view, and today we still do not know whether they are in favour of or opposed to devaluation.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, now I am going to state our policy. The policy of the National Party which we have not only stated in this House, but also implemented, has taken this country to unprecedented economic heights. [Interjections.] If hon. members opposite doubt this, it is merely another illustration of their ignorance in respect of the economy. Right from the start the National Party made the industrial promotion of the country one of the major points of its policy. When that side of the House was still indifferent to that principle, we realized that the promotion of industry afforded us the only method of making South Africa prosperous and of providing employment opportunities for our people. We strengthened the Board of Trade and Industry and gave protection to our industries. From that time on industrial development really started in South Africa. We laid down the principle of private initiative on which South Africa has been firmly built. We established an infrastructure in South Africa which is wonderful when compared to our resources, the size and vastness of the country and the sparseness of the population. This brought public debt. Where do we stand now&#x003F; We still stand by that same policy. Where we are standing particularly in the light of balance of payments problems, and where we have devalued and introduced import control beforehand in order to safeguard our balance of payments and in order to protect our reserves, it is our policy to do everything in our power to safeguard our balance of payments, to push up our reserves and to ensure that we do not get into <span class="col_1485-1486" refersTo="page_0760"/>a similar position as last year, if we can help it in any way. Devaluation and import control are provisional steps to protect our reserves. The increase of our reserves is one of the basic grounds for the implementation of our further policy in respect of the economy. In order to safeguard this balance of payments, we must take a further step, and that is to promote our exports with every means at our disposal. We have already done a considerable amount in this regard. In previous Budgets we announced certain measures for promoting exports from this country. We have established bodies such as Safto; we have sent trade missions abroad, we have stationed trade representatives throughout the world and we have appointed the Reynders Commission to advise us on further steps in respect of exports. This Commission has submitted its provisional report. We are studying that report at present and shall tell this House at a later stage what we are going to do in that regard. Hon. members may accept that this Government is going to do everything in its power to promote exports. Now we ask, &#x201C;What about the private sector&#x003F;&#x201D; Do the hon. members want to encourage the private sector as well to promote exports&#x003F; Surely they are the people who should do so in the first place. In order to promote exports, we need production first.</p>

<p>What is needed now, is that we should increase our production. Our production has decreased, or it has not increased as it should have. The State is not to be blamed for this. An analysis was made by certain people who know more about these matters than some hon. members do, and they found that capital expenditure and management were responsible for 80 per cent of any increase in production. They said that management and capital expenditure were responsible for 80 per cent of an increase in production and that labour was responsible for 20 per cent. We should take a look at the private sector and not blame the State for everything. Hon. members are not doing South Africa a favour when they blame the State for everything, and do not encourage the private sector to play its part as well. When I speak of production promotion, I am thinking in the first place of the refining of our minerals. This is a tremendously large field waiting for us. I have faith in the future of South Africa. As regards the substitution of gold by our base minerals in their unrefined, but particularly in their refined form, the world will have to look to South Africa to an increasing extent for obtaining its raw materials. In coming years we shall have to take all possible steps to refine our minerals as much as possible so that work may be provided for our people, so that transport may be saved and so that a larger measure of foreign exchange may be earned.</p>

<p>We need capital. We shall have to teach our people to generate capital. The first step in that direction is to teach people to save more. If the Opposition wants to work in the interests of South Africa, I want to ask them not to make a joke of the matter when we speak of saving more. There are people in this country who are able to save. I know there are people who are not able to save. This is the position in every country of the world, but there are also people in South Africa who are in fact able to save. When we look at the high consumption figure in South Africa, the actual real consumption I have mentioned, we see that it is tremendously high and that it is growing annually. But every time we speak of saving, hon. members joke about it. This is not doing South Africa any good.</p>

<p>In the second place, we should welcome capital from abroad in South Africa just as we did in the past. There are numerous people who want to come to South Africa. I do not want to mention their names, but I can assure the hon. members that some of the most prominent people in North America and Europe are interested in investing in South Africa. We should not discourage them, as the hon. member for Constantia did by saying that South Africa was insolvent. Let us welcome those people if they want to invest in South Africa.</p>

<p>We shall have to provide credit as well. Already in my previous speech I stated that we should pay attention to the question of credit provision and to the ceiling imposed by the Reserve Bank, on which the Reserve <span class="col_1487-1488" refersTo="page_0761"/>Bank was having discussions with the various monetary banks. The hon. member accused me as though I had only just discovered that this matter was unsatisfactory. I have always known that this matter is unsatisfactory, but let the hon. member suggest another and better method to me. I can assure the hon. House that as soon as there is another and better method of controlling credit, that method will be introduced by the Reserve Bank. It would be stupid and absolutely foolish on our part to lift all credit restrictions now, because it would lead to aggravated inflation in this country.</p>

<p>Let us look at the problem of the protection of our industries. We gave a new directive to the Board of Trade and Industry, which has always performed this task, to protect the industries deserving of protection as far as possible. After I had spoken about our difficulties with GATT, the hon. member for Parktown made the snide remark that in 22 years we had either done nothing or, if we had done something, we did not have the right to speak against GATT. This is the way hon. members opposite argue. The hon. member for Parktown ought to know that in the past 22 years the import duties of hundreds of industries have been increased as a result of agreements with GATT.</p>

<p>The hon. member should first let me finish speaking before interrupting me. The hon. member knows that there are hundreds and hundreds of tariffs which are bound and which we cannot and may not increase without granting compensation for it. The motor car industry, which is one of our strongest industries today, was one of those industries, and over the past 20 years we have conducted numerous very difficult negotiations in that regard. But I have not yet finished with the hon. member for Parktown. We have received numerous increases, also in respect of bound tariffs. At present many of our industries are still subject to bound tariffs and we are experiencing great difficulty in having them unbound so that increased tariffs may be obtained in that way. We also send officials to Geneva who work there sometimes for months and years to fight for our tariffs. In addition we have an embassy operating there. There is one in Geneva which pays attention mainly to this matter. From time to time we also send people over there to do special work. The hon. member for Parktown describes them as &#x201C;a flock of pigeons over the Continent of Europe holding discussions with GATT&#x201D;. This is the way in which hon. members opposite treat the public servants of South Africa. When they are sent out on such essential work, they are regarded as a &#x201C;flock of pigeons&#x201D; flying over the Continent of Europe. [Interjections.] No, this is not the first time this has happened. By now it has become customary for them to attack our public servants, who cannot defend themselves in this House. This is what the hon. member for Parktown did. We are appointing a standing committee to make a penetrating study of the GATT issue, one which will continually be dealing with it. The Government and the Departments of Commerce and Industries continually pay urgent attention to the most effective protection of our industries. However, if the hon. member thinks this is an easy matter, he does not know what it involves. I do not want to be unfriendly, but the hon. member for Parktown and all his sophistry and very subtle reasoning made me think that I should append a name to that reasoning of his. I thought the best name would be Emdinitis. If, however, you regard it as being too personal, Sir, I am prepared to withdraw it.</p>

<p>Taxation was discussed here as well. I realize that the tax burden is heavy. However, it is not as heavy as in many other countries of the world. I want to tell hon. members that it is the desire of this Government to reduce taxation as far as possible, but then the public should not expect of the State what it expects of the State at present. Then they should not expect the schools, hospitals, roads, new ministries and all the other things they want from the State nowadays. At the beginning of this session I started writing down everything hon. members opposite requested of the Government. In the three weeks which have passed, they have <span class="col_1489-1490" refersTo="page_0762"/>put dozens of demands to the Government. However, let us take a serious look to see to what extent it is possible to reduce the tax burden of the country so as to encourage saving and industrial growth.</p>

<p>I come now to the problem of labour. As the hon. the Minister of Labour said last week, labour is one of the most difficult problems with which a government can be faced. I am afraid the Government which tells me that it has found an answer to the labour problem in its country, no matter what country it may be, is not telling the truth; because it is one of the most difficult issues any government has to deal with. In regard to our labour, it is necessary that we should examine it, because I have mentioned the figure before that in the past year, up to July last year, the number of labourers in non-agricultural industries increased by 5 per cent, but production by 4 per cent only, in spite of increasing mechanization. There was something wrong in that regard. That is not only for the Government to rectify. I think this should be examined by the Government on the one hand, but particularly by the private sector and by the managers and leaders in industry. The Government has established a productivity institute. That institute is making a study of various industries, and has found that there is a tremendous backlog in most industries as far as productivity is concerned, something which they themselves should rectify. We need not only supplement our labour all the time, but should make the best use of the labour we have. In most industries which have been investigated, it has been found that it is possible to increase productivity tremendously by means of the better utilization of the existing labour force. Before drawing in more and more labourers from outside, we should make better use of those we have. I want to give hon. members the assurance that the Government always listens with a sympathetic ear to the leaders in our production sector, in trade and industry, when they ask for labour. We indicated that in the White Paper issued last year. This gave us the impression that industry in general was satisfied with it and could continue expanding under it. We are always ready to hold discussions with them. There is a standing committee on labour constituted under the Ministry of Labour. We are always prepared to make fair concessions in that sphere, especially for those industries which cannot move away. The Railways have often been mentioned here, but it is a location-orientated industry. The Railways cannot be moved away; the Railways are at a certain place. What applies to the Railways, applies to all location-orientated industries. What the Railways can do, industries can do to a certain extent as well, and that is to come to an agreement with their trade unions about the reclassification of skilled work, so that less skilled work may be performed by semi-skilled workers. I think if members of the industrial world were to apply themselves a little more to the better utilization of the skills of their labour force, they would have less reason for complaints.</p>

<p>However, there are two things we shall not do. In the first place, we shall allow no uncontrolled influx of Bantu labour into the White areas. Secondly, we shall not allow the labour peace prevailing in our trade unions to be destroyed in any way, because it is particularly on this that the production capacity of South African industry depends. Thirdly, we shall proceed with our policy of decentralization, no matter what hon. members opposite say. The hon. member for Pinetown made a less kind remark here. Speaking of the wages in the decentralized areas, he said: &#x201C;The gutter is the limt&#x201D;. I know the hon. member very well. I think our personal relations are very good. But to say something like this in regard to the wages in the decentralized areas, namely &#x201C;The gutter is the limit&#x201D;, does not suit the hon. member. He himself has many border industrialists in his constituency. Now I want to ask the hon. member: Has he ever asked the industrialists in his area to pay the Bantu employed in their factories higher wages&#x003F; After all, they may pay higher wages; we do not forbid them to do so. The private sector may pay as much as it wants to; we do not forbid them. Has the hon. member asked his people in his constituency to pay the Bantu higher wages&#x003F; Apparently he has not. Therefore he has no right to say to us, &#x201C;The gutter is the limit&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Sir, I come to the final point, and that is Government expenditure. Hon. members launched many attacks on us concerning Government expenditure and said that it was too high. Hon. members should realize that there are certain essential services which must be rendered by the State. They are essential services which can be rendered only by the State. If one studies the infrastructure of our country, one finds that in the last Budget, more than 50 per <span class="col_1491-1492" refersTo="page_0763"/>cent of our Government expenditure was devoted to the infrastructure. This is what must be done. We must expand our roads, our hospitals, our harbours, our railways, our postal services, etc., otherwise hon. members would complain that those services were not available. In this regard, Sir, may I mention a figure to hon. members which comes from the well-known publication <i>International Financial Statistics</i>&#x003F; According to that publication, consumer spending by the Government in South Africa, expressed as a percentage, is the lowest in the whole world. And now we are not comparing us to fifth-rate nations, but to the best in the world. If we compare our consumer spending in South Africa to that of the rest of the world, we find that ours is 11 per cent of our total Gross Domestic Product, while that of other countries is as high as 17 per cent, 18 per cent and more. Ours is the lowest of the comparable countries in the world.</p>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>In clause 1 I just want to make a correction. In the discussion during the Second Reading the hon. member for South Coast asked if these are loans to farmers who wanted to plant forests, of <span class="col_1493-1494" refersTo="page_0764"/>the same kind as agricultural credit allocations to category 3 farmers, and whether they also qualify. After discussions with the hon. the Minister of Forestry I find that the reply given to the hon. member for South Coast&#x2019;s question was not completely correct. The aim of the Minister of Forestry is to initiate and encourage private afforestation. The means test will still apply; a means test will be applied, but not on the basis for agricultural credit farmers who are in financial difficulties. Each case will be considered on its merits by the Minister of Forestry and the recommendation will be made to the House for the granting of loans, provided funds are available. The aim is to encourage private afforestation.</p>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>In connection with this clause I just want to express a few thoughts. Afforestation and the planting of trees has now become a necessity in this country, and it is one industry that can be practised profitably on a part-time basis. It requires capital, and at present there are newcomers in the field doing this on a part-time basis. Since afforestation extends into future generations, and a large amount of capital is invested in it, I want to make a friendly recommendation to the Minister about whether the set-up cannot also be extended to grant assistance not only to the full-time farmer, but also to the part-time farmer who enters this field in all good faith and invests a large amount of capital. There is a parallel in respect of wattle-bark, where the loan on the subsidy paid through the agency of the Land Bank, is made available to all growers. Therefore I also want to make that request in this case.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>I want to state beyond all doubt that we must not get the idea here that any man, the Mitchells, the Streichers, the Graaffs and the Koekemoers, who are prosperous and rich people, may now consider themselves able to obtain loans from Agricultural Credit for the purposes of afforestation. We do want to stimulate afforestation, but I do not want to let the idea take root here that a person can plant forests to his heart&#x2019;s content and that he will obtain loans at 5 per cent. We would then be misleading the people. The Minister of Forestry will consider each case on its merits. To the hon. member for Ermelo I can say that he should actually bring this matter to the attention of the Minister of Forestry. He mentions a person who is not exclusively a forester, but is a prosperous owner of flats who has investments of half a million rand&#x2014;I then ask myself the question and I do not believe it to be our task to finance that man at Agricultural Credit. But if a person is perhaps a maize farmer, or he has a small shop, and the Department of Forestry says it has delved into all the aspects, the man can qualify and we can help him in order to stimulate afforestation, then this can be done. This is a question one cannot answer &#x201C;yes&#x201D; or &#x201C;no&#x201D; to. Every case must be treated on its merits.</p>

<p>Clause put and agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 3:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>This clause, which makes possible and facilitates the establishment of waterworks, is so important to my constituency, in fact to the entire South-Western Districts, that I should like to dwell on that for a few moments. In this belt we have mixed farming. On the one hand one has stock farming and then one also has grain farming. Normally the two go together very nicely. We had a very good grain harvest last year, for which we are very grateful. But the previous three years things went very badly for the farmers in that region. There were three crop failures that accumulated very great losses, and at those times it was very important for one to have had help in the form of one&#x2019;s stock farming. And the general comment amongst the farmers was that if one did not have one&#x2019;s livestock one would have gone under. When one comes to stock farming the provision of water is probably the most important element of the entire set-up, because without a good supply of water one <span class="col_1495-1496" refersTo="page_0765"/>cannot farm with livestock. This clause is specifically so important since it now helps one with the provision of water. There one normally has recourse to boreholes, but these are frequently very briny, so much so that one sometimes catches codfish in them. At other times one bores 10 or 12 holes, as the Department of Water Affairs has already found, without obtaining water. Where the soil is hydrous one can build dams, but the summer rainfalls are at times uncertain. The Department of Water Affairs plans to lay a pipeline for our farmers from the irrigation dams in the mountains, so that they can obtain water from those dams. But a great deal of planning and research must still be done before this becomes possible. This clause has now made it possible for a number of farmers to get together&#x2014;10, 12 or 15 of them&#x2014; for the establishment of their own water scheme. Without the subsidy being given to them in temrs of this clause such a move would never have been possible. What they now do is, firstly, to look for a suitable point in one of the rivers that flows past the area. Then they can abstract the water from the river with a good pump, and a plastic pipeline can then serve fresh water to 10 or 12 farms from the river; something they could not have obtained previously. You will find the farmer&#x2019;s livestock in a much better condition, because with fresh water such an animal&#x2019;s condition easily improves by 10 per cent to 15 per cent. On the other hand a farmer can graze a great many more head of cattle&#x2014;perhaps half as many and sometimes even twice as many. He also has the advantage&#x2014;and this is very important&#x2014;that he can make a garden for himself around his house, lay out lawns, plant flowers and beautify his farm. Thus he can make life pleasant for himself as a farmer. In this clause special mention is made of category 3 farmers who will benefit markedly from this measure. On their own they cannot establish such schemes. The subsidy here being given to them now makes it possible for them to participate in those schemes, to be that much better farmers and to have that much better incomes. With the establishment of the water schemes problems do crop up, and I should like to bring these to the hon. the Minister and his department&#x2019;s attention. If about 10 or 12 farmers get together to establish such a scheme for themselves, a scheme that is subsidized and that could not be constructed without the subsidy, there are usually only one or two of the farmers adjacent to the river who have water rights from the river and who can pump when they want to and as much as they want to. The other 10, 12 or 15 who lie further away, who do not border on the river and do not have water rights, now find a problem developing. If such a farmer is a poor man, he can end up in a lot of trouble. They now have to apply to the Supreme Court for water rights from the river, rights which the farms normally do not have. If they go to the Supreme Court there is quite a lot of work and quite heavy costs involved. A deputation must go along and the application must be made through an advocate. He must make the application before the judge and then the judge gives his decision according to the circumstances. Those costs, which are frequently quite extensive, make it altogether impossible for the less well-to-do farmer to participate in this scheme. It would be too expensive for him, as the hon. member has said. All the water rights of the farmers who have such rights below the abstraction point will be affected by such abstraction. Hon. members probably know that one could rather interfere with a farmer&#x2019;s wife and children than his water rights. The moment you touch his water rights, even though you never use them, he immediately rebels. These people must also be taken into consideration. This whole scheme will make matters so much better for the farmer who is situated some distance from the river. They in particular need this water so badly and they are the ones who would like to use it. These exceptionally heavy costs, legal and judicial costs and the costs involved in the registration of their deeds of transfer, make the costs of the scheme so steep that it will be beyond the reach of many farmers. I want to ask the department to give attention to this matter. They must see whether in future we cannot obtain a recipe, a formula whereby we can find an easier way for these farmers than is now the case with the marked costs involved. To satisfy the farmers below that abstraction point, one may perhaps broach with the Department of Water Affairs the possibility of compelling irrigation dams higher up in the river to allow a certain amount of water to flow through, a quantity equal to that abstracted by this scheme. This would quite possibly satisfy the farmers who are situated lower down on the river and have water rights but do not want to relinquish them, in that they will not offer any opposition to the schemes being <span class="col_1497-1498" refersTo="page_0766"/>planned there. I should like to bring this point to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention and the attention of his department. I want to suggest that in future we give proper attention to that. Let us accommodate the category 3 farmer in particular.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Mossel Bay referred to a matter that we want to give attention to. Actually the Department of Water Affairs will have to be closely involved in this. The hon. member referred to a public stream that is declared a State-controlled scheme where each person is a registered owner of the water right in that stream. That would make him a riparian owner. It does happen that farmers who are not riparian owners also want water from this public stream. The Department of Water Affairs is then faced with the problem that if it gives such a farmer abstraction rights, another farmer could perhaps be prejudiced in the process. Where is one going to draw the line&#x003F; Later one could receive requests for abstraction rights from farmers living 20 miles from the stream. That is why I say that it is not necessary for a farmer to take a lot of legal advice on this matter. The Water Act is very clear about this. As I said, every case will have to be considered on merit. We should like to help such people, but then this must be within reasonable limits. It cannot be expected that a person living five miles from a stream should be able to claim abstraction rights. We are specifically faced with the problem of too little water in this country. The hon. member is right; there are cases where one has a few category 3 farmers and a few prosperous farmers that are drawn together in one irrigation scheme. Cases such as this are very sympathetically considered by the Department of Water Affairs. If they have a practical canal system or abstraction system, if it justifies its existence, if their request has foundation, the farmers will obtain a loan from the Department of Water Affairs for the establishment of such a scheme. We shall investigate the hon. member for Mossel Bay&#x2019;s requests.</p>

<summary>(Committee Stage)</summary>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we are dealing here with an amendment which provides that the hon. the Minister of Agriculture shall designate from time to time an officer in the Public Service to be the Chairman of the Land Tenure Board. As was pointed out during the Second Reading debate on this Bill, the Land Tenure Board is a board vested with tremendous power and tremendous responsibilities. As this amendment is phrased by the hon. the Minister, he is now asking this Committee to give him the power to designate any officer in the employ of the State. If we have a look at the Public Service Act, we find that this includes officers in the employ of the Provincial Administrations as well, and, of course, in the employ of the Administration of South-West Africa. We on this side of the House feel that this is a good move. Because of what has happened in the past&#x2014;I refer particularly to the so-called Agliotti scandal&#x2014;it is only right that the Minister should have direct access to the Chairman of the Land Tenure Board and that this should not be a person acting independently on his own, but that he should be somebody under the direct control of the Minister. Therefore we on this side of the House support the principle that the Chairman of this Board should no longer be the Chairman of the Agricultural Credit Board, but should be a civil servant appointed by the hon. the Minister. With one proviso: We feel that the person so designated by the Minister should be a senior civil servant. As the Bill reads, the hon. the Minister could designate anybody. <span class="col_1499-1500" refersTo="page_0767"/>I know that someone is going to say that that is unreasonable and ridiculous, because he is not going to appoint the person who pours the tea. However, the unfortunate experience which we have just had, is still fresh in the minds of the people of South Africa. I think that, if the hon. the Minister were to accept the amendment which is being suggested by this side of the House, this would go a long way towards allaying any suspicions which may linger, or still do linger, in the minds of the public outside, because we are here handing over tremendous powers to one person. It is for this reason that I move the amendment as printed&#x2014;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>I have gone out of my way to have the Bill modified the way the hon. member asked for it to be modified, but the legal advisers tell us that there is no definition of a &#x201C;Senior official&#x201D;, not even in the Public Service Act. I have asked them to help me since we intend appointing a senior man. They told me we would then experience all kinds of problems as far as definitions were concerned. Previously an &#x201C;under-secretary&#x201D;, for example, was a senior man. That has been changed. The concept of &#x201C;senior officer&#x201D; has been changed to &#x201C;deputy secretary&#x201D;. When a senior man is instructed to perform a specific task he has, at that moment, powers up to a certain point. If the amount he deals with is exceeded he has to consult the Minister. This we have done on account of our experience in the past. But then again he has to have the power to send another man to view a piece of land and to determine whether there is a canal for example, before we buy such land. Is it necessary for a senior man to be sent on a trip of a thousand miles to ascertain that&#x003F; Officers of lower rank should be able to carry out tasks such as those. When a title deed has to be registered, for example, a more junior officer will be given that job. As I said during the Second Reading, when speaking of a senior man, we mean and have in mind an officer who is an expert in his field. I may tell the hon. member that I should like to insert the word &#x201C;senior&#x201D;, but the legal advisers tell us that it is not practicable. We simply cannot do it. For that reason I ask the hon. member to be satisfied and to withdraw this amendment. I should have liked to insert it myself. The relevant person may even be given a more important sounding designation than &#x201C;senior man&#x201D;, because that person will really be a top man. We simply do not have the power to include it in the Bill, and this applies to all legislation we deal with.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>On account of the explanation furnished by the hon. the Minister and the feeling he has expressed here, namely that he is desirous of appointing a senior man in this position, we on this side of the House are prepared to accept it. If this is not complied with in future when the appointment is made, we will simply expect to be able to take the hon. the Deputy Minister at his word as given to this House today. That is the spirit in which we approach this matter. We should like to see that the officer designated as chairman of the Land Tenure Board will, in fact, be the expert referred to by the Deputy Minister. Under those circumstances I believe that the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District, because he also accepts the viewpoint of the Deputy Minister as I do, will be inclined to withdraw his amendment</p>

<p>This is another point where I do feel that we need a little bit of reassurance from the hon. the Deputy Minister. [Interjections.] If that hon. Whip knew a little bit of what was going on and if he were able to read the Bill he might not keep on with that inane interjection all the time. We are dealing with a serious matter here, unless that hon. Whip does not consider R5 million of public money as being serious. Because he cannot read a balance sheet, he perhaps does not know what R5 million means. It is public money and that is what we are dealing <span class="col_1501-1502" refersTo="page_0768"/>with now. I feel that the public outside do require this reassurance from the hon. the Deputy Minister. He has given it, except for this one point. While we are dealing with this question of the board I wonder whether he cannot at this stage show us what is going to happen. The Minister will be allowed to delegate to some officer of the State the power to appoint another officer of the State as chairman of this board. Is this really what he intends to do and to whom is it his intention to delegate that power&#x003F; With the approval of the Committee I withdraw my amendment, having received this assurance from the Deputy Minister, but I would like to have an assurance from him on this second point as well.</p>

<p>Clause, as printed, put and agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 2:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, here we are dealing with the crux of this Bill and with the crux of the whole application of the principle of this Land Tenure Act. How does this clause intend to amend section 9 of the Act&#x003F; We find that the Minister may not delegate certain powers, and I think that I should detail what these powers are for the benefit of the Committee. He may not delegate the power to appoint members of the board, except the chairman of the board. That power he may delegate. He may not delegate the power to determine the period of appointment of the members of the board. He may not delegate the power to terminate the period of office of the members of the board. He may not delegate the power to determine the allowances, the remuneration, leave conditions and other conditions of employment of the members of the board. He may also not delegate the power to make regulations. When we put against these powers which he may not delegate, those powers which he may delegate, we find a completely different story. The powers which he is allowed to delegate, which he may hand over to some officer of the State, include firstly, as I pointed out just now, the power to designate a civil servant to be the chairman of the board. In terms of section 4 of the Act, he may also delegate the power to purchase, from moneys allocated by this House, land suitable for farming purposes. He may also delegate the power to exchange State land for any other land. This involves millions of rands of public money allocated by this House. In addition to that, in terms of subsection (2) of section 4 of the Act, the Minister may delegate to a civil servant the power to expropriate for farming purposes land or rights in or over land in a water-controlled area. In terms of section 5 the Minister has to decide whether State land is or is not suitable or is required or not required for farming purposes, and whether it should be disposed of. He may delegate this power to a civil servant. In terms of section 6 of the Act, the Minister may develop any State land for or for use in connection with farming. So the decision is his; but he may delegate the power to make that decision to a civil servant.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>My hon. friend from South Coast has seen the point. Surely, it appears that the whole matter is back to front. The important issues, the expenditure of millions of rands of public money, the appointment of the chairman of the board, the disposition and development of State land, all these powers may be handed over by the Minister to any civil servant. But the unimportant powers, such as determining the terms and conditions of employment of a member of the board, may not be delegated by him. It appears that this matter is back to front. Accepting the responsibility which is being handed over, and that it should only be handed over to a responsible person, once again I move the amendment which stands in my name on the Order Paper, an amendment to the effect that these important powers may only be delegated to a senior officer of the State. I know the hon. the Deputy Minister is going to come with the same story that it is impossible to define, but I want to say to him that it is surely not beyond the wit of his department and of the legal advisers to find some way of protecting the public in this matter.</p>

<from><span class="col_1503-1504" refersTo="page_0769"/>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>I can see the problem of the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District on account of the explanation he has furnished us. However, he must bear in mind that it makes no difference whether it is a senior or a junior official. It is a very small amount in respect of which a limit is being laid down, and the Minister has to decide whether any land which is more expensive should be purchased. How is one going to appoint another chairman in case the chairman falls ill&#x003F; How is that meeting going to function without a chairman&#x003F; The intention in that case is to designate a deputy to act as chairman.</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>By whom is he going to be designated&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>He will be designated by the fully authorized Secretary or other senior officials of the department. This is simply how it works in practice, but I say again that I can see the problem the hon. member has. I may just tell him that it will be a senior man. We have given all aspects of this matter our careful consideration to see how it is going to work in practice. Section 9 of the principal Act provides for the delegation of all the powers the Minister has in terms of that Act, except those in respect of section 2, i.e. the appointment of the members of the board other than the chairman, and those in respect of section 8, i.e. the making of regulations. The amendment proposed in clause 2 therefore only deals with the power the Minister has in terms of the new section, i.e. to designate an official of the State to act as chairman. The hon. member may now elaborate on the matter further and foresee certain complications. If somebody wants to &#x201C;swindle&#x201D; (verneuk) you, he wants to do so. That is the important point. You have to plug the loopholes now. To our way of thinking I believe the best solution will be to appoint a senior man, a reliable man&#x2014; that does not mean that there have been any unreliable ones in the past, that is not what I should like to insinuate&#x2014;who has a sense of responsibility, one who will appreciate that certain cases will have to be referred to the Minister for his decision before those matters are taken any further. We are all just as concerned about the matter as the hon. member is.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as I have said, I am aware of the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s problems in this regard, but he has just said something which perturbs me even more. Is it his intention that there is going to be more than one official of the State who is going to be designated, at different times, to be chairman of this particular board&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, there is a deputy chairman; that is fine. Provision has been made in the Act for a deputy chairman who will act in place of the chairman when he is ill, but I believe that the Deputy Minister went a little further than that when he spoke about appointing people at different times, and that this power must be delegated to the Secretary because the Minister may not always be available. Frankly, I do not see the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s point. There is one other point in regard to which I should like clarity from the Deputy Minister. He says that an amount has now been fixed, above which all matters must be referred to the Minister, and that the Minister must personally take responsibility for them; he must make the decision. Is that correct&#x003F; He does not lose his responsibility by delegating his power anyway.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Deputy Minister said that he <span class="col_1505-1506" refersTo="page_0770"/>understood the difficulty of the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District. My hon. friend does not have any difficulties; the difficulty lies with the Deputy Minister. I think the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District made out a very good case when he showed that the really important matters are those in respect of which the Minister may delegate. When it comes to matters of lesser importance, the Minister may not delegate his powers. Sir, what is the position of the Deputy Minister&#x003F; We on this side of the House have been seeking an opportunity for a long time to raise this matter, and I think this may be the proper opportunity to do so. We talk here about the delegating of authority to a &#x201C;senior&#x201D; official. This amendment was moved by my hon. friend so as to have a discussion on this point. We know that the legal advisers find it difficult to find a definition for a &#x201C;senior official&#x201D;. We accept that, but that is not the point. The point is that we wanted to use this opportunity to get the assurance from the Deputy Minister which we have now had. As far as we here in Parliament are concerned, is the Deputy Minister the Minister for the purposes of this Bill&#x003F; If he is not, can we include a provision in the Bill that the Minister may delegate his authority to the Deputy Minister&#x003F; If we can do so, we shall be happy. The Deputy Minister is not a senior official, but we shall be happy if the powers are delegated to him, because we shall then have someone here in the House who is answerable for those administrative decisions taken by the Minister. He can delegate his authority to somebody else because he may be busy, with whatever he may be busy with, and he may want somebody else on the job.</p>

<p>I have heard that the Deputy Ministers are, shall we say, jacks of all trades. They are the people who rush around and keep the wheels turning in the departments. Let the Minister now delegate his authority to the Deputy Minister. Then we shall be happy, because we shall then have the opportunity, here in Parliament, when voting moneys, or when dealing with legislation, as we are now, where we can say to the Deputy Minister: &#x201C;There sits the Minister. He has delegated his authority to you, and what do you have to say about this particular matter which has now arisen&#x003F;&#x201D;</p>

<p>But if the Minister and the Deputy Minister for the purpose of our legislation are one and the same person, then what exactly is the position of Deputy Ministers&#x003F; There are numbers of them. What precisely is their function so far as the statutes are concerned&#x003F; We have rules which deal with the right of a Deputy Minister to pilot a measure through the House in place of the Minister. Here we have a case in point today. The Deputy Minister is handling this particular measure; that is in terms of the rules and we have no objection to that. We understand it, because it is before us but, Sir, when it comes to legislation what is the legal position of the Deputy Minister&#x003F; I do not remember any legislation in which the Deputy Minister appears. I know the rules where he appears, but I cannot think of any legislation where a Deputy Minister appears.</p>

<p>As this point has occurred from time to time in discussions, this may be the simple, straightforward opportunity for us to say to the Deputy Minister: &#x201C;Let this Bill stand over. Go to the Minister and ask him to take the power in that particular clause to delegate his authority to the Deputy Minister,&#x201D; and then we will be completely satisfied. Sir, I want to put it to the hon. the Deputy Minister that he should ask leave for this to stand over and that he should go back and discuss this matter with the Minister and point out the difficult position in which he finds himself &#x2014;not the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District. Sir, this is a straightforward debate and the Deputy Minister will accept our <i>bona fides</i> as we are accepting his. Let him go back to the Minister and say: &#x201C;Here are these important matters and it is felt in very reliable and responsible quarters that these matters are of such importance that the delegation should be to the Deputy Minister,&#x201D; and then the Deputy Minister can come back again to this House; there will be no waste of time, and we will then know that the Deputy Minister is the person to whom the Minister can delegate his authority. That, in terms of parliamentary procedure, stems to me to be right and we will be perfectly happy with it.</p>

<p>At the moment the Minister has the power to delegate certain of his powers to the Deputy Minister. If he wants to delegate his powers to buy land, he can delegate his powers to me. It is not necessary to provide for it in the Bill. We are arguing this question as to what is meant <span class="col_1507-1508" refersTo="page_0771"/>by &#x201C;senior official&#x201D;. Sir, I agree with the hon. member for South Coast that this is not a political issue. We are working with the money of the taxpayers, and the taxpayers are not divided into Nationalists or United Party supporters; all the people in South Africa are paying taxes, and that is why I want co-operation, and I am getting it. But I say that it is no use arguing about the powers of the Deputy Minister at this stage. I can ask the Minister to delegate his powers to me, and I think he will be prepared to do so.</p>

<summary>(Second Reading resumed)</summary>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>When the debate was interrupted I was dealing with the most important objection we on this side of the House have to the Bill. I added that this legislation has only been on the Statute Book for one year and it is already clear to some of us that the legislation is not welcomed by the agricultural land owners. Now as a result of the amendments the hon. the Minister is moving, the original Act is being made even more drastic. I refer particularly to clause 3 and to the powers the Minister is now going to obtain. According to our view of this clause it will mean that no farmer will be able to lease his farm unless he obtains the approval of the hon. the Minister. I believe this to mean that the hon. the Minister will be able to interfere with a farmer&#x2019;s reasonable earnings from his land. Not only could circumstances be such <span class="col_1509-1510" refersTo="page_0772"/>that a farmer is compelled to lease such land from a financial point of view, but there may be no heir and he may then decide to lease portions of that land.</p>

<p>As we read this clause it means that the hon. the Minister will have the power to refuse a man permission to subdivide his land and lease certain parts of it. Of course this clause also goes much further, because it is going to interfere with one&#x2019;s local authorities that may need certain agricultural land for the development of urban areas. With these powers he is obtaining here, the hon. the Minister can now prevent such a thing from taking place. Neither is it impossible for a farmer to discover a deposit of precious or base metals on his land. One could now ask whether the hon. the Minister could then prevent the leasing of a portion of that farm if in his discretion he thinks that land should rather be used for agricultural purposes. In terms of this legislation the Minister can also go a step further. He can now lay down conditions for the use of such land. The Minister could determine that because land cannot be used for agricultural purposes, that land must not be leased. We want the Minister to give us the answers to these question. According to his own circumscribed discretion he can restrict any further development if it is not agricultural development. We now want to know: Were all these relevant amendments the Minister is moving discussed with the S.A. Agricultural Union&#x003F;</p>

<p>And what is more, were they discussed with the provincial authorities&#x003F; Were they discussed with the Association of Municipalities and with their executive committee, those people charged with the laying out of towns and with local administration. We should like an assurance as to whether the hon. the Minister or his department was in touch with these people, particularly with a view to the amendment in clause 3. These days great delays are already being experienced in the planning of new residential areas. It is my considered opinion that as a result of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s amendment in clause 3, the delay in the planning of townships that may be situated on agricultural land will become even greater. As we see it, the object of this amendment is to get an even tighter hold of the agricultural land owner. No person will in reality become the owner of his land. We believe that this type of amendment the hon. the Minister is now coming forward with is the worst form of socialism.</p>

<p>There are many farmers living from hand to mouth. Any opportunity they may have had of making a living from their property on anything but an agricultural basis can now be denied them by this hon. Minister. The powers the Minister obtains in this legislation could entail a decrease in the value of the farmer&#x2019;s property. Not only does the hon. the Minister control the subdivision of agricultural land, but he also becomes the one to determine agricultural land values. This is one of the foremost reasons why this amendment ought not to be passed. Everything will depend on the kindness of that hon. Minister, his successor or colleague. When a Minister becomes an autocrat there never will be any certainty of policy either. His views will apply for all circumstances. Nowhere need there be a specific set of rules. Not only does he place himself in an uncomfortable position as Minister, but he places the land owner in an unenviable position of doubt. This could all lead to a greater lack of confidence in the agricultural industry in this country.</p>

<p>Therefore we do not think the hon. the Minister has done the agricultural industry any favours with this amendment Bill. I want to come back to the point I made when the debate adjourned last time. A brand new clause is now being included here, a clause that was not initially foreseen. With the amendment the hon. gentleman will now also have authority over the use of the land. I refer particularly to clause 4, and to the penultimate clause that completely changes the long title of the Act. A year or two ago we thought the Minister only wanted authority over the question of the subdivision of agricultural land. Why is it now necessary for the Minister also to have the power to interfere in the use of agricultural land&#x003F; We want the hon. the Minister to explain this to us. I heard his Second Reading speech very clearly and subsequently also read it very carefully. The hon. the Minister did not give an explanation. This is an altogether new principle. What is the motive of the Government and the Minister in wanting control over the purposes for which agricultural land can be used. Say, for example, I have <span class="col_1511-1512" refersTo="page_0773"/>a piece of land on which I want to erect a brickworks. Say it is good agricultural land. Or say I want to form a company to start such a brickworks because there is excellent gravel under the topsoil. When I have such an asset, which the Minister thinks is good agricultural land, but which I, for altogether different reasons, consider to be good soil for brickmaking, is it the intention that the hon. the Minister may say that I cannot fence off that land into say four, five or ten morgen divisions and start an industry for myself there&#x003F; If it is the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s intention to act even in such a case, I want to tell him that he is taking this Bill on the subdivision of agricultural land altogether too far. For example, say I have a piece of land near the city and I want to float a company and start a chicken farm there. In reality such a thing would be a form of industrialism. But because there are good fruit trees and vines on the land, that hon. Minister can tell me that he thinks I am acting incorrectly and that it is not in the interests of the agricultural industry that I do this. The Minister then says that I may not use it for that purpose. According to the provisions of clauses 3 and 4 we feel that these are powers the Minister could exercise in the course of time. We therefore believe that the Minister must not come forward with this amendment. In the circumstances, I therefore move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, on a previous occasion the hon. member for Newton Park said that the farmer has very sound judgment. I agree with him, and that is also the reason why the Opposition has been sitting in those benches for 24 years. We could have expected the hon. member for Newton Park and the Opposition not to vote for this legislation. They were, indeed, opposed to the original Bill. Now that the hon. the Minister comes along to plug the loopholes in that Act, we can expect them to try to keep those loopholes open. But those loopholes are actually what the hon. members&#x2019; friends, the speculators, use for making money. Anyone who has a love for South Africa&#x2019;s soil and who sees what is happening in the large cities and towns as far as the subdivision of land is concerned, will vote for this legislation. Because the Opposition&#x2019;s strength lies not in the rural areas, but in the cities, they would like to accommodate the speculators in the cities and give them satisfaction. It costs the State a tremendous amount of money to try to consolidate land that has already been cut up into uneconomic units. The State also goes out of its way to help the farmer, who has a small piece of land and wants an additional small piece, to consolidate. What is the use of the State incurring expenses in consolidating land while, on the other hand, it allows that land to be cut up much more rapidly&#x003F; Eventually it would cost the State much more to effect this. The cutting up of land around the large cities and towns is only a way of polluting the land, the water and everything in those surroundings. Hon. members read in the newspapers that there are people living on the Vaal River who had to demolish their houses because the land had been cut up so injudiciously.</p>

<p>Yes, but it does not only happen there, it happens at many other places in the country. This is detrimental to the country and it costs the State a tremendous amount of money to rehabilitate those areas. If there is no legislation to prevent this continuing, what would be the use of correcting it at one spot while it is polluted to a worse degree at two other spots&#x003F; The hon. member spoke of so-called uneconomic subdivision. The hon. member expects a rule to be laid down defining so many hundred or so many thousand morgen of <span class="col_1513-1514" refersTo="page_0774"/>land as an economic unit. It is in that connection that he spoke of &#x201C;so-called uneconomic subdivision&#x201D;. The hon. member is surely aware that at a place like De Dooms eight to ten morgen of land planted with vineyards can form an economic unit. In the sheep areas 5 000 morgen is sometimes not an economic unit. Each case will have to be treated on its own merits when it comes to the determination of economic units. Then the hon. member also comes along here and makes the ridiculous statement that the Minister will now tell the farmers what they may farm with on their own farms. The long title of the principal Act read as follows: To control the subdivision of agricultural land. Now clause 9 of the Bill inserts the following: To control the subdivision and, in connection therewith, the use of agricultural land. Only when agricultural land is subdivided will the Minister have any say. As far as the man who does not subdivide his farm is concerned, the Minister has no say about what he may do on his farm and what he may not do. As I read the legislation, the Minister&#x2019;s authority when land is subdivided is specifically aimed at cases involving cities where there is good agricultural land and other land that is suitable for the development of residential areas. The hon. member asks whether they should hang in the air. When they want to subdivide land and make it available for those purposes, the Minister may say that the land, except perhaps for the ridges, is very suitable for housing and that it is therefore not necessary to use good agricultural land for that purpose. I shall tell the House why they also want that good agricultural land to be available for housing. The reason is that speculators who purchase that agricultural land would be able to develop it more cheaply than if there were ridges on that land. That is why the hon. member is so fond of advocating that it should also be possible to use agricultural land for that purpose.</p>

Would the hon. member then like to see that 1 000 morgen with vineyards destroyed, while there are 1 000 morgen with Port Jackson trees available that can be utilized as well, if not better, for housing purposes&#x003F; No, the Opposition has altogether lost touch with the farmers. If that is the attitude they are going to adopt in respect of legislation of this nature, they will drift even further away from the farmers. The hon. members who should be lodging pleas here on behalf of the farmers have not been able to win any more rural seats as it is. They had to move to the cities.

<p>Mr. Speaker, when one is dealing with legislation of this sort, it is necessary to be quite clear as to what we are talking about, particularly after listening to a speech such as we have heard from the hon. member for Ladybrand. After listening to a speech like that, one has the impression that that side of the House is intent on exercising control over everything that a man can do or cannot do with his land. Is that what the hon. member for Ladybrand is pleading for&#x003F; This is the way in which he has put his case. If that is what they want, then they must tell the House quite clearly and they must tell the voters quite clearly that that is what they want. I am sure that if they did so, they would not have the support from their own people. It is all very well for the hon. member for Ladybrand to speak as he does, but if his farm is situated next to a city or to some development and he can sell his farm at a very good price, will he tell this House that he will refuse that good price simply because he has a good farm&#x003F; Will he tell this House that he will not subdivide his farm in any way and get a good price for part of it because that part of his farm is good agricultural land&#x003F; No, Mr. Speaker, these people talk with two voices. They make very fine general statements, but when it comes to practice, when it comes to their own properties, they are quite prepared to sell for the best price they can get. In fact, they run to the Minister and squeal if he prevents them from selling. I think the fact that we have before this House this amending Bill proves that we were right when the original legislation was introduced <span class="col_1515-1516" refersTo="page_0775"/>in 1970, when we said that this was not the way to deal with the problem which the hon. the Deputy Minister told us then he wanted to deal with, namely the uneconomic subdivision of good agricultural land. We have told him so at the time. He now comes with amending legislation. The curious thing about this matter is that it does not seem as if the hon. the Deputy Minister has studied his Bill very well. In introducing this legislation, he told the House that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The object of the Bill &#x2026; is, in the main, the removal of a few administrative problems which have arisen since the coming into operation of the Subdivision of Agricultural Land Act.</block>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister seems to overlook that this legislation introduces two entirely new principles, both of which are of considerable importance. One of these principles has been dealt with at considerable length by the hon. member for Newton Park, namely that the amendments introduced by this Bill now make it possible for the hon. the Minister, in granting permission to subdivide agricultural land, to define the use to which those subdivisions may be put. This is an entirely new principle. I submit to this House that it is a very important principle. It enables the hon. the Minister to direct how land, which is subdivided, shall be used. In other words, the owner who wishes to subdivide part of his land, and the person who wishes to acquire that subdivided portion are not free to decide to what agricultural use they shall put that subdivided land, but the hon. the Minister will now tell them to what use they must put the subdivision. We on this side of the House do not see any justification for this. The hon. the Deputy Minister shakes his head, but what I have said is perfectly correct. Clause 4, as was pointed out by the hon. member for Newton Park, quite clearly gives the power to the hon. the Minister, if he grants an application, to include &#x201C;conditions as to the purpose for which or the manner in which the land in question may be used&#x201D;. In other words, the purpose for which the subdivision may be used.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>I am not missing the point at all. The hon. the Deputy Minister is trying to mislead the House by asking ridiculous questions. When this Bill was originally introduced into this House in 1970, we told the hon. the Deputy Minister that, if he were really concerned about the use to which agricultural land was being put and the way in which it was being subdivided, he was going about it the wrong way. No less a person than one of the senior State officials of this Government has virtually accepted that the proper way to deal with the situation is the way in which we have suggested, namely to prepare for the whole of South Africa proper regional guide plans showing the use to which the land within that region may be put and to break down that regional plan into area plans dealing with the expansion of cities. This recommendation of the Niemand Commission has been accepted by the Government and it is being put into effect. The hon. the Deputy Minister himself referred to these guide plan committees in introducing the Second Reading of this Bill. If the Government accepts that this is the proper way to go about things, why does the hon. the Deputy Minister then persist with this legislation&#x003F; If he tells me that they must have powers until such time as these guide plans are put into effect, there may be something to be said for that. But then we would be arguing the matter on an entirely different basis. I would then still say to the hon. the Deputy Minister that the way he is trying to deal with this problem is not the correct way. He is going to have to come to this House with more amendments if he persists and if the guide plans are not prepared speedily.</p>

<p>The other objection we have to this legislation&#x2014;I am now dealing with broad principles before I deal with the clauses in detail&#x2014;is that the Minister is not the proper <span class="col_1517-1518" refersTo="page_0776"/>person to deal with this problem. He cannot deal with the different situations which exist in different parts of the country. The provincial authorities have handled this matter very well in the past.

<p>I abide by your ruling, Sir. These bodies have been responsible for the proper co-ordinated development of the provinces. They are the best bodies to handle this. If the hon. the Deputy Minister will not accept my statement, perhaps he will give proper attention to what one of his own M.P.C.s in the Cape Province said. I am now referring to Mr. Conradie. I do not wish to quote at length from the speech, but I would urge the hon. the Deputy Minister to read it very carefully. It deals with all the problems we have heard about in this debate, and deals with them far more intelligently than we have had from members such as the hon. member for Ladybrand. I am referring to the speech delivered by Mr. Conradie to the Sentrale Karoo-Ontwikkelingsvereniging on the occasion of its 23rd annual congress. This speech was made on the 2nd October, 1969. The hon. the Deputy Minister nods his head; no doubt he knows about it. If he knows about it, then he will also know that one of the points stressed by Mr. Conradie was the fact that the provincial authorities should be permitted to deal with the co-ordinated development of land in their own provinces. The hon. the Deputy Minister will not deny that they are also in a position to protect agricultural land properly. He will not suggest that they are going to allow good agricultural land to be used, for example, for township development when other land is available. The hon. the Deputy Minister knows that, with the expanding population that we have and are going to have in the years ahead, local authority areas must inevitably expand so that more housing can be provided for the population. Whether it is for the Coloureds, for the Indians or for the Bantu, more land will have to be given over to housing in the future. An often quoted figure in this House is that within the next 30 years we are going to have to build as many houses in this country as have been built in the last 300 years. One can only do this by giving over more land to housing than is available today. So inevitably some agricultural land will have to be acquired to extend the local authority areas, so that more housing can be provided.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>I am pleased to hear that, because judging by some of the speeches we heard when this Bill was before us in 1970, you would think that every piece of agricultural land was to be made sacrosanct from now on. I am very pleased that we have had this admission because at least there is some realism entering into the debate now. If we accept that local authority areas are going to have to expand and agricultural land or land which is today being used for agriculture, must tomorrow be given over for townships development, the real problem is how this should be properly tackled. Until such time as there is a regional plan to indicate the direction of expansion in which the local authorities may go without damaging good agricultural land which cannot be replaced elsewhere, we are running around in the dark.</p>

<p>Having dealt with the question of a regional plan and of breaking that plan into area plans, I come back to the point I made earlier. The local authority must then handle the position, not the Deputy Minister because the Deputy Minister does not look at the position from the broad point of view. We cannot look at the future expansion of a province or of South Africa purely from the point of view of the future <span class="col_1519-1520" refersTo="page_0777"/>of agriculture. This whole matter is interrelated. One must obviously have regard to the future of agriculture, but one must also have regard to the future of industry and of the towns. The hon. the Deputy Minister knows that more and more of the farmers are coming off the land and going to the cities.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>He in fact encourages it, I am told. Until such time as the Government stops looking at the problem piecemeal and without relating it to the whole, we are never going to have a satisfactory development plan for the various parts of South Africa, a proper development plan within each province. I think that is all I want to say in regard to general remarks.</p>

<p>Now I want to come to the specific clauses. I said earlier on that I wondered to what extent the hon. the Deputy Minister had really studied this Bill. I pointed out, Mr. Speaker, that there are two new principles, the first one relating to the new power given to the Minister to control the use to which a subdivided piece of agricultural land may be put on granting an application for subdivision. The other new principle is in clause 3 (f). The position as it exists today is that a local authority may expand its area of jurisdiction by acquiring an entire farm. There is nothing to stop that from happening in terms of the Act as it stands at the present time. In terms of clause 3 (f), the hon. the Minister is now taking the power to prevent a local authority from even acquiring an entire farm without his permission. It has nothing to do with subdivision at all. Surely that is another important new principle which we find for the first time in this amending legislation. I would like to know from the hon. the Deputy Minister what such a clause is doing in an Act which has to do with subdivision. This has nothing whatsoever to do with subdivision. It is now preventing an owner from disposing of his entire farm&#x2014;not a subdivision&#x2014;to a local authority without the Minister&#x2019;s permission.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to deal with some clauses to which we object specifically, and I want to say that in justifying these amendments, the hon. the Minister has given very few convincing reasons as to the need for some of these amendments, and I hope that later in this debate, in the Committee Stage or in his reply to the Second Reading debate, he will be more specific and that he will justify some of the general remarks that he has made. Firstly, I want to deal with clause 1, paragraph (f). Paragraph (f) as it stands at present excludes from the definition of &#x201C;agricultural land&#x201D; land zoned for any particular purpose under a town-planning scheme which is in force in terms of any law. This has been changed to read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; land which the Minister, after consultation with the executive committee concerned and by notice in the <i>Gazette,</i> excludes from the provisions of this Act.</block>

<p>In motivating this, the hon. the Deputy Minister tells us that he is introducing this amendment because&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Most town planning schemes are situated within the areas of jurisdiction of municipal authorities, the object envisaged in the original measure is net being achieved.</block>

<p>We would like to know what object is not being achieved. Then he goes on to say that he is now taking a power which will enable him, in consultation with local authorities, to exclude land which is not within a local authority area, but which may be adjoining it, from the definition of &#x201C;agricultural land&#x201D;. Sir, in my opinion that is a very good thing to do. It is a good thing that the hon. the Deputy Minister should, in consultation with the local authorities, consider excluding land, which may be suitable for future township development, from the definition of &#x201C;agricultural land&#x201D;. But why does he wish to amend this clause&#x003F; Because the clause as it stands at the moment excludes land zoned for any particular purpose under a town planning scheme. As the hon. the Deputy Minister points out, such land is invariably land which is either within a local authority area, or a local authority may acquire and include it within its area of jurisdiction.</p>

<p>I come now to clause 3 (f). I have already dealt with that to some extent. We would like the hon. the Deputy Minister to motivate this. He tells us that he is introducing this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Because local authorities tend to extend their areas of jurisdiction arbitrarily, it is deemed necessary for the Department </block>

<p><span class="col_1521-1522" refersTo="page_0778"/>of Agricultural Technical Services to obtain control in order to ensure that any extension will not take up only the best agricultural land.</p>

<p>Surely the hon. the Deputy Minister does not suggest that local authorities, which are all subject to the control of the provincial authorities, expand their areas of jurisdiction beyond what is necessary to cope with the normal expansion that they expect in the future.</p>

<p>Sir, let me put it to the hon. the Deputy Minister positively. I do not believe that local authorities, possibly with few exceptions, who are responsible to their ratepayers and who, as I have said, are subject to the jurisdiction of the provincial authorities, will expand their boundaries more than is necessary. In other words, they are not going to take in more land than they anticipate they will require in the future, so I do not believe that the Deputy Minister ought to interfere. If the provincial authorities consider that a local authority is justified in expanding its boundaries to take in further land, why should the hon. the Deputy Minister step in&#x003F; In what way does the hon. the Deputy Minister know better than the provincial authority whether a local authority ought or ought not to expand its boundaries&#x003F; If the hon. the Deputy Minister says that there is a danger that they will take good agricultural land in preference to agricultural land which is not so good, surely this is also a nonsensical argument, because the provincial authorities would naturally take this into account in determining whether to give permission to the local authority to expand or not, and in any event, Sir, I come back to my original argument: Until such time as you have a proper regional plan, how does anyone know where he stands if the Deputy Minister is going to be in a position to say, &#x201C;You cannot take this farm to expand a local authority, but you can take this farm&#x201D;&#x003F; It is not in the interests of the local authority and it is certainly not in the interest of the farmers, because there can be a great deal of prejudice if the hon. the Minister prevents some and not others.</p>

Now, if that is accepted, I think the Deputy Minister ought to tell this House exactly what part this legislation is going to play when these central guide plan committees are going to be established and whether it is the Government&#x2019;s intention to maintain this legislation on the Statute Book, even after these guide plans are in existence, and if he is going to maintain the powers which he is now taking in his hands. If that is so then the Government might as well stop wasting the time of everybody concerned in trying to form these guide plans. All these people who are spending quite a lot of time, not only State officials but private persons as well, in working out these guide plans had better know their position straight away.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. SCHLEBUSCH</person>:</from>

<p>Very well; I agree with you. I want to tell the hon. member for Newton Park at once that we on this side are very pleased with him as the agricultural leader on that side, for as long as he continues to make such stupid remarks and to come forward with as many confusing legal interpretations as he did, we are perfectly happy about the fact that they are not a factor in politics as far as the interests of farmers are concerned. Once again the hon. member for Newton Park and the hon. member for Musgrave have made a big fuss about the fact that we are introducing a new principle here, i.e. the changed use of land. I want to tell the hon. Opposition that in the early forties we had a rarity in the Free State, namely a U.P. Administrator. When gold was discovered on the Free State goldfields, he and the National Executive Committee recommended that control be exercised over the use of land. The U.P. Government of that time accepted that recommendation, and when the Natural Resources Development Act was introduced in 1947, Mr. S. F. Waterson, the then Minister of Economic Development, had the following to say (Hansard, Vol. 61, col. 5279)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Social and Economic Planning Council, in its fifth report, which was on the subject of regional and town planning, pointed out that the nature of land used is such as to demand a considerable measure of public control if certain cardinal social aims are to be realized; and they recommended that the Union should embark upon an active programme of land use.</block>

<p>This is what he said in introducing the Natural Resources Development Act. He piloted through clause 15 of that Bill, which prohibited the subdivision of land and a change in the use of land in controlled areas without the consent of the Minister. As we know, that first controlled area was the Free State goldfields. But as the country developed, that controlled area became bigger and bigger in extent. In other words, the people who quite rightly introduced control over the use of land in this country, are the predecessors of the Opposition. Now they are making a mockery of the work of their own predecessors by using such unbridled language in regard to this legislation which is before us today.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Musgrave also referred to the wide powers now being granted to a Minister. I have just read out to you, Sir, that in 1947 the United Party introduced that very principle by granting unheard of powers to a Minister, in this case it happened to be another Minister, but the principle remains 100 per cent the same. Furthermore, I want to tell the hon. member for Musgrave that he should not take it amiss of me if I make the insinuation here today that he was only speaking on behalf of township developers and their interests. It is true, and I admitted it here by way of interjection, that in the future more agricultural land will have to be surrendered for township development. But then it should be done in a planned manner and then the department which has control over agricultural land, should at least have the control over the type of agricultural land they are prepared to surrender. Sir, if I had to award a symbol or a badge to the debaters on agriculture on that side of the House, I would give them a badge depicting a donkey with a wooden plough. As regards their ideas on the subdivision and the consolidation of land, they are quite archaic. At a time when the entire modern Western world exercises the strictest control over and prohibits the subdivision of agricultural land in order to promote consolidation in that way, they are saying, as the hon. member for Newton Park did, that we are engaged in the worst form of socialism.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. the Deputy Minister that I welcome this legislation because we must come into line with the Western world. As far as the consolidation of land is concerned, one can only come into line with the Western world if one repairs all the leaks in the bucket. One cannot fill the bucket if it has leaks, and that is precisely what the hon. Opposition envisages. They want loopholes and they want leaks so that we may not, like other modern countries, proceed with the consolidation of uneconomic units. I want to say in passing <span class="col_1525-1526" refersTo="page_0780"/>that the hon. member for Newton Park wanted to kick up another terrible row by wanting to know what an economic unit was. Since 1947 we have, under the Natural Resources Act, been dealing with this legislation in controlled areas. I myself have been living under this Act as a farmer and as an attorney right from the start, ever since 1947, when this legislation was promulgated. This is a matter about which one can argue theoretically, but in practice it has always worked out the way it does now. We should not have a hundred-and-one objections, and we should not refuse to follow modern trends.</p>

<p>In conclusion I should like to mention two other loopholes, which I feel should be attended to. I am sure that at the moment it is not possible for the hon. the Minister to attend to this particular objection of mine. It is a major issue and many other problems are involved. It is the question of land which belongs to a company and the use of such land by shareholders. That is an aspect which will have to receive more attention in future. However, I want to come back specifically to clause 3 (d) of the legislation, which provides that no lease in respect of a portion of agricultural land may be registered in a deeds registry unless the Minister had consented in writing to the registration concerned. This clause, clause 3 (d), specifically refers to the type of lease for which provision is made in the General Law Amendment Act of 1956, Act No. 50 of 1956. This Act lays down what the requirements are for validating a long-term lease in respect of third parties, and requires such a contract to be registered in notarial form in a deeds registry. In addition this particular Law Amendment Act provides specifically what leases are to be registered in this manner. To be specific, these are leases where the term of lease is 10 years or longer and where the term of lease is the natural life of the lessee or any other person, or where the term of lease may be extended indefinitely by the lessee for periods which together with the first period of the lease amount in all to not less than ten years. I repeat, this type of long-term lease should only be registered if one wants it to be valid against third parties. This is not necessary between lessor and lessee. Between them an unregistered lease is valid too. Subsequent to that there were other court rulings which provided that certain other persons were not third parties either. Heirs, for instance, were not regarded as third parties. Against them, as I have already said, an unregistered long-term lease is valid too. My question to the hon. the Deputy Minister was: Does clause 3 (d) envisage that a portion of a unit of farm land, to which a title deed exists, may not be leased for a long period without the Minister&#x2019;s consent&#x003F; If the answer is in the affirmative, the provision is not comprehensive enough. I have already indicated that such a lease can be valid between certain parties without registration. However, if the clause only seeks to prohibit a negotiable right without the consent of the Minister, the provision concerned is comprehensive enough, for registration establishes the negotiable right in long-term leases of this type. If the hon. the Deputy Minister says that he only wants to stop a negotiable right if it is not done with consent, I nevertheless want to ask him whether it would not be desirable to make the long-term lease in its entirety subject to approval before it is registered or even after it has been registered. That will not be a controllable matter. I want to grant that. Where registration does not take place, it is impossible for the Minister to know where a lease has been entered into, because it is not registered. However, if the General Law Amendment Act were amended, and if it were provided that such a lease between lessor and lessee would not be valid in respect of agricultural land, irrespective of whether it is registered without the Minister&#x2019;s approval, it would be possible to exercise control over long-term leases of this nature. The reason why I mention this is that, because a lease is valid between the parties without registration, it is possible that a lessor may lease five different uneconomic portions of his farm to five different young people for, say, 50 years or longer. That would be quite legal as long as they are the only people involved. In that manner they would, to my mind, defeat the purpose for which section 3 (d) will have been placed on the Statute Book. I realize that this may mean amendments to the General Law Amendment Act, but I would appreciate it if the hon. the Deputy Minister would give his attention to this matter and react to it at a later stage by effecting an amendment, if necessary.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by saying that I resent very much indeed the insinuation which the hon. member for Kroonstad made against the <span class="col_1527-1528" refersTo="page_0781"/>hon. member for Musgrave by saying that the hon. member for Musgrave was speaking merely in the interests of land developers. I want to ask that hon. member to get the Hansard of the hon. member for Musgrave and to show me where in that speech that he made did he say anything that could be construed to be to the advantage of people who want to develop ground. That is a totally wrong insinuation to make; it is totally false and totally unjustified. I think the hon. member ought to know better. He should not come to this House with that kind of thing.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, as one learned gentleman to another, I think it is unworthy of him. I really do.</p>

<p>The hon. member mentioned the Natural Resources Development Act of 1947. However, nowhere in that Act as passed by the United Party was the Government of the day given powers similar to those which are being given to the Minister. The Act provided for a council. There was a council which would advise the Minister. The Minister was the Minister of Economic Development, and not the Minister of Agriculture. You can see some of these things &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schlebusch">

</speech>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member says that I must look at the principle. The council was empowered to do certain things. I think it is worth while dwelling on those for a minute. The council could prepare schemes for the exploitation, development or use of resources in any such area. It could declare controlled areas; it could facilitate or guide the carrying out of such schemes, that is, &#x2026; to assist and advise statutory authorities vested with any powers or functions in connection with or affecting the subdivision or use of land in any controlled area &#x2026;&#x201D;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schlebusch">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. SCHLEBUSCH</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask the hon. member a question&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>May I just finish what I am saying&#x003F; The Act as passed by the United Party in 1947 made provision for all that this hon. Minister has been trying to do in the Act which was passed in 1970. There was provision there for controlled areas to be developed. This is precisely what we on this side of the House have been asking for. There is one other provision I wish to quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; to facilitate and guide the carrying out of any such scheme, including the establishment of any industries and undertakings contemplated by the scheme.</block>

<p>I believe that the fact that this legislation resides under the Minister of Agriculture, is totally wrong. The emphasis has been placed on the wrong Minister and wrong department altogether. I believe that the department and the Government have had their power, under this Act, the ability to declare controlled areas and to control the subdivision of ground, if they had seen fit to use it in the way which was proposed by this side of the House, namely by zoning certain areas for certain means of development. The hon. member may now ask his question.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schlebusch">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. SCHLEBUSCH</person>:</from>

<p>Does the hon. member deny that section 15 of the Natural Resources Act provide that the Minister of Economic Affairs must grant permission for the subdivision of land and for a change in the manner in which it is used&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Section 15 refers quite clearly to &#x201C;A restriction upon subdivision and use of land in controlled areas.&#x201D; What has happened through this Act of the hon. the Minister, is that the whole of South Africa has been declared a controlled area. Every piece of land, for whatever purpose it may be used, has been declared a controlled area. This is where the legislation is wrong. What has happened is that there has been a virtual embargo placed on the subdivision of ground for many different purposes. The whole question is being viewed from one viewpoint alone, namely that of agricultural ground.</p>

<p>I want to say that I was very disappointed indeed when the hon. the Deputy Minister introduced the Second Reading of this Bill. I have had some problems with his department and he knows about them. When he came with this amendment, I thought it was going to sort out some of the problems I have had, because the legislation deals with ground which is not today agricultural ground in any sense of the word other than in the purely technical definition which is <span class="col_1529-1530" refersTo="page_0782"/>contained in the original Act of 1970. This definition includes ground which cannot in any way be used as agricultural ground. I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister to explain what will happen in the case of areas of land which were legally subdivided, broken up and sold in various small portions to various people, and are now roundabout the peripheries of certain of our urban areas. How does the hon. the Deputy Minister intend to use the Act&#x003F; Will he tell me that he is going to consolidate all those areas back into farms&#x003F; If he is not going to do so, what is the purpose of this Act, giving him control of those pieces of ground with regard to the use of agricultural land&#x003F; I can see absolutely no purpose for this at all. Later on I wish to quote just two examples to the hon. the Deputy Minister and to the House in this regard. I want to ask him to tell me why his department has refused to give permission for that ground to be subdivided further than it has already been subdivided.</p>

<p>I want to say that I associate myself very strongly indeed, as I said at the Second Reading of the original Act, with the idea of a regional plan. In every area a zone must be set aside where the subdivision of ground for residential purposes must be facilitated. We are facing a tremendous housing shortage. All that has happened in terms of this Act is that the subdivision of ground has been made much more difficult, because there seems to have arisen&#x2014;certainly in my province&#x2014;a misunderstanding or a <i>Contretemps</i> between the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department and the Provincial Administration. On several occasions the hon. the Deputy Minister said to me that my problems were caused by the Provincial Administration, but I have taken the trouble of going to the Provincial Administration and tried to find out where the problem lies. I get the reply from them that it comes from the hon. the Minster&#x2019;s department.</p>

<p>Of course, because they do not know what the hon. the Deputy Minister is trying to achieve. They have not yet achieved any kind of understanding and they do not know what he is getting at, because they get a blanket refusal in every case.</p>

<p>I now want to come back to the two points I want to discuss with the hon. the Deputy Minister. The question is made here that we must not allow good agricultural land round about our urban areas to be subdivided and that we must look for the more difficult ground which is not such good agricultural ground. But let me ask the hon. the Minister of Planning a question. In Pietermaritzburg we have a specific case in point, where there are two areas which are to be allocated for Coloured areas. One of them is adjacent to the present Coloured area, but it is very difficult ground to exploit. The other area is some miles away from the present existing Coloured area, and is easier ground to develop. Is the hon. the Deputy Minister now going to place an embargo on the Minister of Coloured Affairs and the Minister of Planning to allocate the better area for Coloured housing&#x003F; How does he resolve these problems&#x003F; If we are going to put up the cost of building by anything up to 25 per cent or 30 per cent merely because we are not going to take ground which is better agricultural land and force building development to go to the more difficult ground, I think the hon. the Deputy Minister has a lot to answer. I do not think it is going to work in that way. I think one is going to find that the pressure is going to be to allow the easiest and cheaper type of ground to be used for housing within certain limits. I think it should be the job of the Minister and his department and the other departments involved in regional planning to determine where these areas are in which development can take place. The hon. the Deputy Minister asked whether we would be content to have 4 000 cattle on ten morgen of land next to the Vaal River, but I want to point out that we passed an amendment to the Water Act last year giving the Minister of Water Affairs specific powers to deal with a case like that, of anybody polluting the Vaal River. It is in the Water Act and any member who sat on the Select Committee will know that that specific problem was raised last year and that provision was made for it in the Water Act. I think the hon. the Deputy Minister should better delegate his powers <span class="col_1531-1532" refersTo="page_0783"/>to the Minister of Water Affairs who will fix it up for him.</p>

<p>When he introduced his legislation the hon. the Deputy Minister gave us no kind of a background as to the problems which have arisen in regard to the implementation of the Act at all. We have had a whole year in which the Act has been in operation. I had some problems with it myself and I hoped that we were going to get a review from the hon. the Deputy Minister when introducing this legislation. I hoped that he would tell us that in trying to apply the Act there were certain problems which had arisen. All we got was a very short and bald statement by the hon. the Deputy Minister, however, dealing with certain specific amendments without giving any kind of a review at all. I think when he replies to this debate he owes it to the House to give us some kind of an oversight of what is happening in South Africa, and how the applications are coming in, of how they are being refused or accepted and so on.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>They might change their minds when I get a chance to talk to them. Here we have a small portion of ground of 27 acres, which lies between the Health Committee area of Merrivale and the local Health Commission area of Cedara. It will never be a farm. It can never again be a farm in the sense of the word that the hon. the Deputy Minister and I understand the term &#x201C;farm&#x201D;. It is a smallholding and it can be nothing else. An application was made to cut off four acres and it has been refused. If the hon. the Deputy Minister is serious and he intends to apply this Act for the consolidation of those areas, I can understand that there might be a problem. But if that is not his intention, surely it is in the interests of the country and it is the duty of the Deputy Minister to understand why the applications have been refused. There must be some co-ordination between the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s Department and the Natal Provincial Administration. One simply cannot place a total embargo on the subdivision of land. I welcome anything the hon. the Deputy Minister can tell me about it. If we can come back to the matter on a later date, I understand I have his full sympathy and support.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, mentioned in the Second Reading debate on the original Bill that my constituency is not only one of the best agricultural constituencies in the country, but that it is also a resort area. I come back to the point I made. The Deputy Minister took me to task for using the phrase &#x201C;holiday home&#x201D;, but there is more and more pressure in my constituency by people who wish to buy small plots of ground where they can go for a weekend, something like a holiday home, a cottage or something similar, something which is vital in terms of the pressures of modern urban living. Again I return to the request that I made, that there should be a zone, that the Deputy Minister should take the <span class="col_1533-1534" refersTo="page_0784"/>power within his department to zone a certain area in consultation with the provincial authorities, who are the people who deal with and understand these matters. He nods his head. I think that we are really making some kind of progress, but certainly it does not appear to me from the terms of the legislation the hon. the Deputy Minister has introduced here that this is going to be his serious intention. I would like to reiterate that in Natal, where we have a very close provincial control through the Town and Regional Planning Commission, it is impossible to have, what I regard as a blanket embargo. There has to be some kind of movement on the part of the department. Let us say once again that this side of the House is totally in agreement with the prevention of uneconomic subdivision of farms. Nobody wants to load the State with the responsibility of having to consolidate farms which are uneconomical, but so many of our problems in Natal relate to the small areas round about the local authorities. I think that this legislation has done absolutely nothing to help the problems that I have had, and I associate myself with the amendment of the hon. member for Newton Park.</p>

But what is the second principle contained in the same Act&#x003F; It is, namely, also to regulate and control the use of such subdivided land.

I want to ask the hon. member for Newton Park whether he consulted organized agriculture&#x003F; Did he consult organized agriculture originally, when the principle of the original Act was under discussion&#x003F; Of course not. The hon. member is so out of touch with organized agriculture that I want to make the statement here that he cannot even pretend to be speaking on their behalf. What are the facts&#x003F; When last did the hon. member attend an agricultural congress&#x003F;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. HEUNIS</person>:</from>

<p>I think he has never been to one. Sir, what is the standpoint of organized agriculture on the principle of this legislation&#x003F; The standpoint of organized agriculture on the principle of this legislation is not negative, but one of support; it welcomes this principle. When the hon. member initially opposed the legislation, he spoke at length about the stream of protest allegedly raised by the farmers against the implementation of this legislation, and where is that protest&#x003F; But, Sir, I want to go further than that. The hon. member is also the patron of provincial powers. He said that this legislation interfered with the powers of the provinces. I want to suggest that he has not read this Bill, for the fact of the matter is that in principle this legislation grants the provinces powers of control which they do not have today. Sir, let us just consider the whole question of provincial powers. When I listen to hon. members opposite, it rather seems to me as though the Government and the Provincial Administrations and even the local authorities, are three institutions which are in continual conflict with one another and that they are not levels of effective administration. Sir, what is the test that has to be applied in order to determine whether a particular power is vested in some or other level that exists in our political structure&#x003F; After all, we are not living in a static economy. Surely, the norm should not be that because a particular power has been granted to some level or other on a particular occasion, it is a situation to which permanence should be given. This is the test: Which of these levels of administration can in a given set of circumstances render the most effective service&#x003F; Surely that is the norm. In a country like ours, with these various levels of administration, it is important for us to realize that from time to time interaction will take place in respect of the powers of these various levels, but always with the aim of effective management and administration as the decisive factor. Therefore I consider it to be wrong that, in respect of effective administration, we should continually try to play off certain levels of government against one another, whereas their function should actually be to put us in a better position to govern our country. But I want to go further. I say that there are certain criteria that should be followed in respect of administration. The hon. members for Musgrove and Mooi River do not agree with the hon. member for Newton Park, for these hon. members, if I understood them correctly&#x2014;they may correct me-&#x2014;adopted the attitude that, in the first instance, there were good grounds for the control of subdivision and the use of land, but that prior to legislation to this effect being introduced, the necessary guide plans should be drawn up. In other words, in princple the hon. members for Mooi River and Musgrave are not against the principle of this legislation, but they have certain objections in respect of the implementation of this legislation.</p>

These are the only two principles contained in this Bill. I ask hon. members: If they object to the principle of this Bill, in what respect has the position changed since they adopted the principle of control over subdivision and control over use in 1944&#x003F;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. HEUNIS</person>:</from>

<p>I am so sorry that the hon. member did not say anything, for if he had said something, he would perhaps have made an intelligent contribution to this debate. Sir, surely there is a continual change in the powers of local authorities in relation to the Provincial Administration and <i>vice versa,</i> and between the Government and the Provincial Administrations and <i>vice versa.</i> The impression I gain is that hon. members on that side are of the opinion that this Parliament ought to have no powers, and I want to tell them that in our structure any Provincial Administration and any local authority derives its authority and powers from this Parliament&#x2014;and the sooner hon. members realize this, the better&#x2014;and that when an interchange of the functions of local authorities and Provincial Administrations takes place, the norm that has to be applied, is the norm of effective administration and government. But I want to take it further. Let us see whether this Bill improves the existing position in respect of control, and let us see whether it does not grant more powers to the provincial councils. Let us see, Sir, whether there is any merit in the accuzation that some provincial powers are being taken away without any compensating factor contained in the Bill itself. Secondly, let us see whether this Bill contains deficiencies, for the hon. the Deputy Minister is obviously introducing amendments for the very purpose of ensuring the better and more effective administration of the principal Act and, by those means, drawing the Administrations into the administration of this Act, or into the principle of this Act, where he himself can exercise the control for the purposes of the work of his department.</p>

<p>The first deficiency that exists in the Act, is obviously the following, namely that the scope of the existing Act is so wide that the Department of Agricultural Technical Services has to consider applications which do not really come within the framework of its objectives, which the hon. the Minister seeks to achieve by way of this Act; in other words, in the definition of agricultural land, the Act now includes land which ought not to be tested against the norm of agricultural and economic standards.</p>

<speech by="#heunis">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. HEUNIS</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, perhaps the hon. member was not here, but when the Minister wanted to allow him that point, he quarrelled about that as well. I want to repeat. What deficiency exists at the moment&#x003F; The deficiency exists that, because the scope of the Act is too wide, there are applications which, with the acceptance of the amendment proposed by the hon. the Minister, improve that deficiency. Then we find a second deficiency, i.e. the fact that farms can be withdrawn from the provisions of the Act through steps taken by local authorities by, for instance, applying in the first place for the extension of its area of jurisdiction, so as to bring into that new area of jurisdiction land which is invaluable from an agricultural point of view. That is the deficiency that exists. I just want to point that out. The hon. member for Newton Park is the Cape leader of this party, and as such he will be aware that there are several divisional councils in the Cape to which the provisions of the planning chapter of the Townships Ordinance are applicable, such as Cape Town itself, Stellenbosch, Paarl and Knysna. The result is that in these areas a farmer can subdivide his farm into units larger than 25 morgen in extent, without any controlling authority over him. That is why there is a deficiency, and I think that what we should do now, is to identify these deficiencies, and once we have identified them, we should judge the remedies the Minister wants to apply in order to supply these deficiencies.</p>

<p>A third deficiency that exists, is that within the areas of some of these urban local authorities, some of the most valuable agricultural land is in fact to be found, such as here in Paarl and in the area of the municipalities along the Orange <span class="col_1539-1540" refersTo="page_0787"/>River. In Paarl pressure is continually being brought to bear on the Cape Administration by owners for good agricultural land to be subdivided. Now the hon. member for Durban Musgrave has quoted Mr. Conradie, the M.E.C., but why does he not quote another speech of his in which he made a moving plea for powers to curb the subdivision of agricultural land within urban local areas, a power which they do not have&#x003F; I shall tell you why.</p>

<speech by="#heunis">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. HEUNIS</person>:</from>

<p>My complaint against hon. members on the other side is that in trying to find motivation for standpoints, they are not prepared to give the complete standpoint of people, but only to quote that portion of the standpoints in question which happens to substantiate their own views. I think the hon. members owe their own responsibility as members of this House a great deal more than the price they are paying now. What does the legislation do after the deficiencies have been identified&#x003F; A new definition, the new paragraph (m) of the existing definition, will enable the Minister to exempt, in accordance with a guide plan, if you wish&#x2014;the Act does not exclude the drawing of a guide plan&#x2014;those areas, i.e. land, which really has no agricultural value and which should not really come within the provisions of the norms of this Act. That is the first matter I want to mention, but the second one is that the result will be that any subdivision in these areas will be controlled by the provinces in terms of legislation controlling subdivision for purposes other than agriculture. In other words, this provision not only eliminates this deficiency, but also grants the province additional powers for resting the land exempted in terms of this provision against the requirements it wishes to lay down in terms of its own legislation for township and other development in its area. But what do we hear&#x003F; All we hear is a repetition of the old outcry that provincial powers are being eroded.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. HEUNIS</person>:</from>

<p>I shall come to that in a moment. It is also true that rural areas in which planning schemes exist, such as around our major cities, which have up to now been excluded from the provisions of this legislation, are now included again. I want to repeat that from the nature of the case the hon. the Minister has, in respect of the department he handles, certain requirements he has to meet. It goes without saying that the Administration and local authorities have certain functions which they have to carry out. After all, there is consultation between the various bodies which, within their departments, have various targets. Surely, a continual process of evaluation takes place between the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department, the Administration and the local authorities, once again with a view to the evaluation of what is of the greatest importance in a given set of circumstances and in a given area, namely the agricultural aspect or the township-development aspect. What hon. members are doing now, is to play off these levels of government against each other all the time. I think it is a public disgrace.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#heunis">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. HEUNIS</person>:</from>

<p>No, I do not wish to reply to questions now. The fact of the matter is that if the right of land use is changed, the local authority may make a <span class="col_1541-1542" refersTo="page_0788"/>recommendation to the Administrator. Determining the right of land use is not the only thing the Administrator can do; he can go much further than that. If he rezones land in a municipal area for a purpose other than the one for which it is zoned at the moment, he can say that the owner has to pay over to the local authority, a part of the appreciation, if there is any. The point I want to make is that the principle of control over land use has, after all, been embodied in our legislation, and also in our provincial legislation, for a long time.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, in local authorities as well.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#heunis">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. HEUNIS</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, in local authorities as well. Let us consider this Bill further. In terms of clause 7 the Minister will be able to delegate powers not only to his own officials, but also to officials of provincial administrations. This is a further extension of those people&#x2019;s powers in regard to the spheres and facets in regard to which they can judge and which come within the scope of their powers. The amendment effected in terms of clause 10 will add to the provinces&#x2019; powers to control the subdivision of land into portions even larger than 25 morgen in extent in areas exempted by the Minister for the provisions of the legislation. It is a further extension of the powers of the provinces. I want to summarize by saying that hon. members may argue as they please, but in fact remains that the whole principle of control over the subdivision of land in rural areas and urban areas, is a principle that has already been adopted. The principle of control over the use of land in rural areas and in municipal areas, is a principle that has already been adopted. Those hon. members are quite prepared to pose here as the champions of the individual rights of the people who are under discussion here, namely the farmers. Do hon. members now want to elevate the individual rights to a position superior to that of the common interest&#x003F; I have here with me the observations made initially by the hon. member for Newton Park. Do hon. members want there to be no restrictions whatever on farmers in respect of the use of their land&#x003F; I want hon. members to tell us what their reply is&#x2014;yes or no.</p>

<p>But of course. Surely that is the point. Surely the hon. member has already accepted the principle in the Soil Conservation legislation, which seeks to protect the soil. In fact, that Act was passed in 1946. But am I now to say that when his party passed that Act in 1946, it eroded the rights of the individual, or am I to say that hon. members, when they passed that Act, carried out their responsibility, namely that of protecting the soil in our country. Now I come to the second point I want to make. Does the hon. member agree that we are a relatively poor agricultural country, and that it is the responsibility of the Government to prevent, in cases where these interests are of primary importance, after a process of evaluation, valuable agricultural land from becoming uneconomic for agricultural purposes&#x003F; Does he agree with that&#x003F;</p>

<p>He is as silent as the grave.</p>

<p>I am of the opinion that there is one deficiency which is not being eliminated by the legislation before the House at the moment. In this draft legislation the Minister did not make any provision for this particular deficiency, and that is that there is also agricultural land situated in urban local authorities over which the Minister cannot exercise any control at the moment. Therefore I am giving notice now of my intention to move the following amendment at the Committee Stage, namely that the following words be added at the end of line 35, page 3: &#x201C;But with the exception of any such land which the Minister, after consultation with the Executive Committee concerned and by notice in the <i>Gazette,</i> declares to be agricultural land for the purposes of this Act.&#x201D; That will enable the Minister to comply with the pleas addressed to him from time to time, namely that he should not prevent and block the subdivision of land <i>per se,</i> but should try to prevent the subdivision of land, tested against a specific norm. I know what hon. members are going to do with this amendment I want to move. They will say that there is already a shortage of building premises, and that the Government is now going to restrict the subdivision of land to an even greater extent. But the essence of this amendment which I want to move, is that <span class="col_1543-1544" refersTo="page_0789"/>this step should be taken in consultation with the Provincial Administration, and when the Administration advises the Minister in this particular regard, he will have to express an opinion in respect of the need and the necessity for township development in that vicinity or in respect of the farm itself. Then the process of evaluation is going to take place in order to determine what interests are to be the decisive ones in this specific set of circumstances. That is why I am giving notice of my intention to move such an amendment.</p>

<speech by="#deacon">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. D. DEACON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for False Bay claims that the principle of control over agricultural land has long been contained in the Act. We admit that there are certain provisions dealing with this in the provincial ordinances and in certain laws of the country. The hon. member referred to Act No. 10 of 1944, in which the area of 25 morgen or 50 acres is mentioned. Those provisions, however, are not at all the same as those in the present legislation.</p>

<p>But I want to go further. There have always been the different levels of government on which the hon. member has so beautifully elaborated here, namely the local government, the provincial government and the ministry right at the top. But how does the present legislation work, for example, the previous Act piloted through this House in 1970&#x003F; Before land can be subdivided one first has to go to the top and ask for permission from the ministry. No surveying or anything of that nature can be done before one has asked for permission from the people at the top. In the past, with the levels of government, one could go to the Administration if the local authority were to reject it. There was a right of appeal to the Administrator. To whom can one go once the hon. the Minister has rejected it&#x003F; It is an impossible matter.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. D. DEACON</person>:</from>

<p>I know of cases in my constituency and the hon. the Minister knows of cases where there was no right of appeal at all, because this matter does not work from the lowest level to the top one, but from the top level down to the lowest one. In other words, this is not a Bill which helps the people to get to the top level, it is a Bill which actually bears down on the people and stifles them, as my hon. bench-fellow said the other day. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>If one compares the long titles of the Act and of this Bill, one sees that the long title of the Act which was before the House in 1970 was only &#x201C;to control the subdivision of agricultural land&#x201D;. If one looks at the long title of this Bill, however, one sees that this Bill is introduced&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; so as further to define agricultural land; so as to prohibit the registration of certain leases; so as to regulate, in certain circumstances, the sale of agricultural land, the utilization thereof for specified purposes, and the registration of servitudes in respect thereof; and so as to extend the powers of the Minister as to the imposition of conditions and the delegation of powers; to amend the Provincial Powers Extension Act, 1944, so as to extend the powers of provincial councils; and to provide for matters connected therewith.</block>

<p>We agree with the extensions of provincial powers, but if one looks at the amendment in paragraph (f) of the definition of &#x201C;agricultural land&#x201D;, and at the amendment in clause 1 (b), one wonders whether it is in fact going to extend the powers of the provincial councils. We know it reads as if it were an extension, but the way I know public life it seems to me that it is only going to handicap the local authority and the provincial council with red tape. I am glad to hear that the hon. member for False Bay is going to move a further amendment to clause 1. I hope the hon. the Minister is going to classify it further, because we on this side are also going to move amendments to that clause, as it is very vaguely put. If it is indeed an extension of the powers of the provincial councils, we cannot see that it is going to be easy to apply.</p>

<p>I now come to the amendment of section 3 of the main Act which is introduced by clause 3. The proposed new paragraph (e) reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; no plot, on agricultural land, which has not been surveyed, or any right to such a plot, shall be sold or offered or advertised for sale.</block>

<p>That paragraph is going to cause a lot of trouble in certain parts of South Africa, and particularly in the coastal areas. Along <span class="col_1545-1546" refersTo="page_0790"/>the short stretch of coast which I know in the Eastern Cape from, say, the Bushman&#x2019;s River up to the Fish River, there are several places where there are no surveyed plots&#x2014;in some cases it is Government land and in other cases a private farm&#x2014;where people do have movable property, a cottage. This includes places such as Gasooka, Kleinemonde, Riet River, Old Woman&#x2019;s River and Fish River Mouth. They are controlled by divisional councils and one cannot erect a permanent structure there. These places have been there for years, however, There are places such as these here in the Western Cape as well. Farmers are not the only people to go there. That cottage, and the right to stay on that land, is sold by one family to another. When one looks at this clause of the Bill one sees that they will no longer be able to sell those places. People sometimes buy those beach cottages when their children are still young. When their children have grown up they sell them to someone else.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. D. DEACON</person>:</from>

<p>No, but it will be interesting to know what will happen.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Clause 3 of the Bill deals with the substitution of section 3 of the Act. The new section 3 (f) is an interesting amendment. It would now appear that a local authority, whereas it could buy ground under the Act as it stood and could extend its boundaries, except ground that was subdivided, may, in terms of this amendment, not even buy a full unit, an undivided piece of ground, without the permission of the Minister. We were talking about the planes of the government earlier on. Surely the local authority must know what its requirements are. Surely it should be able to specify that a certain piece of ground fits in with any urban development scheme. Surely it should be able, in conjunction with the townships board of its province, and with the executive committee, to decide for itself whether it must acquire land or not. Now, even if it needs a piece of undivided additional land, it has to get the permission of the Minister. I think something should be done in regard to this. I feel that one should not over-restrict the subdivision of ground in urban areas. I believe that this Minister, instead of bringing this restrictive legislation, should allow the townships board and the planning boards of the provinces to plan for their large urban areas. If we are going to over-restrict them, we are going to increase the cost of building land, which is already very expensive. By over-restricting and limiting the supply of building land in our urban areas, we can only add to the cost of those plots, and add to the inflation from which this country is already suffering. I suggest that we look at this legislation very carefully before we pass it, with the idea of not creating an artificial shortage. I might mention that the tendency of inflated valuations of land in our urban areas, and also in our holiday resort areas, has multiplied by an enormous amount. It will multiply more if this legislation is passed. Since the ordinances controlling further development of holiday resorts on the Cape coast were introduced some years ago, valuations went up enormously. I want to mention the example of a plot 50 feet by 100 feet in the Eastern Cape, at a place called Boesmansrivier. In 1966 the valuation of this plot was R150, but today is valued at R2 500. This is a dangerous thing that is happening. I believe <span class="col_1547-1548" refersTo="page_0791"/>that if we are going to over-restrict, we are going to put these prices up even further. People are not going to be able to afford the burden. I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister to leave these powers to the provinces and to forget about this Bill entirely. I also appeal to him to accept our amendment.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Newton Park mentioned the possibility of ground being purchased for a brickfield and being affected by this Act. Well, I know of a case about which I did not go to the Minister, because I knew that there would be trouble; so I recommended a 99 year lease. Thank Heavens, I got through in time. But the cost of building material is another thing the man in the street has to contribute to today. The price of bricks is exceptionally high. There is not much brick ground available in certain parts of the country. In some places today bricks are R60 per 1 000. If one is going to push up the price further by restricting the amount of ground available for the purpose, it is just going to aggravate the position.</p>

<p>Clause 4, as has been mentioned by the speakers on this side of the House, introduces an amazing new principle and a new power. It in fact gives the Minister the power to determine how a farmer may farm. I feel that this is going a little bit too far, because the Minister already has power to exclude and control the bad and inefficient farmer under the Soil Conservation Act. Why must we have another clause in this Bill which gives him the power to say exactly what has to be done and how the ground may be used&#x003F; The clause reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister may in his discretion refuse or grant any such application, and, if he grants it, grant it on such conditions as he deems fit, including conditions as to the purpose for which or the manner in which the land in question may be used.</block>

<p>That is very strong wording. If this clause is necessary, we would very much like to know from the Deputy Minister why and whether he is going to delegate this new power to anyone as the hon. member for South Coast asks so wisely; because this is a power which could not lightly be delegated to anybody. I feel that the power to control is already laid down by the Soil Conservation Act. If someone is contravening the Soil Conservation Act, if somebody is upsetting his farming operations by inefficient farming and bad use of land, the Minister may exercize that control; but clause 4 contains an entirely new principle, something we do not like at all.</p>

<p>Then it is difficult to understand sometimes how these cases are decided. I had a case in my constituency which unfortunately I heard about too late. It was a case of certain sections of the old Clarkes party grant of plots of the 1820s. There were four separate surveyed plots but a farmer had bought them up before. Three of them were adjacent to each other on one side of the road, and the other section of 50 morgen was on the other side of the road. Now the owner offered to give the 50 morgen to one of his neighbours, whose farm did not exactly join it, but it was half a mile away. This 50 morgen would have made this man&#x2019;s farm economic. It had water on it.</p>

<p>I will give the hon. the Deputy Minister the details of the case later, but I will tell him now why I never approached him about it. It was turned down by the secretary of the board, and the seller then sold to someone else who bought the lot. It was definitely turned down. I heard about it far too late. But the ground was offered for nothing; it was offered as a gift to a young farmer who was battling on a small farm, and it was turned down. It is too late for us to do anything about that now; but this is what happens under this Act. I believe that one has to take a look at this whole question again, and come forward with something entirely different, introducing a different principle, where there can be a local board to decide these matters. Local conditions are far more important to local people. It is impossible, as I have said during the Second Reading debate of the original legislation, to decide from Pretoria what must go on in Pofadder for instance.</p>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, yesterday was a sorrowful occasion for this House. Had I not heard it myself I would never have believed that the hon. the Minister of Finance could have, or would have made the speech that he did. Yesterday the hon. the Minister was a very angry man. We do not complain about that. We all get angry at times. But, Sir, have you ever analysed why a man gets angry&#x003F; It is always because he is in the wrong. One&#x2019;s anger increases in direct proportion to the weakness of one&#x2019;s case. This is what happened to my friend, the hon. the Minister of Finance yesterday. When he attempted, as he did in only one or two cases, to answer some of the questions that had been put by us in Second Reading or during the no-confidence debate, the replies were completely unconvincing. When he levelled accusations against us his accusations were devoid of fact. And on the 64 dollar question of today, where are we going, we had the same reticence that we have experienced over the past two months. There were no answers from the hon. the Minister of any import.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have been debating the economic position of South Africa for some three weeks. We have discussed the &#x201C;ifs&#x201D; and the &#x201C;whys&#x201D; of intensified import control and of devaluation almost <i>ad nauseam.</i> While the country waits for some lead from hon. members opposite, the hon. the Minister continues to draw red herrings across the trail. Yesterday the hon. the Minister asked what our views were on intensified import control. The hon. the Minister knows well enough what our view is. On 24th November the Minister issued his statement that import control was to be intensified. The next day, on 25th November, I gave an interview to the Press. This is what was reported&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Emdin warned South Africa today that the Government&#x2019;s import clamp down would lead to more inflation and more price increases. Although he conceded that the Government had acted correctly under the circumstances &#x2026;</block>

<p>and I hope that is clear&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; he criticized the National Party for forcing South Africa into a vulnerable economic situation and for moving from one crisis decision to another. Mr. Emdin said that it was correct that international financial affairs were affecting South Africa and her balance of payments position. This is merely an aggravation of a position which the Government had created because of its basic policies.</block>

<p>Now we come to the devaluation by the United States in December. Again I gave an interview to the Press on the following day which was reported as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Emdin last night advised the South African Government to devalue the Rand on a par with the pending devaluation of the United States.</block>

<p>I hope that is now clear enough.</p>

<p>What did Constantia say&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>It does not matter what Constantia said. I at the moment speak for the United Party on these issues. The hon. the Minister knows that. I do not want to start discussing differences of opinion on that side of the House because half an hour will be nowhere long enough. Those are our views and they are quite clear.</p>

<p><span class="col_1551-1552" refersTo="page_0793"/>Now we come to the situation that since that date we have both intensified import control and devaluation running side by side. Here again we have made our position quite clear. We do not believe that side by side with devaluation you can have intensified import control, certainly not for more than an absolute minimum period. I said that before in this House and today I want to add: And only if your balance of payments position is as critical as ours was and I believe still is at the moment. The hon. the Minister says that the intensification of import control was in full conformity with GATT obligations. I should like to know from the hon. the Minister: Have GATT agreed that devaluation plus import control at the same time are permissible&#x003F; The hon. the Minister must not be fooled by the old precept that attack is the best form of defence. Sometimes one finds that when the armaments of the person you attack are very much stronger than those with which you attack, you are liable to take an awful beating.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister says our arithmetic is weak&#x2014;we cannot do the most elementary sums. He gave a number of examples, and I should like to refer to two of them. First of all, there is his story and that of the Reserve Bank, that inflation from December, 1970, to December, 1971, was not 7,1 per cent but only 4 per cent. The hon. the Minister says we must deduct from the 7,1 per cent, increases in sales taxes and other direct taxes, and in a number of Government administered prices. These were largely concentrated in the second quarter of 1971. These come to some 3 per cent. I have said to the hon. the Minister before, and I want to repeat it, that he must stop playing the fool with the public. The cost of living went up by 7,1 per cent. It costs the public 7,1 per cent more now than it cost them a year ago to acquire the same goods or services. Nothing the hon. the Minister nor the Government or the Reserve Bank can say, will stop the taxpayer&#x2019;s rand from buying 7,1 per cent less. This is the position. The hon. the Minister then referred to his reference in <i>Die Transvaler,</i> where he said that the cost of living was going to come down as from March this year.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister said that he explained this in his Second Reading speech and then he added, &#x201C;But the Opposition does not understand anything of it&#x201D;. I agree with the hon. the Minister; he is quite correct. We do not understand it. We do not understand it at all, and because we do not understand it, I hope the hon. the Minister when he replies to this debate will be good enough to tell this House, as I asked him to in the Second Reading but which he failed to do, that devaluation will not reduce the buying power of the rand. The country wants to know, and the expert is the hon. the Minister. He should also tell us whether he expects a rise in the cost of living in 1972 or not. I asked him that as well in the Second Reading, but I have not had a reply. The third thing I asked him was: If he does expect a rise, what is his estimate of the rate of inflation for 1972&#x003F; If the hon. the Minister fails to reply again in his reply to this debate, he must not be angry with us if we use the figure most economists are using, namely 7 to 10 per cent, as the anticipated increase in inflation for 1972. The hon. the Minister took me very severely to task for saying that he had done nothing for 23 years to raise tariffs, and alternatively, if something had been done that he should stop harping back to 1947 and stop saying that the United Party has tied us up with GATT. The hon. the Minister now tells us that hundreds and hundreds of items have had rises in their tariffs, and he says that I do not know that some items are bound. Of course I know that some items are bound, but if we have had tariff raises in hundreds and hundreds of items which the hon. the Minister has been talking about, surely he must now stop blaming us for these few tariffs that we have not been able to amend since 1947. He should not give the general impression that the whole reason for import control is because the United Party tied up all tariffs in 1947 and if the impression &#x2026;</p>

<p>I am sorry, it is &#x00A3;80 million which South Africa, under a United Party Government, lent to Great Britain. The hon. member said that the U.P. had left the country in such a shocking state that the Nationalist Government had to get the money back as quickly as it could, that it had to impose import control and that it had to devalue in 1949. It is a very strange situation that it was under a Nationalist Government in 1949 that South Africa had to devalue and that it was under a Nationalist Government that South Africa had to do the same thing in 1971.</p>

<p>It is strange that it was as a result of the actions of a Nationalist Government that we had to have fusion in 1933 and then go off the gold standard. It is a strange thing that the Nationalist Government had to impose import control in 1949 because of the wicked United Party who left such a mess. But what is stranger still is that we still have import control. It is not 1949 any longer; it is 1972. Three months ago it was intensified. I suppose that we are to blame for that as well. The hon. the Minister read to the House a very favourable report from Dr. Lutz of Credit Swiss. What the hon. the Minister does not know is that this favourable report is probably due to the fact that I saw Dr. Lutz in Johannesburg and gave him the assurance that the present Government would not be in existence in 1975. [Interjections.] The hon. the Minister left out a few very important words from Dr. Lutz&#x2019;s report as it appeared in the Press. I want to read them to the House&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa has enormous industrial potential to be measured by the extent to which Coloured labour &#x2026;</block>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; can be trained and used in specialized jobs.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister in defending import control made great play of the fact that in November he did not know that the monetary crisis was likely to end in December. He went so far as to say that it was anticipated that it might only end in February of this year or it might even only end at the end of 1972. The hon. the Minister is getting forgetful. He forgets that on the 6th of November he said that the international climate was on the verge of improvement. In the radio broadcast he gave on the 14th of November he said that he expected the monetary crisis to be solved. Surely the hon. the Minister thought that the situation was going to be rectified very shortly.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, at the Second Reading I was very kind to the hon. the Minister. I said that two months of the breathing space that had been given to us by devaluation had passed, and that we had no lead from the Government. In point of fact, the hon. the Minister had been far more tardy, because I found among my papers, an interview that the hon. the Minister gave on the 24th December in which he said he had first thought seriously about devaluation on the 15th August. Therefore, the hon. the Minister had in mind on the 15th August that we might have to devalue. That is six months ago and not two months ago. I apologize for giving the hon. the Minister credit for an additional four months. What did we have from the hon. the Minister during these six months&#x003F; Firstly, we had a series of philosophical dissertations stressing that devaluation was a desirable move; one almost from strength is the impression one would get listening to the hon. the Minister. He said that we were now poised for significant further development provided we all worked harder and saved more. I think it is correct to ask the hon. the Minister at this stage when he talks about this advancement we are going to make, how he reconciles our present growth rate with the G.D.P. He knows we are far behind. I think the country would like to know in view of this new optimism of the Minister&#x2019;s, what has happened up till now. Secondly, there may be some reduction in taxation, <span class="col_1555-1556" refersTo="page_0795"/>the hon. the Minister says. If this should be so, at least the hon. the Minister has listened to us. The words he used, &#x201C;the strength of our language&#x201D;, has obviously brought this about. Thirdly, the hon. the Minister said that the credit ceiling might be relaxed, if he could find some other way to keep liquidity under control. Fourthly, he said that we must take the import gap created by devaluation. However, of course, he did not tell us how we are to take that gap. We shall have to send for Dr. Craven. This is not good enough. What the country is waiting for, as we have told the hon. the Minister repeatedly, is a blue-print of future Government intentions. The country now wants to be told what the Government intends doing to curb inflation in the short term and what the Government&#x2019;s long-term strategy will be. The hon. the Minister says we are trying to bring down the Government by creating a psychosis of uncertainty. Surely, the truth is, unless we get a blue-print from this Government, they are going to bring the country down by continuing uncertainty and contradictory policies. South Africa has been clamouring for a firm economic policy and a clear statement of intent. They do not want a pragmatic programme of bits and pieces; a bit of yielding here and a bit of taking away there. The only way in which public fears are going to be allayed is by an overall plan, because the fear of the public is that the problems which brought devaluation now, are going to continue to exist. They fear that these problems will not be tackled in the future, just as they were not tackled in the past. In a few moments I am going to use words which I have never used in this House before. 1972 may be a good year for South Africa economically. There are prospects of good crops. There may be a reasonable amount of spare capacity to take up some of the lag created by devaluation and import control. We hope there will be an improvement in the balance of payments position. But unless the fundamental problems which brought us to the position we were in before devaluation, are solved, the benefits of devaluation are going to erode and after 1972 we are going to be heading straight for a recession. I have not used the words &#x201C;a recession&#x201D; in the past for more years than I can remember. There is no need for me to spell out what a recession would mean to South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister says we must increase production; we must formulate capital by saving; and we must export. Of course we must do all these things. For how long have we been telling the hon. the Minister that these are the requirements of South Africa&#x003F; For how long have we been telling this Government that it must change its philosophy from one of curbs, restrictions and controls to one of increased production, increased production and more increased production&#x003F; To get production, one needs a blue-print which embodies a number of items which I dealt with both in the no-confidence debate and at the second reading of the Part Appropriation Bill. I want to reiterate some of these items Firstly, there is an enlightened labour policy. The hon. the Minister says we must use the labour we have. Of course, we must use the labour we have, but we must be able to train this labour to its maximum potential. Secondly, we cannot have a labour policy based on the amazing theory of &#x201C;plekgebonde&#x201D; industries, of which the Railways appears to be one.</p>

<p>Another fact is that the industrialist of this country is not going to set up new industries on the word of the hon. the Minister that he is going to get better labour facilities, while there is legislation on the Statute Book which tells him he cannot use that labour. If we are going to have, as the hon. the Minister is trying to indicate, a vital change in thinking by the Government in regard to its labour, they must change the relative Acts. That the country will believe; it will believe nothing else. The Physical Planning Act, for one, will have to be changed. We want a critical examination of all those controls, the retention of which is hindering South Africa and we want to remove those except for one or two which are absolutely essential. We do not, however, want the attitude shown by the hon. the Minister the other day, when he talked about the ceiling, and said &#x201C;I cannot find another way&#x201D;.</p>

<p>We need meaningful help for exporters, particularly by tax rebates. I hope the hon. the Minister will listen to what SAFTO said. After all, SAFTO is his creation. They have twice said in their annual reports what we have been saying year in and year out. A blue-print requires more. It requires a far-sighted Government. It requires a calm Government, not an angry Government. It requires a Government that can instil confidence into the people. Is this such a Government&#x003F; Let us look at some of the things that have happened over the last 12 to 18 months. What have we had to encourage <span class="col_1557-1558" refersTo="page_0796"/>the people&#x2019;s faith in this Government&#x003F; Hire-purchase curbs were introduced, and changed twice within two months. A Budget deficit was announced by the hon. the Minister amounting to R35,6 million, but shortly afterwards some additional income was found and, Hey presto!, there was no longer a deficit. As regards the Agliotti affair we still have no answer. Then there was the issue of the motor vehicle insurance fund. It is a Government fund that has been investing its money in the grey market. The Bantu Investment Corporation is another fund of which it is alleged that its moneys are invested in the grey market and which paid a commission to private individuals for raising funds through this fund in the grey market. Then there was the fiasco&#x2014;there is no other word&#x2014;that a portion of all participating bond funds should be invested in Government securities. This is the Government that wants the country to have faith in the date of the directive coming into force it&#x003F; They gave a directive, but postponed three times and then found, as they had been told <i>ab initio,</i> that the directive was not capable of implementation. What kind of a Government is this&#x003F; They build a hospital in Johannesburg &#x2026; I beg your pardon, they are still talking about building a hospital in Johannesburg which would have cost a quarter of the price if they had got on with the job. In this way three quarters of the R80 to R90 million could have been saved. The Government also has water schemes which in 1968 were estimated to cost R240 million, a figure which was reiterated by the Minister of Water Affairs on the 8th September, 1970. On the 18th May, 1971, the estimate was given as R385 million. The public of South Africa no longer have any faith in the empty vessels sitting in the front bench on the other side.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister said yesterday that no political party can gain and maintain power by pure bread-and-butter politics and with a purely materialistic philosophy. I want to tell him that if the concept of a compassionate society, if respect for human dignity, if a place in the sun for all our people, and if a buoyant and expansive economy so that our 20 million inhabitants can all have a better standard of living, are materialistic, then the United Party under my hon. leader on my right is a materialistic party. We would rather be branded for this kind of materialism than for having a 19th century ideological philosophy that has not worked, is not working and will never work. It is a philosophy that has borne heavily on all the people, but which benefited very few. I believe that it is this materialistic United Party, the party that postulates an orderly advance of change, so that all the people of South Africa can go forward together, each with a sense of personal security to a better way of life, to a life free from want, to a life of opportunity, to a life of increasing living standards and to a life that is purposeful and meaningful for all the people of South Africa, that can draw the plans of the grand design we need so desperately. I believe that it can implement these plans and can implement a wide concept and a broad vision for 20 million people. I believe it is the United Party which can give South Africa the prosperity it needs and the prosperity it deserves. Prosperity is the one basic need that can lead us to peace and progress. These two are the twin pillars on which the future of this country rests. Without peace we will have no progress, without progress we will have no peace. The only people who can give these twin pillars to the people of South Africa is the United Party.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE AND OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Parktown will pardon me for not following him up, but there are other matters I want to deal with. I want to start the race against the clock at once. I want to return to the speech made here last Friday by the hon. member for Simonstown. I want to start off by saying that I gave notice today of a motion that a Select Committee should investigate certain assertions made by the hon. member. Even if it were in order, I do not want to be so presumptuous as to discuss here today those assertions which I shall request a Select Committee to investigate. In other words, I am not going to discuss them. I am going to discuss other assertions made by the hon. member in his speech, which one could normally expect of someone who is not fully informed and who wants to make some political capital out of them, but which do not cast reflections on anyone&#x2019;s integrity. Sir, there is an old proverb which runs: &#x201C;One fool can put more questions than ten wise men can answer&#x201D;. In saying this I do not want to suggest that the hon. member is a fool, but I do want to suggest&#x2014; I think hon. members will appreciate this <span class="col_1559-1560" refersTo="page_0797"/>&#x2014;that it is going to be very difficult for me, as one ordinary person instead of ten wise men, to reply in the time at my disposal to all those assertions made and all the questions put by the hon. member in the time at his disposal.</p>

<p>I want to come at once to what the hon. member had to say about Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s theory and all the criticism he expressed in that regard. There is one facet of the criticism he expressed in connection with Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s theory which I am not going to discuss, because I believe it will perhaps fall within the ambit of the Select Committee which I am going to ask for. I just want to repeat briefly what I said in this House on previous occasions. If Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s theory can be proved to be correct and to have a proper scientific basis, it will be a very important scientific break-through for the world, because the entire world is struggling with this problem of how to determine the fish population and what the optimal catch aimed at should be. The first point I want to mention, and which I mentioned on previous occasions as well, is that the application of Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s theory will have serious implications, so serious that it would be the height of folly to apply it while there is a whole host of scientists and people as prominent in the scientific world as Dr. Lochner who have criticized his theory and are not prepared to support it.</p>

<p>In the course of my speech I shall mention several names of people who criticize it. Apart from Dr. Lochner, I do not know of one scientist in the world today who adopts the attitude that his theory has been proved. Sir, consider the implications of his theory. The hon. member said on Friday that I had left my people in the lurch. If that hon. member had in fact been in the position of being able to do what he advocated on Friday, does he realize, for example, what he would have done to Walvis Bay&#x003F; Does he realize what would have happened if he had applied Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s theory in Walvis Bay this year, in 1972&#x003F; Does he realize how many of the nine and more factories in South-West Africa would function, and function reasonably normally, when the season opened, if Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s theory were applied&#x003F; If that theory were applied, there would have been work for at the most, say, two factories. The other factories would have had to stand there. Does the hon. member realize what he would have done to Walvis Bay&#x003F; Now he complains that I left my people in the lurch. Sir, it would be the height of irresponsibility to do this to an industry and to deprive South Africa immediately of those millions of rands, about which he was so dramatic on Friday, on the basis of a theory which is accepted by only one scientist as far as I know, namely Dr. Lochner himself.</p>

<p>The hon. member suggested by implication&#x2014;this is how I interpreted him&#x2014;that the position in South-West Africa seemed so dangerous that the quota of 298 000 tons could not even be filled and that 3 000 tons less had been caught. In order to remove all misunderstanding in regard to those 298 000 tons, let me tell the hon. member at once that there was no question of its not having been possible to fill the quota, and that it is a fact that a maximum catch attempt was not made in South-West Africa; neither by the land-based factories, nor by the factory ship <i>Willem Barendsz.</i> As far as both those parties are concerned, there is ample proof of that. If the hon. member wants me to produce the proof, I shall do so, but he knows it himself. It appeared from his speech that he knew that no optimum catch attempt had been made. The explanation for that 3 000 tons is simply that some factories over-fished a little and some factories under-fished a little, and that in respect of pilchard catches&#x2014;and this is what is concerned here&#x2014; they adhered to the quota to which they were pegged in the first place and the closing date of the season caught them. Furthermore, as we know from previous years, it is a fact that the factory at L&#x00FC;deritz, Angra Pequena, finds it difficult to reach its quota, just as it failed to reach it this year. In other words, that 3 000 tons signifies absolutely nothing; it carries absolutely no weight at all. The hon. member&#x2019;s plea is that Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s theory was correct to within 1 per cent over the past few years. I want to say to the hon. member that if any scientist&#x2014;Dr. Lochner or any other&#x2014;could prove a theory which, for example, is correct to within 10 per cent&#x2014; but he must come and prove it&#x2014;it would be a fantastic break-through. As a result of that formula, we would then immediately be able to eliminate the considerable cost we have to incur in respect of research.</p>

<p>Sir, I am not a scientist, and I have always adopted the attitude that I cannot judge Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s theory, and Dr. Lochner knows this as well as I do. Whom am I to rely on&#x003F; I have to rely on other scientists to judge Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s theory. But, as I have said if he could prove that his theory was correct to within 10 per cent, it would be a fantastic break-through, but then it must be proved. What do I, as a layman, know about this&#x003F; As a layman I know that in the past year, 1971, the catches by the factories as well as by the <i>Willem Barendsz</i> more or less corresponded with Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s estimate of the optimum or maximum catch. The hon. member for Simonstown can get the entire Walvis Bay fishing industry and the <i>Willem Barendsz</i> people as witnesses to the fact that many more pilchards could have been caught had they been allowed to catch more. The hon. member says I have left my people in the lurch by allowing too many fish to be caught. Sir, far from it; if &#x201C;my people&#x201D; in South-West Africa&#x2014;and I am referring more particularly to Walvis Bay now and I am using the phrase &#x201C;my people&#x201D; in quotation marks as he used it&#x2014;are of the opinion that I have left them in the lurch, then it is because I am allowing them too small a quantity of fish. The picture is then the very reverse, with the knowledge they have of the industry there. Sir, suspicion is continually being cast on our Division of Sea Fisheries. Let me just quote to you what Dr. Lochner said in regard to his work and the Division of Sea Fisheries; I am quoting from <i>South African Shipping: A News and Fishing Industry Review,</i> December, 1970. Dr. Lochner wrote an article about his work here and concluded it as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The present work is based on sound statistics accumulated by the Division of Sea Fisheries over a period of many years and the author would like to acknowledge their kind co-operation in making all this information available to him.</block>

<p>But the people in this Division are the people on whom suspicion is being cast in respect of Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s work. I have here a memorandum from the Director of Sea Fisheries, Dr. de Jager, a scientist who has devoted a large part, if not the best part, of his life to research in respect of our fishing resources. Time will not permit me to read everything to you, Mr. Speaker, but I just want to quote the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is great doubt about the validity of Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s predictions. He predicted that after 1968 virtually no pilchards would be present in the waters of the Republic, but in spite of this as many as 100 000 tons have been landed. Dr. Lochner explains these catches in terms of immigrants from South-West Africa. Extensive marking experiments do not support the above-mentioned assumption.</block>

<p>Sir, I can continue in this vein, but I do not want to devote any more of my time to this.</p>

<p>It is not a report. It is the type of memorandum of which hundreds are submitted during the year to Ministers and Deputy Ministers for their information. The hon. member said the Commission of Inquiry into Fisheries in South-West Africa and in South Africa had appointed a subcommittee to investigate Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s theory and asked why they had not reported back subsequently. At this stage I think I should just remind the hon. member again that it is probably two years now since I extended an invitation to him in a private conversation, because I thought at the time that he had a positive interest in our fishing industry, and not a negative one, as I am beginning to believe now. I invited him, when he had problems in regard to our fishing industry, to come and discuss them with me. He has never yet done so.</p>

<p>That committee which was appointed by the commission to investigate Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s theory, when he submitted it for the first time, <span class="col_1563-1564" refersTo="page_0799"/>then proceeded to investigate it. They consulted other prominent scientists, whose names are mentioned here. Now we have the comments of the chairman of the commission. He mentions Mr. Robinson. Mr. Robinson is a South African marine biologist who studied population dynamics in the U.S.A. He was also called in, together with Prof. G&#x00F6;ldner and Dr. van Aarde. The chairman of the commission says this (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As a result of Mr. Robinson&#x2019;s comments, Prof. Du Toit had doubts whether it would be advisable to submit the report to an international scientist such as Mr. Gulland. He made Dr. Robinson&#x2019;s comments available to members of the commission. Dr. Lochner reacted strongly to Mr. Robinson&#x2019;s critical comments, and shortly afterwards, in April, 1970, informed the commission that he was no longer prepared to have his work judged through the commission by Mr. Gulland or by anyone else. He was advised by the members of the commission to have his work published so that it could be studied and judged in the customary way by the international scientific fraternity. Dr. Lochner intimated that he would do so in due course. The work has not yet been published in full, but an article published by Dr. Lochner in the edition of <i>South African Shipping News</i> of December, 1970, contained a summary in which the gist of his theory was set out. The comment which this article elicited from Mr. Gulland &#x2026;</block>

<p>And I hope the hon. member knows whom I am talking about when I refer to Mr. Gulland&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; expressed doubt about various aspects of Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s theory. After Dr. Lochner had indicated that he was no longer prepared to have his work judged through the subcommittee and had agreed to have his report published, the subcommittee regarded its task as completed and did not meet again.</block>

<p>This is the picture as far as that is concerned.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member quoted from a report in <i>Die Burger</i> of November, 1971, in order to prove that the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs had told an untruth when he said that Dr. Lochner was not prepared to have his theories tested. This was in November, 1971. A month or two before November, 1971, Dr. Lochner intimated to me that he was prepared to have his theory tested by a panel of South African scientists. In other words, he was correct in this, but the doubt which the hon. member cast on the Minister of Economic Affairs is not correct. The hon. member pointed out quite piously that Dr. Lochner laid down two requirements for his work to be judged by a panel of scientists. The first was that they should be able to understand the work and the second that they should not be interested parties. Who is going to judge whether they can understand his work&#x003F; Thus far Dr. Lochner has found that all scientists I know of, except one, do not understand his work. If a scientist does not understand Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s work, I expect him to say so in his report. He must not make other findings. In other words, all these scientists who have studied Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s work are dishonourable people, except one. Dr. Lochner himself told me that one scientist understood his work. A few days ago I received provisional comments from that scientist. Dr. Lochner is not going to be very happy about those comments. According to Dr. Lochner, this is the only person who understands his work.</p>

<p>Who is now to decide who the committee panel is to be that must judge Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s work&#x003F; It seems to me he reserves the right to himself to decide whether they understand his work, otherwise they are not competent. In spite of the fact that Dr. Lochner is a good friend of mine, I come to the conclusion that as soon as a scientist does not agree with him, that person does not understand his work and is therefore not competent to judge it. Now they say that it should not be interested parties. The hon. member referred to interested parties in the fishing industry. Dr. Lochner goes much further than that. In all fairness to Dr. Lochner I do not want to elaborate any further on that. But Dr. Lochner goes further than that. He not only demands that they should not be interested parties in the fishing industry. He goes much further.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am not going to quote, because I do not have the time for that. However, I can refer the hon. member to the relevant pages of his speech if he wants to know. These are near the end of his speech when he threw the work of our scientists out of the window and said that we should apply Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s theory. I am telling that hon. member that these people&#x2014;and I do not want to dramatize&#x2014;are literally risking their lives in order to try to obtain information on our fish resources. I, and I think the hon. member for Simonstown as well, would not be prepared to do what those people are doing by flying over the sea in a small aeroplane at night, and that off the Skeleton Coast, north of Walvis Bay. If something went wrong with that aeroplane, they would not even be able to see where they could execute an emergency landing. These people do this because they can make better observations at night. Their work is of world standard. South Africa is not behind the rest of the world. But their work is thrown out of the window. There is no doubt about that. They keep in touch with every new trend and direction in world research in this regard. As I have said, they are well-trained people. It seems as though I am losing the race against the clock.</p>

<p>Mention was made of Prof. C. A. du Toit, a person who cannot defend himself in this House. The hon. member said that if the subcommittee which had to investigate Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s theory, had accepted his theory and recommendations, the factory ships would have had to leave. This would have meant tremendous losses for the companies concerned. There is no logic in that statement. On what grounds would he have told the factory ships to leave&#x003F; They were there just as legally as the land-based factories, except where they transgressed. They were in fact there legally. On what grounds would he have told them to leave&#x003F; On what grounds does the hon. member assert here that they would have suffered tremendous losses had Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s theory, if it were right, been applied&#x003F;</p>

<p>If Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s theory were correct and if it had been applied, it would eventually have led to a profit for the factory ships. If his theory were correct, everybody concerned in the industry would have benefited. The hon. member&#x2019;s mind simply does not work well enough for him to see further than the mere implications at this moment. Furthermore, he asked: Could Prof. C. A. du Toit therefore be expected to make such a recommendation&#x003F; That is to say, a recommendation by the committee investigating Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s theory, that his theory should be accepted. Can one imagine greater stupidity&#x2014;to use that word&#x003F; If a scientist came to me, a farmer, and told me that I was making fantastic profits out of my farm today, but that he was going to prove to me that I was ruining my farm&#x2019;s production capacity so that in a few years&#x2019; time I would no longer produce, I would be a foolish farmer if I told that scientist that I rejected his advice. On the contrary, because it would be in my interests, I would say that I should like to work in accordance with his theories and experience. The same applies here to any interested party in the industry. If Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s theory were correct, it would be in their greatest interests that that theory should be applied. That is why I say that the hon. member&#x2019;s mind is working the wrong way round. He made a great issue of the face that Prof. C. A. du Toit served on the commission in addition to serving on this committee. He wanted to know whether Prof. du Toit had declared his interests in the fishing industry, as the hon. member alleges&#x2014;I do not know whether this is the position&#x2014;to the chairman of the commission. If Prof. du Toit had interests which he should have declared, he should have done so to the Minister and not to the chairman of the commission. I have had inquiries made, but I cannot find any such declaration. It may have been an oral declaration, or there may even have been no declaration at all. However, I want to say that I am not in the least interested whether Prof. du Toit has interests in the fishing industry or not, for the reasons I have mentioned. If I had had to compose that commission, my attitude would have been that I would have appointed somebody from the industry to that commission. That would have been my attitude, and it seems to me to be the correct thing to do. After all it is in the interests of Prof. du Toit, if he is an interested party, to try to save the industry and not to try to destroy it. Surely one does not think so foolishly. The hon. member <span class="col_1567-1568" refersTo="page_0801"/>spoke about the Suiderland company. He mentioned persons&#x2019; names in this regard. Suiderland has received no concessions that I know of from anyone. As far as I know, Suiderland bought its interests in the fishing industry at competitive prices. What is more, fish are not its main interest; its interests extend in other directions. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not pretend to be an expert on fishing. Therefore I do not intend to fish in the waters which the hon. the Deputy Minister has been churning up for the last 40 minutes. All I can say is that quite clearly the hon. member for Simonstown must have a pretty powerful case, because here we have the leading finance speaker launching, on behalf of the Opposition, an attack on the Government&#x2019;s financial mismanagement in a Part Appropriation debate, and the Deputy Minister of Finance gets up and talks for 40 minutes on a single industry&#x2019;s problems. Important it must be, important it is, as the hon. member for Simonstown has said. But if the hon. the Deputy Minister of Finance can go no further than that in dealing with the economic problems of South Africa as a whole, then it is no wonder that people are talking of the &#x201C;hathungry&#x201D; Senator as the hon. the Minister of Finance&#x2019;s successor and not the Deputy Minister.</p>

<p>What have we had&#x003F; The hon. member for Parktown pointed out that point after point has been raised by this side of the House and that we have had no answer from the Government on the real fundamental issues.

<p>&#x2026; he reminds me of another philosopher, also one who would probably have been classified as &#x201C;other coloured&#x201D;. That philosopher said that he used to frequent doctors and saints and heard much argument, but &#x201C;ever more came out by the same door as in he went&#x201D;. That is what it is like talking to this Government: You talk but ever you come out by the same door as in you went. I can see who the doctor was, but I do not see any saints around. The hon. the Minister is certainly not one, because in his speech yesterday he attacked me on something he alleged I had said in a former debate. Not only is the hon. the Minister not running our financial situation, but he is having hallucinations. I did not speak in the Second Reading debate, and in the former debate to which he refers I did not once refer to the subject he criticized me about; I have read my Hansard. What is it then&#x003F; Hallucination, imagination, or credibility gap&#x003F; That is the sort of answer you get, namely an attack on something which was not even said. The arguments of the Government are like the hon. member for Waterberg who goes round and round in ever-decreasing circles&#x2014;like a certain bird; but the trouble is that it does not disappear. What the people want is for it to reach the disappearing point, because quite clearly on financial issues, it does not have any direction.</p>

<p>I happened to look at what happened in another country which had economic troubles. It was interesting to read President Nixon&#x2019;s address on the fight against inflation delivered in October last year. In this address you find that he announced a policy to create half a million new jobs within one year. He announced the price-wage freeze&#x2014;with which we do not agree, but at least it was positive action. He established a cost-of-living council. He appointed a Government committee on interest and dividends. He appointed a pay board to stop inflationary increases. He took steps to ensure that there would be reasonable profits and said that &#x201C;more profits fuel the expansion that generates more jobs&#x201D;. This is positive. He said very clearly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have lived too long in this country with an inflation psychology. Everybody just assumes the only direcion for prices to go is up.</block>

<p>That is this Government. He continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The time has come for some price reduction psychology. It is not only in the public interest, but it makes good competitive business sense.</block>

<p>That is the approach of another country towards its problems. Here it is just accepted that prices must go up and up.</p>

<p>What do we get from this Cabinet&#x003F; We find the hon. the Minister of the Interior <span class="col_1569-1570" refersTo="page_0802"/>saying&#x2014;and I am not quoting from a United Party source, but from <i>Volkshandel</i> of January, 1972, i.e. last month&#x2014;</p>

Of course we had the hon. the Minister of Immigration and Social Welfare and Pensions and the hon. the Minister of Labour repudiating him immediately.

The hon. the Prime Minister has his own garage; he can drive in and the doors close behind him. He also has a private lift up to the top. We do not all have private lifts and huge offices. When we talk about living high, we are talking about the average South African citizen. I want to see what is happening to the average citizen. I ask hon. members on the Government side to take a walk with me to meet ordinary people. I ask the Ministers to take a walk with me to meet ordinary people because I do not know when they last met an ordinary housewife. The hon. the Minister of the Interior, in an article in the <i>South African Digest,</i> said that we were the lowesttaxed country out of the 15 most important countries of the world and he gave figures. He also says we are the highest paid and he quotes examples. He also says that the cost of living is the slowest-growing amongst a whole list of countries. I want to look at this Garden of Eden in which we live, and which the hon. the Minister says has all these wonderful things.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs also made his contribution. He says &#x201C;Pryse word fyn dopgehou. Di&#x00E9; versekering het die Minister van Ekonomiese Sake gisteraand aan <i>Die Transvaler</i> gegee&#x201D;. So we have some Ministers saying that we are living too high, another that taxes are the lowest and another that prices are being watched. They are being watched, but they are having to use more powerful telescopes to keep them in view. I have done a little investigation in regard to these taxes the hon. the Minister of Finance talks about, and they do not tell you that these taxes apply in countries with automatic unemployment insurance, with state medical health schemes, with automatic old-age pensions not based on means tests, and so on. They do not tell you that on the Order Paper are three proposals for a new kind of hidden taxation. They are now called &#x201C;contributions&#x201D; instead of taxes. You have contributions from employers, contributions for transport, contributions from housewives, contributions for Coloured transport, contributions for Indian transport subsidies, and a contribution towards road safety. You have contribution after contribution that does not appear in these taxes. We do not get all these benefits. By the time you have taken off medical aid, unemployment insurance and the rest, and added it to the taxation, and then you look at a man&#x2019;s salary you have a very different comparison when you compare it with the salary and taxes of a man in an overseas country. Then they tell us we must not worry.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Finance made great play in his speech yesterday of the wonderful position of the pensioner. He talked of the pensioner whose pension has gone up from R12 to R38, an increase of 220 per cent, and said that the rand has only dropped in value by 55 per cent, namely from R1 to 45 cents. Then he does another calculation with percentages and suddenly finds that the buying power of the rand has dropped by 220 per cent, but the pension has gone up by 320 per cent. Now I am not a very great expert at percentages. I do not pretend to understand these things very well. I understand simple figures, and I understand that the pensioner must have a roof over his head. He has to live somewhere; I understand that a person who has to bring up a family needs a house to live in; I understand that a house which 30 odd years ago cost, say, &#x00A3;4 000 is now worth R18 000 or R20 000; I do not understand what the percentage is, but I know it would cost twice as much. I know that if I wanted to build my own house now, it would cost twice as much as the &#x00A3;4 000 I paid for it in 1951. I have been offered it.</p>

<p>Good profit, but if I let it I would let it for twice as much. If I wanted to rent a house, I would have to pay twice as much or more than I paid in 1948. Mr. Speaker, I do not understand this 55 per cent drop in the value of the pensioner&#x2019;s money and the 220 per cent increase. I just understand that a house, flat or room costs two to three times as much. The result is that he has to move down and down the ladder of quality of accommodation until today the pensioner with no family to help him is living in a hovel, in a back room somewhere. He cannot find a place which he can afford out of R38. Then that pensioner has to eat. Unless he goes on a banana diet, which is the only item I can find which went down in price recently, he is going to pay far more than any increase in pension he has had. It is not only the pensioner who is affected; it is everyone.</p>

<p>I have here figures, from the <i>Bulletin on Statistics</i> for the last 50 years, which gives a comparison of certain essential items. Bread in 1948, when this Government took <span class="col_1573-1574" refersTo="page_0804"/>over the bankrupt U.P. State, cost 3&#x00BD; cent for 1 lb. Today it costs 11 cent for a 2-lb. loaf, thus an increase from 7 cents to 11 cents. That is a staple food which the Government subsidizes but it has just gone up. A 25 lb. bag of flour has gone up from 88,7 cents to 167,8 cents. That to me makes an increase of 100 per cent in any language, whether I understand it or not. It is twice as much.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I am quoting the figures for 1948 and August, 1971, from the <i>Bulletin on Statistics</i> for the last 50 years, of December, 1971. Rice was 8,1 cents per lb. It is now 17,1 for 500 gr. That to me is double. I cannot work it out in any other way according to the arithmetic I learnt at school. I did not learn the new mathematics, which apparently the Minister uses. Rump steak was 22,3 cents per lb; now it is 61 cents per lb&#x2014;nearly three times as much. Sirloin was 15,5 cents per lb; now it costs 47 cents per lb&#x2014;more than three times as much. Leg of mutton has gone up from 14,8 cents to 46,1 cents per lb. The Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs has gone now, but I will tell him something fishy. Fish has gone up from 8,1 cents per lb. to 26,4 cents per lb&#x2014; more than three times as much. The price of milk varies in different places, but apart from having gone up according to the official statistics from 4,8 cents to 7,8 cents per pint, when they metricated and we were provided with a dirty, plastic pollution container which you can never destroy, there was an increase in the price of milk over and above the net increase itself. So, you not only got a plastic container, but you have to pay more for both the container and the milk. Butter has gone up from 30 cents per lb. to 51,6 cents. Our imported butter landed here at 25 cents per lb. but butter has gone up, as I say, from 30 cents per lb. to 51 cents. I shall not go through all these items, but here are a few more: The cost of coffee increased from 27,9 cents to 57 cents for 500 grams. Jam increased from 18 cents to 33 cents, and coal from 21 cents to 70 cents for 100 lbs.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, soap has remained the same. It was 8,6 cents per lb, and it is now 15,2 cents per kg, so it is roughly the same. But then soap is used only by those who want to keep clean. It therefore does not make all that much difference to those who do not really appreciate its value. One could go on naming these items. Here are two more: petrol and floor polish, and then the hon. the Minister says: &#x201C;Yes, but they are getting 220 per cent more than what they were paid then&#x201D;. But this is what they have to pay if they want to eat, unless they go on a banana diet. Hardly any of these items has increased by less than a hundred to 200 per cent. In the case of only one of these items I have mentioned has the price remained roughly the same. And so you have the picture regarding the problem of eating.</p>

<p>But then a person must travel. The cost of public transport in the last year has gone up by 8,3 per cent alone. Taxi fares have increased, in the last year alone, by 60 per cent. The cost of cars, because of local content requirements, has increased by R70 to R120. Sales tax has meant another 5 per cent on to the price and devaluation has meant another increase of 14-odd per cent. Repairs have gone up from R4 to R6 per hour; tyres have gone up R5 per set. Parking in the bigger towns has nearly doubled. Car insurance has been increased by 20 per cent. All this has happened in one year. And then they say, as this headline puts it; &#x201C;Pryse fyn dopgehou&#x201D;. They may be watching the prices, Sir, but they do not do much about it.</p>

<p>Then we come to clothes. Suits have gone up by between R5 and R10 during the last year, and dresses R3. I wonder if any of these members had to uniform a child going to boarding school for the first time last month. The cost of a child&#x2019;s school uniform is more than double what it was five years ago. A simple little dress costs R7. To outfit a child going to school today with uniforms will cost you R200 or more.</p>

<p>Mine is a Government school, as it happens. Then we come to medical costs, Sir. I know my hon. friend here will not like me saying this, but I think the increase in medical costs in South Africa is an absolute scandal. I am speaking not only of the cost of medical treatment, but of medicines and all things associated with it. Here is an example I know about, because I had to pay the account. To have three teeth removed by a dental specialist costs R70 for the extraction alone. These were three impacted wisdom teeth. This used to be a simple operation which cost you R10 or R15.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, Sir, that member is one of those who charges R70; I am one of those who has to pay. We try to cover ourselves with medical aid but you cannot get medical aid for under R20 to R25 a month if you want any sort of decent coverage for your family. It costs you R250 a year, and then you still have to pay your excess.</p>

<p>Then there are all the other simple day-to-day costs, such as haircuts. And as for holidays! Anybody trying to take a family on holiday and living in a hotel must be a Nationalist Cabinet Minister. He could not be anything else and be able to afford it. And then, Sir, they say we must have productivity: but mothers must go out to work, and then the Minister of Bantu Administration says they must have babies. The Deputy Minister says they must not have servants, and the Minister of Finance taxes them for what they earn. This is the situation in which this Government has landed mothers. When we talk about these things in a financial debate, when we raise these issues that affect every South African citizen, we find the Government talking about &#x201C;Kommunisme&#x201D;, &#x201C;die Rooi gevaar&#x201D; and &#x201C;die Swart gevaar&#x201D;&#x2014;red herrings and any sort of smokescreen&#x2014;so long as they do not have to talk about the cost of living and the burden of the ordinary South African. Is it any wonder that you get the bouncing member for Mayfair bubbling back and forth out of pure frustration with a Government which he admits does not care a jot for the ordinary citizen and his ordinary day-to-day problems. This Government, Sir, has forgotten the problems of the people. It used to know them; it used to care about people years ago, but it has forgotten what it is like to be an ordinary citizen without the privileges of power. But the people have not forgotten and will not forget this Government&#x2019;s attitude, and I say that the days are past when you could bluff the people with &#x201C;Rooi gevaar&#x201D; and &#x201C;swart gevaar&#x201D; and &#x201C;geel gevaar&#x201D; and ignore their problem of paying their ordinary accounts at the end of the month. Sir, we on this side of the House will continue to deal with these problems. We will continue to fight and we will continue to refuse to be diverted by red herrings and by the lack of concern of the people who have been elected to power, ostensibly to look after the electorate but who, when they come here, show no concern at all for the way the people have to suffer. One can give example after example of the problems which people have to face. The hon. the Minister of the Interior referred to it when he mentioned the rising number of insolvencies, but he blamed it on living too high. Sir, that is not the reason. People do not get into debt because they want to. People do not fail to pay for things and get sued and have Judgments taken against them because they like it; they do not pay their debts because they cannot afford to maintain the standard of living to which they are entitled. We on this side of the House do not believe that South Africans on the whole are living too high. We believe that we must raise the standards of the non-Whites and that we must close the gap, but as we do that, so the standard of living of the White South Africans can rise as well, and we reject completely the philosophy of living too high and we reject the philosophy of the hon. the Minister of the Interior that people should not be entitled to wage increases because they do not justify those increases. We believe in a better South Africa, a better and a higher standard of living and respect for the problems of ordinary people.</p>

<p>I listened with amazement to the hon. member for Durban Point. He carried on here about the black peril and the yellow peril, and while I was listening to him I thought of the fat peril before me. The hon. member <span class="col_1577-1578" refersTo="page_0806"/>made a tremendous fuss about the price increases taking place under this National Government. One thing I am glad about, and that is that at least the price increase does not nearly equal the hon. member&#x2019;s increase in weight since the National Party took over power. The hon. member made a great fuss here about pensions. The hon. member said he was no economist and that he did not understand much about figures either; he therefore does things by simple arithmetic. It is very clear to me that he does things by very simple arithmetic, because you see, Sir, the problem with those hon. members is that they take a figure, and because they are not good at figures they wrench it out of context and try to establish a false truth; they try to give the voters a wrong impression. That hon. member made another mistake today. The speech he should have made at Brakpan tomorrow night he made here today. Sir, when they were in power the pensioners drew R12 per month.</p>

<p>Yes, let us make it R10. Under this Government the figure is R38. Now the hon. member for Durban Point says that because the rand is now worth 45 cents, in comparison with what it was worth in 1948, When the United Party was in power, the present day pensioner receives less in terms of the value of money in 1948.</p>

<p>I claim they get more. If the rand&#x2019;s present day value is 45 per cent of its value in 1948, and one takes 45 per cent of R38, it means that in real terms the pensioner is today receiving R17,10 as against the R10 he received under United Party rule. In other words, under National Party rule the pensioner receives virtually double the amount he received under United Party rule. The United Party gave him R10, and expressed in terms of the monetary value of that time he gets R17,10 today. I therefore say that that hon. member is guilty of a blatant untruth when he states that in this House with a view to the Brakpan by-election.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should not like to repeat the history of the hon. member for Durban Point now. These days there is quite a bit of talk about the question of communism. This party repeatedly levels at us the accusation that we accuse them of allegedly aiding the communists. I should like to read to those hon. members what Mr. Marais Steyn said in November, 1947. This is an article he wrote in the official newsletter of the United Party when he was General Secretary of that party. In November, 1947. Mr. Marais Steyn wrote as follows in this official circular&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It may be pointed out that the Government of the Union is by no means turning a blind eye to the activities of the Communist Party. Neither does it minimize its danger. Unfortunately the Communist Party in South Africa enjoys a unique position in so far that it is able to shield itself behind the skirts of Havenga&#x2019;s Ossewabrandwag &#x2026;</block>

<p>These are now the communists&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; Die Broederbond and the Nationalist Party. The Communist Party leaders know that the Government is faced with movements &#x2026; posing as &#x201C;cultural&#x201D; societies and &#x201C;official oppositions&#x201D;, and that it is difficult for it (the Government) to take action against one without taking similar action against the others.</block>

<p>We have reached the paradoxical position in South Africa that every movement seeking to destroy democratic practice is claiming the protection of democracy so that it can carry on its subversive acts.</p>

<p>We shall remember that accusation. We shall possibly come back to that at a later stage.</p>

<p>I now want to return to the question of the economy in general. The Opposition speakers voiced a lament here, particularly the hon. members for Parktown and Durban Point, who compel one to say that Jeremiah was a reckless opportunist and optimist. These people are now trying to create a psychosis about how bad the position in South Africa is and how we are supposedly struggling as a result of the policy of this Government.

<block name="quote">In Europe there is generally speaking signs of stagnation and loss of profitability, especially such as in the German industries. Italy&#x2019;s position is bad with expectations of no economic growth for the immediate future and with large-scale unemployment.

<p>We can even go a little further. I just want to mention to hon. members what they say about the United States&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is said that whenever average unemployment amounts to about 6 per cent the corresponding percentage among the Negroes amounts to about five times that, a very explosive situation.</block>

<p>We can go further and look at Japan&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At the moment, however, a very severe setback is admitted. Japan&#x2019;s economic growth rate for the fiscal year 1971 is now estimated at 5,3 per cent. It is now about half the initial estimate of 10 per cent and as one economist put it, very few people can get as pessimistic as the Japanese. When they become pessimistic, they become almost neurotic and lose their sense of proportion &#x2026;</block>

<p>Oh, if the hon. member could just contain his curiosity! The person who wrote this article is now the crown prince amongst the economists on that side of the House, the person they so fondly quote, i.e. Mr. Jan S. Marais. What is going on at present is that the United Party, and particularly the hon. member for Durban Point, who was unsuccessful today, is talking the economy to death. They are letting people believe that the cost of living is increasing more rapidly than their incomes and so creating such a spirit of pessimism as far as the economy is concerned in order to scare industrialists and investors. They hope for an economic recession, as the hon. member for Parktown called it. I regard this as flagrant irresponsibility in this House, coming as it does from a man occupying his position in the Opposition. I think that if he speaks about such matters he is being disloyal to his country and to the economy of his country. I want to go further. There is an hon. member on that side of the House&#x2014;he is unfortunately not present at the moment&#x2014;who also made a very great fuss about economic conditions and made claims that he could not substantiate in this House. He is telling the people how they are supposedly struggling. The person is the hon. member for Von Brandis. I just want to quote the hon. member for Von Brandis&#x2019; irresponsible utterances. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I believe that immigration is dropping and I have been told in my own constituency why that is so. In my constituency there is a great many immigrants because this is the nearest stop to Jan Smuts airport where they arrive. These young Italians, Frenchmen, Germans and others who are there, tell me that they are going home and that they are going to advise their friends not to come here. When I ask why this is so, they say it is because when they came to South Africa they did so in the belief that they could enjoy a higher standard of living in South Africa for less money <span class="col_1583-1584" refersTo="page_0809"/>than in Italy or Germany, but that they have been on a holiday since then and they now know that with our cost of living they can live better in Europe than they can live in South Africa on the same money. This is why they are going home and that is what this Government&#x2019;s economic policy is doing to immigration.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Von Brandis made the allegation here that with the same incomes people live better in Europe, particularly in Italy, Germany and France, than here in South Africa, and therefore we allegedly cannot get immigrants.</p>

<p>Oh, Mr. Speaker, let that hon. member experience a moment of lucidity. He does not even understand what I read here. The hon. member said he agrees with those people. He makes an allegation and says: &#x201C;That is why they are going home and that is what this Government&#x2019;s economic policy is doing to immigration.&#x201D; In other words, he says they are correct on that point.</p>

<p>Let us look at what the position is in the various countries of the world and at how their standard of living compares with that in South Africa. There are many norms one could measure it against. But when we quote figures here or, to use the hon. member for Von Brandis&#x2019; words, we quote &#x201C;carefully selected statistics&#x201D;, hon. members opposite say that we are trying to substantiate untruths, as the hon. member for Von Brandis puts it. The hon. member tried to make us believe how cheap life in these other countries is. <b>I</b> have here a survey carried out by a source that I do not believe those hon. members will doubt, i.e. the London newspaper, the <i>Financial Times</i> of 13th December of last year. That is just the other day. The <i>Financial Times</i> carried out a survey in various large cities of the world and expressed the value of certain items in terms of American dollars. According to the survey a basket of food, consisting of meat, etc., costs $18-47 in Johannesburg. The hon. member for Von Brandis said that with the same amount of money one could live better in Europe than in South Africa. That same basket of food costs 26 dollars in D&#x00FC;sseldorf, Germany, as against 18 dollars in Johannesburg. In Rome it costs 28 dollars and it costs 25 dollars in Paris. Those are the countries where, as the hon. member for Von Brandis claims, one can live better than here in South Africa with the same amount of money. Let us look at the other items according to which one&#x2019;s standard of living can be determined. Let us take, for example, men&#x2019;s clothes, which the hon. member for Durban Point, who is not in the House at present, made such a fuss about. Clothes, for example a suit of clothes, costs 102 American dollars in Johannesburg. In Rome, the place where one can supposedly live cheaper, a suit of clothes costs 135 dollars. In D&#x00FC;sseldorf in Germany it costs 164 dollars and in Paris one pays 183 dollars for those same clothes. There are still other factors one can compare. Take women&#x2019;s clothes for example. In Johannesburg a certain item of ladies&#x2019; clothing costs 39 dollars, in D&#x00FC;sseldorf it costs 60 dollars, in Rome 83 dollars and in Paris 85 dollars. Hon. members on that side of the House claim that the standard of living in South Africa is on the decline. Let us look at what it will cost if four persons go out of an evening. In Johannesburg it costs 76 American dollars.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House expresses its appreciation for the manner in which the Government has dealt with the agricultural industry over the past years.</block>

<p><span class="col_1585-1586" refersTo="page_0810"/>To judge from the reaction of the Opposition when I gave notice of this motion, I am afraid that we on this side of the House are not going to get a very positive contribution or constructive criticism this afternoon. It occurred to me that when this House expresses its appreciation of the Government&#x2019;s agricultural policy, of what it has accomplished, and of the objects and activities of the various Government Departments dealing with agriculture, it would serve a useful purpose to furnish an outline of what is being done and what has been achieved with the large amounts of money which are appropriated annually in this House in the interests of agriculture. Because Government spending is a topical point of discussion in the present economic situation, financial assistance to the agricultural industry is often regarded critically by those in other sectors. In truth this is nothing strange. Because of the scanty news value which agriculture has we find on the one hand that the image people have of practising farmers is that such farmers are either potato kings, wheat kings, apple kings, or something of that nature, that the farmer sits on his porch drinking coffee, that his pretty wife is busying herself inside arranging flowers which she picked herself in her beautiful garden, and that she follows this up by bathing in a gilded bath; or on the other hand the image is one of decrepitude and backwardness, of a man standing next to a dam with cracks in its base, and with skeletons of animals lying strewn around. These distorted images which some people have, that the farmer is either a plodder or a wastrel who comes to the Government with empty hands in times of emergency to beg for alms, does neither the agriculture nor the country as a whole any good.</p>

<p>With the introduction of this motion I thought I would sketch a more balanced image for people of the farmer and of the importance of the agricultural industry in the country. That there should be a sound relationship between farmer and city-dweller I probably need not emphasize here. Those good relationships do not exist in all the countries of the world. We are rather fortunate in that respect. In the interests of South Africa it is quite imperative that those good relationships should exist. In fact, it is important for any country in the world that its agricultural sector, as purveyor of the basic and indispensible means of subsistence, should flourish. Consequently it is the duty of the State to ensure that that delicate balance between the various sectors is not disturbed. That is why I should like to emphasize the mutual dependence of the agricultural industry and commerce and industry, of the farmer and the consumer, and of the agricultural sectors and all the other sectors which comprise the South African national economy.</p>

<p>Land is indispensible to the farmer as a production factor. The land which is owned by the farmer in South Africa today does not belong only to the present generation. The farmer acts only as a guardian, as it were, to maintain and to preserve for generations still to come the most important asset of the fatherland, i.e. the land. This Government is attempting to bring home this point of view to the entire population, to cultivate a love for the land and to inculcate loyalty to the South African soil. I want to allege today that these attempts&#x2014;and now I am thinking in particular of the land service movement&#x2014;of the Government are succeeding and I should like to express the appreciation of this House for that.</p>

<p>Under South African circumstances the protection of the soil is an ambitious and a great task, too great for the farmer to tackle on his own. The gradual progress which we have made is now beginning to assume spectacular proportions, and we are grateful for that. When calamitous droughts and floods hamper progress and make relief measures necessary, the entire population has in the past contributed willingly, and there have never been any objections, even when it came from taxation. We appreciate this and would like to convey our gratitude to the non-farming sectors of our population. Emergency aid and normal State aid to agriculture is essential to maintain this industry and to protect and expand it. Such assistance is justified on the grounds that the agriculture is also a primary and a key industry. Food and clothing is derived primarily from the soil and in the national economy primary needs must receive top priority. That is why we have appreciation for Government attempts to support the various sectors where this showed itself to be necessary.</p>

<p>I should like to mention a few examples in this connection. If it becomes necessary to bring the products of the farmer to the market at a reasonable price for the consumer, this Government has never hesitated <span class="col_1587-1588" refersTo="page_0811"/>to introduce low tariffs for the transportation of those products on the Railways. If the farmer&#x2019;s production costs become too high, this Government has never hesitated to introduce a subsidy to make fertilizer, for example, available to him more cheaply. When bread and butter became too expensive for the consumer, this Government has never hesitated to subsidize these primary means of subsistence in order to make it cheaper for the consumer. Through its policy of subsidization the Government has now succeeded in preserving the essential balance between the farmer and the consumer. This we appreciate, not only in principle, but also for the way in which it was carried out.</p>

<p>The agricultural industry in South Africa is relatively more important to the national economy than is the case in other countries. The principal reason for this is that South Africa, measured against the major countries of the world, is relatively poor in agricultural potential. As far as our surface area is concerned, we have 122 million hectares, of which only approximately 12 million hectare are suitable for cultivation. That is only 10 per cent, and if we compare it to a country such as America, one cannot help feeling a little envious, for America holds approximately 40 per cent of its agricultural land in reserve. As to climate, South Africa falls outside the high rainfall belts of the world, and the agricultural industry is of course subjected to inadequate and unpredictable rainfall. Periodic and calamitous droughts form a natural part of the farmer&#x2019;s lot in South Africa.</p>

<p>Attendant upon this the limited water resources are an only too well-known factor, which retards growth even outside the agricultural sector. From the nature of our climate we must accept that periodic problems with surpluses and shortages will and must occur. It is the task of the government of the day to cope with these problems, and to do so in a way which will serve the best interests of South Africa. I think that even the Opposition would agree with me that the National Party Ministers have in the past accomplished this task in a very excellent way; to such an extent that there is nothing to which they can refer back today. Because farming in South Africa is practised under strenuous natural circumstances it has from one generation to another produced human material that would have been a credit to any country. We can be proud of our farming population and look back with pride, for the farmers of South Africa have never let the country down.</p>

<p>Well, they did let the Opposition down a little. What is more, young men and women have emerged from this industry who rendered meritorious services to other sectors of the national economy. To mention only one example, and this is to come a little closer, with the exception of Dr. Verwoerd all our premiers since Union in 1910 up to the present day have all been young men who grew up on a farm; what is even more interesting, is that the National Party premiers had so much confidence in the farming M.P.s that not one M.P. who was made a Minister was not a farmer. I am discussing agriculture now. They were made Ministers on the basis of the knowledge they had, in their own right, of agriculture. This is something to appreciate, because if I think back to about 23 to 24 years ago, there was an advocate Minister of Agriculture, Adv. J. G. N. Strauss.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, he was a man of promises. When I think of what happened here yesterday, I feel that the hon. member for Musgrave, Mr. Hourquebie, might be an aspirant Minister of Agriculture in future. He should just hold on for a while. His chances are not too bad.</p>

<p>While I am on the subject of the Cabinet, I want to point out that this Government considers the agricultural industry to be very important. The Government has expanded its services to agriculture to such an extent that this comprises five departments today. Let me mention them: Agricultural Technical Services, Agricultural Economy and Marketing, Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure, Water Affairs and Forestry. At the head of these departments stand no less than two full-fledged Ministers and one Deputy Minister. I can well remember how the gentlemen on the other side objected and said that two Ministers of Agriculture were too many. The farmers of South Africa perceive this consideration shown to them and appreciate it. They are particularly pleased with the present Ministers we have. At this juncture I should like <span class="col_1589-1590" refersTo="page_0812"/>to break a lance, or pay tribute. Do hon. members realize that our present Minister of Agriculture, Minister Uys, has at present been occupying this post for 14 years now&#x003F; If we cast our minds back a little and consider the National Party Government over the years, we will recall that the former Minister of Agriculture, Minister S. P. le Roux, served this country in that capacity for 10 years. If we go back even further we also think of General Kemp who was Minister for 11 years. Then the other side of the House could probably claim a small share. I definitely think that the present Government of this country looks after the interests of the farmer and that its deeds speak to us from the past as well.</p>

<p>Under the guidance of the present Minister of Agriculture the various departments have developed to such an extent that the services of the departments such as research, information, training, marketing, financing and administration, and the laws are so unrecognizable to those who were in power in or prior to 1948 that they could never have dreamed of anything like this. What is more, a small country like South Africa can boast of services which compare favourably with those in major agricultural countries like France. Just think, Sir, this country of ours has five faculties of agriculture at four universities. Then I am not even including the Department of Forestry at Stellenbosch and the various faculties of water affairs, which also, in part, serve agriculture.</p>

<p>To indicate to members the progress made in this sphere, I can by way of summary present this picture: In 1950 there were only two faculties of agriculture, and in 1971 there were five. The number of agricultural colleges remained almost constant. In 1955 there were five agricultural colleges; in the meantime another one has been established and we now have six, but these agricultural colleges have almost doubled in size. The number of agricultural research stations in 1958 was 16. This is not even so far back that those hon. members can accept responsibility for it. Today there are 21 of them. In 1958 there were 21 experimental farms, and now there are 37. Since 1947 these facilities have more than doubled. The farmers of this country appreciate those facilities, and now I want to put this question: Will we, together with the Opposition, fail to testify to what has been done&#x003F;</p>

<p>Sir, time does not allow me to say much more; I just want to mention the tremendous progress in respect of institutes. No fewer than 11 specialized institutes have in the meantime been established, and they are today rendering valuable services. In addition I just want to point out the tremendous progress which has been made in the field of water affairs. If we ascribe to the United Party everything which has been done in this sphere from the time of Jan van Riebeeck up to 1952 then this Government has during the past two decades still done more than was done during that period of 300 years. What is more, 80 per cent of this water is being utilized by agriculture.</p>

<p>Because my time is very limited, I just want to refer briefly to a few other matters. Those who support me in this motion will elaborate further on these matters. What have the farmers obtained as a result of this development&#x003F; This is important, because everything which happened in agriculture and in the department, ultimately revolves around production, and what benefit the farmer derives from that. In 1970 approximately 90 000 farmers in the Republic had a total capital investment of R6 690 million. They employed 1,6 million employees and they contributed R1 316 million to the gross domestic product. In 1970 they exported goods to the value of R431 million. This was truly an achievement, because it was almost a third of our total exports. I could also mention in passing the importance of the farmers as consumers. It amounts to millions of rand. Let us compare the gross value of agricultural production to what it was previously. In 1950 it was R235 million, and in 1971 R1 150 million. This is truly an achievement; the farmers have made use of the knowledge and facilities which have been placed at their disposal. Sir, what I find very interesting is that it appears from the third report of the commission which was laid upon the Table yesterday that in 1947 a farmer was earning R1 179 per annum; in the year 1970 the average South African farmer was earning R6 108. Sir, this is truly an achievement for the farmers; I admit it, but everything revolves around the farmer and therefore this Government is throwing everything into its efforts to support the farmer.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I cannot refer to the prosperity which is prevailing in the country today as a result of the fine crops we have had because I must conclude, but I just want to say that the farmers of South Africa are in the first place grateful for this <span class="col_1591-1592" refersTo="page_0813"/>good year we have experienced and for the good years which lie ahead for us, and that they acknowledge the blessings of the Almighty in this regard. In the second place the farmers, both National Party and United Party, admit that this Government has stretched out its hand to the farmers in times of emergency as never before, and as no other Government has ever done before. For this we want to thank this Government. We are also grateful to the rest of the country which makes it possible for us to help the farmers. Unfortunately the hon. members on that side have disappointed the farmers and have not made their contribution in this regard. Sir, the farmer knows that he may trust this Government in future to assist him so that he may rehabilitate himself, and so that he may in future devote himself to his great task independently and honestly.</p>

<p>His own newspaper says that the hon. the Minister who is responsible for this department carries a burden of shame as a result of his actions in the Agliotti case. His own newspaper, <i>Die Burger,</i> tells him that he should make the greatest sacrifice, and <i>Rapport</i> simply told him straight out that he should resign. That hon. member spoke about five departments that had been established and about the amount of money that had been spent. But how are these departments being administered. I quote from the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> of 24th August&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A senior official of the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure has made a profit of R35 000 after successfully tendering for a Government farm for R39 000. He got a full Land Bank loan.</block>

<p>However, what is peculiar about the whole matter is that when he was asked whether he did not see anything wrong in this transaction, he said: &#x201C;It is common practice; it is done in the Land Bank, too. It is common practice in this department&#x201D;. Then we also had the case of the Director of Lands in South-West Africa, Mr. Strauss, who simply sold a Government farm to himself for R8 000, a farm which had such a high valuation that the Trust Bank held a mortgage of R20 000 on it. And, when he was asked about it, he saw nothing wrong in what he had done. He said it had happened many times before; &#x201C;it is common practice; it is general practice&#x201D; in the department. This is the way in which the department is administered. But then the hon. member went further and said he was so grateful because this Government was, allegedly, looking after the soil of South Africa. How did they look after the soil&#x003F; According to Dr. Ross, the former Director of Soil Conservation&#x2014;the hon. members know so little about soil conservation that they will not even know who he is&#x2014;400 million tons of <span class="col_1593-1594" refersTo="page_0814"/>soil is carried down to the sea every year, 100 million tons more than in 1948. [Laughter.] It amazes me that hon. members are laughing. Does the Minister also find it funny when the soil is being carried down to the sea&#x003F; Twenty-five per cent of our top-soil has been destroyed, but the hon. the Minister laughs about it. Does the Minister know what this means&#x003F; It means that we are losing R400 million&#x2019;s worth of phosphate, R50 million&#x2019;s worth of nitrogen and R300 million&#x2019;s worth of calcium. And then the hon. the Minister laughs. Instead of his appointing officials and saving the soil of South Africa, he laughs. The hon. member said we should save the soil. Sir, do you know what this Government spends on soil protection, on soil conservation&#x003F; Last year R5,5 million was spent out of a budget of R3 000 million.</p>

<p>Not the officials. I mentioned what was paid out as subsidies for soil conservation. You may as well include the officials. Do you know what this means, Sir&#x003F; This is only 0,18 per cent of the Budget; the hon. the Minister spent 0,18 per cent on soil conservation. That is what he thinks of the soil, of the land&#x2014;0,04 per cent of our national income. That is what is being spent on soil conservation, and then that hon. member is so grateful that we spend 0,04 per cent of our national income on it. Instead of appointing people to apply soil conservation, they went and held a Festival of the Soil a few years ago. Then the children had to run down to the sea with sand in order to throw more sand into the sea. Why did they hold a festival&#x003F; Did they hold a festival because 100 million additional tons of soil was going down to the sea&#x003F; It should not have been a festival of the soil; it should have been a memorial service for what this Government is doing to the soil of South Africa. Let us take a look at what a director of soil conservation, Mr. J. P. van der Merwe, has to say. I do not have his precise words here now, but he said that approximately R20 per farm was being spent on soil conservation. This was not even the amount spent on liquor or tobacco, he said. That is what the hon. the Minister thinks of soil conservation, and that hon. member is so grateful for it.</p>

That is how little he knows about soil conservation. Mr. J. P. van der Merwe said the following about this scheme (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is a very good thing that the stock reduction scheme has been introduced because continuous over-grazing of the veld is the main reason for most of the erosion problems and man-made droughts. The only pity is that the principles contained therein, as advocated plus-minus ten years ago, were rejected by the same organizations.</block>

<p>But the hon. the Minister is making such a noise that I have to speak loudly in order to be heard. How is this fine scheme being applied by the Government&#x003F; How has the scheme been applied since it was devised&#x003F; I have requested certain figures. I asked the Minister for the rainfall figures. He could not give them to me but I got them from the Department of Transport. I asked what the carrying capacity of various districts was. The carrying capacity of Phillipstown was fixed at 2&#x00BD; morgen per sheep, or 2,14 ha per sheep, but the rainfall is 328,9 mm. But Klipplaat, at Jansenville, has a carrying capacity of 2 morgen per sheep, and its rainfall is only 235 mm. Then we come to Jansenville, which is also in the constituency of the hon. member for Graaff-Reinet. There the carrying capacity is 2 morgen per sheep or 1,71 ha per sheep, and its rainfall is only 266 mm. Then there is De Aar with a carrying capacity of 1 in 3 and the rainfall is 286,5 mm; Britstown, 1 in 3, and the rainfall 264,5 mm. Then there is Colesberg with 1,71 sheep per ha and a rainfall of 392,6. We have Luckhoff with 1,71 and a rainfall of 384,3. Just look at how this is being applied. We have a district such as Phillipstown which gets 103 mm more rain, or 44 per cent more than Klipplaat, but its carrying capacity has been fixed at 25 per cent lower than that of Klipplaat. How does this work&#x003F; Do you know what 25 per cent means&#x003F; It means 250 per 1 000. Therefore, if a farmer has 4 000 sheep, it means that he must keep 1 000 fewer sheep in Phillipstown than in Klipplaat or Jansenville.</p>

This is the case, in the first instance, because the price which the farmers get for their produce does not keep pace with the increase in the price of their requirements. That is the reason. The reason why they do not get a decent price for their produce is, in the first instance, because there is no marketing system. Unfortunately I do not have the time to go into the marketing system today, but just look at the meat position. Just look at the meat prices. Every week 40 000 sheep are loaded, but they have to wait a week because there are no slaughtering facilities in the country. Moreover, one week the price is high and the next it is low, while the consumers always have to pay the higher prices. Does this Government want to tell me that they have never been able to work out a marketing system with all these crowds of officials that hon. member mentioned&#x003F; Have they been able to work out a meat scheme&#x003F; Surely there are 101 or 110 ways of solving this.

There is no distribution; there is no method. Surely this can be worked out in this age of the computer. What about production costs&#x003F; What is the main cause of farmers landing themselves in this position&#x003F; It is the high rates of interest which caused this, and who was responsible for them&#x003F; That Government was responsible for them. That Government is responsible for the high rail tariffs. The divisional council taxes of the Cape Farmer amount to more than his income tax today. Whose fault is that&#x003F; It is the Government&#x2019;s fault. As for the few farmers who can still carry on, those 16 per cent who still have something, that side of the House is making certain that when these farmers die their children will have nothing as a result of the fact that they have to buy back the land from the Government in the form of estate duty, at a price twice as high as the one their fathers paid for that land.

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think the less one reacts to what was said by this hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town, the better. To my mind the irresponsibility displayed by him, is proved clearly by the one statement he made here, i.e. that the leaders of the farmers of South Africa are sitting there today because they were elected for political considerations.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. S. HAYWARD</person>:</from>

<p>No, the hon. member said that the leaders of the farmers in South Africa &#x2026; [Interjections.] I shall quote that hon. member in the interior, and I shall say he said that the leaders of the farmers of South Africa were elected for political considerations. I shall quote that hon. member wherever I may find myself.</p>

<p>However, I just want to pause briefly at a few matters that were touched upon by the hon. member, for I think the less one says about them, the better. He referred to soil conservation and to the amount of soil being washed out to sea. In a dramatic manner he quoted figures relating to the amount of soil washing out to sea.</p>

<p>Then he said that we should appoint officials to prevent this. Now I want to ask that hon. member whether it is the duty of the official or the Government to stop sand from washing out to sea. Is it the Government&#x2019;s duty or the official&#x2019;s duty, or is it mainly the farmer&#x2019;s duty&#x003F; Now he keeps quiet. I want to continue. When this Government introduced the new soil conservation legislation a few years ago, what did those hon. members do&#x003F; When the Soil Conservation Act was introduced, which brought about general streamlining in our soil conservation, hon. members opposite said that we were interfering with the right of the individual. When the Government introduced measures in an attempt to establish units on which a person could earn a viable income, hon. members opposite said that we were interfering with the rights of the individual. Yesterday this was proved once again. Today that hon. member says that the officials and the Government are to blame for the fact that the soil is washing out to sea. I think the statement he made is an irresponsible one. It is a defamation of the character of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services such as I have never seen before. I hope the Department takes due cognizance of what the United Party thinks of it.</p>

<p>I shall refer to the stock reduction scheme later on. At this stage I just want to say that that hon. member ought to know that Klipplaat is a separate soil conservation district and does not fall under Jansenville.</p>

The hon. member referred to rainfall. But, surely, that is not all that counts. After all, carrying capacity is not only determined on the basis of rainfall. Surely there is also such a thing as soil coverage. Then the hon. member also knows that Jansenville consists chiefly of broken country densely overgrown with elephant&#x2019;s-food, etc. Does the hon. member not know this&#x003F; After all, he often drives through that area. However, the problem with that hon. member is that his power of perception is rather poor. He revealed that again this afternoon. That is why he is saying such absurd things as he <span class="col_1601-1602" refersTo="page_0818"/>did this afternoon in respect of the determination of carrying capacity. I want to suggest that the determination of carrying capacity in connection with the stock reduction scheme was done in conjunction with the soil conservation committees. If that hon. member wants to dispute this, he should go back to his own soil conservation committee and try to solve the matter there. I think the hon. member&#x2019;s problem is to be found in the fact that he has too little knowledge of these matters.</p>

<p>I want to say today that at every agricultural congress held over the past two or three years, there were motions of thanks to the Ministers and to the Departments of Agriculture for everything they had done. I want to add that all of this was done on the highest level of agriculture in this country, namely in the South African Agricultural Union.</p>

<p>In pausing to reflect on a motion such as this one, one is immediately impressed by its scope, and in the relatively short time at one&#x2019;s disposal it is an impossible task to do full justice to the various departments. The services and financing with which the agricultural industry is provided, are so absolutely vast in scope and so irreproachable in quality that it is humanly impossible to go into them in depth. We can only scratch the surface slightly. I have decided to confine myself exclusively to the financing aspect of agriculture, with special reference to the role played by the State in stabilising the agricultural industry by means of direct or indirect financing, as well as the various <i>ad hoc</i> relief measures in times of disasters and price recessions. I want to start with the Land Bank. Once again I want to lay the charge against that party that the greatest injustice that has ever been done to this body, was done during the 1970 election campaign by those hon. members, led by the hon. member for <span class="col_1603-1604" refersTo="page_0819"/>Newton Park. This is the greatest injustice that has ever been done to an agricultural body in this country. Today I want to take up the cudgels for the Land Bank. Long-term assistance to farmers from 1966 to 1970 amounted to R276.5 million, i.e. up to the end of 1970.</p>

<p>Comma!</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hayward">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. S. HAYWARD</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, R276,5 million, including South-West Africa, at an interest rate of 6 per cent. In other words, with the present long-term interest rates, it amounts to a saving of between R10 million and R11 million per annum in interest alone. From 1966 up to the end of 1970 medium-term credit, or mortgage loans, amounted to R20 million at an interest rate of 7,5 per cent. That is an interest saving of R500 000 per annum. The short-term loans amounted to R10 million at an interest rate of 6,5 per cent. That is an interest saving of R350 000.</p>

<p>What is even much more important than that, is the financing of co-operative societies, with which I am going to deal now. This is an indirect form of financing which is also done for to the farmers of South Africa.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kingwill">

<speech by="#hayward">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. S. HAYWARD</person>:</from>

<p>I am dealing with important matters now. That hon. member will not understand them, nor do I wish to reply to him now. I want to deal with assistance to co-operative societies. For instance, instalment loans for bulk-handling financing which are granted to cooperative societies, amount to R48 million at an interest rate of 7 per cent. Now we come to cash credit loans granted to cooperative societies for immediate needs. From 1966 up to and including 1970 a total amount of R2 483 million was granted at an interest rate of 6,5 per cent. I think that this is indeed a proud achievement. Assistance granted to boards of control in the form of advances and loans amounted to R143 million during the same period, including R10 million to the Wool Commission.</p>

<p>Now we come to agricultural credit. Over the past 10 years the credit provision to farmers by the Department of Agricultural Credit showed an increase of 300 per cent. At the present stage a total amount of R183 million has been invested in the agricultural industry by the Department of Agricultural Credit. Now, we must bear in mind that this department was only established in 1966, but I want to add that the former State Advances Division of the Department of Lands has now been incorporated in this department. That is R183 million, of which R125 million is long-term credit at an interest rate of 5 per cent.</p>

<p>I want to submit that as a result of this the South African farmer saves approximately R7&#x00BD; million per annum in interest alone.</p>

<p>I just want to say a few words about the allocation of long-term assistance by these bodies. The public grumbles a great deal about the fact that one person obtains a loan and the other does not. The position is very simple, and the sooner this is realized by people in the agricultural industry, the better. The allocation of long-term loans, i.e. bonds, by these bodies is done purely on the basis of agricultural value and not on the basis of the current market value of such land. The sooner we in the agricultural sector in South Africa recognize this important principle, the less discord there will be. It should be realized that financing ought to be effected on the basis of agricultural value; in other words, on the basis of the production value of that land. If everybody would realize that, order would come about in respect of the financing of agriculture in South Africa.</p>

<p>Now I come to the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing. I must make haste, but there are so many things that are being done that, as I have said, it is only possible for one to scratch the surface. What form of financing is done by the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing&#x003F; In price stabilization they paid our R70 million in 1970-72 the estimated amount was R72,5 million. In respect of <i>ad hoc</i> assistance to industries the amount was R2,5 million in 1970-&#x2019;71 and R8,7 million in 1971-&#x2019;72. The amount in respect of drought and flood assistance was R11,1 million in 1970-&#x2019;71 and R3,6 million in 1971-72. In addition there is the subsidy on production means. In respect of fertilizers alone the amount in 1970-71 was R15,6 million in subsidies, and in 1971-72 it was R20,1 million. The grand total of the amount spent by the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing on the agricultural industry in South Africa was therefore R101,7 million in 1970-71 and R110 million in 1971-72.</p>

<p><span class="col_1605-1606" refersTo="page_0820"/>Now I come to the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. The total amount paid out by them, was R5,7 million in 1970-&#x2019;71, and in 1971-&#x2019;72 it was R14,8 million. All of these are huge amounts. And then that hon. member still says that nothing is being done for the agricultural industry. In regard to financing I just want to read out to the hon. member an expert from what was said by Sir William Gunn in Australia. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have had tremendous publicity given to the plight of the wool industry and, unfortunately, this has created in the minds of the financial institutions as a whole a lack of confidence in the rural sector. The problems of the wool industry are now damaging other rural industries as far as finance is concerned.</block>

<p>We must take care not to bring about what happened in Australia by telling stories such as those told by the hon. member this afternoon. We are killing our agricultural industry by telling such stories, and that hon. member is guilty of that sin. He ought to display more responsibility as far as this is concerned.</p>

<p>I should like to say a few words about the wool industry. I want to convey special thanks to the Government for what has been done for the wool industry in recent years. As far as agriculture is concerned, this industry has been the biggest earner of foreign exchange over the years. It is an industry which finds itself faced with very big problems, firstly, owing to the tremendous drought, and, secondly, owing to the recession of prices. When we pleaded with the Minister to help us with this supplementary price scheme, in which that hon. member happened to have shared amply, the Minister extended his hand to us and said that he would subsidize the scheme by 50 per cent. When prices dropped continuously and when we started getting worried about where it was all going to end, we approached the Minister again and said that we did not want to keep him in the dark. We told him that prices had dropped lower and that they were still dropping. Then we asked him whether we had to carry on with the scheme. When there were doubts in our hearts, this Minister said that we could not at that stage leave our people in the lurch. He told us to carry on and that he had sufficient confidence in the wool industry&#x2019;s ability to recover. Today we are reaping the fruits of this advice, for the wool industry is in the process of recovering. We owe the Government an infinite debt of gratitude, not only for having kept the industry as such on its feet, but also for having kept large numbers of our wool farmers on their farms by means of its subsidization and assistance.</p>

<p>I should also like to say something about combating locusts. I am sorry that the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central is not in this House today. Let me tell you at once that the locust campaign in my area was a huge success. Locusts were exterminated. There may still be odd hatchings of locusts, but I believe that the measures taken in the campaign for combating locusts, were so effective that we wiped out this plague.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Walmer is the last person who may talk, for in his district the locusts, which constituted a tremendous threat there, were wiped out. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central found it necessary to send the Minister a telegram, in which he said that the campaign for combating locusts in the Steytlerville district was in chaos. Without having taken the trouble to inquire into what was going on there, he sent the Minister a telegram based on hearsay, and by doing so he caused the official at Grootfontein a great deal of trouble. The official telephoned me, asking me whether this was true, whether this could be true. I told him that there was no such thing. The campaign was a success. As the hatchings took place, the locusts were sprayed, and there were in fact no problems. I do not know why hon. members opposite do not take the trouble to investigate a matter thoroughly before they start expatiating on it.</p>

<p>I shall now deal with the stock reduction scheme. I want to suggest, and I am glad that the hon. member agrees, that the stock reduction scheme is the greatest scheme ever. But that hon. member should not make statements here which he knows he cannot substantiate. I have the greatest respect for Mr. Stretton, and I serve with him on several committees of agricultural unions; but I think today the hon. member imputed something to him which he really would not arrogate to himself, i.e. that he is the father of the stock reduction scheme. I do not think that hon. member <span class="col_1607-1608" refersTo="page_0821"/>knows what he is talking about. It may be true that he may have something to do with the veld reclamation scheme, but the stock reduction scheme is purely a scheme which originated in the Karoo.

<p>It is not necessary for him to be in this House when I speak. He knows what I want to say. He had the courage of his convictions to take the bull by the horns and to introduce this scheme. Now I just want to know whether the hon. member for Newton Park, when he addressed a meeting of a farmers&#x2019; association at Graaff-Reinet, praised or criticized this scheme. It seems to me as though there is some confusion now: he should not shake his head, because I am going to quote him. There is not one single agricultural organization in this country which does not praise this scheme and does not say that it works one hundred per cent. I could read out scores of letters, but my time is limited. My time is limited, but the hon. member for Newton Park deemed it fit to address a meeting at Graaff-Reinet and to cast doubts in the minds of our people on this scheme. I say that he cast doubts, for he mentioned a R6 compensation for the first 600&#x2014;I do not know where he got that figure from&#x2014;and, in the second instance, he said that we had to keep the farmers on the land. They were not to go in for total withdrawal. What they are to do on their farms with 200 or 300 sheep, I simply do not know.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to conclude by saying that this country and the agriculturist of South Africa, and especially the small stock industry, are sincerely grateful to this Government, and therefore we deemed it fit to convey today&#x2014;by way of a motion in public, so that the people of South Africa may hear it&#x2014;our gratitude to the Government, for if it had not been for this Government, the agricultural industry in this country would have been in chaos, but instead of chaos there is order, and that we owe to a Ministry of Agriculture and departments which know their job and carry it out properly.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. the Deputy Minister says 88 000. I want to know out of which thumb he sucked that figure, because only this afternoon in this House we had a question answered by the hon. the Minister of Statistics, who told us that there are 83 000 White people actively engaged in farming in South Africa, according to the 1970 statistics, and they are not all farmers, Sir. How many of those people are farm managers&#x003F; How many farms have got more than one White person on them today&#x003F; Do not let the hon. the Deputy Minister come and tell us that there are 88 000 active farmers today. There are not 88 000. The point is that he does not know what is going on, nor does the hon. member for Graaff-Reinet, particularly, in the agricultural sphere. Perhaps it is not fair to use an argument like that, but nonetheless it is true, or else the hon. the Minister of Statistics has given us the wrong figures.

<p>Why is it going to be suspended if it is such a good scheme&#x003F; Mr. Speaker, these are the questions that we want answered before we start expressing any appreciation in this House for anything done by the Government as far as the agricultural sector is concerned. Perhaps we have got some farmers who want to say &#x201C;Thank you&#x201D; to the Government. I refer to the poultry farmers, who have now got production control, thanks to this side of the House who told the Minister to introduce the necessary legislation. Then there are also the housewives of South Africa who have no longer got excess water in their chickens because of regulations introduced by that hon. Minister, thanks to this side of the House who forced him into doing it. Those are the people who can express their appreciation in terms of this motion but not, I am afraid, the farmers who had to rely on the Government to do something for them.</p>

<p>Sir, let us have a look at the dairy industry. Does the hon. the Deputy Minister really believe that the people in the dairy industry today are prepared to express their appreciation for the manner in which this Government have dealt with their industry over the past years&#x003F; Surely, Sir, somebody must have his tongue in his cheek when he expects this of the members of the dairy industry. What is the position in the dairy industry today, Sir&#x003F; It has never been in such a parlous state. Let us look at the production figures. The hon. member for Graaff-Reinet has quoted plenty of figures; I also have plenty of figures which I could quote. Let us have a look at fresh milk production in the controlled areas. In 1968 we produced 104,2 million gallons; in 1969 it increased to 111,3 million gallons. In the few years preceding 1968 there had been increases of between 5 per cent and 7 per cent per annum.

<p>It does not matter why. He admits it. Now, why did the hon. the Deputy Minister mislead this House last Thursday when he said that there was a shortage of local butter in November 1971&#x003F; Why did he mislead the House&#x003F; How can we express appreciation for this sort of thing&#x003F; And this is the whole crux of the matter, the bungling and the mishandling there has been in the whole dairy industry; because at the time the hon. the Deputy Minister made this statement he was trying to cover up one of the grossest errors that had been perpetrated by that department. Sir, what was the position with all the importation and the production of butter&#x003F; At the end of the dairy year, 30th September, 1971, we had a surplus of nearly a thousand tons of butter. That is what the Dairy Board had on hand. That was one week&#x2019;s supply. That is all. But what was the production at the time&#x003F; The production of butter at that time was sufficient to meet the demand for butter after the introduction of yellow margarine. The date is important. Yellow margarine was introduced in South Africa on 1st October last year, which was the first day after the closing of the dairy year, in which we had imported 20 million lbs. of butter. But in the three months after that, notwithstanding the fact that our local production of butter was 40 per cent above the local consumption of butter, 6 million kg. of butter was still imported by this Minister through the Dairy Board. Why was it necessary to import that butter&#x003F; And the hon. the Deputy Minister comes here on Thursday and misleads the House with a statement like this. He goes further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die Suiwelraad het na ons gekom en ges&#x00EA; dat ons betyds moet invoer en op daardie stadium was die oorsese botterprys, weer taamlik hoog. Intussentyd is daar toe besluit om margarine geel te maak.</block>

<p>When was that decision taken&#x003F; It was taken in May, and the Minister of Health announced it here. And when you talk about bungling, Sir, on the Tuesday afternoon this hon. Deputy Minister was asked a question by my colleague from East London North, whether it was the policy or whether it was intended to introduce yellow margarine.

<p>Yes, that is the teamwork, but we are being asked to express our appreciation for this sort of bungling. Surely the Board knew when they introduced yellow margarine that the consumption of butter was going to go down. Why still import another 6 million kg&#x003F; The 6 million kg. of butter was imported after production had already exceeded the local consumption of butter. When the hon. member for Swellendam hears this sort of thing, I am sure he feels he should withdraw his motion. Surely we cannot express our appreciation for this sort of thing.</p>

<p>Now, what do we find is the situation today&#x003F; Because we have imported 6 million kg. of butter more than we needed, incidentally at a tremendously high cost, we now have to export at a loss. Why did the Deputy Minister not give the benefit of that to the local housewife&#x003F; Because of the scandal which we unearthed, thanks to the newspapers which got wind of the fact that we were exporting the butter, this hon. Deputy Minister was forced to reduce the price of butter by 12 cents per 500 grams, 24 cents per kg. That reduced the price of the butter he imported but he was still making a profit on that butter. He is still selling it above the price he paid for it when he imported it. He is still selling it at a higher price than that. But today that butter is almost unobtainable, and this has shown the hon. the Deputy Minister that if he reduces the price of butter the housewife will buy it. He is not prepared to reduce the price of local butter to the South African housewife, but he is prepared to reduce the price of South African butter to some consumer overseas. In other words he is asking the South African housewife to subsidize the housewife overseas with cheap butter. It is done at the cost of the South African housewife, and this House is now being asked to express its appreciation for this, for the fact that the South African housewife is subsidizing cheap food overseas which this Minister and this Government will not give to our own housewives and to our poor underprivileged people in this country.</p>

Through something which the hon. the Deputy Minister let slip last week when he was talking here, I did a little bit of arithmetic and I worked out that on the consignment which has gone already, the 2&#x00BD; thousand tons, we have lost R106 000. And if we are going to export 10 000 tons, as the hon. the Deputy Minister told the hon. member for Houghton in reply to a question, we are going to lose another R&#x00BD; million on the exportation of butter at this rate, which is going to be paid by the taxpayer and the housewife of South Africa. It is they who pay this R&#x00BD; million and it is no good the Deputy Minister being clever and doing a little arithmetic himself and saying, as he said here that if he ploughed that back to the housewife in South Africa, it would have reduced the price by 0,2 cent per kg. Of course, on the total consumption of 104 million lbs., that would have been the case, but we are not asking him to reduce the whole lot, but let the South African housewife have the benefit of the butter exported.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Let him reply, Sir, but it will be written down, the same as this has been written down. In the two or three minutes left to me I want to give a little advice to the hon. the Deputy Minister. I do not want to be wholly destructive; I want to be constructive too. I want to suggest to the hon. the Deputy Minister that he investigate the Dairy Board, so that we can get together some time and consider ways and means of putting the dairy industry back on its feet, particularly with regard to industrial milk, other than fresh milk. This is milk and cream used primarily for the production of butter and cheese. I want to suggest to him now that although he has at odd times had people on the Dairy Board who have had the ideas necessary to put the dairy industry back on its feet in South Africa, and to promote the sale of butter, either through other members on the Dairy Board or through Ministerial or departmental action these schemes have come to nought. The best scheme of all was the introduction of smaller packs. Surely the hon. the Deputy Minister has seen in other countries that smaller packs of butter are available. I am very glad to see that South African Airways are making use of them now. At least I know that I am getting butter and not yellow margarine when I fly. I believe that the production of these small packs is curtailed by the Dairy Board and I wonder whether the hon. the Deputy Minister will inquire into this. What happened to the 10 cent packs and to the other smaller packs which should have been produced for our people to buy&#x003F; It has been proved overseas that this is the way to sell butter. It has been proved in our own country with cheese. When we introduced a smaller pack of cheese, the consumption of cheese went up immediately because it became more readily available to more people. Let us market this product. The trouble with these control boards is that the farmer does not have to sell his product. Let this Dairy Board do its duty and let it market the product. Let us put it in a decent wrapping, let us put it into tin foil instead of in a vegetable fibre. Let us make it attractive to the housewife. Let us put it on the shelves of the supermarkets of South Africa.</p>

<p>Unfortunately my time has run out, but I say in all earnestness to the hon. gentleman that we have to consider this matter. We have to go into the whole function of the Dairy Board, because surely the function of any control board should be to make people happy. Unfortunately, under this Dairy Board today the farmers are unhappy, the housewife is unhappy and there are shortages. This Dairy Board is not performing its function. I am sorry, but as long as we have this Dairy Board and this Government, it is impossible for me to express my appreciation for the manner in which this Government has dealt with agriculture over the past years.</p>

<speech by="#van_wyk">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. C. VAN WYK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this side of the House naturally does not expect the Opposition to be enthusiastic about every action of the Government. The least one may rightly expect, is gratitude and appreciation, even if not for all the good things this Government has given us, then at least for the aid and assistance the Government has rendered to agriculture in times of disasters and adversity over the years. However, on that side of the House we have hon. members who regard the interests of the farmers as a joke and who call it foolish and conceited to say thank you. With such hon. members I cannot argue. As far as the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District is concerned, I should not like to spoil the fun of the hon. the Deputy Minister. I leave him in the capable hands of the Deputy Minister. We are not trying to give out by means of this motion that the Government is perfect or that it does not make mistakes. Of course, mistakes are made. In any undertaking, particularly in an undertaking of the magnitude and the diversity of the agricultural industry, mistakes will creep in from time to time. However, I want to tell the hon. the Opposition that we in this country should count our blessings because we have a Government which is not prepared to sacrifice the interests of the farmer on the altar of temporary and short lived advantages, but which is gradually laying foundations on which our children too will be able to continue building. The Opposition may say what they like. They may come with their story that the Government is driving the farmers from the land and that the Government is doing nothing for the farmers. I say they may keep on telling those stories, because to do so will not help them in any way. I have here in front of me the reports of the two agricultural departments, and these reports belie all those assertions of theirs and contain deadly evidence against them. These reports tell the story of why the National Party enjoys the confidence of the farmers of South Africa. They also tell the story of why the National Party represents more than 90 per cent of the agricultural constituencies. This is an achievement because the promotion of the interests of agriculture in a country such as South Africa is no easy task indeed. We know that South Africa is not a rich country agriculturally. We heard here this afternoon that approximately 88 per cent of the surface is suitable for grazing only, on which only extensive farming systems can be applied. As far as the small quantity of arable land is concerned, it is a relatively poor country according to international standards. In this country we usually have more than our normal quota of pests and plagues, droughts and floods, storms and heat and cold. There are few countries in the world where the needs and the problems of agriculture consequently vary as continually as they do here in South Africa. Therefore very high demands are usually made on any Government in South Africa as far as agriculture is concerned. But in passing judgment on the Government, we must not overlook the fact that in addition to those things the Government has had to take into account the challenge posed by science and technology and the higher standards of living brought by them over the past decade and longer, has had to exploit our natural resources, and has had to take into account the inexorable economic laws as well as inevitable world situations and trends, also in the agricultural industry. Here I have in mind, for example, inflation and the depopulation of the rural areas. At the same time the Government has had to take steps to guard against the exploitation and waste of our scanty resources, our soil and our water. But despite all these things, this Government has placed agriculture <span class="col_1619-1620" refersTo="page_0827"/>in South Africa on a sound foundation and has developed it into a force in the South African economy. It has managed to do this because it did the obvious thing, i.e. to conduct proper research into the needs and problems of agriculture. These reports to which I refer, tell the story. When one reads them, one feels happy and one gains confidence in knowing that the information and the guidance of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services are based on new knowledge arising out of and becoming available from their own research. This is of great importance to me. Where certain kinds of research are applicable throughout the world, as in the case of medicine, for example, agricultural research is regionally bound and has real value only if it is carried out on one&#x2019;s own soil by one&#x2019;s own people and under one&#x2019;s own specific climatic conditions. Let me point out, in passing, that time and again in the past when our continued existence was at stake, our own people came forward and made breakthroughs which not only strengthened our strategic position but also quite often placed us in a position of being able to make important contributions to the outside world. For example, when cattle diseases threatened to jeopardize the position of agriculture as a source of food, our scientists at Onderstepoort made breakthroughs which not only safeguarded our agricultural, industry but also gained fame for South Africa. Today we can take a look at almost every scientific discipline and we shall find the names of South African researchers who are holding their own and cause South Africa to keep abreast of a developing world. Therefore we need not have any doubt about one thing, and that is that we have the potential at our disposal and it is with appreciation that we take cognizance of the fact that the Department of Agriculture is employing this potential to the full.</p>

<p>Let us just take a look at what is being done. Between the years 1958 and 1971 this Government spent no less than R29 million on buildings and facilities on behalf of five university faculties of agriculture, six agricultural colleges, nearly 40 experimental stations and, not least of all, eleven research institutes which were established, each of which is engaged in specialized research under planned programmes simply and solely for the agricultural industry. I want to ask whether this is the doing of a government which wants to drive its farmers from the rural areas and which has no time for its farmers&#x003F; The hon. members opposite talk term policy in season and out of season. Our policy allegedly is a short-term one. Let me point out that during the same period from 1958 to 1971 this Government spent no less than R25 million on subsidies for soil conservation works. But that is not all. In addition this Government made the farmers of South Africa a gift of R2 867 702 in terms of the veld reclamation scheme and R5 228 533 in terms of the stock reduction scheme. Is this the doing of a government which does not want the farmers on the land and which has no time for the farmers&#x003F;</p>

<p>In order to gain a better understanding of the inestimable value of research to the farmer, the agricultural industry and the country as a whole, I can do no better than to pose the alternative by asking where the farmers of South Africa would have been if the Department of Agricultural Technical Services had not given them, through unfailing research, the hybrid mealie, which has enabled them to increase the yield of 10 bags per morgen to 20, 30 and even 40 bags per morgen&#x003F; Where would the farmer have been if this department had not given him improved blight-resistant and more adaptable strains of wheat&#x003F; In addition he was given virus-resistant potato strains, tobacco strains and dozens of other strains too numerous to mention. Where would the fruit farmers have been today had it not been for the fact that this department had made so many new cultivare available to them&#x003F; Where would the stock farmers have been without the utilization of ureum in stock fodder in the form of licks or mixtures by means of which dry winter grazing can be utlized effectively and by means of which stock production has been increased so considerably&#x003F; And add to that the achievements gained by the department in the field of breed development and breed improvement. There is, for example, the Bondsmara breed of cattle about which many hon. members on the opposite side probably know nothing. There are the Dorper sheep, the Dormer sheep and the Dohne Merino and many others too.</p>

<p>Sir, have you ever considered what would have happened to many agricultural undertakings had it not been for the indispensable services of the Division of Plant Pest Control with its preventive and control <span class="col_1621-1622" refersTo="page_0828"/>services&#x003F; What would have happened to the citrus farmers had it not been for this department revealing the underlying causes of ring spot, virus diseases and greening disease&#x003F; The biggest critics of the Government will have to admit not only that all these free services have brought the farmers and the agricultural industry inestimable advantages but also that many farmers would have been ruined without them, particularly in these times of increased costs and intensive competition.</p>

<p>But let us proceed. What would have happened to the stock farmer had it not been for Onderstepoort&#x003F; Today there is not a single dangerous or contagious disease which has not either been wiped out or brought under control completely. Take, for example, something like nagana, the eradication of which has made thousands of square miles available for successful cattle farming in the Lowveld. Something like foot and mouth disease virtually is something of the past. The only risk still to be found is on the long borders of our country, which have been fenced by a vigilant Government and are being patrolled. Incidentally during the past year Onderstepoort issued no fewer than 95,5 million doses of 28 different vaccines. I ask again: If this Government wants to get rid of the farmers and if they do not care about the farmers, would they do such things&#x003F; No, anyone with common sense will know that they will not do so.</p>

<p>Research is necessary and in a dynamic industry such as the agricultural industry it is an essential prerequisite for growth and development. That is why the department started conducting research 12 years ago and has developed into the biggest single research institution in the country. In regard to research there are three requirements. Firstly, research machinery must function efficiently. Secondly, research must be purposeful and to the point, and thirdly, research results must be made available to those on whose behalf it has been undertaken and who is to apply it in practice. The successes achieved by the department are mainly attributable to the very fact that that is precisely what they are doing. This department does not undertake research merely for the sake of research. Research is undertaken after a systematic investigation, in the different agro-ecological regions, of all the factors influencing production. Moreover, this is done in co-operation with the farmers through their agricultural organizations. On the basis of information obtained in this way and also on the basis of the advice of expert advice committees established for this purpose, the most important research needs are determined and research programmes are worked out for every one of the research institutes which may then get on with the job. As regards the making available of research results, an essential method is, of course, through scientific publications. In this field, too, the department has done very well. Both as regards the quality and quantity of its scientific publications, these are a worthy reflection of the great and deserving work which is being done. I have here in front of me the <i>Yearbook for Agricultural Research</i> for 1971, with informative progress and final reports of 2 102 registered research projects dealt with during the year under review. To this may be added approximately 440 research publications which appeared in scientific publications, which are internationally recognized, as well as numerous contributions to foreign publications of papers read at international conferences and symposiums.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to point out that all of this would not have been of much avail had one been unable to take those research results to the farmer in a way which he would understand and in a way which would enable him to apply them. That is why the department pays particular attention to training and information, a service which has two important aspects in particular. The first is the grounding of the extension officer himself and the second is the maintenance of good human relations. In order to meet these requirements, the Department introduced a system of in-service training as well as a post-graduate university course in extension methodics. Here I want to put in a good word for the officials of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. I know of few other officials who move in farming circles with so much dedication, tact and patience&#x2014;I am speaking of experience, because I have had to deal with them very often&#x2014;and who discuss the problems of the farmers with them and give them advice and guidance. I want to express my appreciation towards them. But for the further dissemination of information we have the well-known periodical <i>Farming in South Africa,</i> and the press, the radio, and film and slide shows are all used extensively for this purpose, and in addition we still have the departmental publications, and in the latest year under review no fewer than 144 000 copies <span class="col_1623-1624" refersTo="page_0829"/>of six special articles from <i>Farming in South Africa</i> were distributed, 143 000 agricultural bulletins and 87 500 copies of <i>Agricultural News,</i> not even to mention the hundreds of farmer&#x2019;s days and visits to farms and personal interviews with farmers.</p>

<p>For the farmer there are two things of importance. Firstly, that they will have the Government as an ally and, secondly, that their industry will develop basically sound. In other words, they want the assurance that they will not stand alone in the uneven battle against the elements of nature. They also want the assurance that their industry will be administered in such a way that their children will be able to continue farming and still be able to enjoy the same freedom and independence they do. As I myself am a farmer and the representative of an agricultural constituency, I am glad for this opportunity to convey my own gratitude and appreciation, but also the gratitude and appreciation of my constituents who are farmers, to the hon. the Ministers of Agriculture and this Government, as well as the officials of Agricultural Technical Services for what they are doing for the promotion of agriculture in South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this afternoon we had a singular display here, with the hon. member for Swellendam moving this motion.

What is more, one would have expected the hon. the Deputy Minister, as one does when one is thanked on some occasion or other, to immediately have taken the opportunity to express his thanks for that appreciation accorded him.

<p>Or course I appreciate the research these gentlemen and the Departments are doing, but what I find strange is that the hon. member for Wynberg makes no mention of the fact that all this research that was done&#x2014;the wonderful hybrid seed we have at our disposal, the new cultivars that were grown, etc.&#x2014;cost South Africa money. It did mean increased production, but what the hon. member suppresses is that in spite of this increased production in South Africa the South African farmer&#x2019;s profit margin is still dropping. Sir, all these achievements of the Department of Agriculture are altogether contradicted by the attitude of that side of the House, i.e. that today the South African farmer must develop on a horizontal level and must have more land to be able to make a profit and a decent living. This side of the House has always advanced the argument that the South African farmer&#x2019;s production costs have increased to such an extent, and his profit margins dropped to such a degree, that most farmers today find it impossible to maintain the standard of living of a decent human being. The hon. gentleman need not listen to me; let him listen to the chairman of the South African Agricultural Union, who said in Windhoek on 22nd October of last year (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<p>Of course he farms at a loss. But let us hear what was said by Mr. Harry Walker in October last year, four or five months ago, at the Nationalist Party congress in Natal&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Natal&#x2019;s Nationalist farmers complained bitterly yesterday to the Minister of Agriculture, Senator Uys, over the steadily rising prices in agriculture. Mr. Harry Walker told the National Party congress he was sick and tired of agricultural questions being rushed at congresses when farmers were facing a serious situation.</block>

<p>They were not even spending enough time on agricultural matters at their congresses, Sir. He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Tractors and implements have gone up in price four times during the last season, but milk has stayed at the same price for the last 10 years.</block>

<p>He then put this important question to congress&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Which salary earner has not had a rise in income in the last 10 years&#x003F; They have not had one increase, but at least 30. How is the farmer going to carry on&#x003F;</block>

<p>Sir, those are the questions that side&#x2019;s own people are putting to them, and then the hon. member for Swellendam expects us on this side to join him in expressing our gratitude to the Government on behalf of the farmers of South Africa. Sir, what is the position&#x003F; What did the hon. member for Swellendam actually want to say today&#x003F; He actually wanted to thank the Government for the <i>ad hoc</i> assistance they have given to the South African farmer over, say, the past 10 years. Sir, I do not find it strange that the hon. member wants to single out the <i>ad hoc</i> assistance given to the South African farmer by the Government, for the simple reason that this Government has an <i>ad hoc</i> assistance mentality as far as the agricultural industry in South Africa is concerned. Those hon. gentlemen have never had a great vision in respect of agriculture in this country. To them a large number of farmers in this country have always meant only problems. They think that if one decreases the number of farmers in South Africa, one would also reduce the agricultural problems in this country. But, Sir, to concede that the hon. member for Swellendam is correct to a small degree, let us look at the <i>ad hoc</i> assistance this Government has given the farmers over the past 10-12 years. Let us see what happened in times of drought and in times of difficult climatic conditions. Sir, you will still remember the tremendous drought we had in large parts of the Cape in 1970, when many farmers struggled to have their livestock transported; when many farmers struggled with the transport of fodder for those animals. It was only at the last moment that this Government decided to call in the Army to hasten to the assistance of those farmers, after we on this side of the House asked them why they were not prepared to call in the Army to help those people. After the South African stock farmer had suffered great losses and inconvenience from droughts, the hon. the Minister of Transport said at the last moment that he was no longer able to handle the situation, and then the Minister of Defence and his department had to be called in.</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Six, let us look at the example the hon. member for Graaff-Reinet mentioned, i.e. the locust plague. No plague in the past 10 years has caught the South African farmer and the Government of this country more unawares than specifically this plague. Instead of making toxic agents available quickly to individual farmers under the guidance of local farmers&#x2019; associations, they waited until more and more swarms hatched out in South Africa. Instead of this, they waited for the local locust officers and a <span class="col_1627-1628" refersTo="page_0831"/>small bunch of people to see if they could get the situation under control. They tried to take action on a nation-wide scale instead of calling in farmers&#x2019; associations and making toxic agents available to individual farmers for the combating of that plague. What happened was that in most cases people could not obtain toxic agents in time, and frequently the supplies they obtained were insufficient. But let us look at another example. What happened last year when that tremendous storm ravaged the Gamtoos Valley and the Sundays River Valley, and when there were tremendous floods in that area. Within a week or two the hon. the Deputy Minister and his Minister arrived there in helicopters to see what things looked like for the farmers. When the farmers asked them what kind of help the Government was going to give them, they replied that they could not yet say what kind of assistance would be supplied; that they would first have to institute investigations, and do you know, Sir, what the hon. the Deputy Minister said&#x003F; He said that what ought to be done is that this type of storm ought to be averted. In other words, the hon. the Deputy Minister was thinking more in terms of a long-term policy according to which more dams would be built so that those storm waters could be averted, while there were dozens of farmers at that stage who had 10 to 12 ft. of silt over their 10-15-30 morgen plots of irrigable land.</p>

<p>Those people wanted to know from the Government what form of immediate assistance the Government was going to grant them, because if one has so many morgen under orange trees, say, and that land is silted over and everything destroyed, then that part must immediately be placed under production. But it takes this Government three months before they can tell those people what form of assistance they can obtain. Sir, I am not complaining about the form of assistance granted. What I am complaining about is the <i>ad hoc</i> assistance they are prepared to give. That is normally given at such a stage that, when the Government is handling them in that fashion, the farmers have doubts in their hearts and no courage for the future.</p>

<p>Let us take a brief look at the livestock fodder subsidy scheme. Last year the Government decided that in many areas the livestock fodder subsidy scheme would be abolished because, they said, there is now the livestock withdrawal scheme and large portions of the country have had rain. But the hon. member forgets that there were large portions of the North Western Cape that had not yet had rain at that stage. But summarily it was decided that the livestock fodder subsidy of those people would be cancelled. But then they say they are proud of the <i>ad hoc</i> assistance the Government gives the farmers of South Africa.</p>

<p>Let us look at the livestock withdrawal scheme. Last year in December it was announced that any farmer that wanted to go in for the full withdrawal scheme would no longer be allowed to do so. I have no objection to that, but it is said that any farmer that still wants to participate in the livestock withdrawal scheme will be given time up to the end of March this year to submit an application. But then, a week ago, the stock-farmer of South Africa was told: You now no longer have until the end of March to make your application; your application must be in before the end of this month.</p>

<p>That is easy to understand.</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says it is easy, but why was it not possible for them to tell those farmers early that their applications had to be in by the end of February&#x003F; I want to know what the reason is for this unapproachable attitude towards the South African farmer, and I want to describe this decision as a childish one. Why was there no timely notification of the fact that the closing date for applications would be the end of February&#x003F; One could mention another example. One could look at the Government&#x2019;s decision about the manufacturing of yellow margarine. They are supposedly the people who know the South African farmers circumstances so well. Last year when the Minister came along with that legislation, was he prepared to consult the dairy farmer of South Africa&#x003F; No, what does Mr. Albert Basson, chairman of the Dairy Board, say according to the <i>Landbouweekblad</i>&#x003F; (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Albert Basson holds a post-mortem: The Minister of Agriculture said the dairy farmer would be protected against yellow margarine by means of quotas. The quota system, however, is not worth the paper it is written on.</block>

<p><span class="col_1629-1630" refersTo="page_0832"/>He also described the claim by the Minister of Health, Dr. De Wet, that butter is detrimental to health, as unscientific, he said the dairy industry took strong exception to the fact that it was not consulted in this. That was the question of the manufacturing of margarine. If the hon. gentleman and his department are in such close touch with the South African farmer, this type of thing would surely not be happening. If they are helping the South African farmer, how is it that Mr. Andr&#x00E9; du Toit, chairman of the K.W.V., had to say as recently as 3rd August of last year that the Minister had hit the wine-farmers hard&#x003F; Then they pretend they are the friends of the South African farmers, but the farming leaders themselves say that this Government and the Minister are hitting them hard.</p>

<p>Now the hon. member for Swellendam comes along and tells us we must be prepared to thank the Government for those hard blows they are dishing out to the South African farmers. This is no motion of thanks and no motion of appreciation to the Government, but a motion of irony. No Government in South Africa has yet succeeded in bringing more farmers to their knees than this very Government we have had in South Africa for the past 24 years. Let us look at another <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement of this Government.</p>

<p>There is the so-called question of meat marketing. Last year we conducted a tremendously fierce debate in this House about meat marketing. At the time the hon. the Minister told us he had his own scheme in mind, a cheaper and an easier scheme for the stock-farmer. We then told the hon. the Minister that he must be prepared to give a portion of the permits, which are granted, to the South African farmers. At that stage the South African farmers, particularly the Transvaal farmers, felt that they should not be solely dependent on the favour of their meat marketing agents. We then asked the hon. the Minister to do something about the matter. We asked him to give a certain percentage of those permits to the farmers. In August it was decided to do just that. Shortly afterwards, however, the whole scheme was abolished. What is the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s position&#x003F; He denies altogether having had anything to do with it. Last year, before his party congress at Goudini, he denied having had anything to do with that.</p>

<p>Yes, as with Agliotti. Here I have the August 1971 issue of <i>Farming in South Africa.</i> It states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">With the approval of the hon. the Minister of Agriculture, it was decided to apply the permit quota system only to the controlled markets of the Witwatersrand and Pretoria at this stage. Initially 40 per cent of the supply will be regulated to these markets by way of permits and 60 per cent by way of the existing quota system.</block>

<p>Do they acknowledge that this was given with their approval&#x003F; But when he was tackled by the South African farmers, what does he tell them&#x003F; According to the <i>Farmers Weekly</i> he said, when holding the meeting in Pretoria&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Senator Uys has denied that he had anything to do with the withdrawal of the permit quota meat marketing scheme just two weeks after its inception. Addressing a stormy meeting of about 500 Transvaal cattle farmers in Pretoria he said: &#x201C;The first I heard of the withdrawal of the scheme was when I heard the news on the radio.&#x201D;</block>

<p>I also want to refer to what was said about that in the <i>Agricultural New</i> of 1st October. Hon. members must now remember that the Minister said he had nothing to do with that and that he had heard about it for the first time over the radio</p>

<p>One moment we ask him to accept his responsibility, and the next moment he denies having had any responsibility in this respect.

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to apologize to the Deputy Speaker for having lost my temper while the hon. member for Piertermaritzburg-District, who is not present in the House now, was speaking. The House must understand one thing, and this is that I do not regard agriculture as a political matter. I came to this debate this afternoon with the honest feeling that the hon. member for Swellendam was sincere in his proposal in which the Government was thanked for what has been done for agriculture and in which the hope was expressed that the Opposition would make positive contributions, because there are faults in agriculture; there are bottle-necks. I have never managed agriculture with an ulterior politicial motive. When a farmer approaches me and asks for any form of help, I have never wondered whether he is a member of the National Party or of the United Party I regard the agricultural industry as something unpredictable. But if matters are put in a debate as they were put here this afternoon, when something I said last Thursday was presented in a wrong light, hon. members who know my background and understand that I do not want to make a cheap political football of this matter, will know why I lost my temper. Just like last Thursday, I am speaking from my heart, as a farmer and as nothing but a farmer. For that reason hon. members opposite will not be able to understand me, but I think I was unreasonable towards the Deputy Speaker by behaving as I did.</p>

<p>I want to reply to the hon. members individually. The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town said that this motion was probably a joke. How does the hon. member think we in the ministry and the officials who have made it their life task to make a success of agriculture in South Africa, feel if this motion, out of which the hon. member for Swellendam did not for one moment try to make political capital, is referred to as a joke&#x003F; Surely everybody has benefited from the financial aid offered by the Government. The hon. member for Graaff-Reinet mentioned here the positive steps taken by the Government, and the hon. member for Winburg pointed out in a striking way what had been done by the Government. But everything this Government does, is criticized. As far as the officials of the Department of Agriculture are concerned&#x2014;forget about the ministry&#x2014;I want to say to hon. members that if you have a bad labourer on your farm and you praise him for just a moment one day in a month, you will give a little encouragement. If, however, you continually insult him, humiliate him and treat him harshly, he becomes despondent after a while. An Opposition which is prepared to say occasionally that the officials have done at least one good thing, is a good Opposition, but we have been criticized and humiliated here all afternoon. I began to wonder whether it would be worth while trying to explain something to this crowd of United Party members. But I have no choice: I am paid to do the job and must reply.</p>

<p>After all this time, the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town referred again this afternoon to the farm which Strauss allocated to himself in South-West Africa. I am referring to the farm Mahlzeit. As a result of the quick action of the department and the Minister, he was forced to give the farm back. There is nothing wrong. The matter was finalized last year. The hon. member made the statement that potash to the value of R300 million was being washed away every year. What a ridiculous statement!</p>

<p>Furthermore, the hon. member said that the chairman of his farming group, the hon. member <span class="col_1633-1634" refersTo="page_0834"/>for Newton Park, would work out the meat scheme for us. Those were his words. He asked me on Thursday whether I was satisfied with our meat scheme. I told him candidly that I was not. Why should I lie&#x003F; There are various reasons why I am dissatisfied with it. But it is easy to condemn and then leave the matter hanging in the air. When is that hon. member going to give us his meat scheme&#x003F;</p>

<p>I come now to the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District. He has repeatedly said that the number of farmers has decreased. Hon. members shouted at me that I was wrong when I said that there were 88 000 farmers, and said that there were in reality only 83 000. Let it be what it may; but let me ask the hon. member whether the United Party, if it were to come into power, would put a stop to the decrease in the number of farmers.</p>

<p>Hon. members should understand that it is the aim of the Ministry of Agriculture to keep as many people in the rural areas as is practicable. We want to give a man the right to exist. The hon. member asked me what an economic unit was. My idea of an economic unit is a farm on which a man, a woman and four children have a net income of at least R4 000 per year. He should be able to make a decent living in agriculture as well. Why should he always walk around half-empoverished&#x003F; Why can he not live as well as the man in the city&#x003F; This is our idea of an economic unit.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The figure was given to the hon. member a short while ago by the hon. member for Swellendam&#x2014;it is more than R6 000, but it includes big and small farmers. Go and calculate the figure according to our agricultural turnover. In fact, according to the hon. member for Swellendam, it is even more. I think the hon. member calculated it on the basis of 83 000 farmers and not 90 000. This possibly produces a completely different figure.</p>

<p>I come now to the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District. I want to explain why I became angry. It is because the hon. member read out that I had supposedly said: &#x201C;The hon. members know that the fat was in the fire when we told them in November that we had no local butter&#x201D;. I never read a Hansard after I have spoken, but I see here&#x2014;I do not know for what reason&#x2014;and I am not criticizing either&#x2014; that it has been deleted and that here stands what I clearly remember having said on Thursday, namely that the fat &#x201C;would have been (<i>sou wee</i>s) in the fire if in November we &#x2026;&#x201D; that is quite a different matter.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But I am saying that it has been deleted. I have just read out what I said. Perhaps it was a play on words which was rectified so that the sentence could read properly. But when the hon. member read it, he wanted to make political capital out of it. What was my argument&#x003F; Because hon. members reproached us for having imported our butter, I made it clear to them last Thursday that nobody knew the coinciding circumstances which led to the consumption of butter dropping by almost 40 per cent as a result of yellow margarine. The Dairy Board ordered butter on a competitive market, but the butter is transported by sea and one could not predict on what day the ship would arrive. We see that as a result of drought there was a decrease in production. The hon. member has insinuated that we do not pay the dairy farmers enough for their cream. If he had practical knowledge of this problem, he would realize that as a result of the increase in the price of meat and as a result of his labour and Sunday labour problems, the farmer would switch over to the production of meat instead of <span class="col_1635-1636" refersTo="page_0835"/>sending milk to the industries. All these problems must be foreseen. The late King Solomon would not have had a solution to this problem as long as he did not know in November what would happen in January. Butter was ordered, but in the meantime we sat with the problem of yellow margarine.</p>

<p>The hon. members kick up a fuss about yellow margarine. The hon. member for Bloemfontein District has brought me a newspaper cutting which a lady sent him. She was bitter because we were being attacked about butter. It is an English-speaking lady from Natal who sent it to the hon. member. The cutting is from the <i>Daily News</i> of 7th November, 1945, and reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>As a dairy farmer, I was not in favour of yellow margarine, but because of circumstances and pressure, we felt that we should give the people something cheaper to put on their bread. I want to put a question to the hon. member, who is chairman of their dairy committee. I stated emphatically in the debate&#x2014;he did not quote it&#x2014;that it had appeared that the quotas allocated would be exhausted by March. I am asking the hon. member whether we should increase the quotas for yellow margarine, yes or no. Now the hon. member is drinking water! It is easy to sit in the Opposition benches. Some days I would also enjoy sitting there and making irresponsible statements. If the hon. member said that the quotas should be increased, the dairy farmers would have it in for him, and if he said no, the housewives would have it in for him. Therefore it is easy to criticize and it seems to me that I should remain calm and never become angry about these matters.</p>

<p>I come now to the hon. member for Newton Park. He asked me where the Minister was. Yesterday the hon. member for South Coast said that the Deputy Minister should also have powers, as the Minister has, so that he may delegate in respect of the purchasing of land. However, hon. members opposite are more than incensed because the Minister has delegated me to be here this afternoon. How does one understand that&#x003F; Let me tell hon. members what the Minister is doing at the moment. At the moment he is working for the farmers of South Africa. Why should he be here if I am here&#x003F; Surely we want to be efficient. Surely two people are not needed to pulverize a crowd like that! I personally was pleased with the letters we received from agricultural unions and farmers&#x2019; associations about the way in which we combated the locust plague. Last year the department spent R2 million on the combating of locusts and bishop birds. Farmers also praise us for tackling these plagues on such a large scale. However, the hon. member for Newton Park has criticized our method of eradicating locusts. He asked why we had not given the poison to the farmers. Ten years ago we gave poison to farmers, and six years later we were still discovering poison to the value of several thousands of rands stored away on farms in case the farmer had a shortage one day. The department cannot exercise control over an area of 800 miles and cannot visit all the farms in the areas where locusts must be combated. These are facts I obtained from the departments.</p>

<p>I come now to the Gamtoos issue. The hon. member made a joke of it by saying that I had said that we should prevent the storms. It is so easy to distort something. Do hon. members know that the Gamtoos Valley scheme is going to cost the tax-payer R5 million&#x003F; Does the hon. member know that in terms of a motion he himself has seconded here, we have allowed the Gamtoos Valley farmers to cultivate land in the basin of the river&#x003F; Does he realize that if another flood disaster strikes next year again, that R5 million in income tax money can wash away again&#x003F; Is it not my <span class="col_1637-1638" refersTo="page_0836"/>duty to issue a warning and to say that farmers should not cultivate lands in the basin of the river, because the area is subject to periodic floods&#x003F; My words to the farmers were that we should see whether we should not perhaps leave this deep alluvial soil which attracts everyone, and perhaps farm according to other methods. Was it wrong to say that&#x003F; Furthermore, I asked them whether we should not have more catchment areas in the upper reaches in order to prevent a possible disaster. The taxpayers cannot pay R5 million every two years in order to reclaim land. However, the hon. member for Newton Park has said that we waited three months before announcing any aid. At the meeting the Minister told the farmers they should continue with their work and rebuild their farms. He said he had to go to the Cabinet and hold discussions with the Minister of Finance. However, he undertook to get Cabinet approval for 50 per cent of the costs of rebuilding their land. Those farmers came to us with tears in their eyes because we were there when the water was still flowing and because we offered to help them. Today, however, we are being reproached because the farmers supposedly had to wait for three months before they received aid. It is not pleasant if one tries to do one&#x2019;s duty and political capital is subsequently made out of it. The position is that the surveys took much time. All the farms had to be visited in order to determine what each farmer should receive. Some farmers&#x2019; land had been completely washed away. Those persons had to be resettled. Surely one could not at that junction have said to him: &#x201C;Man, we are going to give you another farm&#x201D;. The matter must be investigated. One needs officials to go and look where one can resettle the farmer. I think the country would experience a disaster if the member for Newton Park ever became Minister of Agriculture.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Graaff-Reinet spoke about the stock withdrawal scheme. The hon. members for Walmer and for East London City have praised us. Everyone has praised us, and the agricultural unions also told us that initially we should grant a withdrawal allowance of R2 per sheep. Subsequently this became R2,50 and later R3 per sheep. Up to R5 000 was paid to the farmer in order to withdraw 2 500 sheep on a sliding scale. The hon. member for Newton Park held a meeting at Graaff-Reinet. Here is a report on it. The following words appear in that report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Maximum stock reduction must be 75 per cent. Pay higher compensation, but compel the farmers to stay on the land.</block>

<p>He must withdraw 75 per cent of his sheep, but then you must compel him to stay on the farm. The farmer who had 400 sheep, would have only 100 sheep. A strong young man of 30 years may not go and work. He must look after 100 sheep. Just think of it! This is what he said and those farmers said to me: &#x201C;Man, do you think that a man in full possession of his faculties could come and make such a suggestion at Graaff-Reinet&#x003F;&#x201D; Today he has the courage to criticize, because the Minister of Agriculture has decided that the stock withdrawal scheme &#x2026;</p>

I want to ask: Why do the hon. members refer to the debt of the farmers in South Africa&#x003F; There is a debt of R1 300 million, but the assets of the farmers of South Africa amount to R7 000. Say, for example, there are 83 000 farmers in South Africa. I think hon. members would like this number to be even less, but that small number of farmers is producing increasingly more for a growing population. In the past 20 years, the smaller number of farmers have increased their annual production by an average of 4,4 per cent. This is a country which harvested agricultural products to the value of R1 600 million last year and which has doubled the production in 20 years. Over the same period our population increase was 2,3 per cent a year. It is a small number of farmers who bought 15 000 tractors alone last year for R41,8 million.</p>

<p>Regarded globally, the net profit of these farmers has increased. We mentioned the figure to you a moment ago. There are none so blind as those who do not want to see. We have given him the figure. What is the most important issue in agriculture&#x003F; The Du Plessis Commission illustrates this so strikingly. Do not reproach the Government and say how many thousands of tons of soil have been washed away; do not tell the State to do this or that. Let us please retain the self-respect and initiative of the farmer. I am saying there are farmers who definitely cannot make the grade because they are not economically suited. Such a farmer is not a business man; he is not the right jockey in farming. But there are so many dozens of them, and the Commission says we should look at the farmer who has made a success of his enterprise in our country. Let us be positive for a change. In spite of everything hon. members have mentioned, how many of those farmers have helped to attain this production without State aid, but with its support&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to Onderstepoort. Last year an undertaking such as Onderstepoort, which is a State institution and the only one of its type in the world, made 140 million doses of spray and vaccine available to African countries and other countries in the world. Not one of them will rise and say that this is indeed an achievement by the Department of Agriculture&#x2014;forget about the Government &#x2014;but all we get is a campaign of disparagement from start to finish.
