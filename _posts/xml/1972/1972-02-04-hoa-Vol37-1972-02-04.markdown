<heading>NO-CONFIDENCE DEBATE</heading>

<summary>(resumed)</summary>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>This motion of no-confidence debate has almost run its course, and if one takes stock of it one can hardly think that it was actually to be, according to Opposition commentators and their Press, the debate of the year. It was to have been the debate that would totally unnerve and unmask the Government. This debate has now reached the final day, and it is not necessary for me to comment on precisely what the Opposition has achieved in this debate. You, Sir, have sat here for five days, and I think that is all one could have done&#x2014;to sit. But what was said in this debate is not of as much interest to me as, again, what the Opposition did not speak about. Sir, five days is a long period of time. There are a great many speakers that can take part in that debate, and a tremendous range of subjects can be broached. Particularly if one takes into account the fact that here one has an Opposition that is trying to lead the country to believe that it is not only ready to take over, but as it were on the point of taking over, it is interesting that no single word has come from the Opposition about the all-important subject of foreign affairs in which South Africa is very intimately involved. I find it even more interesting that not a single speaker from amongst hon. members opposite stood up in this debate to say something about the farmers and their affairs.</p>

<p>And yet the usual inane laughter rose from the Opposition side when the hon. member for Swellendam brought up his motion here, and now I hear the hon. member for Walmer saying there is still time. What time&#x003F; How much time&#x003F;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the debate is in its last throes. Must I now take it from hon. members opposite that they had time to speak about all sorts of trifling matters and that they took up hours and days of the House&#x2019;s time, but that now the hon. member is saying there is still a bit of time left this afternoon; the farmers must therefore now be satisfied with the crumbs that have fallen from the table.</p>

<p>What also interests me, if one calls to mind their utterances of last year, if one looks at the statements made by them <span class="col_379-380" refersTo="page_0205"/>during the recess, is that in this debate not a single word has been said about sport.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Etienne Malan spoke about it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think even my hon. friend the member for Yeoville can describe what Mr. Etienne Malan said as a speech.</p>

<p>But, of course, the position is obvious. I remember very well how, when the sports policy was announced, a chorus of voices rose from hon. members opposite and how they wrote that this policy would not even get off the ground, that it was doomed to failure. It now stands as a fact before the hon. members of the Opposition and before the country, not only that this sports policy has been applied with very great success in practice, but also that at present South Africa is receiving more visits from international sportsmen and sporting teams of all kinds and is making more visits abroad than ever before in its history&#x2014;this is apparently the reason why the Opposition did not mention the subject. That is what has become of the isolation which they told us South Africa found itself in.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>What about our soccer, our cricket and many other sporting activities&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I also find it interesting that, apart from referring to the urban Bantu, hon. members&#x2014;where was the hon. member for Bezuidenhout&#x003F;&#x2014;did not say a single word about race relations, the all-important subject in South African politics. There are, of course, reasons for this. I say that about these four important subjects there was nothing forthcoming from the Opposition, and for a very obvious reason.</p>

<p>Since I have now mentioned foreign affairs, you will permit me, Sir, just to refer in passing, because I know there is great interest in this matter, to the reports we have read in the Press and heard on the radio about a possible visit to South Africa by the Secretary-General of the U.N. In this connection I want to say that, as hon. members will understand, the Government has not yet heard anything official in this respect. On the contrary. Such discussions as are being held are only tentative as yet and so far nothing has been brought to finality. I want to say, however, that if the Secretary-General of the U.N. should decide to come to South Africa, he would be received by us here with the utmost courtesy and hospitality, just as we received Mr. Dag Hammarskj&#x00F6;ld here in his day and as we invited U Thant to come to South Africa, although he declined our invitation. It will be appreciated that I therefore do not want to anticipate this matter, apart from saying that if the Secretary-General of the U.N. wants to come to South Africa to discuss, <i>inter alia,</i> the self-determination of non-White peoples with the Government, he will find, as far as the Government is concerned, that we are willing to discuss it with him, because it is our policy to lead our peoples to self-determination. However, if he wants to come to South Africa to act as the mouthpiece of the extremists of the O.A.U. and others and to put across resolutions taken in that connection, he will still be welcome and be very courteously received by us, but I can tell him in advance that he will be wasting his time.</p>

<p>The Leader of the Opposition introduced this debate by saying that he had the easiest task any Leader of the Opposition had ever had. [Interjections.] I wish to agree with my hon. friend the member for Witbank: He made the biggest failure of it that any Leader of the Opposition could! But, Sir, the hon. Leader still has a great deal of time in which to learn. He is fit; he is looking surprisingly well; he is the indisputable leader of that side. [Interjections.] I want to make the hon. members a present of that&#x2014;he is by far the best of those sitting opposite. There is no doubt about that. I say&#x2014;and I want to express my pleasure at the fact&#x2014;my hon. friend is fit. He will still learn a great deal in the next 15 to 20 years that he will be sitting there. The hon. Leader said he had an easy task. Sir, if he makes so great a failure of the easy task, what would he make of a difficult one&#x003F; Because both of us are leaders of a party, and because both of us are politicians, I now want to address a word of warning to my friend, just as he addressed words of warning to me. He must not allow the English Press to play trampoline with him to such an extent. At the beginning of the session they toss him up so high that I can hardly see him up in the air above me. When the discussions in Parliament are over, they pull away the trampoline from under him when he descends <span class="col_381-382" refersTo="page_0206"/>and he falls to the ground with a crash. I do not think it fair of the newspapers supporting his party to do this to my hon. friend. Take, for example, the merciless criticism that rained down on my friend&#x2019;s head after the discussion on my Vote last year. I do not think the Leader of the Opposition deserved that. He was not as bad as his newspapers made out; he was just normal.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>What a lofty, statesmanlike expression!</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall be coming to you.</p>

<p>At the very beginning of his speech the hon. the Leader of the Opposition referred to me in the following terms&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The hon. the Prime Minister himself seems to be losing control, not only of the situation in the country, but even of the situation in his own Cabinet.</block>

<p>Let me say at once that if this had been the first time the Leader of the Opposition had said this I would have taken it to heart. If the Leader of the Opposition had referred only to me in so many words, I would have taken it to heart even more. Sir, I am not doing my friend an injustice when I say this; his strong point is not originality. Just in passing I looked up what he had said about my predecessors. He had hardly become Leader of the Opposition, when on 2nd May, 1957, he referred to the late Mr. Strydom in these words (Hansard, col. 5205)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Department of External Affairs, the Prime Minister himself, businessmen and industrialists in South Africa, the Opposition itself&#x2014;whose words carry weight&#x2014;may do their best to give an acceptable interpretation of the South African situation, but all their efforts tend to be defeated by the activities of the extremists in the Cabinet, whom the Prime Minister seems unable or unwilling to control.</block>

<p>Therefore I am not the only one to lose control; as far back as 1957 Mr. Strydom had lost control. And if this is not serious enough, one may also read the following (Hansard, Vol. 6, col. 4441), dated 22nd April, 1963, i.e. during Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s time. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition then said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It seems the hon. gentleman is losing control. I think the trouble is that he has too many Ministers.</block>

<p>Then he stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I think the time has come, Sir, for us to clamp down to see that there are changes in the interests of the country.</block>

<p>[Interjections.] This story is really wearing thin now. When one consults the Hansard volumes, one sees that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has been repeating the words &#x201C;losing control&#x201D; every year. It is like a gramophone record with the needle stuck in the groove. However, for the moment I shall leave the matter at that.</p>

<p>The second reproach that came from hon. members opposite, and one that we have also been hearing for many years now, is that the Government&#x2019;s policy has failed; the policy is dead.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>That is a fact.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>If it is a fact, as the hon. member for Yeoville in his wisdom states, I am amazed that the United Party almost split because they wanted to take over a small, fractional part of our policy.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has now come along with his motion of no confidence. However, it is going to be held against him. He is the man who pretends that he can form an alternative government and that he can become an alternative Prime Minister. It is going to be held against him by the one newspaper that has stood by him through thick and thin, i.e. the <i>Sunday Express,</i> for he did not carry out their instructions. I want to quote from a report that appeared in that newspaper on 26th September, 1971. This is now a party that wants to lead us to believe that they want to take over either because this side of the House has no policy or because <span class="col_383-384" refersTo="page_0207"/>the policy of this side of the House has failed. I quote the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is clear that the United Party cannot take the political risk of entering the next session of Parliament in January without a firm and decided race policy &#x2026; It seems certain, therefore, that their commission &#x2026;</block>

<p>They refer here to a commission which they say was appointed. I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It seems certain, therefore, that the commission will report to Sir De Villiers Graaff to avoid protracting the issue until the 1974 congress. Sir De Villiers will have the power to accept or reject any recommendation and it seems likely that he will announce the party&#x2019;s new policy during the no-confidence debate when Parliament reopens.</block>

<p>He was to have announced a &#x201C;new policy&#x201D; to us here. I would not know what the number of new policy announcements would then have been, because I have lost count. But I like the next part of the report; it reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is to say, if he put forward this &#x201C;policy&#x201D; when Parliament opened&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; would place the Nationalist Party in Parliament at a serious disadvantage in attacking the policy since it would only have an hour or two to consider the changes &#x2026;</block>

<p>He had to creep up on us with the new policy. He had to steal into Parliament and creep up on us with the new policy. The report reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This would place the Nationalist Party in Parliament at a serious disadvantage in attacking the policy since it would only have an hour or two to consider the changes, but it would allow the United Party steadily to propagate any changes throughout the debate.</block>

<p>But he and I know each other, and in all amity I now want to tell him here across the floor of the House &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>You can just give me five minutes&#x2019; notice. That is quite enough.</p>

<p>But my hon. friend put certain questions to me in the course of this debate. I first want to deal with those questions before I conduct a general discussion in reply to certain questions put by hon. members opposite. In the first place the hon. member put a question to me about Agliotti. Mr. Speaker, I am sorry that this matter has not yet been concluded&#x2014;for very good reasons, which I shall mention to hon. members opposite. Hon. members will recall that there was a commission of inquiry under the chairmanship of Chief Magistrate Lindeque and that it concluded its work in December, 1970. Immediately on receipt of its report, that report was made available and handed over to the police and the Attorney-General for such action to be taken as appeared necessary from that report. The police gave attention to this matter on the highest level. One of the best investigators in the detective force, i.e. General Bester himself, took charge of this matter. Now hon. members must remember in the first place that there is a very long record of evidence&#x2014;it runs to no fewer than 2 726 pages; that there are quite a number of references to other documents in it and that there are quite a number of technical aspects to be cleared up. Studying this record and the related circumstances alone took up a great deal of time. In the course of time it has, as I have said, received the greatest attention and 86 affidavits have already been taken from people. These affidavits have from time to time been discussed with the Attorney-General himself. The Attorney-General has specially assigned two State advocates to give their personal attention to this matter and the investigation connected with it. In other words, both the police and the Attorney-General have been giving very thorough attention to this matter on the highest level. But it goes without saying that when one is dealing with a matter such as this, it must, in the first place, be investigated thoroughly. You cannot prematurely charge people before you have your evidence ready, because if, merely to satisfy <span class="col_385-386" refersTo="page_0208"/>the public, you charge people and they are found not guilty because of lack of evidence at that stage, you can never charge them again. Let us now admit to each other here that there is a great deal of suspicion in this connection, but suspicion is no proof at all in any court. There are many deductions which one could readily make, but a person cannot be charged on deductions which are made. Consequently this is unfortunately one of those cases where justice must take its course and the investigation, which has to be a thorough one, has to be completed. Our detective and police forces have an excellent record in regard to these matters. If there is anything in this regard which is not what it should be, and if there is evidence which has to be located, I think they will find it in due course. By way of summary I can inform hon. members that this matter has from the outset received the best attention, but that no charge has yet been laid against any person in that connection. However, the investigation is continuing on the highest level.</p>

<p>In the second place the hon. the Leader of the Opposition attacked me in regard to the statement I had made about the Caprivi incident. As I have said before, I gave that statement very thorough consideration. Every word stated therein, as well as every word not stated therein, I either included or omitted deliberately. I made my statement, which I made after very careful deliberation, available to the Press. My complaint was&#x2014;and this will always be my complaint if it should happen again&#x2014;that words were put into my mouth and written into my statement which I had not used.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. member would glance at my statement which he has before him, he would see that in the first place I did not say a single word about &#x201C;border&#x201D;; in fact, I did not even mention the word &#x201C;Zambia&#x201D;. I made that statement, in the form in which I made it, after very careful deliberation, and I am of the opinion that I cannot take the hon. member into my confidence in regard to the reasons for my making it, not even across the floor of the House. Hon. members will just have to accept this from me now. My standpoint is&#x2014;and this is also what I told the newspapers&#x2014;that newspapers may speculate, for they have the right to do so; newspapers may make deductions, for they have every right to do so; they may ask questions, but no one&#x2014; not the hon. member for Yeoville either&#x2014; has the right to put into a person&#x2019;s mouth words he did not use.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I say that no one has the right to write words into a statement, least of all when a ministerial statement is made on such a delicate subject. That was my complaint and it will always be my complaint. Then the hon. member came up with the ridiculous sequel which, strangely enough, neither he nor even one of his newspapers mentioned at the time, that I had supposedly endangered the lives of men with the statement I had made.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Certainly.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>If they made such a statement, it is as ridiculous as the deduction the hon. the Leader of the Opposition made. I want to repeat very clearly that what I said and did in that connection, I did deliberately and to the benefit of South Africa and, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;let me say this now to hon. members on the opposite side&#x2014;to confirm in principle that South Africa will not simply allow itself to be attacked, just like that, and do nothing about it.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition asked me for a statement in regard to the speech made by my colleague Minister Gerdener. In this connection I must say that not only do I want to discuss it, but I also want to make it very clear what the policy of the Government is in respect of this matter. Particularly in view of the fact that we have to a large extent been conducting an economic debate here, I want to say a few words, with reference to speeches made on the opposite side and dealing with the subject of the economy, about the allegations made by the opposite side of the House that we have allegedly allowed the economy to go to rack and ruin, whereas <span class="col_387-388" refersTo="page_0209"/>this was a country flowing with milk and honey while the United Party was governing it, i.e. up to 1948. With reference to those in receipt of old-age pensions we heard the ridiculous statement that the rand today is worth only 40 cents in comparison with what it was worth in 1948 and, they wanted to know, what about the old-age pensioners&#x003F; Look how badly off they are compared with their situation in 1948! In the first place, if the value of the rand is compared with its equivalent in 1948 it is not worth 40 cents, but 50 cents. That is the factual position. For argument&#x2019;s sake let me concede to the clever hon. member that its value is 40 cents. In the days when the land was flowing with milk and honey, that side of the House had only a maximum of R10 per month for an aged person who had nothing, who had no other means of subsistence. In those days there was a means test which made it impossible for most elderly people to receive even that amount. Money was supposed to be in abundant supply then, but in truth there were more poor people at that time than there are today. They are now posing as the people who are the friends of the poor man; not only are they posing as the friends of the poor man, but they also say that in their time they had more money than they knew what to do with. All they had to spare for the poor man in that time of plenty, was R10 per month. That is what they had to spare for him. But let us now assume that the rand today is worth 40 cents as compared with 1948. If we wanted to treat the poor elderly people on the same basis as they treated them, we would today be giving them only R25 per month. Instead of that, we are giving them R38 per month.</p>

<p>Now the hon. member says that their living standards have risen. Of course living standards have risen, for it is this Government which has caused them to rise. [Interjections.] That being so, we are giving the elderly people not merely the R25 according to the standards of the United Party, but we are giving them R38 per month.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Is that sufficient&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I will never say that what you are doing for an elderly person or a sick person is sufficient, for you can never do enough for them. However, you do what you can, taking into consideration the funds at your disposal. This Government has done what it could considering the funds at its disposal, and every reasonable person has to admit this. If the hon. member now asks me whether it is sufficient, let me say this to him: The hon. members say that in their time there was no lack of funds; they had money in abundance, but they gave him a miserable R10 per month. These are the people who are posing as the friends of the poor man. The hon. members speak of a time when the land was flowing with milk and honey, but ask the bricklayer of that time what he was earning; ask the constable, the clerk, the professional man or the teacher of that time what he was earning then. He will tell them. I want to make it clear that it is the declared policy of the Government to raise the salaries and wages and the standards of living of all workers. White and non-White, in so far as it has control over these matters, and to encourage this being done. Not only is this the policy of the Government; the Government has in fact done so. Sir, I want to say that the Government will do this whenever it is justified, and provided the Government and the country can afford it. When I say that the Government will do everything in its power to raise the standard of living, I would be neglecting my duty, considering the position in which I find myself, if I did not once again make an urgent appeal to our people and say: You are entitled to every possible comfort and convenience; it is the right of the man who has worked for it to have this, but in heaven&#x2019;s name, let us in future live within our means in South Africa.</p>

<p>Hon. members opposite also voiced the complaint that South Africa had allegedly deteriorated to such an extent under the regime of this Government. Let us examine that complaint, taking into account the fact that, according to their own calculation, the rand is today worth 40 cents as against the value of the rand in 1948. What do we find&#x003F; I find, according to the statistics, that the average wage of all factory workers, Whites and non-Whites, increased threefold over the period from 1948 to 1970. Whereas the average wage was R453 in 1948, the average for all workers today is R1 376. If one takes only the White workers&#x2019; wage into account, then it has increased fourfold, as an inevitable result of the scarcity of his labour <span class="col_389-390" refersTo="page_0210"/>and his greater proficiency and productivity. Whereas the average White worker only earned R864 in 1948, the average worker earned R3 577 in 1970. Let us now consider the non-Whites. The non-Whites&#x2019; wages have increased almost threefold over the period from 1948 to 1970. In 1948 the average income of the non-White factory worker was R254. Today his average income is R689.</p>

<p>Sir, let us consider the cost of living. The cost of living today is twice what it was in 1948. That is what every person who has knowledge of this matter says. But let us consider only 1970 and 1971. In 1970 average wages increased by 10 per cent, and in 1971 by 11 per cent; in other words, over a period of two years they increased by 21 per cent. The consumers&#x2019; index indicates an increase in the cost of living in 1970 of 4,1 and in 1971 of 6,9&#x2014;a general increase of 11 percent; in other words, the worker is, as far as that period is concerned, still 10 per cent to the good.</p>

<p>Let us now consider the non-Whites. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition levelled a reproach at me in passing in regard to this matter, but he did not quote what I had said at my Press conference. I made it very clear there, and this is also the policy of the Government, that there is no law which lays down a minimum wage for Whites and a maximum wage for non-Whites. There are, in fact, the Industrial Conciliation Act and the Wage Act which control these aspects, and they specifically provide that there may be no discrimination on the grounds of race or colour against a person when wages are determined. In addition, there is the Bantu Labour (Settlement of Disputes) Act. As a result of the intervention in terms of that Act, it is calculated that non-Whites have profited to the amount of R5 million per annum as far as their wages are concerned.</p>

<p>As far as the gap is concerned, it is the declared policy of the Government to narrow that gap, which is an historical one. We have stated this on various occasions. We are dealing here with an historical gap, in the same way as there is an historical gap in respect of equal wages for men and women. All that any government can set itself to do in that regard is to narrow the gap, and this Government is committed.</p>

<p>It is not necessary for the hon. member to speculate on what appeared in the newspapers; his Leader had the speech made by the hon. the Minister in front of him when he spoke, and nothing whatsoever about that is stated therein. He did not even ask for equality. I made this absolutely clear at my Press conference, and the hon. the Leader of the Opposition had that in front of him as well, but when he attacked me on this, he did not deem it advisable in all fairness, to read it out. I said on that occasion that, as far as the subject discussed by Minister Gerdener was concerned, his general statements were correct and that nobody could dispute them, but that there could be no danger of bloodshed in South Africa because those circumstances did not exist in South Africa. [Interjection.] I say this for the simple reason that there are no minimum wages for Whites and no maximum wages for non-Whites. I say this for the simple reason that there are many thousands of non-Whites earning better salaries than Whites, and that there are non-Whites whose living standards are higher than those of certain Whites; in other words Sir, we are not dealing with a privileged group of Whites here in South Africa who have entrenched their position at the top so that the non-Whites can never catch up with them; we do not have a position in South Africa where a ceiling <span class="col_391-392" refersTo="page_0211"/>has been established for the non-Whites, and where they have been told: &#x201C;Beyond that ceiling you may not go&#x201D;.

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition attacked me on that, and what is the background to the situation, Sir&#x003F; We are aware that there was a strike in Owambo. We are aware that that strike was settled as a result of an inter-governmental agreement negotiated by Minister M. C. Botha. Subsequently incidents occurred, and Minister M. C. Botha referred to those incidents in his statement. Immediately after that statement was made, there was in the first place the headline in the <i>Argus,</i> the statement by the Leader of the Opposition, and there was, as always, the presumptuous action of the member for Pietermaritzburg District, who immediately wanted to go on a &#x201C;factfinding mission&#x201D;, instead of trying to find himself. If one consults the newspapers published at the time, one will see that they wanted to blow up the situation into a major issue, and not only a major issue which would dominate South African politics, but a major issue which was to dominate international politics. That is perhaps what some hon. members on the opposite side wanted&#x2014;I do not know. But immediately it was then put forward that there was a news black-out, and, as always, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition&#x2014;he always sees something sinister behind everything&#x2014;has now said that I should take the country into my confidence, for everything is not as it should be in Owambo. There is nothing sinister about it, Sir. After all, we have said now that the labour question was solved; it was solved, but the agitators began to scavenge, as they are want to do, not only here in South Africa, but also in Rhodesia and other parts of the world where there are always agitators who come to scavenge. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition now refers me to my statement. What did I say in my statement&#x003F; In the first place I said that there was no crisis in South-West Africa, in Owambo, and there is no crisis in Owambo.

<p>Sir, I do not mind the hon. the Leader of the Opposition referring derogatorily to this Government; it is part of his task, but, Sir, he has been in Owambo himself; several of his members have been to Owambo and surely they know, and surely my hon. friend knows, who the people are who are opposed <span class="col_393-394" refersTo="page_0212"/>to the Government of Owambo. The Government which has been established there&#x2014;whether my hon. friend agrees with them or not&#x2014;is the authority in Owambo. Surely he knows that the people who are opposed to them are SWAPO. Surely he knows that it is the communists and the Anti-Apartheid Movement that want to eliminate that Government. Surely he knows that it is the extremists of the Organisation for African Unity who want to destroy this Government. Surely he knows that the agitators active in Owambo at the present time are in fact the agents of SWAPO and their people. Sir, you can do anything, but you must not jeopardize the authority of that Government in the eyes of those people by referring in your Parliament&#x2014;and this was done through the mouth of the Leader of the Opposition&#x2014;to them as a puppet government. Those agitators can turn around tomorrow and say: &#x201C;Why should we take any notice of the Government of Owambo&#x003F; It has come from the highest authority, it has been said in Parliament, that they are a puppet government; we need not take any notice of them.&#x201D; Sir, differ with them if you wish, but do not call them by that ugly name, for by doing so you are undermining the authority in Owambo.</p>

<p>I now want to say to my hon. friend, as well as to other hon. members on that side of the House: This Government of Owambo has shown itself to be a responsible Government; this Government has shown itself to be a realistic government and one which is mindful of the welfare of its people. This Government has shown itself to be a government to which resposibility may be entrusted. Sir, I want to express my gratitude and appreciation towards the Government of Owambo for the exceptional sense of responsibility it has displayed. But I want to cross swords with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition on another issue in this regard. I was surprised to hear these words uttered by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, and that is why I immediately asked him: &#x201C;Why call them a puppet government&#x003F;&#x201D;, to which he replied, &#x201C;Because they do not have enough powers &#x2026; and the hon. the Minister knows it.&#x201D;</p>

Sir, that is typical of hon. members on the opposite side. I really want to make a very serious appeal to them. I have done this on a previous occasion and I want to do so again now.

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said to this hon. Minister: &#x201C;Do not give me comparisons with fifth-rate nations&#x201D;, and the comparisons made here were in fact with those countries. But I leave it at that. I want to refer to a similar statement made in this connection in this debate by the hon. member for Hillbrow. I do not think one should take too much notice of the hon. member for Hillbrow, but I must express my very great displeasure at the fact that <span class="col_395-396" refersTo="page_0213"/>the hon. member for Hillbrow used the following words with reference to the visit of President Banda; &#x201C;We are so famished in this respect that when a small, impoverished state from the north comes here in order to ask for alms as it were, it is regarded as a major diplomatic breakthrough.&#x201D; Sir, what hope do we have of establishing good relations in Africa if leading members on the opposite side use language such as this&#x003F; But what is more, Dr. Banda came here as President of Malawi and as the guest of the South African Government, as the guest of South Africa. Sir, he did not come to beg. What right does the hon. member for Hillbrow have to accuse him of coming to South Africa on a begging mission&#x003F; On what grounds did he make that assertion&#x003F; One can understand now why even the <i>Sunday Times</i> takes no notice of him. Sir, because his snide and uncalled for remarks have been placed on record, I want to place it on record here that Dr. Banda did not come to South Africa to beg. As for his reference to Malawi as a &#x201C;small, impoverished state&#x201D;, I want to point out that it is a state of Africa in its own right, a responsible state with a responsible president as its leader. Sir, it is true that Malawi is a poor country, but I want to say this to the hon. member for Hillbrow, and he can put it in his pipe and smoke it: Malawi is poor, but Malawi is decent. Malawi is not only decent, Malawi is also responsible. I want to express my appreciation. Here we have a country which is poor; they know that they are poor, but they are doing their best, through hard work, to escape from their poverty. We achieve nothing by addressing other states in this disparaging manner, whether they be big or small, rich or poor. But why is Malawi addressed in this fashion; why is the Government of Owambo referred to in such derogatory terms&#x003F; Sir, it is because they are favourably disposed to South Africa. Those who are favourably disposed to South Africa must be discredited; they must be made to look ridiculous. The heroes of the hon. the Leader of the Progressive Party in this House and her kindred spirits&#x2014;and the hon. member for Hillbrow is one of them&#x2014;are Zambia, where Kapwepwe is at present being held in prison just because he is in the Opposition, and Tanzania&#x2014;and when the hon. member was there on this circus tour which she and Colin Eglin made, she bubbled over about what exemplary states these were. This will be my only reference to the Progressive Party. If I, as another leader, may tell the hon. the Leader of the Progressive Party in Parliament something, it is that it is time the Progressive Party grew up. The other day I heard someone say&#x2014; and I have never yet heard a better description of the Progressive Party: &#x201C;It is all gas but no paraffin.&#x201D; It is high time they grew up. They can make appointments and issue statements about all sorts of things, but when an election has to be fought one sees nothing of them. I want to say that they are no factor in South African politics and never will be.</p>

<p>I know nothing of any reference to it as a &#x201C;fake&#x201D; photograph. I want to tell you, I sat there and that photograph was taken at a certain occasion, and in addition I want to tell the hon. the Leader of the Opposition this: he and his people may abuse that <span class="col_397-398" refersTo="page_0214"/>as much as they like; they may abuse it to their hearts&#x2019; content; it will not yield any returns in Brakpan.

<p>But let us continue. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition reproached me with not spending enough on education, both White education and non-White education. On a previous occasion I pointed out to the hon the Leader of the Opposition that proportionately, <i>pro rata,</i> we have more students at university than any other country in the world. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition quoted figures here that are not correct. [Interjections.] I shall furnish all the replies. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition told us&#x2014;I am looking for it here in his Hansard&#x2014;how the amount spent by us on education has decreased under this Government.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>As a percentage of the national income, from 3 per cent to 2&#x00BD; per cent.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is exactly what I wanted to look for in order to tell you that you are wrong. This is what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We are spending a smaller percentage of our national income on education than we were doing 20 years ago. The percentage has dropped from 3 per cent to 2&#x00BD; per cent.</block>

<p>There are many ways in which one can calculate this. Various calculations have been made in this connection by various people. I have had an authoritative calculation made, and it shows that we spent 3,5 per cent on education in 1950 and that it increased to 4,56 per cent in 1970. I shall now quote this sentence to the hon. member&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is important to note that the above-mentioned figures are only in respect of the State. If the share contributed by the students and the private sector is added, it will be considerably higher.</block>

<p>So much for the figures which the Leader of the Opposition himself mentioned. This share has been included in the figures for the other countries of the world, but in our case it is just the State&#x2019;s contribution, while the contributions made by private students and the private sector have not been included. If the contributions made by the students and the private sector are included, it will be considerably higher. For example, if regard is had to the fact that we have about 61 000 full-time students, and the amount is calculated at R700 per student per year, it comes to R42 million, and this should already change the picture; and if schoolchildren are added, the percentage expenditure will be even higher. I say that this is in fact the figure we are spending, but now the hon. the Leader has said we are not doing enough. Sir, as in the case of the pensions I referred to, one can never do enough in this connection. One can always do more, but if the money one has available is taken into account, I want to tell you that <i>pro rata</i> South Africa is doing more than any other country to have proportionately more students at university. Just take engineers, for example, of whom we have an acute shortage in this country. In 1959 the registered number of engineering students at all our engineering faculties was 2 495. In 1970 the figure increased to 4 861, in other words, it has exactly doubled from 1959 to the present time.</p>

<p>But now I want to come to another matter. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition levelled the reproach at me that we were not spending enough money on non-White education. I now want to know from him &#x2026; I shall wait until he has finished with Achitofel. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition levelled the reproach at me across the floor of the House mat we were not spending enough on non-White students. I now want to know this from him: What has he done with his leader in South-West Africa, because he is no longer merely an occasional United Party man; he is now a full-blooded United Party man, because he has been incorporated. With reference to this matter and to Owambo, the Leader of the United Party in South-West Africa, Senator Percy Niehaus, said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In order to create a good image overseas the Government have spoilt the Owambos with too much kindness.</block>

<p>He went further and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They have seen all this money poured into their homelands, into the new hospitals, schools, colleges and so on.</block>

<p><span class="col_399-400" refersTo="page_0215"/>Across the floor of this House he has the temerity to tell me we are spending too little on non-White education.</p>

<p>But, Sir, I must hurry. The urban Bantu have been discussed in the past few days. I also want to say a few words in this regard. During the recess urgent discussions were held with urban Bantu. I personally devoted three days to those discussions. I want to say that these discussions were of a high order and penetrating. The one impression I carried away with me is that, although the urban Bantu, precisely as my colleague, one, two or more Minister M. C. Botha said, may have been urbanized for generations, they all still have their national affiliations. I put the question to them on every occasion, and they replied that all of them still had their national affiliations, and that they knew of no one who did not. Here I want to emphasize the National Party&#x2019;s view in this connection very clearly, a view which is correct, i.e. that one cannot see the urban Bantu as divorced from his homeland and the people to which he belongs, that one must see the two in the same framework and that all one&#x2019;s actions must be based on the fact that he is and wants to remain a member of his people. I want to congratulate my colleague&#x2019;s department on the machinery they have created in this connection. I want to say that there will be development as far as the urban Bantu are concerned, and that development will be within the framework of the National Party&#x2019;s policy.</p>

<p>But I now want to ask the hon. the Leader a question, a question to which he has not yet replied and which was put to him on 3rd October, 1971, by Hogarth de Hoogh. For all I know, this may be the member for Kensington. I do not know. He begins the article by stating&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I was intrigued by a remark made by the Leader of the Opposition, Sir De Villiers Graaff. At the United Party&#x2019;s Natal congres&#x2014;she said that the U.P. were regularly in touch with non-White leaders in South Africa and consulted them in framing the party&#x2019;s policy.</block>

<p>Then they say that it strikes them as strange, that they are surprised about it. I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Now Sir Villiers Graaff tells an altogether different story. What about it, Sir De Villiers&#x003F; Disclosure of this information, with the permission of the non-White leaders concerned, of course, would show that the U.P. are more on the ball than some of the critics say they are.</block>

<p>Let the hon. the Leader now be &#x201C;on the ball&#x201D; and tell us who the persons are with whom he held discussions.</p>

<p>But let me go further. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition made use of this opportunity to move a motion of no confidence in the Government, that is his right; in fact, it is the opportunity an Opposition must make use of to criticize the Government, but not only to criticize the Government, but also to state a general policy. What is more important than this, is that they must prove to the <span class="col_401-402" refersTo="page_0216"/>country that they are indeed an alternative government. Let us now take a look at this Opposition which is making these claims. We need not say what my friend here says and what my friend there says. Let us look at what they themselves are saying. Let us also look at their friends&#x2019; comments on who and what they actually are. After all, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition says I have lost control. He also says that our policy has failed and that we do not know where we are going. However, the <i>Sunday Times</i> has never referred to us as a &#x201C;party which has lost its way&#x201D;. What is more, even their enthusiastic supporter, the <i>Cape Times,</i> has had to realize there is no clarity in their ranks. On 17th September the <i>Cape Times</i> spoke of &#x201C;Graaff to clear up confusion tonight&#x201D;. Let us now see how he cleared up the confusion. We see that part of the confusion was due to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. &#x201C;Sensation at party congress&#x201D;, stated the <i>Cape Times</i> of 18th September, and &#x201C;Japie Basson&#x2019;s attack on U.P, policy&#x201D;.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It does not matter to me now what <i>Die Vaderland</i> says. What matters to me is what the <i>Cape Times</i> says and, what is even more important, what Japie says and what Graaff says. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout did not get a turn to speak and has not taken part in this debate. We are all interested in whether hon. members opposite should sit here and whether I should sit over there. Let us now try to analyse the matter calmly. In <i>The Star</i> of 31st August the following was stated in an article entitled &#x201C;Background to the News&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As for the criticism of the United Party&#x2019;s attitude to Bantustans, the U.P. has only itself to blame for Mr. Marais&#x2019;s statement to <i>The Star</i> last week being regarded as new policy. What the party believes in and what is part and parcel of its policy is not put across forcibly.</block>

<p>Mr friend is losing his strength. I read on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You never knew where the emphasis lies and what the party advocates.</block>

<p>That is what an observer such as <i>The Star</i> has to say about the United Party which, in the words of the hon. member for Pinelands, is asking, &#x201C;Please make way for us&#x201D;. We must now make way for a party about which <i>The Star</i> says: &#x201C;You never know where the emphasis lies and what the party advocates&#x201D;. Does the hon. member for Pinelands see how ridiculous he was&#x003F;</p>

<p>Let us go further and in passing look at the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 29th August. There they charge the hon. member for Yeoville with certain things, and quite rightly so in my opinion. This is now the party that tells us they are the alternative government that must take over. Then the confusion was virtually over according to some people and according to hon. members opposite. On 4th October the following leader appeared in <i>The Star</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The <i>Sunday Times</i> says United Party policy has changed and the <i>Sunday Express</i> says it has not. Mr. Marais Steyn says, of course, it has not. Mr. Japie Basson says it has, but then again it has not.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I can already see the hon. member for Bezuidenhout standing in a patch of flowers, picking the petals and saying: &#x201C;We have, we have not, we have, we have not &#x2026;&#x201D; But this is the party that wants to take over; that is the party that says we must please make way for them right away. But the report continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Japie Basson says it has, but then again it has not, and Mr. Myburgh Streicher blames the confusion on the fact that not enough people took the trouble to know what it was in the first place.</block>

<p>This is the party that must take over from us, but let us continue.</p>

But when this so-called confusion had already been cleared up, another report appeared in this connection in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> on 2nd November. The House must know about these things. The report reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Cape Town. The Leader of the United Party in the Transvaal, Mr. Marais Steyn, M.P., and the Leader of the Party in the Cape, Mr. Myburgh Streicher, M.P., last night reacted strongly to a statement by their colleague, Mr. Japie Basson, that the United Party accepts the right to independence of certain advanced homelands.</block>

<p>But let us continue and come to the hon. member for Green Point, who interrupted me earlier on. Just take something like the gap between the salaries and wages of Whites and those of non-Whites. When my hon. colleague Minister Schoeman asked him a question, he blandly pulled out the little booklet and said: &#x201C;This is our policy&#x201D;.

<p>No, I am speaking about the United Party now; I am speaking about you. In <i>The Star</i> of Monday, 23rd August, I read the following about this subject&#x2014;not even to mention other subjects&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sir De Villiers Graaff in one respect recovers some of the ground he lost last week. It remains to be seen, however, whether the United Party is facing the full implications of his policy to close the wage gap. Last week he said that the United Party believed that in State service there should ultimately be equal pay for equal work for all races. Predictably he was criticised for this.</block>

<p>We know what they said about him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He has ultimately placed him way behind at least two Cabinet Ministers. Over the week-end he made some amends. He said equal pay for equal work should be implemented at once and he seemed, rightly, to extend this condition to all forms of work, not only in the Public Service.</block>

<p>But then <i>The Star</i> asks this question, and so do I&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But what we all want to know is how the U.P. would set about this</block>

<p>In conclusion: The cornerstone of any party&#x2019;s policy for the future is Bantu representation in this House of Assembly, for the way in which and the extent to which they are allowed into this House of Assembly will, more than anything else, determine the future of South Africa. Our standpoint is very clear; I need therefore say nothing about it. The standpoint of my friend over there is also clear; I need say nothing about that. His standpoint is that there will be eight White representatives and that they will remain at eight unless the electorate directs, by way of a referendum or a special election, that this should be changed. We know&#x2014;it is stated in their sixpence policy&#x2014;that if a person does not subscribe to that policy it is &#x201C;tickets&#x201D; for him; then he must go.</p>

<p>I now come to a statement made by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. I am referring to his full speech as he delivered it to the Transvaal congress. In that speech the hon. member for Bezuidenhout used these words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One of the first things they &#x2026;</block>

<p>The word &#x201C;they&#x201D; refers to certain leaders of the United Party, this is very clear from the context, for earlier in his speech he said that he had become a member of a certain study group, as many other members had done. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to mention just a few of the names of the people who have joined this discussion group; Chief Gatsha Buthelezi, the leader of the Zulus; Mr. M. P. Morani, the editor of <i>Bantu World;</i> Dr. Dick van der Ross, a prominent Coloured leader; Mr. C. M. Ndamse, a member of the Transkei Cabinet; Mr. Pat Puvalingam, a prominent Indian leader from Durban, and several well-known White people in South Africa.</block>

<p>This is taken from a <i>verbatim</i> report of his speech.</p>

<p><span class="col_405-406" refersTo="page_0218"/>I just want to ask the hon. member for Bezuidenhout in passing why he did not also inform his Congress that the kingpins of this discussion group were Colin Eglin, the leader of the Progressive Party, and himself&#x003F;</p>

<block name="quote">My advice to them is: Live in a fool&#x2019;s paradise. Let them! But my plea to my party is this: Don&#x2019;t let us try to bluff our youth as to what lies in store for them.</block>

<p>Then he went on to say what I should like to refer to&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One of the first things that they will learn is that the time is past that a White man can say to a non-White leader, &#x201C;I am prepared to work with you, but you must talk to me through a White man and choose a White man to represent you.&#x201D; It will be very much better to offer no representation at all, but whatever contact and consultation there is to be in future, it will have to be direct.</block>

<p>Here we have a rejection of United Party policy by one of its prominent members.

I have listened to the discussions which have been held here; I have given thought to the discussions which have not been held here; and I am convinced, like every colleague on the opposite side of the House, that the years ahead are not merely going to be of very great importance, for if we consider what is happening in various parts of the world, if we consider the progress the communists have made, if we consider the chaos, the struggles and the bloodshed occurring in various parts of the world at the present time, then it arouses concern for the period ahead; it causes concern to everyone who has the welfare of the world at heart. The time has come for one to ask oneself again: What lies behind it all&#x003F; Against what must we entrench ourselves and against what must we be on our guard&#x003F; Sir, I have read a great deal on this matter, but I want to tell you frankly&#x2014;and therefore I do not apologize for taking up the time of the House on this matter &#x2014;that the best comment I have found on it is a short passage written more than 40 years ago in this regard by Sir Winston Churchill.</p>

<p>It makes no difference now whether or not I agreed with him previously. It is not relevant now. What is relevant is that the words he wrote at the time, are true. This is what he wrote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Communism is not only a creed; it is a plan of campaign. A communist is not only the holder of certain opinions; he is the pledged adept of a well-thoughtout means of enforcing them. The anatomy of discontent and revolution has been studied in every phase and aspect and a veritable drill book prepared for subverting all existing institutions. The method of enforcement is as much a part of the communist&#x2019;s faith as the doctrine itself. At first the time-honoured principles of liberalism and democracy are invoked to shelter the infant organism. Free speech, the right of public meeting, every form of lawful political agitation and constitutional right are paraded and asserted. Alliance is sought with every popular movement towards the left. The creation of a mild liberal or socialist r&#x00E9;gime in some period of convulsion is the first milestone, but no sooner has this been created than it is to be overthrown. Woes and scarcity resulting from the confusion must be exploited. Collisions, if possible attended with bloodshed, are to be arranged between the agents of the new government and the working people. Martyrs are to be manufactured. An apologetic attitude in the rulers should be turned to profit. Specific propaganda may be made, a mask of hatred never before manifested amongst men. No faith need be, indeed may be, kept with the non-communist. Every act of goodwill, of tolerance, of conciliation, on the part of governments or statesmen is to be utilized for their rule. Then, when the time is ripe and the moment opportune, every form of lethal violence, from mob revolt to private assassination, must be used without stint or compunction. The citadels will be stormed under the banners of liberty and democracy and once the apparatus of power is in the hands of the brotherhood, all opposition, all contrary opinions, must be extinguished by death. Democracy is but a tool to be used and afterwards broken, liberty but a sentimental folly unworthy of the logician. The absolute rule of the self-chosen priesthood according to the dogmas it has learnt by rote is to be imposed upon mankind without mitigation for ever. All this, set out in the prosy text books, written also in blood in the history of several powerful nations, is the communist&#x2019;s faith and purpose. To be forewarned should be to be forearmed.</block>

<p>We too, Sir, must take this to heart in these times. It will be of decisive importance to every one of us, when we consider these matters, to manage our race relations in such a way that there is an assured place for everybody in South Africa. We should always be asking ourselves how we are going to get along with one another, for that is the question which is <span class="col_411-412" refersTo="page_0221"/>going to determine the future. This will require great patience, it will require regular consultations, and it will require that we lend an ear to problems and bottlenecks. It also means that inciters and agitators must be kept in check. Race relations can easily become strained and can sometimes be very delicate under the circumstances. The world is full of this, if we think of Nigeria, if we think of Cyprus, if we think of the present relations between Jew and Arab, between Moslem and Hindu, between the British and the Irish. We have examples of this through-out the world.</p>

<p>I think that our Parliament should keep an eye on all organizations and should keep an eye on all trends which may possibly in this connection be giving rise to subversion. I emphasize the word &#x201C;possibly&#x201D;, for in this connection we cannot afford to make a mistake. If we should make a mistake, with the potentially explosive situation we have in South Africa, we would have to pay dearly for it. I have mentioned Parliament deliberately, because in my humble opinion Parliament can rightly play a role in regard to this matter, and I do not for one moment doubt that Parliament will play its role in this regard. I believe that Parliament should take cognizance of four organizations which exist in South Africa; four organizations with widespread subsidiaries and ramifications. I believe that Parliament should take cognizance of these bodies. I believe that Parliament, as the chief guardian of our liberties, should acquaint itself with the objectives and activities of these organizations and their subsidiaries, their contacts and their financing.</p>

<p>For that reason I intend proposing as soon as possible that a Select Committee of this Parliament be appointed to investigate the objectives, activities, etc., which I have mentioned here, of the following four organizations: the University Christian Movement, Nusas, the Christian Institute and the Institute of Race Relations. Sir, I do not want to pronounce any judgment on these people at the present moment; I do not want to place them in the dock in anticipation, but in view of the information at my disposal, I would be neglecting my duty if I did not tell Parliament that the information indicates that there is a <i>prima facie</i> case here which needs to be investigated. I believe that Parliament, as the guardian of liberty, should undertake that investigation by means of a Select Committee, consisting of members of both parties, and once Parliament has done that, Parliament will have acted in the interests of South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Prime Minister, in a lengthy reply, has given us the full gamut of his platform tricks and of the manner in which, I have no doubt, he performs at &#x201C;stryddae&#x201D; of his party in various parts of South Africa. But I am glad, Sir, that he finished on a more serious note and warned of the dangers of international Communism and its possible effects on our lives in South Africa. I want to say to him that I believe&#x2014;I believe this side of the House has always believed&#x2014;that one of the ways to fight Communism is to remove those fields of dispute, those fertile fields, to be exploited by the agitator in the field of race relations. One of the ways to combat Communism is to ensure that the methods you use in fighting even your opponents are not the same sort of methods that communists themselves use, because you run a real danger very often, in fighting Communism, that you will introduce the very methods that you dislike most about that system.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. gentleman quoted Churchill&#x2019;s well-known statement on Communism. He might as well have quoted the address of the late Field-Marshal Smuts on that subject when he was installed as Chancellor of the University of Cambridge. He was, I think, perhaps one of the first world statesmen to warn against the insidious methods being used by communist powers to infiltrate those whom they felt they could not overthrow in other ways. It is noticeable, Sir, that within four years of this Government&#x2019;s taking over, the Prime Minister of the day, Dr. Malan, made a statement in which he referred to a Police report that had been compiled during the years when the United Party was in power. He pointed out how serious the situation had been and said: &#x201C;Of course, the situation is much worse now,&#x201D; after four years of a Nationalist Government in power. Sir, at various times during the currency of this Government we have heard from various Ministers on that side that Communism and communist activities in South Africa have been limited (aan bande gel&#x00EA;) and that they had, so to speak, been destroyed.</p>

<p>One cannot help feeling that one of the fields in which they are most interested in South Africa is the field of race relations.

The interesting thing, Sir, is that the hon. the Minister of Defence, who is responsible for the security of the country in that regard, told an audience, as reported in the <i>Cape Times,</i> that the United Party was making propaganda with the story that independent Bantustans could form alliances with communist countries.

<p>But I go further. Sir, I say quite clearly this Minister of Defence is prepared to take the same risks as the Prime Minister to the everlasting <span class="col_415-416" refersTo="page_0223"/>regret of South Africa. I say that if there was anything responsible for the fact that Communism is the danger that it is in South Africa, it is the non-European policy of this Government. Sir, let us look at what is happening. A lot has been said in this debate about the urban Bantu. A lot has been said about the Government&#x2019;s non-European policies and the creation of independent Bantustans. I reiterate the danger that could arise if one of those independent states entered into negotiations with communist countries. We know, Sir, what has been happening already; we know that there are communist embassies in certain of the independent states on our borders. We know that Botswana and Soviet Russia are seeking to enter into diplomatic relations. We know of the influence that was exercised by those communist countries in the recent elections in Lesotho, yet the Government goes on with a policy of this kind, destined to divide South Africa up and to create that danger to an ever-greater degree.</p>

<p>But, Sir, I believe that that danger exists as well in the attitude of the Government to the urban Bantu in South Africa. I think that is one of the main reasons why this issue was raised in the course of this debate. You see, Sir, when you look at the sort of situation that is developing in these areas, you find that many millions of people living in the urban townships, around our big industrial complexes, with no security of tenure, no home ownership, no right of family life, are getting a very indifferent opportunity for education for themselves and for their children; they are getting very little secondary education in those areas and they are becoming some of the big danger spots in South Africa. Mr. Speaker, look at what has been happening: You have a statement from the hon. the Deputy Minister in this House that he intends relaxing the provisions in respect of certain Bantu who are more or less permanently in those areas, to allow them to bring in brides from areas which are not prescribed, i.e. from the homelands or the rural areas, if they marry them. When that statement is greeted with acclamation by most people who have the interests of the country at heart, you find the hon. gentleman outside this House running away from that statement to a large extent and qualifying it as best he can. When one reads that statement, one finds first of all the declaration by him that teachers will be allowed to move with their families and will be given housing. Sir, why are teachers favoured above other professional classes which are almost as necessary&#x003F; Then the hon. gentleman says they will be allowed to bring their wives, if housing is available. What are they doing about housing for families in those Bantu townships&#x003F; How great have the cuts not been in respect of the Johannesburg and Durban municipalities in the housing for families in those Bantu townships&#x003F;</p>

<p>I think the paths of the two sides of the House diverged a long time ago when it came to the question of the urban Bantu. We accepted that they would be a permanent part of the industrial structure of South Africa, that they would be permanently in the White areas. We accepted that some 20 years ago. The other side of the House has regarded them as impermanent. They have not been prepared to give them any vested rights at all and their whole idea was to reduce their numbers as far as possible and to cut them down to well below what they are at the moment. In fact, we had hon. members and hon. Ministers on the other side of the House telling us how easy it was to get on without servants and how we would have to do without servants in future, as the urban Bantu were sent back to the Bantu homelands and the Bantu areas.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, The party sought to settle the Bantu problem by ridding South Africa for ever of the black man. When that is their philosophy, we now suddenly hear from this Deputy Minister that the plans for the urban Bantu are unfolding and these include additional opportunities for wives to be housed with their husbands under certain circumstances. He says also that there may be other things coming about which he is not prepared to speak at present. But if you look at the history of this Government you find that virtually every single one of its enactments concerning the urban Bantu, have been enactments of negative effect, to make them less secure, to give them the feeling that they do not belong in these urban areas and to give them the feeling that they are there as a privilege, only while they can work for the White people of South Africa. What has happened&#x003F; Whereas in the old days of the United <span class="col_417-418" refersTo="page_0224"/>Party home ownership for those people was allowed in those urban Bantu townships, now you have step after step being taken by this Government to put an end to the system of home ownership for the urban Bantu.</p>

<p>Let us look a little more closely at what that means. I have a report here which was the result of a conference of various municipalities on the question of Bantu housing not so long ago. The report states that until a few years ago Bantu in the urban areas were allowed to acquire their own homes or build them themselves. That approach was discontinued in 1968 and the municipalities were instructed to buy back those houses as and when they became vacant. They had to buy them back, but the Government supplied no funds for the buying back. Oh no, they left that to the municipalities, knowing that that would leave less money for additional housing for the urban Bantu in their areas. What is more, they undermined that pride which the individual Bantu had in his home. They deprived him of a source of saving, something which he could pass on to his wife and children and which he could sell at the end of his time in the White area, when he returned to a Bantu area. They placed these people in the position that where in the past they had made efforts to convert their modest homes into something more elaborate and more attractive, regarding them as a good investment in which they could take pride, and now we find the situation arising where they are tending more and more to neglect them because they belong to somebody else. Hon. members opposite had a lot to say about the fact that I visited Soweto, as I have done before on a number of occasions. I also visited Kwa Mashu and other townships in the country. On every occasion the best houses in those areas were where home ownership was allowed to the Bantu.</p>

<p>I go further. Not only have they restricted ownership of their own homes, but they have purposely restricted facilities for higher and vocational training of the urban Bantu in their own areas. They are told that they can only get that training in the Bantu homeland. Now we find the position that there is no State programme for training people to make them skilled in those areas. Training goes on clandestinely. They do skilled work, not as of right but by virtue of exemptions. Where one would have thought that this would be the source of skilled labour to go back to the Bantustans, this is being neglected and there is virtually nothing flowing from it.</p>

<p>What happens as well is that there is pressure from the Government to force traders and professional men to go back to the reserves. The decree has gone out that in the urban townships your Bantu doctors and professional men are not to practise. That work is to be done by the Whites in those areas. Surely this should have been one of the facilities which should have been available to these people; it would have had a tremendous psychological effect on them.</p>

<p>The Government boasts of the way in which it reduces the number of Bantu in the White areas, but it does not think of the consequences as far as the employer is concerned, having to replace people at short intervals and to get others in their places who are not trained for the work. You find the emphasis not on homes and home ownership; under this Government the emphasis is on the hostel system, which is being enforced more and more, and on the pass laws, which are being more and more strictly enforced in those areas. Then you have this hon. Minister coming along and saying that he is not making concessions, although be used the word &#x201C;vergunning&#x201D;. He says &#x201C;Dit is geen vergunning nie&#x201D;, but a logical unfolding of Government policy. Sir, this is not a logical unfolding of Government policy. It is a complete negation of Government policy and the hon. gentleman knows it. I welcome it, but I fear that as applied by this Government and this Minister it will be a stop-go affair, because he is going to find that he will encounter resistance from his own people who have been told that these Bantu in the urban areas are here merely temporarily and that they should seek their future in the Bantu homelands.</p>

<p>The whole basis of his philosophy and that of his party is that these urban Bantu retain their tribal affiliations. I accept at once that they know which Bantu nation they belong to. They know which tribe they came from, or, in some cases, their parents came from. But to suggest that they have the same aspirations and desires and that they are the same sort of people any more as those who are living in the Bantu homelands is to stretch one&#x2019;s imagination to the absolute extreme. We have the evidence here of the hon. member for Potchefstroom and I have very seldom heard such <span class="col_419-420" refersTo="page_0225"/>biased evidence in my life. You see, I went to Soweto. This is what the Chairman of the Soweto Urban Council said: He abhorred tribalism because it could not benefit residents who were all faced with the same hardships and disabilities, regardless of their tribal background.</p>

<block name="quote">This applies to an even greater extent to South Africa where more than three million Whites are playing a leading role in this process of development. Whoever refuses to acknowledge this and still wants to dream about the evolution of some autogenous culture or the other for the Black man, is suffering from a form of romanticism which is simply out of touch with reality.</block>

<p>[Interjections.] That is the basis of the policy on which this Government has founded its provisions in respect of the urban Bantu. [Interjections.] Do you realize, Sir, that the urban Bantu population is growing at the rate of 4 per cent or 5 per cent per annum&#x003F; It is growing at a rate of over 150 000 per year at the present time. Do you realize that one of the experts of the Department of Planning believes that by the year 2000 there will be over 20 million urban Bantu in South Africa, and that they will account for over two-thirds of all urban inhabitants&#x003F;</p>

<p>I come back to the dangers of Communism. I come back to the effect of Communism and its doctrines upon people placed in that position. I want to ask hon. members of this House to look at it through their eyes. What do you find if you look at the situation as far as they are concerned and what do you see&#x003F; You see poverty induced by discriminatory restraints on what a man may do, which make orderly living and his privacy and the inculcation of civilized habits very difficult indeed. You see, Sir, the insecurity of tenure which makes all efforts for the future worthless. It makes him cautious and he does not adopt the provident habits of a civilized person. You see something which means a lot to the Bantu is the humiliation of the elders, whom he has been taught to look up to, as a result, very often, of contraventions of the pass laws. You see lack of proper educational training as of right in so far as these people are concerned.</p>

<p>I wonder what the consequence of that insecurity is going to be&#x003F; It is an insecurity, unfortunately, which is not declining; it is increasing. The tragedy is that a lot of real good is being done by this Government, as has been done by previous governments. I would be the first to recognize the quality of the health services which are provided, the work which is being done in slum clearance, the provision of primary education on a tremendous scale and improvements in job opportunities&#x2014;I think it is too slow, but it is happening. However, I am afraid all this weighs too lightly in the scale against the loss of the ordinary rights which every family man wants to enjoy, when the one is weighed up against the other.</p>

<p>I impute no ill motives to this Government&#x2014;far be that for me&#x2014;but I believe it has too long been blindly wrapped up in policies on paper, in blueprints which cannot work and in solutions for the Bantu problem which are being forced on to the Bantu without proper consultation or regard to their own wishes, and which is placing us in a position that Blacks in their millions are always going to be in and around our urban areas. I am afraid they are not going to be that settled population which we would so like to see in a troublesome world at the present time. You see, Sir, the policies of that side of the House are wrong. I think every South African knows they are wrong. Tragically, we all have to suffer for them. I think as far as we are concerned, we on this side of the House are very sick of the sense of guilt that one gets when one sees what is happening to the family life of the Bantu people under this Government, when one sees the conditions under which they live in these Bantu townships, when one looks at the unutterable waste of human material which could be put to good purpose, all because of the policies of this Government, and when one sees the short-sightedness of the arrogant attitude that is being employed by them. That is why we on this side of the House have been unable to accept those policies. That is why we have envisaged a different sort of policy for South Africa.</p>

<p>We have sought to see that the urban Bantu will get home ownership, that he will enjoy undisturbed family life where-ever possible, that there will be exemptions from the pass laws for the responsible Bantu, that there will be proper educational facilities, and that there will be active steps to try and promote the emergence of a responsible Bantu middle class that will be the greatest bastion against Communism you could build up in South Africa.</p>

<p>We realize also that economic prosperity is not all that is asked for by human beings at the present time. They want some say in how their lives are conducted and how their affairs are managed. While this Government has gone along the route of dividing South Africa up into separate states, we have gone along the route of trying to keep South Africa as one whole under a federal arrangement. This policy was enunciated a long time ago. It was first set out, I think, in booklet form in 1963, a booklet that went into eight editions. In it I set out very clearly that that policy would be put into operation by the United Party on coming into power in three stages which would necessarily overlap. I said that in the first stage we would see to it that certain of the senseless discriminatory laws that existed would be repealed and reviewed. I said that steps would be taken to see whether there were unnecessary invasions of the dignity and the freedom of individuals. I said steps would be taken to try and strengthen the economic position, so that there would be higher standards of living for all sections of the community.</p>

<p>Then came the second stage where I said we would create the machinery for consultation in South Africa. Part of that machinery would be the creation for each race group of what we call &#x201C;Communal Councils&#x201D;, which would manage their own affairs for them, those affairs of a most intimate nature. I indicated that we believe in consultation at all levels and that therefore there should be liaison between those Communal Councils and Parliament, and that that liaison should be by way of standing statutory committees in which White man and non-White man would meet around the table as representing each his own Parliament or Communal Council, discussing matters of concern to them. I believe that at that stage, while the machinery for consultation is being brought into operation, there should be representation for each non-white group here in Parliament. On the issue of the Bantu I said I believed their representation here should be by eight people, who should be White, and six in the Senate. I undertook that there would be no change otherwise than as the result of a referendum or an election in which that was the issue, and there was a substantial majority of the White voters in favour thereof. I indicated that I believed that, with the passage of time and the growth of consultation, we would reach a stage where we would be able to introduce a federal constitution in South Africa with the approval of the White electorate by a substantial majority by means of a referendum. In such a constitution White leadership will not only be accepted, but will also be entrenched. The rights of minorities will be protected and it will also allow for defined representation for each separate group. The hon. the <span class="col_423-424" refersTo="page_0227"/>Prime Minister is upset, because the hon. member for Bezuidenhout feels that it is wrong for Whites to represent non-Whites.</p>

I will tell him something else. They were not only unanimously accepted, but the delegates were so satisfied that by means of a unanimous resolution they gave me the power to change that policy at any time because they knew that I would never take any step that would not get the virtually unanimous support of the United Party.</p>

<p>*I want to tell the hon. the Prime Minister that if he thinks he can sow dissension in the ranks of the United Party with the sort of speech he delivered today, I simply want to say to him now that he is fishing on dry land. In addition, I should like to inform him that no secret sessions were held at that congress. Everything was discussed in public, and the policy of the United Party was approved.</p>

<p>*As far as the statements of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout are concerned, about &#x201C;paternalistic political crumbs&#x201D;, I want to say that our policy makes provision for the discussions the hon. member wants.

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>No. The difference between our party and the Nationalist Party is that we proceed by way of consultation at all levels to try and carry these people with us. The policy of that party on the other hand is to say to the people: &#x201C;This is the policy. You like it or you lump it. We will give you self-determination as to whether you have independence or nothing at all&#x201D;. That is their attitude. If there ever was a policy that endangered the whole future of South Africa, then it is the policy of this Government in respect, not only of the rural Bantu, but in effect, in respect also of the urban Bantu. If there is any one matter which makes me feel that this Government is unfit to govern South Africa and unworthy of the confidence of the people, then it is the attitude it has taken up in respect of non-White policy and its record in that regard.</p>

<p>I was challenged by the hon. member for Langlaagte&#x2014;I see he is not here&#x2014;that the demands we were making in respect of the urban Bantu were all new; he says that he has never seen them before. Those were enshrined in the 1954 policy statement of the United Party, what the hon. the Prime Minister called the &#x201C;sikspensbeleid&#x201D;. I am sure the hon. the Prime Minister will lend him a copy so that he does not make foolish statements of that kind again.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister has sought to reply to certain queries I put to him in respect of certain other matters. The first of those has to do with a statement by the hon. gentleman in respect of the Caprivi Strip and the activities which had taken place there. I asked the hon. the Prime Minister several questions in that regard. I asked him how it could have come about that a newspaper, the <i>Transvaler,</i> which interviewed him personally on the day he made that statement through its senior reporter, Mr. Van der Merwe, could have made such an entirely erroneous report the following day.</p>

<p>Mr. Vorster says he did not say this was happening &#x2026;</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Here is the report of the <i>Rhodesia Herald.</i> The hon. the Prime Minister says he never saw them. I accept it, but why should they make a statement of this kind&#x003F; Then we had a leading article in <i>Die Volksblad</i> dealing with this matter. Dealing with the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s statement, the article says:</p>

<block name="quote">Although Mr. Vorster did not say it all, most newspapers deduced from this that South African Police had crossed the border and that it was the Zambian border. This is the deduction which, in our opinion, would have been made by Zambia itself and at the United Nations, even had South African news media not done so.</block>

<p>The article reads further:</p>

<block name="quote">It appears that the Police pursuit took place only in the Caprivi Strip and that it was a difficult and time-consuming process, time which, if reports from Zambia are correct, might have been used to get Zambian forces to the border and to warn terrorists at whatever border.</block>

<p>I said there was newspaper reference to what I had said in that regard. The other thing the hon. the Prime Minister has not answered is why there was no reaction to the report in <i>Hoofstad</i> the afternoon he made that statement. There was a most sensational report in the chief city of the Republic, where the hon. the Prime Minister was holding his congress, and I cannot believe that there were no &#x201C;kongresgangers&#x201D;, no member of the Police or members of the Security Forces who drew his attention to it.</p>

If they had taken action that night, nine-tenths of the wrong publicity given that statement would never have occurred.

<p>The hon. gentleman dealt with the queries I raised in respect of the Agliotti matter. This is a really extraordinary affair. The hon. the Prime Minister expresses his regret at the delay. He reiterates the regret on this side of the House. Mr. Speaker, do you realize that, as a result of questions in this House, we elicited that inquiry must have started in September, 1970&#x003F; That means that that inquiry has been going on now for 17 or 18 months. Is it possible that, with our top investigators and the assistance of advocates in the employ of the State, we have not yet reached a stage where a charge can be laid or where it can be said that no charge can be laid&#x003F; Mr. Speaker, I reiterate: This is a most unsatisfactory state of affairs and I want to tell the hon. gentleman that he will get no rest from us until this matter is brought to a satisfactory conclusion.</p>

<p>Then we have the question of the statement made by the hon. the Minister of the Interior and repudiated by the hon. the Minister of Information. It would seem that the hon. the Prime Minister does not agree with the hon. the Minister of the Interior either because he disagrees that there is a danger of violence or he does not believe that these conditions obtain in South Africa. Well, what is he doing about that Minister&#x003F; Is he making sure he will not issue statements of that kind again&#x003F; Is he keeping him in his Cabinet if that sort of thing is allowed to go on&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. gentleman tells us what the policy of his Government is, namely to narrow the historical gap between White and non-White wages which exists in South Africa. Here he must help me: In the course of his speech he said that the salaries of White workers had quadrupled since 1948.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I was talking about factory workers. That is the example I quoted.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, he said that the salaries of factory workers had quadrupled since 1948. He also said that the salaries of non-White factory workers had trebled since 1948. In other words, out of his own mouth he stands condemned because the gap has been widened under this Government. The gap has been widened when the salaries of the White factory workers have quadrupled, that is they have been multiplied four times, while the non-White salaries have multiplied only three times. That means that the gap must be bigger now than it was at that stage. In fact, it must be very much bigger. Unfortunately that is a state of affairs that has been happening &#x2026;</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I am not arguing about the minimum which has been fixed by the Wage Board. The hon. the Prime Minister says that the salaries of White workers have quadrupled and that the salaries of non-White workers have trebled. That means that the gap is wider than it was before. You are faced with something else. The ratio paid to White and non-White professional men in the provincial services was 10:9:8 at one stage in 1964 and it was accepted that it would be so. Today in some cases it is as low as 10 to 5 under this Government, whose policy is to narrow &#x2026;</p>

<p>The ratio has been restored.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. gentleman says that the ratio has been restored. Maybe the ratio has been restored, but they are not enjoying the salaries yet. I can tell the hon. the Prime Minister that this hon. gentleman was in fact an Administrator and was, one can say, a co-conspirator in seeing that the wage and salary gap widened during the time he was Administrator of the province of Natal. I do not want to make anything serious of the conference the Prime Minister held and the interview he gave on this issue. He spoke of the Industrial Conciliation Act because he knows it does not apply to the Bantu or to the Civil Service. He spoke of the Wage Act and the fact that it prohibits discrimination. Furthermore, he spoke of the Labour Disputes Act. I accept all that, but he knows very well that even the minimum wages laid down by this Wage Board provide for vast differences in the type of job that is normally done by non-Whites and the type of job that is normally done by Whites. So, the whole impression created is a false one as far as the picture of South Africa is concerned. Here we are: a Cabinet with a policy to narrow the gap, but it is enlarging the gap; a Minister stating his own views, but he is contradicted by another Minister and largely contradicted by the hon. the Prime Minister himself. Indeed, very little progress has been made in that regard.</p>

<p>We dealt with the situation in Owambo and the hon. the Prime Minister took exception to my reference to the Owambo Government as a &#x201C;puppet government&#x201D; When he queried it across the floor of the House I said it was because of the limited powers they had. Hon. members know very well that there is a government which virtually have only advisory powers at present. It is a government with very limited powers indeed. I go so far as to say the following. The hon. the Minister has told us with pride that agreement has been reached between Government and Government on this issue of wage agreement. Where has that Owambo Government the power to enforce that agreement&#x003F;</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister says that I complain when it is proposed to give them more power. Let me tell that hon. Minister that it is the policy of this side of the House to have a communal council for that area and to give them far more powers than these hon. gentlemen have sought to give them. We are once more in the position that we are told that there has been a settlement. However, there is still unrest and there are still disturbances in the territory. I am a long way from being satisfied that the situation is now satisfactory.</p>

<p>Then we raised one other matter with the hon. the Prime Minister which concerned the unanswered questions arising from the Government&#x2019;s use of the vast powers it has to invade personal freedom in South Africa. We had difficulty with the hon. the Prime Minister who could not understand why we were not satisfied with findings of an inquest as to cause of death and the circumstances surrounding it and why we called for a judicial commission. I wonder if the hon. the Prime Minister does not feel that his failure to have these matters cleared up expeditiously and to the satisfaction of the overwhelming majority of the public of South Africa, is something which is doing the image of South Africa harm, not only in the outside world but in the field where he is seeking dialogue at the present time. I wonder if that accusation which he makes against us, viz. that we are allowing ourselves to be used as tools by communists, cannot be thrown back at the hon. gentleman because of the unfavourable publicity he is getting for South Africa because of his attitude in this matter. Few things can react more unfavourably than the hon. gentleman&#x2019;s remark in this House namely: why do you tell them there were only nine&#x003F; Only nine have committed suicide or are alleged to have committed suicide while in detention. Nine seems to me nine too many.</p>

Have they anything to do with the resultant suicide of no less than nine people while in detention&#x003F; That is the important question. No inquest can satisfy you on that.

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am not answering questions. I am replying and you have had five days in which to put your questions. I put this very seriously because I feel that it is most important that the concern which is felt by <span class="col_433-434" refersTo="page_0232"/>the public of South Africa be cleared up on these issues. Do not let the hon. the Prime Minister come along with the smear that we are playing the game of the communists or that we are friendly disposed towards the communists or anything of that kind. Concern exists among vast numbers of men who were not afraid to place their lives in jeopardy for South Africa and are prepared to defend it at all costs, even at the risk of their own lives. They say that they have every sympathy with those Police who have lost their lives on the border. They look upon them as comradesin-arms. We want the name of our country to stand high and clean amongst the nations of the world and we believe that that could have been achieved by a satisfactory judicial commission enquiring into these matters at that time.</p>

<p>I may say in passing that no good can come to South Africa or its good name by the fatuous denial by the hon. the Minister of Justice and the hon. the Minister of Police that we have any such thing as detention without trial in South Africa. What is the use of trying to play with words and to conceal the fact that people can be arrested by the Police and can be held indefinitely without trial for purposes of interrogation. That is detention without trial. They are detained and they cannot go away. It is without trial and indefinite. What does the hon. gentleman think he is achieving except making himself ridiculous by saying that there is no such thing as detentions without trial in South Africa&#x003F; They are creating an appalling image for the country when statements of that kind are made by Ministers who should be responsible persons.</p>

<p>The main gravamen of the attack in this debate has been on the Government&#x2019;s handling of the economic situation in South Africa. The hon. the Prime Minister dealt with that issue for only a few minutes in his reply. Certain of his Ministers have sought to meet the accusations made. Therefore I must deal with them. The hon. gentleman made reference to the satisfactory state of insolvencies from the official figures he had of insolvencies of individuals and firms.

What is interesting is the figure involved. The figure was R8,2 million in 1970 and R16,4 million in 1971. I hope my figures are wrong. These are figures that have been given me reliably as indicators of the situation at the present time.</p>

<p>The hon. gentleman is entitled to make his own conclusions.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what has been interesting about this debate has not been the attempts of hon. Ministers on the other side to answer the arguments or the criticisms advanced from this side of the House, but the consistent attempts to draw red herrings across the trail and to try and suggest that to be critical of South Africa in the commercial or the economic fields and to criticize any action taken by the Government, is to be disloyal to South Africa. It seems to me as if we have a new dictionary, a new use of words in respect of debates on economic issues at the present time. I want to say to the hon. the Prime Minister that I believe that if I and my colleagues had spent the major time of the House this week defending the cost of living when we knew what was going on or had put our case in such a way that the effects of a rising cost of living in South Africa were not brought out, or if we had spent our time castigating South Africans for living beyond their means instead of examining the basic reasons for people having to spend more, we would have been disloyal and unpatriotic, because I believe that being unpatriotic is not having the interests of your country and the welfare of the majority of the population at heart. I believe what is unpatriotic is this attempt to smear honest critics of the Government as persons who are disloyal to South Africa and unpatriotic. Sir, it is not done because they have answers to the arguments. No, Sir, it is done because they do not know what to reply at the present time.</p>

<p>It is about two months since we had devaluation. As I said in my opening address, devaluation has only bought time to set our house in order, and not much time at that. On the economic front, I believe this is the most important issue facing South Africa. As far as this side of the House is concerned, we have never criticized the Government for devaluing.</p>

We believe that if the Government had done its job properly, it might have been in a very different position. No Government wants to devalue. They always deny it till the last moment, and the hon. the Minister of Finance knows that; they always deny it to the last moment. It is not a course upon which a Government lightly embarks. We accept that the situation under this Government was so bad that there was no question but that they had to do it. But, Sir, devaluation is not an end in itself. Unless it is accompanied by certain other measures, in isolation it is a meaningless thing, and I believe that unless the other measures are taken, devaluation can have a very bad effect upon South <span class="col_437-438" refersTo="page_0234"/>Africa. That has been the burden of my argument. Sir, the hon. the Prime Minister took exception last night to the statements made by the hon. member for Constantia in which he seemed to indicate that there was a crisis situation in South Africa. Sir, it was rather interesting to read <i>Rapport</i> over the week-end, this Nationalist newspaper with a Nationalist Minister as Chairman of its board.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. the Minister of Finance can give his judgment again.

<p>Throughout this debate the accusation has come from the other side of the House that we have made no positive proposals in respect of the economic situation. You will recall, Sir, that I outlined what I believed to be the short-term measures to get the best benefits from devaluation. I said the aim of these measures should be simple and direct, i.e. to increase productivity, to get more goods and services off the production line as fast and as sufficiently as possible. Sir, who produces the goods and services&#x003F; The people who produce them are the businessmen of South Africa. Therefore I dealt with the various changes I believe should take place. Not one of those changes has been criticized by a member on the opposite side of the House; not one Minister has said whether they are accepting those recommendations or not. Not one Minister has told us whether they will take those steps or steps of that kind. I said that credit ceilings must be lifted even if not removed entirely. Are they going to do that&#x003F; I said the companies tax must be reduced so that business can once again be able to finance expansion from its own savings. Are they going to do that&#x003F; I said the tax on the rewards of risk-taking and the use of initiative and hard work at managerial level must be reduced. Will they do that&#x003F; The hon. the Minister of Finance did say that one of the advantages of devaluation was that he may be able to reduce taxation and loans. We have noted that, Sir. We shall watch this hon. <span class="col_439-440" refersTo="page_0235"/>gentleman. I went further and said exports must be encouraged on a realistic basis, and this must take into account the most important issue on the export front, i.e. to produce here in South Africa goods at a cost and price sufficiently low to attract buyers on the international market. You know, Sir, there is an organization called SAFTO which deals with exports, and it has made a statement on this issue. It said recently that unless South Africa can increase exports by R900 million a year by 1980, we will be R2 000 million in the red on our trade balance. That is a drastic prospect. Do you realize, Sir, that our exports have only increased by about R500 million in the last nine years while they have shown a decline in recent years&#x003F; What is the Government doing about it&#x003F; I asked whether workers were going to be helped by intelligent measures to achieve greater productivity and not dragooned or lectured&#x003F; What is the Government doing&#x003F; I asked for reduced Government expenditure, particularly wasteful expenditure, in direct competition with the resources of the private sector. We have been told in the State President&#x2019;s speech that there is going to be a curtailment of Government spending. What is the extent of that curtailment&#x003F; Are they going to take active steps on that subject&#x003F; I said they must set the minds of businessmen at rest and see to it that they would get the necessary labour to expand their businesses and expand their export. What is the Government going to do about it&#x003F; You see the sort of situation we are in, Mr. Speaker. Here is a serious situation which has led to devaluation. You cannot benefit by devaluation to the full unless you take certain measures. The Opposition comes to this House and proposes certain measures to the hon. the Minister of Finance and to the Government and we are prepared to debate them across the floor of the House, but there is no reaction from a single Minister or member on that side of the House. Are they really fit to govern South Africa, if that is their attitude&#x003F; I gave them recommendations for the short-term health of the economy and I give them recommendations for the long-term health of the economy. Not on one single item have we had a clear-cut answer from anybody on that side of the House, except that the hon. the Prime Minister said that we were spending as much as we could on education. I want to tell him that that is not enough and if he continues at that rate, we are not going to expand our exports or our economy to the extent that we should. It is not surprising that there has been no criticism from that side. I see that in a recent speech, Mr. Burger of Trust Bank supported very much the measures I have outlined. We find that Union Acceptances in its last quarterly bulletin, the publication which this hon. Minister preferred to his own Reserve Bank statement in respect of the standards of living in South Africa, makes the same recommendations we have made from this side of the House. What reply have we got&#x003F; The only thing we got was a tirade on labour from the hon. the Minister of Labour who said that unless we accepted the report of the Riekert Commission or accepted that everything possible was being done by the Geyer Commission, we wanted influx control done away with in South Africa which he knows is not the case &#x2026; [Interjections] &#x2026; and all jobs turned over to non-Whites without consultation with the White trade unions. Why does the hon. gentleman talk such nonsense in this House&#x003F; He knows that that is not the policy of the United Party; he knows that it has never been the policy of the United Party. Why must he make statements like these; is he hoping to mislead the voters of Brakpan, or is there somebody else whom he is hoping to mislead&#x003F;</p>

We have had cost of living figures in which, I believe wrongly, the figure of 4 per cent is used. The public have been misled by the suggestion that it is 4 per cent, because certain aspects of increased living costs are not added in. The Minister knows very well that the cost of living has risen by at least 7 per cent in South Africa. Figures are compared, but the loan levy is neglected.

They cannot bring down the cost of living, because they cannot take the necessary steps in respect of labour, and because they cannot take the necessary steps in respect of labour, inflation goes up in South Africa.

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The prevention of cruelty to animals in South-West Africa was entrusted to the Minister of Justice by the South-West Africa Affairs Act, 1969. The purpose of this Bill is to make the South African Acts covering this subject applicable to South-West Africa in the interests of uniformity and sound administration.</p>

<p>There are two such Acts. The first is the Performing Animals Protection Act, 1935. The Afrikaans name of this Act sounds somewhat strange today. The older generation knows what &#x201C;dresseer&#x201D; means, but today one seldom hears the word. And yet the &#x201C;Handwoordeboek van die Afrikaanse Taal&#x201D; still gives &#x201C;dresseer&#x201D; as a verb used for the training of animals, the drilling of people and the coaching of students for an examination. This Act offers no consolation to coached students. It is aimed at affording protection to animals that are exhibited or trained for exhibition. At present South-West Africa does not have a similar Act. In the first eight clauses of the Bill the Performing Animals Protection Act, 1935, is made applicable to South-West Africa and amendments are made to convert pounds to rand, to substitute references to the repealed Act No. 8 of 1914 with references to the present Animals Protection Act, 1962, and to provide for imprisonment as an alternative where at present only a fine is mentioned. While a fine of &#x00A3;25 for a first offender and &#x00A3;50 for a second offender was possibly sufficient in 1935, I am today of the opinion that cases of cruelty to animals can occur at present for which the courts would regard imprisonment as more fitting.</p>

<p>The second relevant Act of the Republic is the Animals Protection Act, 1962, which is aimed at the prevention of cruelty to animals in general. In this case South-West Africa already has comparable legislation, i.e. the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Proclamation, 1919, the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Amendment Proclamation, 1938, and the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Amendment Proclamation, 1950. The 1919 proclamation, however, only declared the old South African Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1914, applicable to South-West Africa. Later amendments of the South African Act of 1914 were also applied respectively by the 1938 and the 1950 proclamations in South-West Africa. The result is that the presently prevailing legislation in South-West Africa is the same as the legislation that was in force locally before the passing of the South African Animals Protection Act, 1962. In his Second Reading speech in connection with the Animals Protection Bill, 1962, the then Minister of Justice said that it was an old Act that was just being modernized. By now also replacing the South-West Africa legislation with the South African Animals Protection Act of 1962, the modernization process is being carried through to South-West Africa. In clauses 9 to 12 the implementation and concomitant amendments are done.</p>

<p>Sir, as the hon. the Minister has indicated, the real, main purpose of this Bill is to extend its provisions to South-West Africa and we have no objection to that. In addition, in terms of the modern Criminal Code, it makes provision for the alternative of imprisonment in the event of the non-payment of a fine. Sir, one of the things that does strike one is that all that is being done in 1972 is to alter the fine of &#x00A3;25 provided for in the 1935 legislation for a contravention <span class="col_447-448" refersTo="page_0239"/>of the regulations or a contravention of the Act to a fine of R50. It does seem to us, if it was considered in 1935 that &#x00A3;25 (R50) should be the maximum penalty for a contravention of the Act or of the regulations, that this figure should be proportionately higher in the year 1972.</p>

<p>Yes, that is merely by the way&#x2014;<i>en passant,</i> as they say. Sir, the hon. the Minister will appreciate that there has been considerable public awareness and concern about the training and exhibiting of performing animals. Indeed, Sir, some years ago I presented to Parliament a number of petitions from people who were concerned about this and who wanted the training and exhibiting of performing animals banned, and indeed the hon. the Minister at that time agreed to receive a deputation of the persons concerned. In all these circumstances, it does seem to us, especially having regard to the public awareness in this matter, that the penalty provided for in this year 1972 is somewhat disproportionate to the penalty provided for in 1935, and we hope that the hon. the Minister will give his attention to this aspect before we come to the Committee Stage. At this stage, Sir, we agree that this Bill should be extended to South-West Africa and we offer no objection at this stage.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>This Bill is aimed at the abolition of the South African Admiralty Courts and the transfer of admiralty jurisdiction from these courts to the provincial and local divisions of the Supreme Court of South Africa.</p>

<p>To most people, including lawyers, the nature of South Africa&#x2019;s Admiralty Courts is a closed book. The very fact of their existence is not even widely known. But hon. members need not be perturbed because of ignorance of the subject, as no less a person than a former South African Chief Justice had the following to say in an Appeal Court judgment concerning the jurisdiction of Admiralty Courts. He said: &#x201C;The subject is so special that I express my views with diffidence&#x201D;. With similar diffidence I will briefly try to explain the history of our Admiralty Courts and the law applied by them, as I understand it.</p>

<p>South Africa&#x2019;s Admiralty Courts originated from the High Court of Admiralty, which was the Court of the Lord High Admiral of England. There existed historic rivalry between the Lord High Admiral and the common law courts. When the court of the Lord High Admiral was said to have jurisdiction, it meant that that Court not only had jurisdiction to take cognizance of the matter, but also to apply its own law and practice. Thus the High Court of Admiralty had its own rules of practice and applied its own law. Admiralty law constituted the General Maritime law of England, a law differing in several very important respects from the Municipal Law of England.</p>

<p>The Judge of the High Court of Admiralty was styled the Lord High Admiral&#x2019;s Lieutenant. Because it was in some cases inconvenient to resort to the High Court of Admiralty sitting in England, the Lord High Admiral also appointed his deputies or vice-admirals, and their lieutenants, or judges, in the principal ports of the United Kingdom and its dependencies. These Vice-Admiralty Courts originally exercised the same jurisdiction as the High Court of Admiralty. From time to time certain statutory powers were however given to the High Court but not to the Vice-Admiralty Courts.</p>

<p>This then was the position when the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act was placed on the statute book in 1890. According to its preamble the purpose of that Act was, and I quote: &#x201C;to amend the Law respecting the exercise of Admiralty jurisdiction in Her Majesty&#x2019;s Dominions and elsewhere out <span class="col_449-450" refersTo="page_0240"/>of the United Kingdom&#x201D;. And that is what it did: In the United Kingdom the position was left unchanged, but in the colonies the Vice-Admiralty Courts were substituted by independent Colonial Courts of Admiralty in each colony. The Act provided for the declaration of courts in British possessions as Courts of Admiralty, but if no declaration was made in respect of any particular possession, then every court having therein unlimited civil jurisdiction, would be a Court of Admiralty. No declaration under the Act was made in respect of the Cape and Natal, both at the time British possessions, with the result that the high courts of these colonies also became Admiralty Courts when the 1890 Act came into operation on the 1st July, 1891. Throughout South Africa&#x2019;s constitutional development, the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890, remained operative in the Cape and Natal. Until this day the Cape of Good Hope Provincial Division, the Eastern Cape Division, the Natal Provincial Division, the Durban and Coast Local Division and probably also the South-West Africa Division in respect of Walvis Bay, can sit as Admiralty Courts. Since Union only six cases where this has happened have been reported. The fact that the same Judges preside in both courts and the fact that the two courts use the same premises and are served by the same officers, may create the impression that any particular division of the Supreme Court and its corresponding Admiralty Court, are one and the same thing.</p>

<p>It may appear as if it is only a question of the exercise of a special jurisdiction by the Supreme Court. This is however not the case. We have in fact two courts which originated apart from each other, developed along completely separate roads and are today regulated by two different statutes, the Supreme Court by the South African Supreme Court Act of 1959, and the Admiralty Courts by the English Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act of 1890. Their procedures are set out in two different sets of rules, the rules of the Admiralty Courts still being the 1883 rules inherited from the Vice-Admiralty Courts.</p>

<p>The most important difference between the two courts is, however, the law which they apply. The Supreme Court adjudicates according to South African law with a Roman-Dutch origin while the Admiralty Courts apply English Admiralty law, being the law applied and developed by the English High Court of Admiralty. In the English case <i>The Gaetano and Marie,</i> Judge Brett described this law as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is not the ordinary Municipal law of the country, but it is the law which the English Courts of Admiralty, either by Act of Parliament or by reiterated decisions and traditions and principles, have adopted as the English Maritime law.</block>

<p>The matters which our Admiralty Courts have jurisdiction to deal with include cases concerning collisions between ships, salvage, bottomry, seamen&#x2019;s wages, towage, necessaries supplied to ships, damages done by ships and the ownership of ships. I mention these matters only as examples. There are many other maritime matters which will also fall within the jurisdiction of the Admiralty Courts. The Admiralty Courts exercise their jurisdiction concurrently with the provincial and local divisions of the Supreme Court. A litigant can himself decide which court to approach. This very choice open to a dominant litigant immediately brings us to the first problem attending the existence of Admiralty Courts. There are points of conflict between Roman-Dutch law applied by the Supreme Court and English Admiralty law applied by the Admiralty Courts. The final outcome of a particular action may therefore depend upon the court in which it is instituted. Secondly, an important advantage of the Admiralty Courts lies in Admiralty procedure, which includes a simple but speedy procedure for the arrest of ships. The procedure of the Admiralty Courts is however, still regulated by rules compiled in 1883. Furthermore, there is not one single complete set of these rules available at any one of our courts. Lastly the Admiralty Courts are creatues of an 1890 English Act, drafted for a British empire of colonies, the intention having been that the Colonial Courts of Admiralty, together with the British Courts, would uniformly administer Admiralty law over large parts of the world. Needless to say, this state of affairs must in modern conditions give rise to many uncertainties.</p>

<p>Initially we thought that we could solve the problem by just abolishing the Admiralty Courts. This would, however, have meant that we would also have lost English Admiralty law. Although only a few actions were instituted in the Admiralty Courts over the last half a century, and although most of those actions could possibly have been satisfactorily resolved under South <span class="col_451-452" refersTo="page_0241"/>African law, it is a fact that English Admiralty law receives almost world-wide recognition. With our ever increasing participation in merchant shipping activities, it can only be to our advantage to retain English Admiralty law, to weave it into South African law where it would be desirable to do so, and to adapt it to changing times by means of the decisions of our courts and legislation.</p>

<p>It is in an attempt to serve this purpose and to solve the related problems that I am introducing this Bill. The Bill abolishes the Admiralty Courts and vests their jurisdiction in the provincial and local divisions of the Supreme Court. What we are doing is to create by statute a situation in which the two systems can be applied by one court and in which that court can bring them ever closer together by giving preference to the best from each. By proceeding in this way we will not relinquish anything we now have, but on the other hand we will transfer a facet of our legal administration from an archaic appendage to our Supreme Court where it belongs.</p>

<p>Clause 1 vests admiralty jurisdiction in all the provincial and local divisions of the Supreme Court and not only in those which are now also Admiralty Courts, i.e. the coastal courts. This is done, firstly, to prevent difficulties in the case of future changes in the divisions of the Supreme Court; secondly, for the sake of uniformity; thirdly, because it is not impossible that admiralty law principles may later also find application in aviation matters.</p>

<p>Clause 2 provides for the retention of the rules of the Admiralty Courts.</p>

<p>Clause 3 contains the necessary provision for matters which may be pending in Admiralty Courts on the date when they are abolished.</p>

<p>Clause 4 repeals the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890, thereby abolishing the Admiralty Courts.</p>

<p>Clause 5 applies the Bill to South-West Africa. At present only Walvis Bay falls within admiralty jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Clause 6 postpones the commencement of the Bill in order to provide an opportunity for considering the adequacy of the existing rules of court.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is another Bill to which we have no objection in principle as it, as the hon. the Minister has said, tidies up the position and makes the Admiralty Court the Supreme Court when hearing matters concerning those matters to which the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act applies, subject to the Supreme Court rules which are with us and which are more modern and which are adapted to our conditions and which can be changed readily by the Chief Justice in the circumstances which arise from time to time. The Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act of 1890 conferred the same powers as adhere to the High Court of Admiralty in Great Britain to the civil courts of unlimited jurisdiction in the Commonwealth. We in 1968 repealed that part of the 1890 British Act, the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, in so far as they dealt with prize jurisdiction. Now it seems to us &#x2014;and I may say that in this regard I have taken the trouble to consult with those who practise in relation to these Admiralty Courts&#x2014;that there is a feeling of doubt expressed as to whether or not the Colonial Court of Admiralty Act of 1890, which this Bill seeks to apply so far as jurisdiction is concerned to our Supreme Court, is still in existence. This is so because this doubt arises. The 1890 Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act specifically provides that it shall only apply in British possessions. Whatever sort of interpretation one might place on the expression &#x201C;a British possession&#x201D; seems to us that we certainly could not apply that term to our country since we became a Republic on 31st May, 1961. So it seems to us that it would be necessary and advisable, even if there is a difference of opinion, to insert in this Bill at the Committee Stage a provision that it &#x201C;shall be deemed to have been in operation right up to the time of the passing of this Act&#x201D; or &#x201C;shall be deemed to have been in operation since 31st May, 1961&#x201D;, so that there can be no doubt about this. Furthermore, it seems to us that we should also indicate that what we are applying, the jurisdiction we are giving our Supreme Court, is the jurisdiction as it contained in that Act, the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act of 1890, either now or as at 31st May, 1961, so that there can be no further confusion if the British Parliament were to change that Act, so that one could not say it is that Act as amended by the British Parliament. I would like to indicate at this stage that we will move an amendment to that effect in the Committee Stage. As I say, it is a matter of debate whether they are necessary. I believe the majority view is that they are necessary, but in any case it <span class="col_453-454" refersTo="page_0242"/>would do no harm to clarify the position for all time as far as we are concerned.</p>

<p>Sir, we welcome this Bill. We welcome the clarity which it will now bring to practitioners who will not now have to go round looking for the rules of these Admiralty Courts when these cases come before the court. The hon. the Minister is aware that this is a matter of great difficulty. If one in any Bar asks around what one is to do, there are very few people who will be able to tell you. In fact, nobody would be able to tell you where to find the rules, never mind about the actual rule that should apply, unless they have had the experience of having to find them. Once found, like all these strange, English statutory matters, they are never forgotten, and we are delighted therefore that we do not have to put up with this sort of rule, and we can now have the Supreme Court Rules in future.</p>

<p>We have no objection to the Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if I understand the hon. member correctly, he maintains that we might be abolishing a statute which, in any event, does not obtain. I think that is his argument. I do not agree with him, but I shall have a look at it before we come to the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>Secondly, with regard to the rules which the hon. member says are very difficult to obtain, I, as a matter of fact, can go further: They are not obtainable at all. There is not a single Admiralty Court, as a court, or an officer of such a court, who is in possession of such a set of rules. The one court may have a portion of the rules and the other another portion of the rules. However, there is not a single complete set. My department has succeeded in tracing a complete set of rules as far as we know, with Mr. Justice Harcourt of the Natal division. That was in his private possession. Apparently he is a collector. We are now making copies of that to make it available to the Chief Justice for consideration when the re-draft is undertaken.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Section 5 <i>ter</i> (1) of the Suppression of Communism Act, 1950, provides that the Minister of Justice may, by notice in the <i>Gazette,</i> prohibit persons who were office-bearers, officers or members of an organization which has been declared to be an unlawful organization from participating, without consent, in certain ways in the activities of other organizations. In this way, for example, the Minister of justice may prohibit persons who were members of the African National Congress from becoming members of student organizations or trade unions. The intention has always been that persons who belonged to the organization at any time before or after the organization was declared to be unlawful shall be subject to such a prohibition. They were associated with an organization which engaged in subversive activities, and the danger therefore exists that they may promote the aims of that organization by means of an innocent lawful organization. It is in the interests of national safety that there should be control over the activities of these persons in vulnerable lawful organizations. Such a prohibition was introduced during 1962. Since then numerous legal proceedings have been instituted against persons who, according to available evidence, belonged to organizations before they were declared to be unlawful. Many were found guilty. In 1969, however, the appeal of a certain Mary Ranta was heard in the Transvaal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court. Although the issue was not decisive, the court nevertheless expressed the opinion that it was unlikely that it had been the intention that such a prohibition should apply to persons who were members of such an organization before the date on which they declared to be unlawful, but were no longer members at the time it was declared to be unlawful.</p>

<p>It is possible that the courts will in future interpret section 5 <i>ter</i> (1) to mean that proof that the accused was a member of the organization before it was declared to be unlawful is no longer sufficient. If that should happen, section 5 <i>ter</i> will to a large extent cease to serve any useful function. It is an almost impossible task to establish or to prove that a particular person was a member of, for example, the African National Congress, 12 years ago when that organization was declared to be unlawful. The amendment which is being <span class="col_455-456" refersTo="page_0243"/>effected by clause 1 is aimed at eliminating the uncertainty which has arisen as a result of the Ranta judgment, and to make clear the original intention of section 5 <i>ter.</i></p>

<p>I now proceed to clause 2. Section 1 of the Newspaper and Imprint Act, 1934, prohibits the printing and publication of a newspaper unless a certificate of registration has been issued to it. When section 6 <i>bis</i> was inserted in the Suppression of Communism Act, 1950, it had to be worded in such a way that it corresponded with section 1 of the Newspaper and Imprint Act, 1934. Section 6 <i>bis</i> therefore prohibits the issuing of a certificate of registration in terms of the Newspaper and Imprint Act, 1934, unless the Minister certifies that he has no reason to believe that the newspaper will at any time be prohibited in terms of section 6 of the Suppression of Communism Act, 1950, or unless a deposit not exceeding R20 000 as the Minister may determine, has been paid. In 1971 the Newspaper and Imprint Registration Act, was passed. This Act replaces the Newspaper and Imprint Act, 1934. The 1971 Act has not come into operation yet and thus the 1934 Act still applies. The problem is, however, that the 1971 Act prohibits the printing and publishing of a newspaper unless that newspaper has been registered. Whereas the 1934 Act thus requires the existence of a certificate of registration, the 1971 Act requires that the newspaper shall be registered before it may be printed or published. This means that section 6 <i>bis</i> of the Suppression of Communism Act is no longer adjusted to the new Newspaper and Imprint Registration Act. Clause 2, in the first place, now amends section 6 <i>bis</i> in order to effect such an adjustment. As amended by clause 2 section 6 <i>bis</i> prevents the registration of any newspaper if the Minister should have any suspicions regarding it. Subclause 2 (2) provides that the amendment shall come into operation on the date of commencement of the Newspaper and Imprint Registration Act, 1971. In this way the occurrence of a period during which section 6 <i>bis</i> is not consistent with the current law on the registration of newspapers is prevented.</p>

<p>However, clause 2 also amends section 6 <i>bis</i> in another respect. As section 6 <i>bis</i> reads at present, the Minister of Justice shall consider every application for the registration of a newspaper. He must then decide whether he wants to certify that he does not harbour any suspicions in respect of the newspaper, or else he must determine an amount which shall be paid over as a deposit. In all the time section 6 <i>bis</i> has been in existence a deposit has been required in only ten cases. There is an average of five applications for the registration of newspapers per month. It is clear that the existence of section 6 <i>bis</i> deters persons with ulterior motives from making application for the registration of a newspaper. The vast majority of applications are cases where a deposit will obviously not be required. It is therefore unnecessary for every application to go through the whole process. In an attempt to save work and promote efficiency, clause 2 also amends section 6 <i>bis</i> so that it will no longer be necessary to submit every application to the Minister of Justice. As amended, section 6 <i>bis</i> will make the registration of a newspaper possible without a certificate being issued by the Minister. Instead of that, he will have to determine a deposit within 21 days after the application has been received by the Secretary for the Interior; if this is not done, the registration proceeds.</p>

<p>The last clause I want to deal with, is clause 3. Section 10 <i>quat</i> of the Suppression of Communism Act empowers the Minister at any time to order certain persons to report periodically at a police station. However, the section does not empower the Minister of Justice or the magistrate to grant permission, by way of an exception, that the restricted person need not report on a specific day or days. This was probably a mere oversight in the formulation of the original section, for the other sections in terms of which restrictions are imposed all contain this authorization. At the moment permission in the form of an amendment to the notice is granted by me to restricted persons, to the effect that they need not report on a specific day. However, this is a cumbersome procedure. In addition a certain amount of delay is also inevitable because the local magistrate cannot deal with the matter. Clause 3 therefore amends section 10 <i>quat</i> so that the Minister and a magistrate are also, in that case, just as in sections 5, 9 and 10, authorized to grant exceptions.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is a Bill which the late Mr. Lewis Gay, the former member for Simonstown, would have described as a Bill full of a lot of wordage. I must say that when one looks at clauses 1 and 2 particularly, one appreciates that words sometimes have different meanings for different people.</p>

<p><span class="col_457-458" refersTo="page_0244"/>Mr. Speaker, for the life of us we really do not appreciate why the amendment proposed by clause 1 of this Bill is necessary at all. This clause deals with the power of the Minister in respect of persons who were members, office bearers or officials of an organization declared to be unlawful. The Minister may in terms of this clause impose in respect of those persons prohibitions from joining other organizations, those which he names. As the law stands at the moment he may do this if their names appear on any list in the custody of the officer referred to in section 8, i.e. the liquidator of the Communist Party, the person who makes lists in respect of the Communist Party and any other organization which the Minister instructs him to make lists in respect of whether they were members of those organizations before or after the commencement of the Act. If they are on that list the Minister may make such a prohibition. The law, as it stands at present, also lays down that apart from those lists compiled by the liquidator of the Communist Party, he may also make such orders in respect of persons who are office bearers, officers or members of any organization which has been declared to be an unlawful organization. He does not make the order until it has been shown that he was a member of an unlawful organization. He was such a member either before or after or both. The hon. the Minister has indicated that although not giving a decision on the matter, some Judge in the Transvaal, merely <i>obiter dicta,</i> indicated that there might be some doubt about this. Of course, Judges very often do this. They express a view in passing which is not relevant to the debate as you, Mr. Speaker, indicated just now. Even Judges sometimes do this. It really does not mean anything at all. In our view, this amendment merely says exactly the same as is there already, it only says it in different language. It takes the matter no further. At any rate, one is delighted that the hon. the Minister is aware and has taken note of what Judges of the Supreme Court say in respect of the drafting of these statutes.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>It makes assurance doubly sure, which, in our view, was in any event sure. It was quite clear when this clause was before us when this Bill was debated.</p>

<p>As far as clause 2 is concerned, it is probably an improvement on the existing situation. I remember&#x2014;and the hon. the Minister will remember&#x2014;that a Coloured man in Durban wanted to produce a newspaper which was to provide a sort of social magazine for the Coloured community in Durban. He wanted to bring this magazine out once a month and, in it, indicate to the people who had been married and engaged. There were to be pictures, and social and sporting events were to be featured, purely for that section of the population. As far as I was aware&#x2014;I think the hon. the Minister did not doubt my representations to him in this regard&#x2014;the person concerned was a <i>bona fide</i> character and one had no reason to believe that this newspaper would be anything else than a social journal for the Coloured community in Durban. However, if it was to be a newspaper&#x2014;that is to say, if it was going to be published once a month&#x2014;the hon. the Minister was required to issue a certificate in which he had to certify that he had no reason to believe &#x201C;that a prohibition under section 6 will not at any time become necessary in respect of such newspaper&#x201D;. As the hon. the Minister has said, how could he sign such a certificate&#x003F; I must say that, when the hon. the Minister pointed this out, I appreciated his point of view. How could he sign such a certificate&#x003F; What this amounts to is that this was really a <i>brutum fulmen,</i> a hiatus, in our law. This is now being changed. The hon. the Minister will now no longer have to certify anything. That is the first improvement. He must now be satisfied that a prohibition in terms of the Act will not at any time become necessary in respect of such newspaper. Well, I hope that that will make the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s task easier. Certainly, his task was impossible before. So I wish him the best of good British luck as far as this clause is concerned, because I do not see how he is going to avoid the same difficulties that he had in the past.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, there is one definite improvement in this Bill as opposed to a non-change, namely clause 3 which makes the whole situation concerning exceptions in certain circumstances&#x2014;such as reporting to the Police&#x2014;much more flexible. This is to be welcomed, because, obviously, it has been found in practice to be necessary. So we offer no objection at this stage to this Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we are again dealing here with a Bill amending the Communism Act. It is a pity the hon. member for Durban North did not simply state at the outset that he agreed. They agree with the Bill but the hon. member states that he does not see the necessity for the amendment. He said the amendment was simply a lot of wordage.</p>

<p>I should like to mention to the hon. member two reasons why I think this amendment is very necessary. The hon. member, as a legal man, ought to know that one would at all times like to have certainty in the law. When two learned Judges, Mr. Justice Rabie and Mr. Justice Trengove, give an opinion <i>obiter dicta</i> in the Ranta case which is contrary to this section, surely one must rectify the section in order to have certainty about it in future. I should like to quote what the hon. Judge said in this connection&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is the contention of the Appellant that the words &#x2026;</block>

<p>Then he quotes those words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; in section 5<i>ter</i> (1) of Act 44 of 1950 and in the Minister&#x2019;s notice mean, in their plain and ordinary sense, persons who were at any time office-bearers &#x2026; of such an organization and that there is no reason for interpreting them respectively so as to relate only to persons who were office-bearers &#x2026; at the time when the organization was declared to be unlawful. I do not agree with this submission.</block>

<p>Then the Judge continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It seems reasonable to suppose, I think, that, if the intention had been that &#x201C;the words should bear the meaning contended by the Appellant&#x201D;, it would as a matter of language have been more appropriate to speak of persons who &#x201C;have been office-bearers &#x2026;&#x201D; of a banned organization, perhaps with the addition of words like &#x201C;before or after the date on which the organization was declared unlawful&#x201D;.</block>

<p>That is precisely what is intended with this clause, namely to add those words. In the first place one would therefore like to have legal certainty. Secondly, to sow doubt is only one of the aims of communism. Where a mere opinion has been expressed by a Judge, one could imagine that the communists are going to seize upon that doubt which has arisen in the law to bring about future lawsuits. Here they have already received an indication from the Judge that everything is not as it should be with this section in the principal Act. Surely they will therefore seize upon this section to make things impossible for the Government. For this reason as well it is therefore essential to amend the section. After all, these people are always at liberty to go to the Minister to get the necessary permission to belong to any organization. Why hon. members on the opposite side feel that this amendment is not necessary, is beyond us. We feel that this clause is very necessary and that it is merely a rectification of an existing intention. This is therefore being done in this Bill. The same applies to clause 2 as well. This clause also has to do with the rectification of the existing intention. If section 6<i>bis</i> of the Newspaper and Imprint Registration Act, 1971, is not amended, the section is in fact useless. This amendment Bill is therefore absolutely essential.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is not my intention to take up a lot of the time of this House. Our position has been made clear by the hon. member for Durban North. The hon. member for Potgietersrus was not in this House when the original section 5<i>ter</i> was introduced in 1962. Had he been in the House, he would have known that this section was debated on the basis that it was intended to make it possible for persons to be prevented from doing the various things provided for in section 5<i>ter,</i> persons who were members of an unlawful organization not only at the time when the organization was declared to be unlawful, but also at any given time before that, for the reasons which have already been mentioned by the hon. the Minister of Justice, namely that it is virtually impossible to say who was and who was not a member at the specific moment when the organization was declared to be unlawful. In other words, we on this side of the House dealt with the original section on that basis. In our view the words &#x201C;were office bearers, officers or members of the organization&#x201D; are sufficiently wide to include not only persons who were at a particular time, but who were at any time, members of such an organization. It is for this reason that, in our view, the amendment which has been introduced <span class="col_461-462" refersTo="page_0246"/>does not go any further than the section as it stands today. It merely says exactly the same thing in different words. Therefore we do not oppose this amendment.</p>

<p>I would point out as well that the <i>obiter dicta</i> to which the hon. the Minister and the hon. member for Potgietersrus referred, was not a considered judgment on the meaning of the words. It was not an issue in the case. It was merely an expression of the opinion of those Judges that the words had a particular meaning. It is quite possible, though, that, had these Judges been required to consider the meaning of these words as a specific issue in the case, they would have come to a contrary decision. So I do not think that one can rely on the <i>obiter dicta</i> as being an expression of the views of these Judges as regards the meaning of these words. For these reasons we do not consider that this amendment extends section 5 <i>ter,</i> and therefore we do not oppose it.</p>

<p>As regards the other amendments which have been introduced in this amending Bill, we regard them as improvements and therefore they have our support.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The provisions of the South-West Africa Affairs Act, 1969, place the registration of deeds in South-West Africa under the administration of the Minister of Justice. Whereas this matter is regulated in the Republic by the Deeds Registries Act, 1937, South-West Africa has its own Deeds Registry Proclamation of 1939. However, the South-West African Proclamation is mainly a re-enactment of the South African Act, with minor adjustments. Over the years relevant amendments to the South African Act have to a large extent been incorporated in the South-West Africa Proclamation.</p>

<p>In order to promote uniformity and sound administration, it is desirable for the South African Act in substitution for the Territory&#x2019;s Proclamation to be applied in South-West Africa, as is being done in this Bill. In addition, I want to refer you to the Sectional Titles Act, 1971, which is linked with the Deeds Registries Act and which cannot really function independently of it. The Sectional Titles Act applies to South-West Africa as well. This makes the application of the Deeds Registries Act in South-West Africa all the more necessary.</p>

<p>Most of the clauses require no explanation. I shall gladly explain the others. Clause 12 (g) inserts a definition of the expression &#x201C;the commencement of this Act&#x201D; in the Deeds Registries Act. In respect of South-West Africa this expression will therefore mean the date of the commencement of this Bill. The definition is aimed at the use of this expression in sections 1 (2), 2 (3) and 3 (1) (a). By its insertion, it is envisaged to cause pending transactions in Windhoek to be brought to finality under the regulations under which they were commenced, to cause the formal appointments of officials in the Deeds Office in Windhoek to remain valid, and to instruct the Registrar in Windhoek to retain in his custody the documents in his custody at the time of the commencement of this Bill.</p>

<p>The second amendment that requires explanation, is the one contained in clause 12 (h). The necessity for clause 12 (h) arises from the fact that the Deeds Registries Act contains references to the Administration of Estates Act, 1913, and the Administration of Estates Act, 1965. The Administration of Estates Act, 1965, has been implemented in part in the Republic, but does not apply in South-West Africa as yet. In the existing South-West African Proclamation, the Deeds Registry Proclamation, 1939, reference is made to the Administration of Estates Act, 1913, as applied to the Territory by the Better Administration of Justice Proclamation, 1921. In order to rectify this confusing state of affairs, this Bill amends the Deeds Registries Act so that reference is made throughout to the Administration of Estates Act, 1965, whilst clause 12 (h) inserts subsection 102 (2) in order to provide that any reference to the Administration of Estates Act, 1965 shall be construed in South-West Africa as a reference to the corresponding laws, which may be in force in the Territory from time to time.</p>

<p>Clause 13 has the effect of the Deeds <span class="col_463-464" refersTo="page_0247"/>Registries Act being made applicable to South-West Africa, with the exception of sections 70 to 74<i>bis</i> and sections 84 and 85. Sections 70 to 74<i>bis</i> deal with mineral rights in a piece of land, and sections 84 and 85 with prospecting contracts. In certain cases in South Africa private rights to minerals in a piece of land give rise to prospecting and mining rights. In South-West Africa all prospecting and mining rights are vested in the State, and therefore these sections cannot apply in South-West Africa. The exclusion of these sections has no practical effect. It is merely being done in order to promote neatness.</p>

<p>Clause 16 repeals the relevant laws in South-West Africa, but does so subject to the provisions of subsection (2). In South Africa the Mining Titles Office operates in terms of the Mining Titles Registration Act, 1967. The establishment of the Mining Titles Office in Windhoek was, however, brought about in terms of a South African Proclamation, No. R90 of 1969. This Proclamation did not lay down comprehensive regulations for the operation of the Mining Titles Office, but only identified the South-West Africa Deeds Registry Proclamation, 1939, with minimal adjustments, for this purpose. The Deeds Registry Proclamation, 1939, thus contains the regulations in terms of which the functions of the Mining Titles Office are carried out. That is why it is necessary to keep in existence that Proclamation&#x2014;which is being substituted in terms of this Bill by the Republic&#x2019;s Deeds Registries Act. 1937&#x2014;for the purposes of the Mining Titles Office in Windhoek. This is what is envisaged by subsection (2).</p>

<p>The last clause, clause 17, postpones the commencement of this Bill. This is being done so that sufficient notice of the commencement may be given beforehand in order to enable interested parties to make the necessary preparations.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>This Bill, as the hon. the Minister has indicated, is to extend our system of registry, with certain reservations, to South West Africa, and I am sure that there is not one of us, particularly those who are concerned with deeds registry, who will not welcome this measure, because it extends to South-West Africa a system which I think we in South Africa are entitled to believe is one of the best that one can find throughout the world as a system of registration. Sir, I say that because in the past practitioners have had some difficulties and perhaps there have been delays caused by&#x2014;if I may use this expression, Sir, without damning the Bill&#x2014; the non-integration of the Windhoek Deeds Registry into the deeds registry system in the Republic I believe practitioners will find that this uniformity will obviate delays in registration. I believe that it will also bring about a modest reduction in the cost of conveyancing transactions between the Territory and the Republic. A particular advantage which I see in this measure is that it prepares for the time when the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s centralized registry of bonds, etc.&#x2014;what is commonly known as the Debt Registry in the Deeds Office&#x2014;is established. This registry will bring the registry of Windhoek into the same orbit as the other registries, and in the Republic one will be able to obtain information from the Windhoek registry. Perhaps the Minister will be able to tell us how far that computerization of the central Debt Registry has progressed.</p>

<p>Another point which arises from this Bill is the following: One notices the necessary perpetuation of divided responsibility between the hon. the Minister of Justice and the hon. the Minister of Agriculture. The Minister of Justice deals with the procedural aspects of registration while the Minister of Agriculture deals with matters of land tenure, consolidated titles, the consolidation of contiguous properties, and so on. I believe that the hon. the Minister and his department would be doing the country a service if that dual control could be eliminated, so that the whole matter could fall under one authority. After all, registration is so intimately bound up with the question of consolidated title, which is referred to in this Bill, that it would help considerably if they were brought under one ministry.</p>

<p>A further matter I want to refer to is the exclusion of the registration of mineral rights and leases, hypothecation, and various other aspects concerned with mineral rights, and the standardization of the procedures in regard to registrations flowing from mineral rights. The Minister has quite correctly indicated that the vested right in minerals is different in the two territories. I do not want to labour the point at this stage, but I believe that even there uniformity could be established between the two registries in regard to mineral rights. After all, there are mineral and prospecting leases, and a different form <span class="col_465-466" refersTo="page_0248"/>of registration can lead to the perpetuation of a degree of conflict, which may cause confusion and uncertainty as to what applies in the Republic and what applies in South-West Africa.</p>

<p>In mentioning these points, I want to repeat that we on this side of the House welcome this legislation. We believe that it will lead to greater efficiency and to a certain extent it will lead to a lowering of costs in so far as transactions between the Republic and South-West Africa are concerned. We support the Second Reading of this Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in supporting this measure I want to say that we welcome the fact that the Bill is also supported by the members on the other side of the House. All of us who, as practitioners, are concerned with the registration of deeds and with the deeds offices, welcome the gratifying aspect that attention is being given to legislation with regard to registration offices, especially in recent times. In terms of this legislation the position will be improved and it will be made so streamlined&#x2014;if one can use the word &#x201C;streamlined&#x201D; in connection with registration offices&#x2014;that it holds many advantages for practitioners when it comes to the drawing up of deeds. As the hon. member for Green Point also indicated, it will to a large extent be possible to reduce the costs pertaining to the registration of deeds. This is necessary because we can in this country most certainly expect an increase in the registrations and preparation of deeds in all deeds offices in the near future, especially in view of the Sectional Titles Act which the hon. the Minister also mentioned here, and it is therefore essential that it be done in this way. In the same breath we also want to express our thanks to the hon. the Minister for the classification which has already been made, by means of which the work is at present proceeding almost normally in the deeds offices.</p>

<p>The application of this Act to South-West Africa is a welcome thought in view of the uniformity which it creates in respect of liaison in regard to bonds, as the hon. member for Green Point also indicated, as is the application in regard to provisions in connection with marriages in community of property and the registration of deeds in the name of women, especially now that we are working on the basis of a uniform metric system. It is very clear why the provisions mentioned in Clause 13 are excluded. These are provisions pertaining to mining titles only, they are excluded because all rights in respect of minerals are vested in the Administration. I support the provisions of the Bill.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>This Bill contains a number of unrelated amendments to the Insolvency Act, 1936.</p>

<p>Section 70 of the Act requires a trustee to open an account in the name of the insolvent estate with a bank. The type of bank is not defined. At present, however, all banking institutions must fulfil the same requirements, and therefore it is only right that they should receive equal treatment in Acts such as the Insolvency Act. The provisions of clauses 1 and 4, taken together, amend section 70 so that the required estate account may be opened at any banking institution. Provisionally registered banking institutions have, however, not yet rendered proof of their viability, and as far as the investment of trust money is concerned here, they are excluded. But in order to protect existing rights, trustees are allowed, as they may at present, to open such accounts with banking institutions which were registered provisionally before the coming into operation of the Bill.</p>

<p>At present executors in deceased estates are authorized by the Administration of Estates Act, 1965, to invest money which is not needed immediately, in order to earn interest for the estate. The time is ripe for this principle to be extended to insolvent estates. Clauses 1 and 4, taken together, amend the Act so that trustees of insolvent estates are authorized, with the consent of the Master, to open a savings account in the name of the insolvent estate with a banking institution or a building society or, with the written consent of the Master, to place moneys on <span class="col_467-468" refersTo="page_0249"/>interest-bearing deposit with a banking institution or building society.</p>

<p>Section 70 (2) provides that a trustee shall, within fourteen days after his appointment, give to the Master notice in writing of the bank with which he has opened an account for the estate. A work-study investigation has revealed that this notice is simply filed away in Masters&#x2019; offices and therefore serves no useful purpose. Clause 4 amends the section in such a way that a trustee is obliged to furnish the information only when the Master requires it from him.</p>

<p>Section 42 of the Act requires that a special meeting of creditors shall be convened in the manner prescribed in section 40. However, section 40 was amended in 1965 and at present provides for more than one method by means of which meetings shall be convened. Probably as a result of an oversight, section 42 was not adjusted to this amendment at the time. Clause 3 now amends section 42 so that the section itself contains its own provision in regard to the way in which a special meeting is to be convened. It must in fact be done by notice in the <i>Gazette.</i></p>

<p>A number of unrelated Acts contain provisions in terms of which preference is given to certain claims in the division of the free residue of the assets in an insolvent estate. It is mainly levies, contributions or duties in terms of the respective Acts that are concerned here. Almost all the provisions are similar, so that problems arise when it has to be determined which claim mentioned in one Act should in fact enjoy preference over that mentioned in another Act. The result is that preference has to be established on the basis of the dates on which the Acts were passed. Such a state of affairs is unsatisfactory. In addition, it is desirable that all provisions of this nature should be combined in one Act, namely the Insolvency Act, so that they are available as an entity to interested parties. Section 99 of the Insolvency Act already contains a provision of this nature, in which preference is given to, <i>inter alia,</i> contributions and compensations in terms of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. By means of clause 5 we are therefore removing all these provisions from the various Acts and combining them all in section 99 of the Insolvency Act. At the same time we are providing that all these claims shall rank <i>pare passu</i> and abate in equal proportion, if necessary.</p>

<p>I proceed to clause 5. Approximately 75 per cent of the persons whose estates are sequestrated never apply for rehabilitation. Various periods which must elapse before application may be made for rehabilitation are stipulated in the Act. They vary from six months after sequestration to five years after conviction of an offence in connection with insolvency. Where application for rehabilitation is in fact made, it sometimes happens that the court refuses the application for some or other reason, but in such cases it is normally put to the applicant that he may re-apply after a further specified period, usually one or two years. When such a period is stipulated, the insolvent is almost invariably rehabilitated. Those who do apply for rehabilitation, can therefore on the one hand be rehabilitated within months, and on the other hand, where they have been convicted of offences in connection with insolvency, within approximately six or seven years.</p>

<p>The 75 per cent odd who do not apply for rehabilitation are probably precluded from doing so either because financially they are not capable of bearing the cost of the application, or because they do not deem it necessary in their own interests, or because they are ignorant or simply not interested. The result is that a large group of unrehabilitated insolvents are absorbed into society and perform juridical acts daily which, because of the change of status resulting from insolvency, they are not legally entitled to perform. After a few years, neither their trustees nor their creditors take any interest in their actions. As I have said, even a person who has been guilty of offences in connection with insolvency is rehabilitated by the court within about seven years, the last-mentioned cases will include even the extreme cases of dishonesty in connection with insolvency. It is therefore not the intention that a person whose estate has been sequestrated should be left with a lowered status for ever. Surely the purpose of sequestration is to make the best of a bad case by combining all the insolvent&#x2019;s assets and then dividing them among his creditors. The spirit of the Insolvency Act is that this task should be completed within six months. It is the insolvent&#x2019;s estate that is sequestrated, and not the insolvent himself. Admittedly, he does undergo a <span class="col_469-470" refersTo="page_0250"/>change of status in regard to his contractual capacity, but it is aimed more particularly at not complicating the administration task of the trustee on the one hand, and at protecting the public on the other. Once everything is over, however, the court restores to him his status of having full contractual capacity. This can be done much sooner, but because one prefers to be on the conservative side in such matters, I shall say that I see no reason why such a person should not automatically regain this status when 10 years have elapsed after the sequestration of his estate; on the contrary, the state of affairs I have just outlined is a good reason why this should in fact be the case. Some people who have been consulted in this regard, raised the objection that automatic rehabilitation would afford rogues the opportunity of repeatedly going solvent in a fraudulent way. I do not share that objection. In the first place, one&#x2019;s adult life is too short for one to go insolvent advantageously in cycles of say, 20 years&#x2014;I say 20 years because there has to be a period of business activity between each insolvency. In order to fit two such insolvencies into a lifetime, one would have to start fairly early. In addition, the rogue is not going to sit waiting for 10 years to be rehabilitated. If he is anxious to start all over again with a new dishonest scheme, he is going to apply to the court for rehabilitation as soon as possible and, to judge from reported cases, he will even be rehabilitated in considerably less than 10 years if he has been found guilty of an offence in connection with insolvency. There is a secondary advantage of automatic rehabilitation that I want to mention, although in itself it is not related to to the principle. Section 155 (2) of the Insolvency Act authorizes the Master to destroy all records relating to the estate of an insolvent after five years have elapsed as from the rehabilitation of that insolvent. When no rehabilitation takes place, Masters must keep the documents <i>ad infinitum.</i> This is the case with the more or less 75 per cent of insolvencies where no applications for rehabilitation are ever submitted. After a few years, these documents become completely worthless. Nobody, not even the Director of the Archives, is interested in them. Several thousand linear metres of shelving space in Masters&#x2019; offices are occupied by such records. This accommodation must necessarily cost the State a considerable amount every year. Automatic rehabilitation will also relieve this problem considerably.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I cannot say whether this idea has already been implemented in other countries. However, I have perused the Scottish Law Commission&#x2019;s memorandum of 27th November, 1971, about &#x201C;Insolvency, Bankruptcy and Liquidation in Scotland&#x201D;. In this document a work-study group of the commission considered, <i>inter alia,</i> recommendations in regard to automatic rehabilitation and then proposed (I quote from that report)&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Every bankrupt who shall not already have obtained his discharge shall be automatically discharged three years after the date when the examination of the bankrupt has been concluded, provided that no bankrupt shall be discharged from a later bankruptcy while he is undischarged from an earlier bankruptcy.</li>

<li>(2) At any time within the foregoing period of three years the trustee may lodge in court a caveat against the bankrupt&#x2019;s discharge and the automatic discharge shall not apply when a caveat has been lodged.</li>

</ol>

<p>This brings me to the one aspect about which I initially had doubts and in regard to which I request hon. members&#x2019; special attention. Various proposals have in fact been made which amount to the inclusion of a safety valve so that automatic rehabilitation may be prevented in some or other way if special circumstances justify it. I personally had in mind the case of an insolvent who may possibly become entitled to an inheritance after the 10 years have elapsed. However, I know of no case where something like this has actually happened or could have happened. Surely a period of 10 years affords creditors sufficient opportunity to claim their pound of flesh. Furthermore, the idea of sequestration is in fact the termination of a hopeless situation by, <i>inter alia,</i> the extinction of debts. The inclusion of such a safety valve would greatly prejudice the whole idea which is aimed at a moment of finality and certainty. And where something like this would, as far as I can see, only have theoretical value, I have decided that it is unnecessary and undesirable.</p>

<p>I now want to refer to clause 7. Section 134 of the Act deals with the manner in <span class="col_471-472" refersTo="page_0251"/>which an insolvent should have kept a record of his transactions before the sequestration of his estate. Doubt arose as to whether the methods of bookkeeping required included modern methods&#x2014;for example, making use of calculating machines. It is hoped that the amendment being effected by clause 7 will remove this uncertainty.</p>

<p>The only aspect of clause 8 which requires explanation is the repeal of section 5 (2) of Act No. 24 of 1922. This section deals with the reciprocal validity between the Republic and South-West Africa of court orders in insolvency cases and has become redundant as a result of the application of the Insolvency Act to South-West Africa.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we are grateful to the hon. the Minister for the explanation of the provisions of this Bill. At this stage we support the Bill. May I just say that the hon. the Minister has said everything that can be said about the provisions of this Bill, except about the provisions of one clause, namely clause 6.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Clause 6 deals with the automatic rehabilitation of an insolvent after ten years. It seems to us that there may well be circumstances where a person is the sort of person who ought not to have full freedom especially in respect of public finances or finances in which the public has an interest. Ten years is a short time in the life of such a person. We have recently seen the tragic happenings with a company like Sidarel. One does not yet know by what it was caused, but it was certainly caused by the individual manipulations of moneys within companies upon companies within companies. It does seem to us that there may well be circumstances where there are people whose actions ten years after their insolvency ought to be contained. We should like to see some provisions in terms of which a man who has, for example, committed an offence under the Insolvency Act in respect of his insolvency, must after ten years, apply to the court for his rehabilitation. This would then give the court the discretion to look into all the circumstances which then obtain. In the normal course of events I think we agree with everything the hon. the Minister has said in respect of the desirability of automatic rehabilitation. There may well be people with a predilection for this sort of activity. It seems to us that if we could formulate the circumstances in which the court should examine the matter, it would be in the public interest. In other words, such persons as one might be able to describe, should then come before the court which, in its discretion, could grant the rehabilitation.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The positive suggestion, subject to any discussion, which I would like to mention now so that we may think about it before the Committee Stage, is that if a person committed an offence in terms of the Insolvency Act concerned with or relating to his insolvency, or if he committed an offence during the course of his insolvency, he should not be automatically rehabilitated. Such a person should only be rehabilitated on application to the Supreme Court, which would consider all the circumstances and decide accordingly.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>In those circumstances, the Master is usually the person who would have to make a report on the activities of the insolvent. Certainly in the case of the sort of person we are concerned with, it should, I should think, not be without public notice. Here we are not dealing with the sort of person who just goes insolvent and does not bother to be rehabilitated. We are dealing here with the sort of person who ought not to be allowed to deal with public money or engage upon operations which might involve the public in the sort of loss and unhappiness which the Sidarel case has shown us. I say that because in terms of section 127, subsection (2), of the Insolvency Act, a discretion now resides with the court&#x2014; even under the statutory applications for rehabilitation&#x2014;to lay down conditions upon which the rehabilitation shall take place. In the case of certain people one can envisage in this regard, the court may well lay down as a condition that the person concerned shall not indulge in any company activities, float any companies, or take a position such as director of a company. I mention that merely as an example.</p>

<p>With those few thoughts on the only <span class="col_473-474" refersTo="page_0252"/>clause in the Bill on which we would have any discussion in the Committee Stage, we support the Bill at this stage.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#heunis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. HEUNIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I just want to reply briefly to what the hon. member for Durban North has said. Obviously it is possible that theoretical circumstances may exist where the desirability of such a person having to be rehabilitated automatically, may be doubted. In my opinion the point of departure should be in the first place, that insolvency is not so much only to the detriment of the insolvent himself in respect of his contractual capacity. It is much more an action which is taken for the protection of creditors or, in other words, of third parties. So, the fact that a particular person&#x2019;s estate has been sequestrated and that he himself is insolvent, has detrimental effects not only on him, but also to a much larger extent on the people with whom, under normal circumstances, he deals every day in the company as well as in the business world. It is a fact, as the hon. the Minister pointed out, that there is a large percentage of people who are not really interested in being rehabilitated in terms of the existing provisions of the Act. All these people&#x2014;the 75 per cent to whom reference was made&#x2014;are people who stand in some legal relationship to other parties virtually every day and who negotiate transactions which are not really valid in law.</p>

<p>In the interests of and for the protection of those people, including the business world, with whom the insolvent deals from time to time, I think it is important for finality to be reached at some stage or other in respect of his status, not only for his own protection, but for the protection of the other people with whom he negotiates business transactions, because they are not always aware of the fact that they are entering into business transactions with a person who does not have contractual capacity. For that reason they are in the position of not being able to enforce the consequences. Although there are circumstances, such as those to which the hon. member referred, it is clear to me that the preponderance of present evidence is in favour of the automatic rehabilitation of an insolvent after a specified period. The hon. member referred to the case where an insolvent would commit an offence in respect of his insolvency in terms of the provisions of the Insolvency Act as well. It is important to note that where such offences have been committed, there are punitive provisions in respect of those particular offences. I do not think an additional penalty should be imposed after the legal process has taken its normal course and after a person has been punished for the offences with which he was charged.</p>

<p>I come now to clause 2, which, in my opinion, contains an extremely important principle, and that is that when a person&#x2019;s estate has been sequestrated and a trustee has been appointed, the assets shall vest in the trustee or curator. It is a generally recognized legal principle that persons who have been entrusted with the assets of other people, in this case in order to realize the assets to satisfy the claims of creditors, should have imposed on them a larger degree of circumspection and caution, because they are in a position of trust. For that reason I consider it a good idea that people should not speculatively invest the funds of such an insolvent estate in companies or in banks which have not yet proved their viability. In my opinion the amendment in clause 2 removes the possibility of insolvent estate funds being invested in speculative undertakings. Further to this, I consider the next provision to be of equal importance, and that is that the trustee will now be entitled to invest the funds standing to the credit of the estate in a banking institution or building society.</p>

<p>This provision conforms with the provision which already exists in respect of the Estates Act which deals with deceased estates. I think it is extremely important that the creditors should be entitled to the earning capacity of any assets which can be invested. This particular clause once again gives the trustee or curator, in discharging this particular onus resting on him, the opportunity of working to the advantage of the people on whose behalf he is acting, and of gaining additional income by means of the investment of the assets of the estate. In this regard it is relevant that one should be aware of the fact that a considerable period sometimes expires before a trustee is able to distribute any of the funds available to him, in any case not before his first account has been approved. Because it often takes a considerable period in practice before this is possible, I consider this provision which enables the trustee to invest the <span class="col_475-476" refersTo="page_0253"/>funds to the advantage of the estate, to be extremely important.</p>

<p>Lastly I want to make a few remarks in regard to clause 5. Trustees often have to refer to various pieces of legislation in order to determine which claims have preference and in terms of which statutory provision this must be done. The insertion of the preference in regard to certain statutory obligations in the Insolvency Act, has the twofold advantage that this is laid down in the Act itself and that it is therefore not necessary to refer to other legislation in order to determine whether an incidental preferential provision is contained in such legislation. In the second place, it also makes it possible for an adjustment in the determination of order of preference to be laid down in terms of a mere amendment to the particular Act. For these reasons it is with pleasure that I support the legislation before this House.</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to support the hon. member for Durban North in what he has said, especially in regard to clause 6. We on this side of the House feel that we cannot support automatic rehabilitation, even after a period of ten years. We can see no difficulty in cases where no offence has been committed. In those cases we are quite prepared to support the Minister. In fact, we think there is much to be said in favour of the principle of automatic rehabilitation, for the reasons given by the hon. the Minister, namely that in so many cases people do not bother to apply for rehabilitation. It is a good thing that after a certain period there should be certainty one way or the other.</p>

<p>But in the case of those who have committed offences, we do not think that there should be automatic rehabilitation. It is true that some offences may be quite minor and would not justify keeping the person insolvent. But these are matters which the court would be able to deal with on application. We would point out, though, that with the complicated methods that are being adopted nowadays in commerce, intercompany dealings, and so forth, such as the case which is before the public at the moment and which has already been mentioned by the hon. member for Durban North, namely the Sidarel case, there may well be reasons why a person who has been declared insolvent in circumstances of this sort, should not automatically be rehabilitated, even after a period of ten years.</p>

<p>I do not wish to delay the House at this stage by debating this question in detail. We will have the opportunity of doing so at the Committee Stage; but I believe the matter is of sufficient importance for me to raise at this stage and to tell the Minister that we are not happy with this proposal. We intend to propose an amendment that, where there have been offences, the matter should be left to the discretion of the court. We would ask the hon. the Minister to give serious consideration to our proposal.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the objections raised by hon. members opposite are not without weight. As I, too, tried to indicate in my Second Reading speech, this was a matter which had bothered me. However, it is extremely difficult to overcome this problem. Actually, it seems to me that, as far as the Opposition is concerned, it amounts to the fact that they will be satisfied on condition that alternative action is to be taken in respect of people who have committed offences in terms of the Insolvency Act, and apparently particularly in respect of people who have fiddled with companies and have committed offences in that way. I should be pleased if they could come forward with a suitable amendment. I just want to point out, however, that we should remember that even in the worst cases of offences under the Insolvency Act, the existing Act provides for the insolvent to apply for rehabilitation after five years. This does not mean that it will be granted at that stage, but experience has also taught us that if an offender of the worst order applies after five years and the court rejects his application, the court usually indicates a period when he may apply again. As far as we know, that period is hardly or ever more than two years. When he applies at that time rehabilitation follows virtually automatically. This is the procedure in respect of the person who wants to do something like this.</p>

<p>I attach considerable value to the proposal of the hon. member for Durban North, namely that when people do strange things with public money or with company money, and a company is liquidated, such people cannot be rehabilitated again. Such a person is found guilty in terms of the Insolvency Act and even his estate may be sequestrated as well. One <span class="col_477-478" refersTo="page_0254"/>may think of the possibility of excluding such persons from automatic rehabilitation. This is one possibility to which consideration may be given. As I have said, we shall pay attention to it before the Committee Stage. I should appreciate a suitable proposal from Opposition side.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The demand for Bantu labour, the provision of Bantu labour, the training and the improvement of the quality of Bantu labour have become today one of the most topical issues facing everybody concerned in the matter. From all quarters people are looking to my department for the provision of sufficient labour but also good labour. The housewife seeks a neat and reliable domestic servant; the one industrialist seeks a strong and willing labourer, and the other seeks an energetic and intelligent one. Everybody wants to have excellent Bantu labour, but few are concerned about the implications of their demands. Employees can only do their best if they are happy, and to a large extent the happiness of Bantu employees can be assured if those bodies which, on behalf of my department, have to ensure this happiness to Bantu labourers, have at their disposal sufficient funds that will enable them to do so. And yet one finds the unfortunate phenomenon that the moment this facet of Bantu labour is raised, emotions become inflamed and even find expression in strong language. To those people one feels inclined to say, in the words of Bertrand Russell&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The degree of one&#x2019;s emotions varies inversely with one&#x2019;s knowledge of the facts. The less you know, the hotter you get.</block>

<p>In regard to this topic, this is really the case. For instance, the gross misrepresentation was made that this Bill before the House at the moment, allegedly provided that all Bantu in White areas would be &#x201C;taxed&#x201D; from now on. If hon. members would read carefully clause 2 (1) (b) of the Bill and the White Paper that was placed at their disposal, as well as the definitions of &#x201C;employer&#x201D; and &#x201C;employee&#x201D;, they would see at once that this is not the case at all. For years there has been a definition in section 22 of Chapter VIII of Government Notice R.1892 of 1965 of &#x201C;casual labourer&#x201D; or a person who works for his own account. There are very few casual Bantu labourers of this type in respect of whom R1 can be collected in terms of this Bill and who are therefore affected by this Bill. No Bantu person, except a casual Bantu labourer, need therefore make any payment in terms of this Bill, and I hope there will be no misunderstanding in this regard.</p>

<p>My department, local authorities throughout the country and I myself, who have to bear the brunt as regards the provision of Bantu labour, often find ourselves in the situation that the public does not realize what expenditure Bantu administration involves, and that costs, in respect of the provision of this basic service as well, are showing an upward trend. For that reason I should like to give the House an idea of those matters which involve expenditure within the framework of the administration of Bantu employees in White areas.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Whilst I concede, Mr. Speaker, that the scope of the Bantu Services Levy Act, 1952, is confined to the provision of certain defined services, and whilst my department and myself have taken into account the fact that some local authorities have built up balances, and in some instances quite substantial balances, in their Bantu Services Levy Account, it is our firm conviction that we cannot conceive of a situation ever being reached where services in respect of Bantu employees would become superfluous or altogether obsolete. It is therefore logical that the Bill will fall short of its requirements if employers were to be exempt from contributing towards such essential necessities. Indeed, we cannot waive the need for providing for essential services such as a good water supply, sanitation services, electricity supply, roads&#x2014; including bus roads and termini&#x2014;clinics and health services, recreational facilities, cr&#x00E8;ches, community centres, libraries and, <span class="col_479-480" refersTo="page_0255"/>what is more, the maintenance of these services. After all, we are a civilized country, and we are duty bound to look after the interests of these labourers in our midst. Within the framework of Bantu administration, as developed over the years, these costs have become known as &#x201C;administration costs&#x201D;, and you will note that administration thus includes everything that is necessary to ensure that the Bantu employee, whilst he sojourns in the White area, is a happy and contented person&#x2014; that he is not merely treated as a commodity but as a human being with human needs. Employers are richly rewarded by the fruit of this policy.</p>

<p>In addition to the essential services already mentioned, costs in respect of the provision of adequate office accommodation, the running of an efficient labour bureau, the provision of effective aid centres to assist workers and work seekers generally, and the subsidization of rentals in deserving cases, should not be overlooked. Furthermore, sight should not be lost of needs of employees resident in the homelands, but working in the industrial areas of White South Africa. At present more than 300 000 Bantu employees travel daily on a subsidized basis between their homes in the homelands and their places of employment in the White areas, and this number is increasing. For that reason it would be competent for a board to canalize some of its surplus funds voluntarily to an appropriate homeland. In addition my Department is busy with vocational orientation projects within homelands from which industry will greatly benefit especially on a long-term basis. These projects are being carried out in close collaboration with the CSIR and the National Occupational Safety Association with a view to promoting the following:</p>

<ol>

<li>(i) A more efficient Bantu labour supply organization;</li>

<li>(ii) facilities for medical examinations;</li>

<li>(iii) aptitude tests of a general nature;</li>

<li>(iv) safety measures in factories;</li>

<li>(v) cleanliness in working conditions; and</li>

<li>(vi) vocational orientation.</li>

</ol>

<p>There should be no illusion regarding the costs entailed in the peculiar administration under discussion. To illustrate what is involved the position of one big city can be taken as a case in point. This city requires a total personnel of just over 4 000 units apart from agency services rendered by other departments of the local authority, such as the town treasurer, the engineering department, etc., while rentals in respect of Bantu housing are estimated for 1971-&#x2019;72 to be subsidized to the extent of R4 million. Now it must be remembered that when rentals are subsidized from a local authority&#x2019;s general account, it means in effect an indirect taxation of all persons within the area of jurisdiction of such a local authority, whether they employ Bantu or not. It is however not the intention to burden employers with an elaborate urban Bantu administration, but any such administration must have adequate funds to be efficiently run and particularly in such a manner that essential services are not skimped. Bearing this in mind you will appreciate, Sir, that neither my Department nor its agent, namely a local authority or a Bantu administration board, when it is instituted, can at this stage predict exactly what amount per Bantu employee would be required in any particular area or for an efficient administration as a whole, or simply to ensure an adequate service, especially as regards really efficient labour bureaux and aid centres. It would therefore be unrealistic to commit oneself to any <i>per capita</i> figures, but my Department and I consider a maximum of R2,50 per month sufficient for a period of, we hope, at least five to ten years. It could also be longer. It is for this reason that the Bill purports to be an enabling measure, leaving ample scope for the determining of fees, on a differential basis from time to time.</p>

<p>*It is not expected that any need will arise in the near future for the maximum amount of R2,50 to be levied in any area.</p>

<p>The Bill deals chiefly with the following: (a) the consolidation of three types of fees or levies, namely the labour bureau fee, the registration fee and the levy payable in respect of Bantu services; (b) the principle of differentiation, i.e. between employers, between areas or also between categories of employers; and (c) the utilization of the contributions.</p>

<p>In respect of (a), the consolidation of these three types of fees, I must point out a very important provision contained in clause 5 of the Bill, namely that although <span class="col_481-482" refersTo="page_0256"/>the present Bantu Services Levy Act, 1952 (Act No. 64 of 1952), is not being repealed now, any person who in terms of this Bill pays a contribution, is <i>ipso jure</i> no longer liable for Bantu services levies, nor for any other fees. However, it is not possible for the relevant Act, as well as the other provisions, to be withdrawn now just like that, for this legislation will not necessarily be applied everywhere; it will gradually become applicable, only subsequent to a proper investigation having been carried out and my having been advised in this regard by the local authorities. The present moneys in the Bantu Services Levy Fund will remain there and will be utilized or spent just as was done in the past, and in accordance with the procedures and principles that were applicable in the past. As has already been said, without prior investigation it is impossible to say what the fee in respect of any category of employer in any area will amount to, but it is my wish that no unnecessary surpluses should accumulate from these contributions. By those means an important assurance is given to the White employers who have to make this contribution.</p>

<p>&#x2020;As regards (b), i.e. the principle of differentiation, the position has been briefly but clearly set out in the White Paper. The Bill provides that when a Government notice is issued which prescribes the payment of contributions, it may be applicable to employers only or to casual labourers only, or to both employers and casual labourers. It may further be applicable to all employers, or to employers belonging to a category of employers only. For example, it may be applicable only to the State, to commerce and to industry, or it may be worded in such a way that it will be applicable to all employers, except the employers of certain categories of employees, for example Bantu domestic servants, blind Bantu, or crippled Bantu. The notice may furthermore be worded that it shall apply to all casual labourers or casual labourers who are, for example, painters only&#x2014;not washerwomen, let us say&#x2014;or to all casual labourers, except painters or washerwomen, whatever the case may be. The notice may even be worded to read that contributions shall be paid in respect of all Bantu employees or only in respect of employees of certain categories, for example, those who are employed in the Post Office or as bus drivers, or it may be phrased to read that contributions shall be paid in respect of all Bantu employees except employees engaged in Postal Services or as bus drivers. You will therefore observe, Mr. Speaker, that every possible combination has been covered by the terms of this legislation. Futhermore, different rates or contributions may be determined for different employers, casual labourers or categories of employees as well as for different areas or different parts of a given area. We can discuss that later on.</p>

<p>It is possible to fix different rates for Putsonderwater and Cape Town, or different rates for the harbour area of Cape Town, the business area of Cape Town and the residential areas of Cape Town. These provisions are necessary to arrive at an equitable <i>per capita</i> figure, or exemption having regard to all the circumstances and after due consultation with local authorities so as to avoid undue heavy contributions on <span class="col_483-484" refersTo="page_0257"/>any person, especially on those who can ill afford them.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It will worry me, yes. In that regard I think I have already furnished the House with ample evidence.</p>

<p>After all, it does not require any imagination to appreciate that from the nature of the case there must be differences in the contributions of, for instance, a Karoo town and those of a metropolitan city, such as Cape Town or Johannesburg, or between the employers of domestic servants, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, those of semi-skilled Bantu labourers employed in an industry. There will also be differences between, on the one hand, washerwomen who earn only R30 to R40 per month and, on the other hand, Bantu painters who are casual labourers and earn R400 or even more per month, or between employers providing their employees with housing, with all the expenses that involves, and employers who do not provide their Bantu employees with housing. In any case, the principle of differentiation is no new principle, and is embodied in the existing legislation making provision for certain exemptions. However, in drafting notices, one will have to have regard to keeping the system as simple as possible.</p>

<p>In respect of (c)&#x2014;i.e. the utilization of the funds&#x2014;I wish to draw attention to clauses 4 and 9 in particular. I want to make the point at once that in respect of an important point clause 4 (2), as printed in the Bill before the House at the moment, differs substantially from clause 4 (2) as published for general information in the <i>Gazette</i> on 24th December, 1971. As you are aware, every local authority has to keep a Bantu revenue account in terms of section 19 of the Bantu (Urban Areas) Consolidation Act, Act No. 25 of 1945. All revenue relating to Bantu administration is paid into that account, and the expenditure is paid out of that account. The Act also makes provision for the manner in which expenditure is to be utilized, and provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that expenditure may only be incurred subsequent to a estimate having been submitted and approved by the Minister. A special section of my department checks these estimates, and control over funds is strict. Up to now it has not been possible for the Minister to direct a local authority to pay out moneys. Experience has shown that clashes sometimes arise in cases where one local authority undertakes to render services for another&#x2014;and this is an important point&#x2014;and, owing to circumstances beyond its control, finds that it has to do it at a loss, whilst the other local authority tries to adhere strictly to the terms, which are in its favour. The present clause 4 (2), as printed, now authorises the Minister to direct the other local authority to pay over an equitable amount to the one rendering the services, and the latter, in turn, has to pay that money into its Bantu revenue account. In other words, this means that clause 4 (2), as it now appears in print before the House, differs in a very important respect from the one published for public information on 24th December, 1971. The difference is that an addition has now been made for a case where services are rendered by one local authority to another local authority. It is therefore not a general principle that the Minister may determine the utilization in respect of the surpluses of a local authority in any case. As clause 4 (2) reads now, he may only do so in a case where one local authority has rendered services to another. I should like to bring this important point to the notice of the House during the Second Reading.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I wish to draw the attention of hon. members to amounts of money paid in with a Bantu affairs commissioner. These amounts will be so small that they will actually be more of a burden than a real financial asset. With the introduction of the Bantu affairs administration boards, these moneys will disappear completely, for they will then be paid over to these boards. In the main, these moneys, if any, will have their origin in rural reas, such as fees in respect of rail workers and road workers in a rural area. These are just about the only categories there are. This money will, of course, be utilized in the interests of the Bantu. Local authorities have a great deal of autonomy in the utilization of their fees, and over the years donations have been made from the Bantu Revenue Account, particularly to welfare organizations or bodies and even to the Department of Bantu Administration and Development for utilization in the interests of the Bantu generally. Therefore, voluntary donations are involved here. This has been the practice for decades, but in recent times a certain attitude has become more and more evident an attitude in terms of <span class="col_485-486" refersTo="page_0258"/>which this practice is considered to be wrong because such moneys should only&#x2014; and I quote&#x2014;&#x201C;&#x2026; be utilized in the area where they have been collected&#x201D;. Clause 9 of this Bill, which amends section 19 of the Urban Areas Act, now puts this position beyond all doubt, namely that in a case where a local authority wishes to make a donation from its surplus funds, it shall be statutorily capable of doing so and no more. Therefore, if a local authority deems it fit, and if the Minister approves, its funds may be utilized elsewhere in the interests of the Bantu.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I believe that these explanations adequately elucidate the principles and the provisions contained in the Bill. It is most unfortunate that so much has been read into this Bill, viz., that it is the intention of the Bill to divert economic activities from developed areas to the homelands, for example, and that it is the intention of the Bill to take off more than R100 million in African taxation, etc. I wish to deny these allegations categorically. I and my department do not wish to accumulate unnecessary funds which serve no purpose. I think hon. members will all agree with that. We shall be happy if local authorities could financially be placed in the position where they can render a proper service to the public and to the Bantu employed in their areas in the form of an efficient Bantu administration; not only in the few isolated areas, but throughout the Republic of South Africa.</p>

It was very interesting to hear him talk about the urban Bantu, the intentions of the Government in respect of the urban Bantu, and what they should do to make him &#x201C;gelukkig&#x201D;, to make him happy. The hon. the Deputy Minister said that the urban Bantu must be contented, that he is a human being and that his human needs must be respected. The hon. the Minister mentioned all the facilities which must be given to the urban Bantu to make him happy and contented. Not so long ago we had another hon.

<p>When the then Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration, Mr. Coetzee, made those comments, he was quite right in proposing that because the object of the Government then was to make the urban areas less attractive so that the Bantu would go to the homelands. He was carrying out Government policy; he was being honest. But now there has been such a change in Government policy that nobody knows what the real object of the Government is; whether it is to attract Africans to the urban areas or to attract them to the homelands. Last week we had a statement from the hon. the Deputy Minister that the policy now was to allow the fairly permanent Bantu&#x2014;I do not know what he means by that&#x2014;to bring their wives in from the Reserves to live in the townships where housing is available.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Casual permanent&#x201D; or &#x201C;permanently casual&#x201D;; we could not make out which it was. Of course, we are in agreement with the hon. the Deputy Minister that the human needs of the urban African should be catered for. Our complaint against this Government has been that it has not catered for the human needs of the urban Bantu in the past. In fact, they have denied them the human needs. They have not regarded them as human beings with all the ordinary needs of human beings. That is why we have pleaded with them to allow them to have their wives in the urban areas where they can enjoy ordinary family life. It seems to me that this is what the Government has now set out to do. We are pleased to see this change of heart. There has been some suggestion that the Government is going to take R100 million in Bantu taxation through this Bill. However, the hon. the Deputy Minister says that this is nonsense. I wonder whether he can give us some idea of what they do expect to take by way of this proposed taxation. We are completely in the dark as to how much is expected to be recouped in terms of this Bill because there are so many differentiations and discriminations. We do not know actually to <span class="col_487-488" refersTo="page_0259"/>whom this Bill is going to apply and to whom not. The Minister alone will decide. I will return to this point at a later stage.</p>

<p>In stressing that the life of the urban African must be made a happier one, the hon. the Deputy Minister mentioned something about vocational training. I am not quite certain about this point. Will this vocational training be given in the urban areas&#x003F;</p>

<p>I shall get the answer. They all say I shall get it, but when shall I get the answer&#x003F; Anyway, we will get no further information on that question.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister referred to the taxation to be applied to the casual Bantu who makes his own living. As far as the term &#x201C;casual&#x201D; is concerned, the hon. the Minister is quite right&#x2014;there is a lot of confusion about the word &#x201C;casual&#x201D;. Most people of course take a casual labourer to be one who is employed today; he works in your garden and has worked for somebody else, but he is your casual labourer. That is not what is meant by &#x201C;casual&#x201D; labourer, but it refers to the self-employed labourer. Of course, in normal circumstances that man who makes as much money as the hon. the Minister told us&#x2014;I think he said that some of them make as much as R400 per month&#x2014;would not have to pay tax in this way, because he would be supplying his own house if he were allowed to. Obviously he must be living permanently in the area concerned, otherwise he would not be allowed there. A man of that nature should be in the position where he can buy his own land and have his own house. In that way he would relieve the local authority and the State from providing houses. That is another criticism we have of the Government&#x2019;s policy in regard to the urban African. As their policy now stands, the local authority and the State are responsible for building and supplying all the houses required, whereas the Bantu themselves could build a lot of houses if they were allowed to do so.</p>

<p>There is an impression amongst some people that this Bill is really a consolidating measure, because once this tax is applied employers will be relieved from the liability of contributing to the Bantu Services Levy Fund 20 cents per week; the <span class="col_489-490" refersTo="page_0260"/>monthly registration fee of 20 cents and the initial registration fee of 25 cents under the Levy Act. The 25 cents is not a recurring contribution. It is, of course, not a consolidating measure. If it were only a consolidating measure, we could give our approval provided certain assurances were given us with regard to the services levy. This is not a consolidating measure because, firstly, it will apply to all employers of Bantu labour. That is something new. It will apply to the Government, to the householder and to the farmer. The hon. the Minister can, of course, allow exemptions. I am sorry that he did not give us an indication whether it is the policy to apply it to all Government employees. We would like to know, because that would be something new. Also, provision is made for the Minister to differentiate between categories of employers, employees and areas. Thirdly, the hon. the Minister can raise the amount payable up to a maximum of R2,50 per month. At present the levies or taxes which will be effected amount to approximately R1,05, with the initial registration fee of 25 cents. Also, the object of the contribution by the employer is altered.</p>

<p>With regard to the contributions, the result should be a big increase in the contributions, i.e. that the total amount contributed should increase &#x2026;</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister said that every employer in the country is going to be affected by this Bill and that, at the moment, every employer is not affected by this Bill. Another thing, in the past, under the services levy, the employer paid according to the number of days the employee worked. Now he is going to pay for a whole month, even though the employee only works for one day in a month. The hon. the Deputy Minister nods his head.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>He does not pay for the whole month now. If the employee works for, say, two days only, the employer only pays for a week, and does not pay for a whole month. The amount to be collected if the Government applies this measure will be considerable. We are at a disadvantage arguing about this Bill, because we do not know how it is going to be applied. We are completely in the dark. At any rate, the Government will not collect less than it does now.</p>

<p>The second point is that the hon. the Deputy Minister can differentiate between employers. He can also differentiate between areas. The Minister can, therefore, in order to make East London, for example, more attractive than Johannesburg, differentiate and make the employer of a certain industry in Johannesburg pay the full amount of R2,50, whereas the employer in East London need only pay 50 cents. The Minister will be entitled to do that; he can differentiate. With this measure the Government can, by means of taxation, force employers to carry out their policy. As this Bill is now, the Minister of Planning and his department is not necessary. The Government force industry to a certain area. The Department of Bantu Administration can do this by levying the full tax on other areas and giving taxation relief in the area to which they wish the factory to go. This is why the hon. the Deputy Minister would not tell us when we asked him what he meant by differentiation in areas. This is in fact what it means. As we read this Bill, he can apply different rates of taxation in different areas. I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister will tell us whether we are wrong or not.</p>

<p>In terms of this Bill there is a limit to the tax which he can apply, namely R2,50. I have said that, at the moment, the tax amounts to approximately R1,05 per month without the initial registration fee of 25 cents. I have said too, that with the powers of taxation being given here now and the increase in the number of employees on whom taxes are going to be paid, the R1,05 could be reduced. There should not be any necessity to increase the ceiling, because once administration areas with administration boards have been brought into being, administration should be less costly. It should be more economic to run administration boards than individual municipalities, because duplication of staff will be eliminated. This provision&#x2014;call it a levy or a contribution&#x2014;of whatever amount is fixed, amounts to taxation. Parliament, by agreeing to this measure, will lose its control of taxation. It is like the Minister of Finance saying to us, &#x201C;I am making a ceiling now. I am not going to put your income tax up to more than 90 per cent of your income. I do not think I will have to do that for ten years, but I want to take the power to do it.&#x201D; This measure creates too much uncertainty. When you have taxation, it should be clear and ascertainable. Parliament should know who is going to be taxed. We cannot give a blank cheque to this Minister to tax whom he likes and to what amount he likes, up to R2,50 per month.</p>

<p>I should like to remind the House and the Minister that most of this taxation will come from the services levy. We remember that when that services levy was introduced, the employers were given the assurance by Dr. Verwoerd that as soon as it had served its purpose, it would be abolished. The Minister is not running away from that. He admits that that is what Dr. Verwoerd said. He has also admitted that local authorities have not been able to spend all the amounts collected under that services levy. Last year when we discussed this measure, we were given to understand that the total standing to the credit of the fund was something like R26 million. I suppose it is much more now. We quite agree that employers should contribute towards the services. We have no objection to their providing better amenities for the people whom they employ. But we also say that we should remember that Dr. Verwoerd promised that the services levy which they would pay, would only be used for the Africans whom they themselves employ.</p>

<p>At the end of his speech the hon. member for Transkei particularly laid emphasis on the money being paid over to the Bantu administration boards. In that connection it is important that we note that the Bantu-administration boards are specifically bodies instituted to deal with the Bantu labourer in a White area. In a certain sense, in terms of the measures adopted here last year, the work done by local authorities on an agency basis, as agents of the Central Authority, is partly transferred to the administration boards, and if this levy, about which the hon. member is so concerned, goes to the administration boards, it surely serves the specific purpose we had in mind in passing the Bantu Services Levy Act. This Bill serves the specific purpose for which the Bantu Services Levy Act was introduced; the money is transferred to the administration boards. The field covered by these two Acts is exactly the same. The hon. member also hit out strongly at the hon. the Deputy Minister about the assurance Dr. Verwoerd gave that if the levies were no longer necessary, the Act would be repealed. But, Sir, today we are dealing with the practical fact that there are certain local authorities that cannot use the levies. One of our motives in the establishment of these administration boards is to bring about greater labour fluidity and everything connected with that. In my view the Opposition&#x2019;s attitude is diametrically opposed to their own policy, since throughout the years they have been so-called advocates of greater labour fluidity and have advocated that actually there should be no restrictions by way of influx control on the labour fluidity &#x2026;</p>

<p>Today the Opposition wants to imply here that the fact that certain moneys, collected in terms of the Bantu Services Levy Act, has virtually become unnecessary, proves that that Act must be done away with. What then about the Opposition&#x2019;s demands that more Bantu labour be made available and, in addition, that there be greater labour mobility within a certain specific area&#x003F; We have established the Bantu administration boards to bring this about. It is important that we tell the Opposition that under the National Party&#x2019;s dispensation certain things took place in respect of urban development within the Bantu homelands, having a direct bearing on the Bantu in the White area. The hon. the Minister referred to the fact that there are certain local authorities which have already made donations for the development of Bantu townships in the Bantu homelands. Hon. members are now terribly concerned about the development of Bantu townships within the Bantu homelands, but we have already seen how this works in practice. We also have examples of such Bantu townships in the Western Transvaal, where contributions for their development are made by local authorities. That action was aimed chiefly at removing the unproductive Bantu from the White areas, and to make housing and various facilities available for the productive <span class="col_495-496" refersTo="page_0263"/>Bantu. This is in accordance with our policy of supplying housing for the productive Bantu within the White area and removing the others. I will not allow myself to be told that there is no connection between the two, and our White urban areas and local authorities must assist in the development of certain Bantu townships within the Bantu homelands, not only indirectly, but actually and directly. In this connection I could mention many examples. It is wrong simply to say about this legislation, which gives the Minister certain powers to employ money in the interests of the Bantu, that the Minister is only going to use those powers to employ money for development in the Bantu homelands to take place. I say: If development takes place in the Bantu homelands, and that development originates as a result of the establishment of Bantu townships created to relieve the position within the White area, this is always still beneficial to the White employer. This is something the original Bantu Services Levy Act also aimed at. Consequently from the Opposition side there can be no argument about us simply using this money for the development of the Bantu homelands. If we develop Bantu townships within the Bantu homelands, affording relief to the situation in the White area, it is as much in the interests of the employer in the White area, as in anyone else&#x2019;s interests.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. D. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, we have never said that we would simply take that money. This legislation states: If a surplus exists in respect of that account, the hon. the Minister and his department can negotiate with the city concerned&#x2014;for example, the Johannesburg City Council&#x2014; to make certain concessions to other municipalities. Let me explain it to the hon. member in this way: The Johannesburg City Council supplies services in certain Bantu townships round Johannesburg, for example Soweto, Alexandra, etc., but the Randburg Town Council does not do so.</p>

<p>The Randburg Town Council may have certain revenue from any of the four sources of revenue mentioned in this legislation, but they are under no obligation to supply any services. After consultation it could then be decided that the Randburg Town Council must make a contribution to the Johannesburg City Council for the services funished in Bantu residential areas in the White area. The hon. member did not understand me correctly and I should like to come back to his question. I have never claimed that money was simply going to be taken from Johannesburg to be sent into the Bantu homelands for development there. But we have had examples, for instance that of the 14 towns in the Western Transvaal which had surpluses on their levy and Bantu beer accounts. They simply got together, there was co-operation and a central township by the name of Itsoseng, between Lichtenburg and Mafeking, is at present developing. Those municipalities accepted responsibility for the development of that specific township, and this township affords relief within the White area in that all unproductive Bantu are removed from those areas so that place can be made for productive Bantu within those areas. My point is now that if this happens&#x2014;and the Minister now obtains the power in terms of this Bill to make possible for those municipalities what they already do in practice by way of donations&#x2014;surely the position in the White area is relieved, and to the White area can come more Bantu who can be productively active there. I can see no objection to that. In fact, this is the rectification of a position that already exists today. [Interjections.] The hon. members may make their own speeches. I do not have the time to answer questions now.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Transkei also claimed here that the Bill before us is not a consolidating measure, but rather one that is appearing <i>de novo</i> before this House and in which the hon. the Deputy Minister is appropriating certain powers for himself. Anyone who looks properly at this Bill will see that it merely contains a collection of consolidating measures. I would perhaps concede one point to the hon. member for Transkei, i.e. that where the measure provides for a maximum fee of R2,50 per month that must be paid, as the Deputy Minister said, that fee is not merely a comprehensive one in relation to the existing fees under the various Acts relevant here. But the hon. the Deputy <span class="col_497-498" refersTo="page_0264"/>Minister indicated that the time was ripe for certain increases in those fees to take place, for the sake of the proper functioning of the administration. It is wrong to claim now that if the Deputy Minister provides that there will be a maximum fee of R2,50, it deprives this Parliament of the power to determine the taxes. I think the hon. member must go and determine the difference between a tax and a levy. There is a big difference between the two. A tax applies where someone is taxed on certain factual information relating to income. In the broad sense of the word levies deal with administration moneys collected in order to provide certain services. It has nothing to do with taxes in the normal sense of the word; it has to do with the establishment of funds for the purposes of administration. Now, the Deputy Minister sets it at R2,50, while at this stage it is in the vicinity of R1,05. However, the Deputy Minister said very expressly that it is a measure intended to ensure that we would not have to return to Parliament every year in order to amend this matter. And it is quite logical that where one is dealing with levies and administration moneys it must not be necessary to come back to Parliament each time for the amendment of such an Act.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of the various classes of employers. I think the Deputy Minister will reply to that in greater detail. But I think that if it is not stated in any of the other Acts that the State and the farming industry must pay for their employees, or whatever the case must be, it is quite right that, with respect to these services being furnished at all levels, we now include all employers in these relevant provisions.</p>

<p>The Deputy Minister has already intimated that the State&#x2019;s labourers and so on are being included. In principle, in terms of this legislation, all employers can be included, but there is authorisation for the Minister to decide upon the classification for inclusion. And then it is very important&#x2014;simple common sense tells one&#x2014;that one cannot make a provision which can simply be taken right through. There are circumstances that have to be taken into consideration and those circumstances will definitely be taken into consideration when it is determined what employers will be included and what their classification will be. I think the hon. members must be very careful if they want to criticize us on that specific point and were to come forward with the argument, for example, that the moneys for a domestic servant and that for a man working in an industry or factory should be exactly the same. The hon. members must be very careful what they do in that connection. We on this side depart from the standpoint that differentiation is possible, that it will take place with discretion and that it will not simply be a rigouristic determination and no more. I think the hon. the Deputy Minister will indicate that at this stage, for example, there is an idea that farmers will not be included. These are matters that the Deputy Minister can indicate to you. The principle that all employers are being included is, however, correct. The second principle that cannot be circumvented is that there must be ministerial discretion, and the Minister must exercise that discretion with respect to the classification of the specific employers and employees.</p>

<p>The hon. member also tried to insinuate that by way of taxation this Deputy Minister, as he put it, could now force employers in South Africa to accept, for example, the policy of border area development&#x2014;I think that is what he implied. The hon. member referred to the possibility of the tax in Johannesburg being R2,50, but that in East London only 15 cents, thereby forcing people to go to the border industries.</p>

<p>The hon. member must not dispose of the whole question of consultation. I also remember very well how last year these hon. members referred disparagingly to this Government&#x2019;s idea of consultation with respect to this question of the relationship between the Central Government and the provincial authorities and also this question of the Bantu Administration Board. However, if he would take a little trouble I think that hon. member could determine how far the hon. member for Langlaagte and his committee have already progressed with the establishment of these administration <span class="col_499-500" refersTo="page_0265"/>boards in consultation with various groups of people. In fact, so much progress has been made that in the urban complexes there are local authorities that are now hurrying that hon. member and this hon. Minister along for want of administration boards. This we have obtained on the grounds of consultation. I can quite understand that those hon. members cannot join in discussions about consultation, because they cannot even consult each other in a no confidence debate&#x2014;let alone consult with other people! However, this Government has built up a reputation with respect to consultation, not only with other peoples in South Africa, but also with several bodies in South Africa. There is abundant proof that that consultation will take place. Saying that the hon. the Deputy Minister and his department will ask R2,50 in Johannesburg and 15 cents in East London, simply to force all the people to the border industry at East London, is a ridiculous example to use.</p>

<p>It is not possible because consultations are going to take place. Neither the Johannesburg or East London local authorities, whatever authorities are concerned in the matter, would be so foolish that on this specific point of consultation they would not see the matter in the correct perspective. Just as hon. members predicted that these administration boards of ours would not get off the ground, while we have nevertheless made brilliant progress with our own manner of consultation, the hon. the Minister will also be able to progress in this matter of consultation. We must not present that kind of argument to the public at large as being a valid argument, i.e. that this is a tax that is going to be imposed on employers simply to ensure that the Government&#x2019;s policy in the border industry areas is implemented. This is, after all, merely to conjure up spectres and will create amongst employers an antagonistic attitude towards all the provisions of this legislation. Since this legislation with its consolidating provisions is specifically aimed at facilitating certain matters for the employers and eliminating a great deal of paper work, it is altogether wrong of the hon. member to use that type of argument in this House and then to propagate that attitude to the outside world. This is wrong because it is not only detrimental to the general growth of the country, but also to the orderly planning of South Africa, and the hon. member knows it.

<ol>

<li>(a) any domestic servant employed by a private householder; or</li>

<li>(b) any adult male Bantu for whom his employer provides accommodation approved by any competent authority having jurisdiction &#x2026;</li>

</ol>

<p>There are a number of exclusions. As the position stood at the end of September, 1971, in Johannesburg, I believe 43 000 employers at least would have been excluded as against the position today. I would rather leave that for a moment and just say that the effect of this Bill, the purpose of this Bill does not present the beautiful picture which the hon. the Deputy Minister has tried to paint to us in his opening address. It was extraordinary to the listener to hear this beautiful euphoric story which the hon. the Deputy Minister put before this House, of his intense and sincere desire to ensure the best interests of the urban Bantu. Whilst I highly commend that, and would do nothing in the world to decry the purpose and the nobility of that thought, I do say that it sounded most extraordinary in his introduction to this Bill. I say this because this Biill is intended to provide the funds that the Bantu Administration Boards will require in order effectively to administer the services that they are going to render in their administration. First of all, they will need much more money than the Native services levy provided. Secondly, the losses of which they complained local authorities were suffering because of additional services to the urban Bantu would have to be made up. This was the way in which it could be done. It was, therefore, necessary to do away with the necessity for collecting funds under the Native Services Levy Act and to have an entirely new Bill altogether. This Bill just sailed merrily along and provided for contributions for any purposes within or allied to that particular prescribed area where a particular board or authority operated. It completely widened the entire source of funds which these boards would receive and the purposes to which it should be applied. Hitherto the R26 million which has been bothering the hon. the Minister for a couple of years could not be used because he has been tied to an undertaking which a former Prime Minister gave this House, an undertaking which he does not want to dishonour and, I take it, will not dishonour. Therefore he has to find another means of raising the funds that are necessary in order to avoid bringing to an end the wonderful flow of funds which comes so easily into the hands of the authorities and which he now wishes to use for any purpose at all. What I do not wish to decry is what the hon. the Deputy Minister said in his opening words. Will he indeed use it for all the purposes which he has described to us&#x003F; I just want to mention the City of Johannesburg as an example. I do not hold any brief for the particular authority because the authority, in any event, is passing into the hands of a Bantu Administration Board one of these days. In Soweto you will require anything up to R6 million or R7 million to meet the immediate shortage of schools. This is one simple example of the services that are required. In the case of Johannesburg there was a deficit of R2&#x00BD; million in the Bantu Revenue Account last year. This was very severely criticized by people like the hon. member for Langlaagte and by the hon. the Deputy Minister himself. However, that shortage was due to the fact that services of an urgent, important and useful nature, such as the hon. the Deputy Minister described in this euphoric address, were required, and because there were not sufficient funds in the Bantu Revenue Account to meet the costs, the ratepayers subsidized it to the extent of 2&#x00BD; million. A year ago it was severely criticized. A year ago it showed maladministration, it showed irresponsibility, it showed the inability of an authority to handle its affairs properly. That was the allegation made by hon. members on that side of the House. Yet, with this Bill the hon. the Deputy Minister hopes to rake in from Johannesburg alone at R1,05 over R5 million per year. If he goes up to R1,50, it will be nearly R8 million, and if he goes up to R2, which he probably will, he will rake in just on R10 million from this one source alone.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, let us not bluff ourselves. The time has come not to bluff ourselves. The reason why it is necessary to place a ceiling is that it is vizualized that you cannot come back to Parliament year after year for more money. Here you have an opportunity to increase your income by many millions of rands. The discretion will rest with the Minister. All that is needed is a proclamation in the <i>Government Gazette</i> and the funds will be available to meet an enormous task which hitherto has been shirked and in respect of which there is a tremendous backlog, brought about because of the non-cooperation of the Government with local authorities in dealing with the urban Bantu. But I do not want the hon. the Deputy Minister to be upset at what I am saying. I merely want him to face the facts. I just want him to know that, if he does apply it satisfactorily&#x2014;as has been questioned by one of the hon. members on our side of the House&#x2014;for the purposes he has declared, namely clinics, cr&#x00E8;ches, sports fields, sporting amenities, technical training, schools, cultural assistance to young people and for recreational purposes, I can understand that there may be a purpose in bringing the services levy to an end. The citizens will co-operate if what the hon. the Minister said is correct, and I am sure it will be. I certainly hope that it is correct. I want him to know that the House must not be left under the wrong impression that this is merely an easier method from an administrative point of view to ease the burden of perhaps, the employer of labour, allowing him to make a payment of just one sum without the necessity for a lot of additional paper work, etc. It has a very much more important and wider purpose, namely to obtain funds for a purpose. This brings me to a point which was argued a little while ago, namely how will we know what happens to the funds. Parliament, which has to give the power to the hon. the Deputy Minister to enable his administration to obtain these funds, should know what will happen to these funds. Parliament should know what is received so that the citizen can raise his voice if necessary where he is entitled to do so, either in criticism or in order to make clear to the administration and the Government his point of view with regard to the use and purpose of the funds which will be paid. Whilst it may be called a levy by an hon. member on the Government side, it is a form of indirect taxation.</p>

<p>Did the hon. member for Langlaagte say that&#x003F; He probably listens to himself; that is the only way in which he can ever make a speech in this House. He probably recall his own speech. I am not talking through the back of my neck; I know what I am talking about. This is not a levy any more, but an indirect form of taxation in order to provide the necessary funds for the administration of the Bantu Administration Board. The hon. member for Langlaagte is being critical only because he is sitting on the special committee in Pretoria which is going to work out the constitution of the various boards throughout the country. Of course he does like the idea of the public considering it as a levy. It cannot be a levy; it has no objective other than proper administration, I hope. Since it has that object, it is an indirect form of taxation. Therefore Parliament has the right to know how the money is being spent and administered.</p>

<p>I further want to say that the hon. the Deputy Minister tried to laugh out of court the question of R100 million per year. Johannesburg certainly does not represent more than 10 per cent or 15 per cent of the entire labour force of the country. Is that not so&#x003F; If it represents 20 per cent, about R30 million at least will be obtained every year, plus the bureau fees and the fact that there are many more people being taxed.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister promised he would give us the figure. What we on this side of the House feel is the correct procedure is that the hon. the Minister of Finance should account to Parliament yearly for the expenditure of these funds, and what he estimates the income from these funds will be for the purposes for which they are required. Otherwise, as was pointed out by the hon. member for Umtata, it is as if a blank cheque were put in the hands of the hon. the Minister, which we feel is not wise. Now we have talk about consultation. This question of consultation is purely at the behest of the hon. the Deputy Minister. There is no provision for consultation in the Bill. We have that in the Bantu Affairs Administration Act of 1971; I think one or two sections of that Act speak of consultation with the local authorities when making certain changes. Nothing to that effect is said in this Bill. The hon. the Deputy Minister gives us his assurance that he will consult but if he is not in office next year and his successor might even be an hon. member on this side, I am sure, he may not want to consult because he finds no provision in the Act.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>The point is that if there is to be consultation provision should be made in the Bill, and not merely a statement by the hon. the Deputy Minister in the House.</p>

<p>The other point is the question of the differentiation of charges. This is a very important aspect of the Bill and I believe that differentiation is something which should, by means of the Budget, be something that can be dealt with in this House. One does not know how it will be applied, because it is also purely at the discretion of the hon. the Minister. Quite frankly, I do not know how the boards will be constituted and which remote towns will be included. We may find that big centres will be paying for the development of areas completely outside their interests, areas which make no contribution whatsoever to the source from which the funds come. That is a responsibility which should rest on the shoulders of the State and not one which should be passed on to the industrialist or to the employer of labour. I feel that if there is to be consultation at all, this question of consultation should also be embodied in this clause which provides for differentiation.</p>

<p>I want to make it perfectly clear to the hon. the Deputy Minister that this side of the House is very anxious to ensure that the whole approach to the problem of the urban Bantu is a sound and realistic one. Its objectives should be to ensure that there is proper housing; that there are proper race relations between White and non-White; that amenities are provided, amenities that will make them a contented and stable community; that electricity is provided in consultation with local authorities or other electricity authorities who operate in the country; that a blueprint is established in conjunction with a Bill of this nature, a blueprint that will ensure that all these amenities are catered for. The hon. the Deputy Minister will then be in a position to approach the employer and set the figure which he wishes to set in respect of contributions for each employee. I feel that without doing so the Government will fall into its old habit, something which we have criticized constantly and something which unsettles and dissatisfies the public, namely that globular sums are voted through the instrumentality of a Bill and that no one really knows how that money is applied except as the department through the discretion of the Minister applies it. I feel this is not a fair load to throw on to the shoulders of the industrialist and the employer of labour in the various towns throughout the country.</p>

<p>I want to make one final point. I think the Government must realize that it is unable to handle this important problem in our country unless it has the co-operation and the goodwill of the employer and John Citizen. I think the Government should realize that it cannot rule virtually by decree or try to lull the public into a false sense of reality in this country, to make them believe things that do not exist, to make them believe that everything is rosy and under control and that everybody is happy. We do know that in the country today there is more unhappiness, hatred and conflict than we have had in many, many years. These are not physical conflicts &#x2026;</p>

Here is an opportunity for him to do something worth while, provided he can make the satisfactory changes in this Bill which will enable it to be a workable measure, one that will contribute towards the welfare of the community, that will help each particular area which makes its contribution to meet the problem that faces it. If you have a city with &#x00BE; million, you must use all the funds you have available there, because it is very difficult, almost impossible, to satisfy its needs even through the funds that will flow from this Bill. This very principle that is contained here of diffusing those funds, I think will undoubtedly foil any assurances which the Deputy Minister has given us that this Bill will work satisfactorily and carry out these dreams which he puts before us and which I hope he really means to carry out.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetsee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to begin on the same note on which the hon. member for Jeppes concluded and point out to him that his own city of which he was for a considerable time, I think, the first citizen, bears the best testimony to the contributions that can be collected from the employer. Members on this side of the House visited Soweto, Meadowlands and bordering areas during the recess. What did we encounter there&#x003F; Not &#x201C;more hatred&#x201D;, which the hon. member for Jeppes speaks about; we encountered a smiling, happy community there. They are people cultivating their gardens, who are happy with the kind of housing they have, and who have recreational facilities they are proud of. But, alas, like a monument to the obstinacy of that side of the House in definitely providing proper housing for the Bantu, there is still the area known as Pimville. It stands there like a monument, a finger pointing at the other side of the House. And one can also recall their resistance of all the legislation which led and contributed to the financing of better housing and resettlement in those areas. The hon. member is not listening to me. I take it he does not want to listen because he does not have any reply. Because he does not have a reply, the hon. member levels the accusation here about there being more hatred in these times than ever before. Unfortunately we gain the impression that every inch of progress towards goodwill which this side of the House makes or tried to make, is regretted by that side of the House, specifically by someone like the hon. member for Jeppes.</p>

<p>During the Second Reading debate last year about the Bill which led to the passing of the Bantu Administration Boards Act, the hon. member for Transkei pointed out that the Bantu Revenue Account is not strong enough to provide for all the Bantu administration services in places such as Johannesburg or Cape Town, for example. He himself pointed that out. The question now is, what then is his solution&#x003F; His solution&#x2014;and also that of the hon. member for Jeppes&#x2014;is apparently that we must come to this House with a system of taxation. Sir, it does not take much political knowledge and experience to know in advance that if we came to this House with a well-ordered tax proposal, that side of the House would hit the roof. That side of the House must tell us today whether they accept it as the collective responsibility of all employers and White South Africa, to establish a mobile labour force in the White Area.</p>

<p>That is what they are asking for here every day. The moment they accept that principle, a look must be taken at the financing of the essential services for this working community. If we look at the aspects the hon. the Deputy Minister mentioned as being involved in these services, we find that each of these facets can contribute to our having a happier labour community in White South Africa. We refer to the provision of water, sanitary services, the provision of electricity, roads, clinics and health services, recreational facilities, community centres, libraries, aid centres, etc. If this is endorsed in principle &#x2014;and I want to emphasize this&#x2014;then that side of the House has no right to object to the establishment of this system of contributions by certain Bantu and employers. Sir, what is important is that while that side of the House regrets our coming forward here with a uniform levy, at the same time they do not see the employers&#x2019; side of things. The employer will now make a single monthly payment instead of three levies, i.e. labour bureau fees, registration fees and service levies. The last one is calculated weekly at 20 per cent per Bantu worker. Those who have experience of this calculation will know that it is a <span class="col_509-510" refersTo="page_0270"/>complicated formula; a troublesome document must be completed every month. These matters are now all being consolidated for the joint benefit of the employer and the employee.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Transkei has now returned and I just want to dwell on one or two of his introductory remarks which contain his entire argument against this Bill, i.e. that in this Bill there is a deviation from the approach of this side of the House at the time when Dr. Verwoerd piloted through the Bantu Services Levy Bill. But he goes further. From the trend of his speech it is clear that he doubts our wanting to make the Bantu worker a happy worker in the White area. Sir, the hon. member for Transkei does not realize what is really being envisaged here. He does not realize what the purport of our policy is. The purport of our policy is, in fact, that as we link up the Bantu to his homeland, his fatherland, he will become a happier person and a happier worker in White South Africa. For him a greater amount of certainty will take root.</p>

<p>Sir, he linked that up to the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s announcement last week. What nonsense! For example, if I were to go and work in England or America for a year or longer and obtain a visa for myself only, not for my family, and after two or three years I am granted leave to have my wife join me, does that mean that that country has changed its policy&#x003F; That is precisely what is happening here, and precisely what provision is being made for here. As our policy develops further and this worker&#x2019;s orientation becomes homeland-centred, he will become a happier worker here, provided that side of the House does not purposely botch up the position further.</p>

<p>As regards the one particular clause with which the Opposition is dealing, i.e. the discretion of the hon. the Minister to exclude by way of proclamation certain kinds of employers or employees and areas from the present legal provision, I want to point out the positive content of this arrangement. It can only lead to the Opposition&#x2019;s continually being in a position to keep their finger on the pulse and continually to test the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s discretion in this House, and if they do not do so they will be neglecting their duty, and then that is what they are admitting by implication. This side of the House sees that measure as a logical result and continuation of the Bantu Administration Boards Act which was passed here last year. This side of the House sees it as a further development of the policy of giving South Africa a well-ordered and mobile, but also a happy, labour force in the White area.</p>

<p>The hon. member must not come and say that this Bill is consolidating them all into one payment for easy administration, because that is not what is happening. As I say, all that is happening is that five are being consolidated into four, as though this is going to be a tremendous advantage to employers of Bantu labour in this country. No, Sir, the hon. member for Bloemfontein West must not try to bluff us. He started off by saying that we on this side of the House must say whether we want a mobile labour force in South Africa. Sir, how many times have we told them what we want&#x003F; How many times have we not advised them what to do to provide for just such a labour force&#x003F; But I want to go further. How many times have we pleaded with those on that side of the House to make it a happy mobile labour force through the provision of certain amenities in the urban areas&#x003F; And what have we had in the past&#x003F; The hon. member admits that we have pleaded for it. I am glad to hear that he admits it because then somebody at least on the opposite side concedes that we have done so. But what has been the answer every time we asked for it&#x003F; What is the answer of the hon. the Minister of Community Development&#x003F; That we must not make things too comfortable for them in the urban areas; they must be attracted back to the homelands by making it far more comfortable for them in the homelands; we do not want any of the Bantu in the White areas.</p>

<p>That was the reply of that hon. Minister when he was Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration. But what did the predecessor of the hon. the Deputy Minister say&#x003F; He said the repatriation of families was priority number one. And then the hon. member for Bloemfontein West tells us this afternoon that there is no change in their policy, now that this Deputy Minister has announced belatedly, that they are prepared to allow certain Bantu wives to stay in the urban areas. But he says there is no change. What did the present Administrator of the Free State, when he held the post of this hon. Deputy Minister, say&#x003F; He said that the repatriation of families was priority number one. He said that the repatriation of 3,8 million of these superfluous appendages, as he called them, was <span class="col_513-514" refersTo="page_0272"/>in his opinion priority number one, and that was in February, 1969, three years ago. But this Deputy Minister says that there has been no change in policy. He bases his argument on the fact that this Government, as he puts it, established a forum whereby negotiations could take place with the Bantu authorities for this very concession.</p>

What I want to say to that hon. Deputy Minister is this: I believe he is honest when he says that he will allow the wives of Bantu workers, those who are &#x201C;fairly permanently&#x201D; employed, to come and settle in the White areas. I accept his honesty, but he has added a rider to this statement: provided that the amenities are there. Now I want to challenge that hon. Deputy Minister to carry out that promise. But he cannot carry out that promise if he continues with this sort of legislation. In terms of this sort of legislation the money which should be used for the provision of housing and the other amenities upon which the entry of a wife of a Bantu is dependant is going to be channelled outside of those areas to other areas. That is the most iniquitous thing about this Bill. How that Deputy Minister can make this statement in the same week in which he introduces legislation like this, I simply cannot understand, because the one cannot be reconciled with the other. I sincerely hope the hon. the Deputy Minister is honest and that he will allow these Bantu to bring in their wives, but he cannot if he continues with this legislation. Because what do we find in this legislation&#x003F; This is an extension of the principle which was accepted and introduced by that party and opposed by this party last year in this House, namely that the funds which will be available to the Bantu Administration Boards may be used outside of the areas of jurisdiction of those Bantu Administration Boards and that they can go to the Bantu homelands. It is all very well for the hon. ex-member for Benoni to interject and say that that money can only go to the homelands if the Johannesburg City Council gives it away or makes a gift of it. Sir, does that hon. member not know the regulations which he is now charged with implementing&#x003F;</p>

<p>He is busy preparing the establishment of a Bantu Administration Board in the Transvaal now, to include the Johannesburg area, and he knows that on that board there will be people whom his Government will appoint and one representative of the Johannesburg City Council&#x2014;one only&#x2014;and then he says it is going to be in the power of the Johannesburg City Council to make donations. How can he mislead this House like that&#x003F; I hope he is ashamed of himself. I sincerely hope that that statement of his will not go outside this House in an attempt to mislead the public of South Africa, because that is not so. It is the board which will decide where this money is to go. Admittedly I know that all this talk which has been going on that the Minister will be able to take this money is rot, and I am glad to put it on record. I accept that it is rot. The Minister cannot take the money but he is setting in motion the machinery, which he will control, whereby he will get that money into the homelands and out of the urban areas where it belongs.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>I am very glad to get this assurance from the hon. the Deputy Minister. We believe that the Bantu homelands must be developed, but they must be developed by moneys voted by this Parliament and not moneys taken away from urban areas where it should be used for other purposes. I am very glad to get that.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister made two statements when he introduced this measure; he said that the workers can only work properly if they are happy; I accept that. But he went further and said that it was desirable that the local authorities should voluntarily canalize moneys to the homelands. Now, Sir, I hope he is not going to bring too much pressure to bear on these local authorities because these Bantu cannot be happy if they have not got amenities. I am sure the Deputy Minister realizes that. I hope he will stick to the undertaking he has given me and leave the money there and for the provision of these amenities; and let us make these areas as luxurious and as nice as possible for them.</p>

<p>But I must cross swords with the hon. the Deputy Minister on another point, and that is the question of the use to which he can put the powers for which he is asking in this Bill, particularly the power to canalize industry to those points where he wants it to go. I have heard him deny this while other members on this side have been talking, but I have not heard him really give any assurances on this point. We would like to have clarity from him how he intends applying the powers for which he is asking here. It is an old trick of this Government&#x2019;s to come with a Bill like this and to ask for blanket powers without telling us exactly how they are going to use those powers. In the case of the hon. the Minister of Justice and the hon. the Minister of Police, as was pointed out in the debate here last week, we have had occasions where the Government has said that they want these powers but that they will only use them in a certain direction, and then we have found that they have used them in another direction. If this Bill is accepted as it is today, an industrialist could find himself paying R3,85 a month per Bantu employee. That is the maximum amount that could be levied on him today, the maximum amount which he could be taxed today by this Government. Using the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s own analogy, we could find that at Putsonderwater the total tax to the Government is only 5 cents. There is a factory close to me which employs 500 Bantu. This number, at R4 per month each, means a total of nearly R120 000 per year. Surely it is going to be worth the while of that industrialist, if he is centred in Johannesburg, to move his industry to Putsonderwater&#x003F; This is what we mean and we should like an assurance from the hon. the Deputy Minister that this is not what is behind the power he is asking for, to be able to differentiate between industries in different areas. What we should like from the hon. the Deputy Minister is an assurance that within an industry there will not be such a great variation as I have pointed out. I have taken the two extremes; I accept that. I had to take them to illustrate my point. I hope that the hon. the Deputy Minister will give us an assurance that if, for instance, an industrialist in the clothing industry in Johannesburg has to pay R2 in tax, he will not tax an industrialist in the clothing industry in one of the border areas at only 10 or 15 cents; that there will not be a large variation in the amount that he will tax an industrialist in a particular field; that the taxing should be similar.</p>

<p>The question remains, even if we receive the assurances which I have sought from the hon. the Deputy Minister, that an undertaking was given to the industrialists of this country by the late Dr. Verwoerd when he introduced the Bantu Services Lew Bill, and if this provision is accepted as we have it today, it is going to perpetuate that levy in a different guise. If for no other reason, we on this side of the House must oppose this measure.</p>

<p>Twenty-five cents.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, Mr. Speaker, it is 25 cents; I beg your pardon. The position is that these moneys were sufficient for a long time, but it cannot always be sufficient to meet the needs which have to be provided for. That is why the Minister now has the right to increase the amount to R2,50, but this is not to say that this amount will be implemented as such. It may also be less. However, for the next five or 10 years this will meet the basic needs for which it may be collected. On the other hand, one should perhaps ask the question of whether it is not as a result of a lack of funds that the Bantu administration services are so poor today. Is it not perhaps as a result of this fact that adequate services cannot be rendered&#x003F; I think the hon. the Deputy Minister put it very well in his introductory speech when he said it was based on the demand for labour, the provision of labour and the training of labour. We know there is a demand for labour throughout South Africa. Everyone wants a labourer, and those labourers have to be provided. In order to meet those basic needs, funds are necessary. The result is that those labourers cannot simply be caught in their wild state and deposited among industrialists. They must be trained, and that is why it is still going to cost a great deal of money to train them. The question has been asked here &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, a great deal has been said as regards this legislation, and I just want to raise a few points. Before dealing with the merits of the case, I want to deal with one point raised by the hon. the Deputy Minister. He said he disapproved of the fact that so much advance publicity, and the wrong kind of advance publicity, had been given to this Bill. If there were mistakes, I want to lay them at his door. I think he should rather have followed the procedure he did on the eve of this Session when his Department conducted Press interviews and informed the Press about certain Bills. As far as this legislation is concerned, the legislation was announced, but no explanatory memorandum was handed to the Press. No information was made available, and everyone had to guess what the intention was with this legislation. Therefore, if the Minister now deplores the fact that there were mistakes, it is the result of the particular treatment this Bill got at its publication. In speaking about these points, I want to praise the Department for the fact that the Bill was announced beforehand. I think the hon. the Minister himself will be the first person to admit that various improvements were effected because of the fact that the legislation received publicity. It has given rise to the fact that we are dealing with legislation today which is better than it was at the time it was announced. Unfortunately this is not good enough yet, as has been indicated by this side of the House.</p>

<p><span class="col_519-520" refersTo="page_0275"/>This brings me to a few comments I wish to make on the merits of this Bill. My friend the hon. member for Transkei very effectively pointed out the objections we have in principle against this Bill. I just want to emphasize two objections of this side of the House against this Bill. I shall not touch upon the others. In the first instance I just want to emphasize that it contains a tax principle which we cannot accept, a principle to the effect that there is only a ceiling on the tax that may be levied, but no detailed explanation has been given as to precisely what may be levied. This is completely at variance with the approach shown by all the Ministers of Finance in respect of taxation in general, and we cannot see why this should be different now. In the past we dealt with levies that were fixed, and if it was possible to depart from them, we knew far more accurately where we stood than is the case at present.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>But, surely, the hon. member knows these levies have been laid down, too. One may not charge more than a certain amount.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>No, but this is the kind of tax principle which will be quite inadmissible when it comes to the general Budget. I think the hon. the Deputy Minister owes it to the House to determine the financial requirements of the Department far more precisely and to tell beforehand what they want. It is important that a watchful eye should be kept on the expenditure now incurred. As the Bill reads at present, it will be impossible to keep a watchful eye, and it will be very difficult for us to learn precisely what has happened to the money and what things have been done with it.</p>

<p>The second point I want to emphasize too, is the possibility that money collected in a certain city or place may be spent at quite a different place. The hon. the Deputy Minister said this could be done by way of a donation by the local authority. That is how I understood him. This sounds all very well, but in practice it does not work out so well. The local authorities of the various cities are now going to be replaced by the Bantu administration boards. These Bantu administration boards are now going to become local authorities. We know only too well that these Bantu administration boards are dominated by the Government, i.e. the local authorities, as the Act reads, include these Bantu administration boards, and therefore it is only the Government in a different guise which is going to exercise control over these so-called donations. Say, for example, a city such as Cape Town collects money for this purpose. In Cape Town there are no Bantu who come from the homelands daily to work here, but if a Bantu administration board has been established for the Cape Town area, the Government will have the biggest say on such a board, and the board will then be able to make a donation for purposes with which we may not agree at all. As has been stated clearly by hon. members on this side of the House, we support the development of the reserves just as much as hon. members opposite do. We believe our policy will ensure that in a much cheaper way they will eventually be developed far more effectively. We say it is a wrong principle that money from these sources may in such a way, by Government resolution, be transferred to entirely different areas.</p>

<p>Our policy of the utilization of money from private entrepreneurs for creating employment in the Bantu reserves, will be far cheaper for the country than to do so by means of money which comes from the taxpayer.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by just emphasizing that it appears from this legislation, and particularly from the speech made by the hon. the Deputy Minister, that that side of the House has again adjusted its Bantu policy. As far as we are concerned, this points to an improvement. The other day we heard that family life was going to be promoted by that side of the House. In their new approach to the amenities for the urban Bantu, that side of the House has once again revealed a new approach. This confirms the impression that they have accepted that the urban Bantu now form a permanent part of our population. In conclusion I just want to say that we hope that they will realize, accordingly, the implications of the major shift that has taken place in their policy.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am very sorry the Opposition are trying to make something out of this matter which is not in actual fact happening. <span class="col_521-522" refersTo="page_0276"/>What is the Opposition trying to make people believe here&#x003F; They are insinuating that a brand new principle is being introduced here, i.e. that by way of this legislation and by means of the consolidation of the various levies which are being imposed, a tax is being levied. But surely that is not the case. No new principle is being introduced by means of this legislation. The preamble to this Amendment Bill states very clearly that this is a consolidation of all the various fees which are being levied today. Let me now try to put this in a very simple way and see whether they can perhaps understand it. Various fees are being levied today, labour bureau fees, registration fees and a levy on services are being imposed. Besides these there are two others, i.e. licence fees and transport service levies. These are the five levies which are being imposed today.</p>

<p>What is now being requested here is that the labour bureau fees, the registration fees and the service levies should be consolidated into one levy. The other two, licence fees and transport service fees, are being omitted. There is a very good reason for that, which I shall try to explain to hon. members. Licence fees are being omitted and are not being consolidated for the simple reason that licence fees are for licences taken out by people to enable them to accommodate Bantu servants in their back yards. The second, transport fees, cannot be included here for the simple reason that transport fees are administered by the Department of Transport, as the hon. members know. There is an amendment Bill on the Order Paper in respect of the Transport Act so that the transport fees may be amended. We shall have this before us shortly. These are thus the only two which are being omitted. What hon. members are saying here, i.e. that a new principle is being introduced here, creates the impression outside&#x2014;even if it is not intended to do so&#x2014;that the United Party are deliberately trying to stir up feelings outside in regard to this legislation. What we have before us is a simple, innocent consolidation Bill.</p>

<p>What has happened to the United Party&#x003F; They have once again been taken in tow by the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> and the <i>Financial Times</i> which have lost their heads and are trying to make everyone believe that an amendment is going to be introduced which is going to impose additional taxes on the employers.</p>

<p>I shall not do it again, Sir. This is a simple provision and for hon. members on the opposite side to see other things in it is quite wrong. They are merely trying to drag in a red herring here. They are putting words in the mouth of organized commerce and industry which they do not confirm. I am convinced that these people know what is contained in this measure and that they are satisfied with it. I have also discussed this matter with these people. They expressed their misgivings about this ceiling levy of R2,50. However, the matter was discussed with them. They are today quite satisfied that they will be consulted when that levy is determined. It will be done. But the United Party, through the hon. members for Jeppes and Pietermaritzburg District, is adopting an attitude here which will result in no one ever attaching any value to any standpoint they adopt here in future. They no longer have their ears to the ground. They do not know what the people outside are thinking. I think that organized commerce and industry, as a result of the Opposition&#x2019;s attitude today, must write off this Opposition completely. They mean absolutely nothing to them.</p>

<p>I want to reply to a few other questions, which are very important. I am sorry the hon. member for Transkei is not present at the moment. He said that I should reveal what is going to happen to vocational training and where vocational training is going to take place. Is it going to take place in the locations in the White areas, or where&#x003F; The policy of this party has been clearly and distinctly stated and there need be no misunderstanding in regard to it. The vocational training of these people takes place within their own homelands. There are reasons for that, <i>inter alia,</i> because we are establishing all the facilities for them there, and also because we want these trained artisans to be used in the homelands as well for the development of industries in the homelands.</p>

<p>No, Sir, we are not running away from anything. We are carrying our policy through in a logical way. Actually, the principal aim of this measure is that we are now removing the control of Bantu administration from the local authorities and transferring it to the Bantu Affairs Administration Boards. Since the previous session I have been working on the delimitation of these Bantu Affairs Administration Board areas, and I think that this legislation is absolutely essential, so that the collection of these various fees can be made as easy and as simple as possible for the Administration Boards. That is why this legislation is generally accepted by these people who will have a say in and control over the new Administration Boards. I really welcome it. Hon. members on the opposite side are making a great fuss about how these funds are going to be spent and who is going to have a say in regard to them. Sir, this is the first time in the history of South Africa, as far as the administration of Bantu in White areas is concerned, that you are going to have a representative body which will have control over the spending of funds for that purpose. Who are the people who are going to serve on those boards&#x003F; Who are the people who are in fact going to have an equal say in this regard&#x003F; The people who are going to serve on those boards are going to be representatives of the local authorities; they are going to be representatives of commerce, of industries and of organized agriculture; those are the people who are going to sit on those boards; those are the people who will have to administer these funds.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Transkei was sitting in this House when the Bantu Services Levy Act was piloted through here, and he knows that there is no provision in this Bill which introduces any change whatever to the provisions of the Bantu Services Levy Act. Consequently this Parliament alone is empowered to change the provisions of the Levy Act, as it stands on the Statute Book today, and until such time as that is done by this Parliament, those funds will be utilized according to the provisions of that Act.</p>

<p>Hon. members must therefore not talk about promises made by Dr. Verwoerd. No changes are being made to the provisions of this Act. Those promises will be kept as faithfully as in the past.</p>

<p>I want to say that we welcome this consolidation Bill. The Bantu Administration Boards which are being established, will also welcome it. It is a move in the right direction to establish proper administration and to simplify the levying of these funds.</p>

<p>I have listened very carefully to what the hon. member who has just sat down said. What a wonderful Bill we would have in front of us if it reflected the speech of the hon. member, but with all due respect, Sir, may I say that the hon. member should be deeply grateful to you for telling him to get on with his speech just when he was faced with the responsibility of having to explain a difficult question that had been put to him from this side of the House. While he was fumbling, Sir, you quite rightly ordered him to continue with his speech. I want to deal with one or two of the points he raised before I come to the Bill itself. I think the hon. member should get a reply. He said that there was no new principle in this Bill. Sir, the new principle in this Bill is the point which the Deputy Minister, when he introduced the Bill this afternoon, continually came back to when he complained that the existing legislation limits the area in which expenditure can take place in respect of the proceeds of the employers&#x2019; tax, or contributions.</p>

<p>No, I am coming to the tax. This is the tax, which we are dealing with now, but it was the employers&#x2019; contribution. The Deputy Minister and other hon. members referred several times to the difficulty that the objects on which the proceeds of this levy could be expended, were limited, were too circumscribed. Now there is no limit. It is only necessary for the Minister to say that in his opinion it is in the interests of the Bantu, and the money can be spent forthwith, and there is no appeal to the courts. There is no means of testing whether the Minister has applied his mind to the matter.</p>

When he is asked questions, what does he do&#x003F; He repeats the question very, very slowly, while thinking what answer he can give to this question. So he repeats it. That is an old Parliamentary trick. Mr. Speaker, you and I have been here a long time. We know that when a member is caught off balance by a question put by the other side, and a reply is expected quickly, the way to gain <span class="col_529-530" refersTo="page_0280"/>time to think it over so as to be able to give a reply which may pass muster is to repeat the question, very slowly and seriously, and with due regard to all the points raised.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I am not answering questions. The hon. member said there was no new principle. I told him what the principle was. It is the principle of the limitless power of the Minister, an individual, a principle where the Minister can even through caprice spend that money. He is completely untrammelled. If he has a peculiar neurosis he can spend the money according to that. Sir, may I say to you also, for the edification of the hon. member, that the credibility gap, so far as we are concerned on this side of the House and as far as South Africa is concerned, has stretched so wide that any assurances which are merely given in debates will be looked at with the very greatest suspicion at the present time. We want it in the Bill. The hon. member who has just sat down, referred to the assurances given by the hon. the Deputy Minister. What assurances&#x003F; He said that he gave these assurances in this debate and that they were a reply to the criticism which came from the newspapers. He does not say whether the prognostications of the newspapers are wrong. He said that in his opinion that would not happen. That is not the point. The point is whether the Bill permits it. Were the newspapers entitled on the evidence of what is here in black and white before us, to come to that conclusion&#x003F; The answer is: They were so entitled. It is no good either the hon. the Deputy Minister or the hon. member who has just sat down saying: It will not happen; the Minister will not act like that. What has the hon. the Deputy Minister said said in regard to those points that the cost to the employer is going to be that much greater&#x003F; He has simply said: We do not want to keep on coming back to Parliament with a new Bill every time we want to raise the charges. However, they put a ceiling on the charges and what is there with this bigger credibility gap, as I say, to make us believe that the Deputy Minister and his Minister and the other Deputy Minister and the whole of the hegemony concerned, are not going to come forward with the highest possible level of charges to that ceiling&#x003F; Nothing at all! We are suspicious of it and we say so.</p>

<p>When the hon. member who has just sat down referred to the pledge by the late Dr. Verwoerd&#x2014;he is the only member who has referred to it&#x2014;he said that the pledge still covered the expenditure of the money coming from the employers&#x2019; levy, we say that that is not the case. What is happening now is that the name of that levy is being changed. People who come after us will not be able to see that that is the levy in respect of which the pledge was given by the late Dr. Verwoerd. That levy produced in fact, if my hon. friend who spoke just now is correct, something like a surplus of R26 million. How did that surplus accrue&#x003F; It accrued because the Minister and his department were bound by the law, which the Deputy Minister admitted. They could not spend that money on any of those matters which fell outside the four corners of the law. They will be able to do so when this Bill is passed.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I did not expect that kind of remark from the hon. member who has just sat down; I expect it from a very young backbencher who has just come in here and who does not understand the courtesy which we extend to one another in Parliament. In the light of what has been said here about the three levies which have been amalgamated into this central tax, I just want to deal with the principles of this matter. The question arises in my mind why should only the employers pay this tax. Presumably the argument which was adduced at the time by the late Dr. Verwoerd when he imposed the Employers&#x2019; Tax, was that because the employers were getting the benefit of the Bantu labour they should pay that tax. It was limited in its scope and it was to provide certain amenities which were specified. So it was perfectly clear that the object was to let the employer pay for the benefit of having the Bantu, this certain tax, and for the proceeds to go to certain improvements in so far as the Bantu living conditions were concerned. Now we move right away from that and I do not think that can apply any longer, particularly when we see the amalgamation of these three levies into one tax. Therefore, I ask again, why does it only apply to the employers&#x003F; The Bantu who go into the towns are of immense importance to the commercial people in Natal. They are a vast purchasing body, a body of people who purchase from all sorts of undertakings in town. They help commerce tremendously and apart from the labour they provide, they help the industrialists tremendously, because they are the market to which so many industrialists sell their manufactured goods. In other words, the whole community is benefiting from that. I hear from a pretty good authority that the sudden exodus of a large number of workers to their homelands, has in a certain area of our country, hit the trading community very hard indeed. The economy of those areas, I understand, is suffering very badly. The persons who suffer are the traders, the storekeepers and generally the trading community. I repeat that it just goes to show that we still have only one economy in South Africa to which we all contribute. Where this tax is concerned, it is being levied in a discriminatory manner against employers. That is one of the first points we want to make. It is a discriminatory tax which is levied against one group of people, the employers of Bantus, because the employers of the Indian people, the employers of the Coloureds and the employers of the Whites do not have to pay such a tax. The employer is not the only beneficiary; the communities at large in our urban areas are all beneficiaries from having that Bantu labour in their areas. They benefit <span class="col_533-534" refersTo="page_0282"/>from it in so many different ways that I do not want to go into here. For that reason I say that this measure is unreasonable, it is selective and it is discriminatory against one group of the population. But not only is it discriminatory, it can also choose between employer and employer. It can choose between one employer and another in the same area and it can choose between one employer and another employer who is engaged in precisely same kind of occupation in a different area. The hon. the Deputy Minister is neither shaking his head, nor nodding it, nor wagging it, because this is what he has said himself this afternoon when he introduced this Bill. He pointed this out as a measure of excellence, but I say it is the most damnable feature of this legislation before us. The most damnable feature to my mind is that the Minister, who for all practical purposes will have complete control of the taxing machine&#x2014;the taxing machine will be in the hands of one man, the hon. Minister&#x2014;will have the right to discriminate throughout the length and the breadth of our country, to discriminate between two different employers who are engaged in precisely the same kind of occupation. He will have the power to levy a tax of a certain magnitude here and of a different magnitude there, and if those employers happen to be in other areas, he can again discriminate between employers in the specified areas and employers in the other areas.</p>

<p>The hon. Deputy Minister is merely saying that I am right. That is what is in this Bill, and this is one of the major points to which we object. Firstly, they select only employers and I have pointed out how the discrimination will take place.

However, they can levy a tax on the domestic servants employed in Benoni.</p>

<p>Yes, or Langlaagte or even Randburg. They have agreed to leave the domestic servants there, so they may as well tax them.</p>

<p>I now want to come to this question of the tax. Apparently, for some reason or another, hon. members opposite have found themselves facing a very ticklish position. They seem to be very sensitive about this question of the tax. Of course, it is a tax. I still believe that the estimate of the hon. member for Jeppes, that this tax can easily amount to R100 million per annum, is right. It has long been an established principle in regard to taxation in South Africa that as far as possible it shall be simple and easily collected. A cardinal principle, not only in South Africa, but with all the governments which are based upon a parliamentary form of government, is that Parliament shall vote supply; Parliament shall control the taxation; it shall approve the tax. It shall approve the expenditure of the proceeds of the tax annually. In this particular Bill that we have before us this afternoon, approval is not sought for a principle of a tax, but for a principle whereby a Minister, after having created what I call the Baab&#x2019;s, the Bantu Affairs Administration Boards &#x2026; When he has created a Baab he has complete control over it. Thereafter, as the money comes in for whatever the purpose may be, it may be handed over to another body for expenditure. Hon. members opposite say that if such money is handed over to a body in another area for expenditure, it will be a gift, a donation. Mr. Speaker, how easy it is to make a donation when the money you give away does not belong to you! What a hard thing it is though when the money comes out of your own pocket!</p>

<p>The position is that here we have taxation proposals, the proceeds of which can amount to R100 million. The Government, pursuant to its now avowed policy of bettering the position in the homelands, of spending large sums of money, will not be spending money obtained from the proceeds of taxation. They won&#x2019;t come to Parliament and say that they are going to levy taxation. We are all benefiting from the presence of Bantu in our towns. We are not only benefiting from their labour, but also in so many other ways, because they are contributing to the economy of South Africa in exactly the same way as any other citizen in this country, directly and indirectly. If we want to levy a tax on the people of South Africa, it will go through the normal parliamentary procedure; it will be expended in such and such a manner and we can debate it here in this House. However, none of that happens in this case. We neither know the incidence of the tax nor on whom it will fall, except that it will be on a certain group. However, we do not have the faintest idea on which members of that group the incidence of the tax will fall. Within a certain ceiling we do not know the amount of the tax. We do not have the faintest idea. We would have thought that when the hon. the Deputy Minister came here, the first thing he would have said would have been: &#x201C;We expect that this tax will produce such and such a sum of money in every full fiscal year.&#x201D; However, he does not do that. When we ask him what the figure will be, he says that he will tell us by and by. He says that he has an estimate. His estimates are worthless because, if in 12 months&#x2019; time there is a need for more money, he has already indicated that the charges will be raised without coming to Parliament. The hon. the Minister says that they have placed a high ceiling to avoid coming to Parliament. What kind of democratic government is this where R100 million can be taken out of the pockets of the taxpayer of one class, namely the employers of Bantu only and not from the taxpayers of South Africa generally, and then be disposed of at the will, whim or wish of the Minister of Bantu Administration&#x003F; Under the Bill we have before us, and the associated measures, that is precisely the position we have reached today. We on this side of the House say that that is not the way to deal with taxation in this country and that the Government should come here with a measure explaining precisely what the tax is, what it is for and how it is going to be expended. We say that it should go through the proper parliamentary procedure in the same way that other taxation measures do.</p>

<p>Before I sit down, may I say that I think the hon. the Deputy Minister missed something in that he did not sit here with the late Mr. Klasie Havenga. I remember the late Mr. Klasie Havenga as Minister of Finance sitting over there and on one famous occasion, when legislation of this kind was coming forward, actually getting up in this House and saying to hon. members on his side that he had now heard what had been said on both sides and wondered whether it was wise to proceed with that measure. His reasons for saying that was that one should bear in mind that one day there would be a United Party Minister of Finance and a United Party Minister of Bantu Administration who would be administering this law. Consequently, he asked if they were being wise in proceeding with that legislation. So, today, I want to say to the hon. the Deputy Minister that there will be a United Party Minister of Bantu Administration administering this law one day. Sir, would it therefore be wise to proceed with this&#x003F;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. D. K. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have listened attentively to the hon. member for Natal South Coast. I must say that to my mind that hon. member as well as those hon. members who preceded him, did not treat the hon. the Deputy Minister well, right and fairly. I do not think hon. members of the Opposition, of whom there have been five speakers so far, have really expressed any substantial criticism on the Second Reading debate of the hon. the Deputy Minister. I think the previous speaker in particular was unfair in his approach to the hon. the <span class="col_537-538" refersTo="page_0284"/>Deputy Minister in the sense that it was taken amiss of the hon. the Deputy Minister when he interjected that he would reply in due course to the questions put to him by hon. members opposite. I think in many ways it has become the attitude of hon. members of the Opposition to become personal with the hon. the Minister when they cannot really come forward with substantial criticism of Ministers of this side of the House. Mr. Speaker, I think you will permit me to say that although the hon. the Deputy Minister who introduced this Bill is still a young man, he is a capable Deputy Minister, and that in his job he is most conversant with these matters. I think one ought to tell both the public outside and, in particular, the Bantu with whom the hon. the Deputy Minister has to work, that he is a person who does not only have a thorough, scientific knowledge of the Bantu, but that he also knows all the basic principles of his subject. For that very reason he is competent to deal with this particular legislation.</p>

<p>However, that was not the only thing that has happened tonight. Members of the Opposition also tried to play off the hon. the Minister of Community Development against the hon. the Deputy Minister. They also suggested here that during the time the hon. the Minister of Community Development was a Deputy Minister, he had no Christian heart, no kind or sympathetic heart for those Bantu living in White areas. That is unfair and untrue. I think that if there is one Minister who has had a very sympathetic heart for the Bantu in the White areas, it is the present Minister of Community Development. We cannot allow the remarks made by quite a number of the hon. members on the opposite side to pass simply unchallenged. The hon. members of the Opposition made a big fuss in suggesting that we were allegedly once again granting those so-called dictatorial powers to the Minister. Just as that accusation they also made in the past was unfair, so it is tonight too. They say that the levy funds which will be imposed in terms of this Bill, will not come under the scrutiny of this Parliament at any time. That is not true, because the Vote of the Minister concerned is dealt with here every year. The accounts of the Bantu administration boards are duly audited so that the funds collected by them will not simply vanish into nothingness. This House as well as other bodies will most certainly gain an insight into the administration of those funds.</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast made the statement that this legislation would have the effect of discriminating against those employers who will employ Bantu labourers. He then asked: What about those employers who employ Coloureds and Indians&#x003F; That is the basic flaw in the premise of hon. members opposite, i.e. they want to see the entire South African society as one integrated whole. They do not have any thorough knowledge of the background and the reason why the Bantu are placed in this particular relationship to the White employers. The way in which the Bantu are placed in their position as employers as against the Whites, is historically quite different from what it was in respect of the Coloureds or what it was in respect of the Indians. We are dealing with a variety of communities, when one is dealing with the Bantu on the one hand, and, on the other hand, when one is dealing with the Coloureds or with the Indians. That is why the arrangements made between the White employer and the Bantu on the one hand, and those between the Coloureds and the Indians on the other hand, will from the nature of the case be different. Therefore I think it it was entirely because of a misconception that the hon. member for South Coast made such a statement. After one has listened to the arguments advanced by the hon. Opposition, it is very clear that they really have no clarity as to the contents of this particular legislation. They have no clarity in this regard because they themselves have no clarity as to how they are going to deal with the Bantu in the White areas. The Opposition proceeds from the premise that the Government is not at all sympathetically disposed to the Bantu in White areas. Last week we also had these arguments from the other side. The National Party&#x2019;s premise in dealing with Bantu affairs has always been based on Christian guardianship. We have said so all these years.</p>

<p>I think the hon. member should be very glad that my name is not Bernadette and that my surname is not Devlin, for if he passes such a remark and suggests by it that in the year 1972 he still does not know that <span class="col_539-540" refersTo="page_0285"/>the basis of the National Party&#x2019;s policy in respect of the Bantu community is that of Christian guardianship, then I do not know how old that hon. member will have to be before he understands it. I want to make this matter very clear. All the years the National Party has made it very clear in its standpoint on the Bantu in White areas that it is aware that there is a diversity of people and that these people came to the White areas because they wanted to sell their labour to the Whites, that the Whites will take the necessary precautionary measures for them so that, as long as the Bantu are a labour factor in the White areas, provision will be made for them to make a decent living. We have always adopted that standpoint. It is therefore not a foreign standpoint. No new principle is being introduced by this legislation introduced by the National Party or the announcements made by the hon. the Deputy Minister last week. Nor is there any change of policy. Hon. members fail to see that every measure in the National Party&#x2019;s programme of Bantu legislation forms part of an integrated whole of legislation on the handling of Bantu affairs. Therefore it is unfair for that side of the House to say that in its treatment of the Bantu in the White areas in its legislation, the National Party is inhuman and unchristianlike. I want to remind hon. members of the fact that if it had not been for the National Party and its legislation, the world would rightly have had the opportunity and the right to say that the Bantu in White areas were being discriminated against.</p>

<p>Gladly, Sir; it is just that one is tempted by the Opposition to digress. I just want to express a few thoughts on clause 4 (3), which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Contributions received by a Bantu affairs commissioner shall be transferred to the Secretary and may be utilised by the Secretary for any service, expenditure or grant in respect of which the Minister certifies in writing that it is in the interests of Bantu.</block>

<p>Sir, you will notice that we have chosen our words very carefully in this particular clause. To be specific, we say that these moneys will be utilised for any service, expenditure or grant in respect of which the Minister certifies in writing that it is in the interests of Bantu. The United Party thinks that a certain number of Bantu are living in the White areas, as though they have been completely cut off, so to speak, from those Bantu living in the homelands. But, also in this particular clause, we are very clear about the fact that moneys collected in this way will be made available to the Bantu within their national context. That national context of the Bantu is not confined to the so-called &#x201C;urban complexes&#x201D;. The ties between the Bantu in the White areas and those in the homelands are given permanence and developed. I just want to mention an example here.</p>

<p>It is a misconception on the part of the hon.

As far as the Bantu are concerned, the position is precisely the same. The fact that we want to allocate these moneys to the Bantu within their national context and that some of those Bantu are living in White areas whilst others are living in the homelands, does not give one the right to say that these people have to be separated on those grounds. We want to utilize these moneys in the full national context.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like an explanation regarding this clause. I notice that in regard to the Republic the practice of veterinarians is governed by the Veterinary Act of 1933. In regard to South-West Africa no mention is made of any specific ordinance.

<p>The hon. member&#x2019;s question is something of a surprise. I do not believe, however, that there is a similar ordinance in the Territory, because clause 9, which amends section 1 of the Animals Protection Act of 1962, reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; in the application of this Act in the Republic, means any person registered <span class="col_543-544" refersTo="page_0287"/>as a veterinarian under the Veterinary Act, 1933 (Act No. 16 of 1933), and in the application of this Act in the Territory of South-West Africa, means any person practising as a veterinarian.</block>

<block name="quote">In line 20, after &#x201C;Republic&#x201D; to add &#x201C;but shall be deemed to have been in force in the Republic up to the date of commencement of this Act&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The effect of this amendment is to ensure that there is no doubt whatever that the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act of 1890 has applied in the Republic since we became a Republic. The clause, as it stands, says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890 (53 and 54 Victoria, C.27), of the United Kingdom, is hereby repealed in so far as it applied in relation to the Republic.</block>

<p>My amendment seeks to add: &#x201C;but shall be deemed to have been in force in the Republic up to the date of the commencement of this Act&#x201D;. As I indicated yesterday, there is considerable doubt and it is strongly argued, I believe correctly, that when we became a Republic on 31st May, 1961, this Act ceased to have effect in the Republic because it is expressly stated to have effect in British possessions. Whatever wide connotation or interpretation one might give to that expression &#x201C;British possession&#x201D;, most certainly one could not say that since 31st of May, 1961, the Republic of South Africa could be described as such at all. In order to remove any doubt that their might be, and because it cannot in any way do any harm, I move the amendment which stands in my name which I am sure the hon. the Minister would be prepared to accept.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have very carefully considered this amendment proposed by the hon. member. As the hon. member rightly says, it can do no harm, but one does not write unnecessary things into legislation either. I feel that this would be the case if this amendment were accepted. I just want to mention to the hon. member that we have discussed this matter with the law advisers, and that they have no doubt about it whatsoever.</p>

<p>In the second place, the hon. member knows, of course, that section 107 of the Constitution Act provides that, subject to the provisions of that Act, all laws which were in force in any part of the Union of South Africa immediately prior to the commencement of that Act, that is the Constitution Act, shall continue in force until repealed <span class="col_545-546" refersTo="page_0288"/>or amended by the competent authority. Natal was also part of the Union, as was the Cape Province.</p>

<p>To take the matter further, in 1963 this Parliament confirmed, by implication, the fact that this British Act was still in force here. Section 54 of the Merchant Shipping Amendment Act of 1963 contains an amendment in which Admiralty jurisdiction is mentioned. In 1968 we passed the Prize Jurisdiction Act. That Act repeals the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, the same Act we are dealing with now, in so far as it related to matters concerning prizes. In this way Parliament accepted once again, in 1968, that the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act applied in the Republic. Since we have all this evidence, I really feel that although the proposed amendment can do no harm, it is unnecessary and, after all, one does not write unnecessary provisions into one&#x2019;s legislation. Consequently I am unfortunately unable to accept it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I appreciate that in 1968 the Prize Jurisdiction Act repealed those parts of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, the very one that is being repealed here, that affected prize jurisdiction. However, that was on the assumption that in fact the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act of 1890 applied in the Republic. It could not possibly be said that we were a British possession after the 31st May. I want to say that it is not a case of legal advisers that I am talking about; I have talked to people who practise in these courts and who have experience of these courts; this is their view. <i>Prima facie,</i> the hon. the Minister has not answered that particular argument. It is a very simple argument. If the British Act says that it will apply only in British possessions, then by a stretch of the imagination one could perhaps have said that in view of the way in which that expression is used, it might have applied to the Union of South Africa up to the 31st May. However, by no stretch of the imagination can it be said that the Republic of South Africa after the 31st May, could be described as a British possession. Therefore that Act does not apply and has not applied in the Republic of South Africa since we became a Republic.</p>

<p>It seems to me that it is necessary that this amendment should be accepted. I think that the hon. the Minister would at least go so far as to admit that it is arguable as to whether or not it has applied since 1961. If it is arguable, it would be wise to accept this amendment which would ensure that there can be no difficulty in respect of any judgment which has been given which, in the nature of things, is a different sort of judgment from the judgment given by a Supreme Court acting under the jurisdiction conferred on it by our Supreme Court Act. If the hon. the Minister feels that this question is at least arguable, concerning this one point, I do urge him to accept the amendment I have moved.</p>

<speech by="#coetsee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. member accepts that the legislation which brought Courts of Admiralty to South Africa was still in force before we became a Republic, he must tell us how he interprets section 107 of the South Africa Act. I do not think there can be any doubt that, in the first place, Admiralty law and, in the second place, Court of Admiralty procedure, were applied in our courts of appeal even before we became a Republic. I should like to mention one case to him. There is, for example, the case of <i>S.A.R. &#x0026; H.</i> V. <i>Lyle Shipping Company Limited,</i> 1958 (3) page 416. Admiralty law was obviously applied in this judgment. I can go further back to other judgments, for example, in S.A. Law Reports (1950) (1), page 880: <i>Ex parte Government of the United States of America in re S.S. Union Carrier.</i> In this case there was the same situation, namely recognition and acceptance of Admiralty law as such, and application of the Court of Admiralty procedure. So the question which has to be answered in order to satisfy the hon. member for Durban North is whether the situation which existed before the commencement of the South Africa Act was perpetuated after we became a Republic. Subsequently we must look at the wording of section 107 of the Constitution Act. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Subject to the provisions of this Act all laws which were in force in any part of the Union of South Africa, or in any territory in respect of which Parliament is competent to legislate, immediately prior to the commencement of this Act&#x2026;</block>

<p>Remember that the Constitution Act came into operation three years after the decision of 1958&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; shall continue in force until repealed or amended by the competent authority.</block>

<p><span class="col_547-548" refersTo="page_0289"/>That is what we are now working on. Consequently I should like to support the hon. the Minister in his statement that unnecessary wording would be written in to this clause if that hon. member&#x2019;s amendment were accepted.</p>

<p>I do not want to take up the time of the House with regard to this matter. The hon. the Minister has indicated that he does not want to accept this amendment, while the hon. member who has just sat down has pointed out that section 107 of the Constitution Act says that those laws which were in force at the time we became a Republic, would continue to be in force. Of course, the lawgiver in that instance would have been this Parliament. In fact, it was this Parliament which did this. However, it only has effect because the lawgiver in Great Britain in fact made it applicable. So that, once we became a Republic, the effect of that Act ceased in actual fact. We could adopt it. If we wanted it, the laws which were there, would continue, but when expressly applied &#x2026; I may say that this is a matter about which one can disagree and, in fact, about which lawyers are disagreeing at present. It is for that reason that it seemed wise to us to amend it. However, I am not going to press it. It is on the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s head if anything goes wrong.

Consequently we cannot allow just any young man to do the work, and fairly senior officials must do it. However, considerable progress has been made. All ante-nuptial contracts have been included in the computer system and much progress has been made in respect of interdicts and caveats. Progress is slow, however, because great care has to be exercised and the work has to be checked repeatedly.</p>

<p>The Committee will note that in this clause there is some residual power being left with the Minister of Agriculture in regard to certificates of consolidated titles in certain circumstances. Here again, the hon. the Minister will know that it will result in a duplication between his department and the Department of Agriculture. I wonder whether the time is not ripe to have here, instead of the Minister of Agriculture, the Minister of Justice, who otherwise deals with the Deeds Registry. Could the Minister tell us whether <span class="col_549-550" refersTo="page_0290"/>there has been any move or attempt to bring the control of registries under one Ministry instead of under two as it is at the present time.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member referred to this aspect yesterday as well. At the moment, of course, the position is that the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure is the body which deals with all State-owned land. Furthermore, there is the question of consolidation. Up to now there have been no negotiations between the two departments or between the two Ministries. We can give this matter some thought; up to this stage, however, there has been no talk of it.</p>

<p>Clause 6:</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To add the following proviso at the end of the proposed section 127A:</block>

<block name="quote">Provided that the Trustee or the Master may prior to the expiry of the said period apply to the Supreme Court on notice to the insolvent if he is of the opinion that the insolvent ought not to be rehabilitated or ought to be rehabilitated subject to conditions and the Court may make such order as it may deem fit.</block>

<p>I hope that the hon. the Minister has had the opportunity to have a look at this amendment. To some extent the purpose of this amendment was mentioned in this House during the Second Reading debate by both the hon. member for Durban North and myself. We indicated that where an insolvent estate is straightforward and there have been no contraventions of the Insolvency Act or any other contraventions, we saw no difficulty; we agree with the hon. the Minister that there should be a limit to the insolvency and we think a 10-year period is adequate. But in this modern day we do foresee circumstances where one would have to do with a complicated estate and also an estate where there may have been serious contraventions; where an automatic rehabilitation at the end of the 10-year period would not be justified. Sir, we do not know the details of the Sidarel collapse at this stage and therefore one does not want to go into any details, but I would point out to the hon. the Minister that the judicial manager of these companies has pointed out that the transactions are so involved that it may well take as much as three, or maybe even four, years to unravel this whole thing. If one had to do with a situation of that sort, it could well be that a 10-year period is not long enough.</p>

<p>During the debate yesterday, Sir, we suggested to the hon. the Minister that the exception should provide that where there are contraventions the insolvent should apply to court for this rehabilitation. On reconsideration of the matter, we think that the amendment I have moved would be a better way of dealing with it. There are obviously many contraventions of the Insolvency Act that are merely technical and would not warrant the insolvent having to make specific application to court for this rehabilitation in circumstances where the legislature is going to provide for an automatic rehabilitation after a certain period. We think, therefore, that the amendment ought to meet the difficulties which the hon. the Minister pointed out in dealing with our request yesterday. This would provide for an automatic rehabilitation, as is envisaged in the amendment, but will give the power either to the trustee or to the Master to make application to court if in the opinion of one or other of them there are circumstances which would warrant the extension of the insolvency beyond the 10-year period or would warrant a conditional rehabilitation. We have provided that if one or other of these people&#x2014;the trustee or the Master&#x2014;feels this way, he must make application to court, on notice to the insolvent, before expiry of the 10-year period. Mr. Chairman, I do hope that the hon. the Minister will accept this amendment because whilst we agree that in the 75 per cent of cases to which the hon. the Minister referred&#x2014;and it may even be 85 per cent of the cases&#x2014;an automatic rehabilitation after a 10-year period is perfectly satisfactory, there are, however, the small minority of cases, the few <span class="col_551-552" refersTo="page_0291"/>people, who seem to take advantage of their creditors and who involve themselves in what are very often very serious malpractices. We do think that there should be some provision whereby either the trustee or the Master should be able to say: &#x201C;In this particular case we do not think that the insolvent should be rehabilitated automatically at the end of a 10-year period or, if he is rehabilitated, certain conditions should be imposed.&#x201D; I therefore move this amendment, Sir, and I urge the hon. the Minister to accept it.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, during the Second Reading debate yesterday I indicated that I was not entirely happy about certain points. I said I would consider the position and invited the Opposition to make proposals in this regard. The hon. member was good enough to send me his proposed amendment this morning. We have examined it, and I want to congratulate him, because he has in fact given us an idea, but his proposal is not quite in order yet. His amendment is limited in the sense that reference is made only to the trustee or the Master. As I indicated yesterday, it often happens that the trustee cannot be traced and then he cannot act in this regard. This is one difficulty.</p>

<p>There is another difficulty which may arise if the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment is accepted as it stands. Hon. members should remember that when this Bill is published and proclaimed, there may be a considerable number of insolvents whose 10-year period would already have expired and who would then slip through. There may be the biggest rogues among them, and it would not be possible to do anything. These are the two major deficiencies inherent in the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment. However, I concede that his idea is highly acceptable, and therefore I want to put it to him in this way: I shall accept the amendment and it may appear in his name, but then it must be phrased slightly differently. I propose that the new section should read as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">Any insolvent not rehabilitated by the court within a period of ten years from the date of sequestration of his estate, shall be deemed to be rehabilitated after the expiry of that period, unless &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is substituted for the hon. member&#x2019;s proviso&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; unless a court upon application by an interested person &#x2026;</block>

<p>The trustee is an &#x201C;interested person&#x201D;, as is the Master, and the hon. member himself may be an &#x201C;interested person&#x201D;. If the other two disappear one day, the hon. member will still be there. I think this would cover the position. The addition to the section, as it reads in the Bill at present, would then be as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; unless a court upon application by an interested person after notice to the insolvent orders otherwise prior to the expiration of the said period of ten years or before the 31st December, 1972, whichever date is the latest.</block>

<p>In other words, we are giving persons the opportunity until 31st December to go to the court in the case of those persons who would then practically have qualified, and to say: &#x201C;Look, for this or that reason I feel that that fellow should not be rehabilitated.&#x201D; If the hon. member will accept this change, I am prepared to accept his amendment. The amendment can then still stand in his name.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it has been brought to light that certain provisions in the Prisons Act reveal shortcomings and inconsistencies, and it has therefore become necessary to amend those provisions suitably.</p>

<p>For instance, a great deal of obscurity has arisen in regard to the expression &#x201C;special warder&#x201D;, as used throughout the Act. What is actually meant by this expression, is a person who has been appointed in a temporary capacity, but owing to the existing terminology this is often considered to be an appointment for a special or extraordinary task, which, however, is not the case. The proposed amendment in clause 1 therefore seeks to remove this obscurity.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it has become a more and more frequent occurrence for the department to re-employ in a temporary capacity commissioned officers who have retired on pension. The reason for this is chiefly to be found in the fact that such ex-officers usually have a mature experience and knowledge of the functions of the department, the result being that their reappointment holds considerable advantages for the department. As the position is at present, however, such ex-officers are, in terms of section 9 (2) of the Act, charged with the same powers and functions, have to perform the same duties and are subject to the same discipline and authority as are warders appointed on a permanent basis. The result is, therefore, that after their reappointment they cannot be used as commissioned officers in any capacity. Accordingly it is the conviction that valuable knowledge and experience are wasted in this manner. The proposed amendment in clause 2 therefore seeks to make it possible for such an ex-officer who has been reappointed temporarily after retiring on pension, to be granted the same powers he had before retiring on pension. I may just add that they are reappointed at the same salary as that of an ordinary temporary warder, not at the salary of a commissioned officer.</p>

<p>It has also been brought to light that section 9 of the Act contains an inconsistency. Subsection (1) authorizes the appointment of special warders&#x2014;i.e. for the safe custody or transport of prisoners or for any other purpose&#x2014;and therefore also covers those cases where a hirer or an employee of a hirer of convict labour is appointed as a guard for the purpose of keeping watch over those prisoners. Under subsection (2) all special warders are vested with the same powers and duties and are subject to the same discipline and authority as a warder appointed on a permanent basis. Now we come to the inconsistency, i.e. the fact that subsection (9)<i>bis</i> provides that the salaries of all special warders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Public Service Act. Therefore, in a case where a private person hires convict labour, he is appointed under subsection (1), enters into a written contract, takes the oath of allegiance and subsection (2) defines his powers and duties, but subsection (9)<i>bis</i> does not apply to him as he is not remunerated by the State. The proposed amendment in clause S therefore seeks to remove this inconsistency.</p>

<p>In terms of section 53 of the Act a commissioned officer has the jurisdiction to try any member or any special warder in the event of infringements of discipline having; been committed. However, if such a member or special warder has committed an offence and his services are terminated before the case has been settled, such a court consisting of commissioned officers does not have the jurisdiction to try such ex-members or ex-special warders. Since this is prejudicial to the administration of justice and to authority, the proposed amendment in clause 4 seeks to remove this deficiency.</p>

<p>Finally, section 88 (1) of the Act provides that, with the exception of customs and excise duties, approved canteens of the department and the articles on sale in them shall be exempt from licence moneys, taxes, duties or fees. However, it does not indicate specifically that such articles shall also be subject to sales duties, and consequently the Department of Customs and Excise has requested that the necessary adjustment be effected in the Act. The proposed amendment in clause 5 therefore seeks to put it beyond all doubt that such articles shall not be exempt from the payment of sales duty.</p>

<summary>(Second Reading resumed)</summary>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. D. K. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the debate was adjourned yesterday evening, I had made <i>inter alia</i> the following remarks and had suggested that the hon. the Opposition was being very unfair to the hon. the Deputy Minister in the debate they were conducting; that the contributions which would be collected in terms of this Bill need not give rise to any problem in the sense that the Opposition would be afraid of what would become of the money. The revenue and expenditure would in fact be duly audited. Another standpoint I mentioned was that the National Party had, on the basis of its Christian guardianship, always seen to it that justice was done to the Bantu in White areas and consequently that all legislation of the National Party for dealing with the contact situation between the Bantu and the Whites, should not be seen in isolation but as part of a whole.</p>

<p>I should just like to make a few concluding observations. This morning I had the opportunity of very thoroughly reading the speech made by the hon. member for Transkei yesterday. I had listened to him very carefully, but now I have also had the opportunity of reading his speech. I also read the speeches made by his colleagues. I want to make the comment that their speeches remind me of an observation once made by Bennet Cerf to the effect that &#x201C;politicians are like ships, noisiest when lost in a fog&#x201D;. That was the feeling I got when I listened to the speeches made by the hon. members on the opposite side. I really could not find one single reason or argument why they were opposed to this legislation in principle. The few observations I want to make in this regard are that their comments on the contributions that will be collected here are proof of the fact that if they should ever come into power one day, they would be the very people who would have jobs for pals, that they would use the moneys they would collect to benefit certain employers. It is therefore very clear that in their arguments, the hon. members on the opposite side are only a mouthpiece of those big Progressive Party business personalities in the large urban complexes. This legislation places a very great responsibility on the officials who have to deal with the aspects of the employer and the Bantu every day. I therefore find it such a pity that the hon. member for Florida, and others, have by their arguments made the atmosphere in which these officials have to work, more difficult, and that they have made such comments while the officials are having great difficulty in dealing with the relationship between the employer and the Bantu. I have the hon. member for Jeppes in mind. He made the following statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; which has been brought about because of the non-co-operation of the Government with the local authorities in dealing with the urban Bantu.</block>

<p>And then, as if the National Party cannot do anything, he went on to say that they would very much like to collect funds and that those funds would have to be used for clinics, cr&#x00E8;ches, sportsfields, technical training, schools, cultural aid for young people etc. When the hon. the Deputy Minister tries to introduce effective measure, they oppose it on the one hand, and on the other hand they say they are going to do all these things. They say all these things with the implication that in this legislation the National Party does not want to cooperate with the local authorities while the opposite is true. The opposite is that there were certain local authorities that wanted to exploit the urban Bantu or the Bantu within the White areas as a result of their approach to the Bantu, and that they now want to lay this at the door of the National Party. Then the hon. member for Transkei made an observation on so-called vocational training. The hon. member asked the hon. the Deputy Minister why he spoke of vocational training in this speech. He then asked the hon. the Deputy Minister <span class="col_557-558" refersTo="page_0294"/>whether there had been another change of policy in respect of these matters. Those hon. members know very well that the National Party adopts the standpoint that the Bantu are to be trained within their national context and that that training can best be dealt with in the homelands. This is true for many reasons. There are, for example, the reasons of language usage. If the Vendas, the Tswanas and the Shangaans have been lumped together for vocational training, surely it is very difficult to have to work with a number of young Tswanas. One goes to the homeland concerned, to the homeland where the Tswanas are to be trained, the homeland where there is a particular cultural atmosphere, with a language of its own, and then one starts with one&#x2019;s training. The hon. members of the Opposition want the National Party to walk into a trap here, and they want us, in coming forward with the better administration of affairs, to yield to principles we laid down a long time ago. This vocational training of young Bantu persons is indeed to the advantage of the big firms that provide employment. Therefore it is in their own interest that the training should take place in this way.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that the observations made by hon. members of the Opposition are proof to me that they are an interim party with an interim policy which cannot be of any benefit to either the Bantu or the Whites.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, having listened to the honied tones of the hon. the Deputy Minister and his supporters in introducing this legislation and proclaiming a millenium for both the employer of Bantu labour and the Bantu employee, one can very easily be misled into believing that this is a new &#x201C;verligte&#x201D; approach whereas in fact it is just another brick in the legislative castle that is being built around the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development.</p>

<p>First of all, I should like to deal with the hon. member for Rissik. I am quite sure that he misquoted Bennet Cerf when he said that the quotation read: &#x201C;Politicians are like ships, noiseless when lost in the fog.&#x201D; May I say that we heard his foghorn blowing pretty hard while he was lost both last night and this afternoon.</p>

If we speak about guardianship, they tell us we are paternalistic. I believe that he is totally lost in his political thinking and his political philosophy. He is blowing his foghorn very hard.

<p>Yesterday afternoon I received a few telegrams in quick succession. The hon. the Deputy Minister may have received a telegram himself.

<p>Yes. The second telegram reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The M.C.I. reiterates its strong objection to certain aspects of the contributions in respect of Bantu Labour Bill. Refer our Memorandum LEG/5/9 dated 12th January. Please bear foregoing in mind during Second Reading of the Bill. Director, Midlands Chamber of Industries.</block>

<p>I have the memorandum here. Perhaps it has been submitted to the hon. the Deputy Minister. I shall just read the final paragraph&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This Chamber also maintains that its support of the Administration Act was gained under false premises. It was understood that the Board areas would be reasonably small and there was no indication that funds accumulated in the now proposed large areas would be utilized in other Board areas or, for that matter, in the homelands. In order to demonstrate that the Act was not introduced with any intention to mislead, it is suggested that the provisions to which exception is now taken in the draft legislation are redrafted in acceptable terms. Had the two Bills been presented simultaneously, the support of this Chamber for the Administration Act would most certainly have not been as readily obtained as it unfortunately was.</block>

<p>Let me continue. I have a further memorandum from the Midlands Chamber of Industries, namely the submission they presented to the Federated Chamber of Industries. There is quite a lot going on in organized industry today. Yet the hon. member for Langlaagte yesterday had the temerity to tell us that this activity was not going on. I wish he were here now to answer for himself.</p>

<p>I believe that this is another inflationary measure. When one regards this legislation, one has to take things to absurdities. One has to have regard to the maximum that may be imposed. As I have shown from the information supplied in the memorandum of the Midlands Chamber of Industries, and as we on this side of the House all feel, one must accept the fact that the Bantu Administration Boards will now practically cover the whole country. This levy or contribution&#x2014;we call it a tax&#x2014;is going to be imposed by these Boards on various people, employers and employees, at various rates. Let me take the ceiling, i.e. the maximum that they may be taxed, and do a little sum: Making use of the statistics of the economically active Bantu in this country in 1960 and taking into account that the maximum is R2,50 for the employer and R1 for the employee, which either he or the employer is going to have to pay, this measure can take between R180 million and R190 million out of the taxpayers&#x2019; pockets in this country. These are the powers we are giving. I believe it to be absolutely correct that one can take these sums out of general revenue. Let me do another small sum for the hon. the Minister. Pertaining to a small area of this country, I can give him the figures, which I think he has seen before on another occasion, of the estimated total disposable income in a part of my constituency, the district of Albany. The estimated disposable income&#x2014;in other words, the buying power&#x2014;of <span class="col_561-562" refersTo="page_0296"/>the Bantu in that district was R3 800 000 in 1970. That is the buying power of all these Bantu. They all pay sales duty. If we calculate the sales duty at a low percentage of that buying power, say 5 per cent, it works out at R160 000 in the district of Albany alone. Why cannot that amount in sales duty be channelled back to the Department of Bantu Administration so that it can be spent on those people&#x003F; Why must a further tax be levied if we are already levying a tax&#x003F; Why does the hon. the Deputy Minister not ask the hon. the Minister of Finance for a dash of that money for his Department, instead of imposing a further levy on the people of South Africa&#x003F; It is a levy which, as I say, can be far higher than what the hon. the Minister intends taking at the moment.</p>

<p>I am asking the hon. the Deputy Minister to scrap the lot. Under the Bantu Administration Board system the farmers will be included. Farmers will also be included in this levy. Let us look at the definition of a Bantu employee in clause 1: A &#x201C;Bantu employee&#x201D; means &#x201C;a Bantu employed by or working for an employer and who receives or is entitled to receive any remuneration, and any other Bantu who in any manner assists in the carrying on of conducting of the business of an employer, but shall not include a Bantu referred to in section 2 (1) (b) &#x2026;&#x201D; As we know, section 2 (1) (b) excludes very few Bantu working in the agricultural sector. Those are the ones who are painters, plasterers, and so on. But what is going to happen to the highly labour-intensive sectors of agriculture&#x003F; I am now thinking of the sugar industry which uses a large amount of labour seasonally and the pineapple industry which is also seasonally labour-intensive, as well as the chicory industry. Everyone knows the position of agriculture and that of Bantu labour on farms today. The farmers are battling to keep them alive because of the prolonged droughts and other conditions. What is the ratio going to be there&#x003F; Are only permanent employees going to be taken into consideration, or will the loose labour employed in large numbers in seasonal periods be included&#x003F; I would like the hon. the Deputy Minister please to answer this question when he replies to this debate.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. C. VAN WYK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Albany discussed details, the reason for his absorption in details, is that he has a weak case. It is not necessary to go into details now, because one can discuss them profitably in the Committee Stage. In this Second Reading debate the point at issue is, in the first place, the principle contained in this measure. This measure is a very simple and a very ordinary one. It is not complicated, it is easy to understand, and after the Second Reading speech of the hon. the Deputy Minister and those of other hon. members on this side of the House, very little remains for me to say. Apart from what the hon. member for Albany said, this is a measure which is accepted by all bodies. It has been accepted by trade, industry, local authorities and everyone concerned in this matter, through their representative bodies. It is accepted because it is a purely consolidating measure. It is one which does not contain any new principles whatsoever. This measure is aimed solely at facilitating the administration of certain contributions and at bringing about, by means of differentiation, a larger degree of fairness towards those from whom it is collected. What is more, it sets out to improve Bantu services quantitatively and qualitatively, in other words, to look after the well-being of the Bantu labourer at all times and to assist him so as to be able to maintain a better and higher standard of living. That is why it goes without saying that it is in the interests of the employer. This is the very principle embodied in the original Act, a principle which is not being abandoned in this measure, but which is being given permanence and perpetuated in this measure. Surely no-one on earth can have any objection to such a principle, least of all those Who are directly affected, i.e. the employers. Small wonder that those people accept it. The only people who object to it, are the hon. members on the opposite side. They can throw up as many smokescreens as they like, but one thing is very clear, i.e. that they oppose the measure purely and simply because it promotes the policy of separate development. Because they have no sound arguments to advance against this measure, <span class="col_563-564" refersTo="page_0297"/>they take recourse to the old well-known methods and look for something sinister in this measure as a whole. Henceforth the Minister would allegedly have the power to force people to lend a hand with homeland development. Sir, this is untrue. To my mind the hon. member for Langlaagte made that very clear. But even if this were to be true, I would still say, &#x201C;So what&#x003F;&#x201D; Hon. members made much of the fact that contributions collected in one place might not be used somewhere else. That argument has no substance whatsoever, because this does not concern the provision of services to a certain group of Bantu in certain areas; it concerns the upliftment of the Bantu in general. Let us just get the fact clear that the reason for the introduction of this measure is that the Government has its finger on the pulse of Bantu development. Those people who simply want to keep Bantu labourers in the White metropolitan areas and use them here without keeping abreast of their developing needs, are not having any regard to reality. By neglecting the homelands and drawing labourers to the White areas for the sake of more development in the metropolitan areas, they may possibly increase their profits phenomenally, but one thing is as certain and that is that social and political consequences will catch up with them soon. National interests require us to use all productive powers as efficiently as possible in this country. But, Sir, it requires still more. It requires that no social and political tensions whatsoever shall be created, but that peaceful co-existence of White and Black in this country will be promoted.</p>

<p>That is why, Sir, this Government is engaged in a national programme for the upliftment of the various Bantu peoples. We are reconciling White social and political self-preservation on the one hand with Black nationalism on the other hand. Let me tell hon. members on the opposite side this: We do not have ages in which to accomplish this. No one may have any illusions about one matter&#x2014;and I want to conclude with this&#x2014;and that is that this side of the House is determined to create a strong infrastructure in the homelands and to bring an economic life which will make it more and more profitable, pleasant and attractive for the Bantu to live and work there. We shall continue with this, despite the actions and the objections of the United Party, because we know and believe in our hearts that this is what must be done.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I do not intend to reply to the broad and general observations on Nationalist Party policy which the hon. member for Winburg has just been making, except to say that, of course, there are other people who also have the welfare and the future well-being of South Africa and its race relations at heart and that they offer very different solutions to the problems from those offered by the hon. member and his party. But I want to say, as far as this Bill is concerned, that I was very sorry indeed that I was not here to hear the hon. the Deputy Minister make what I am sure was one of his characteristically enthusiastic speeches about a Bill introduced by him, but I do want to assure him that I have taken the trouble to get a copy of the speech and that I have read his peerless words with great attention, so that when I reply today my reply will not be based simply on Press cuttings on his speech yesterday. I have also tried to read up one or two speeches made on the Opposition side and I have managed at least to read the speech of the hon. member for Transkei and of the hon. member for South Coast. I have also studied the Press report which was put out by the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Bantu Administration and I think I have probably learned more about the Bill from that statement than I have from any of the speeches that I have read. I want to say at once that I think possibly the original reaction to the Bill might have been a little exaggerated, but perhaps the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own statements, coupled with the ambiguity of the Bill, is responsible for that. But there are several bad features which, in my view at any rate, justify very considerable criticism of this measure. I want to say at once that there is no doubt that the powers which are being given to the hon. the Minister and the vague way in which he can set aside areas, or parts of areas, in which the additional levy shall apply and the different contributions that can be levied by the hon. the Minister on different classes of employers of African labour, all give rise, without any doubt whatsoever, to considerable uncertainty in the minds of the people who, after all, whether the Government likes it or not, supply at least 95 per cent of the revenue which goes into the coffers of the State, and that is the major employers of African labour in <span class="col_565-566" refersTo="page_0298"/>this country. The uncertainty that is engendered in not knowing exactly what sort of expenses they are going to have to meet when they employ African labour is, I think, going to be a factor in the future determination of the question as to whether or not to expand existing industries in metropolitan areas. Although the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Bantu Administration specifically asks that this Bill should be considered quite apart from the Physical Planning Act, to the extent that the Physical Planning Act also engenders uncertainty in the minds of entrepreneurs, I think that there is a parallel between these two measures, and I think it is something which is certainly open to a considerable amount of criticism. One does not know when the maximum of R2,50 will be reached. I admit that there are administrative advantages to be gained from consolidating the three different types of contributions or levies, or whatever you want to call them, but one does not know at which stage it will be decided to increase the contributions to the maximum of R2,50. I might say that one does not know, although the hon. the Deputy Minister will have to come back to Parliament for this at least, how long the maximum is going to be retained at R2,50, although he did say in his speech that hopefully that would be the figure for five to 10 years. But all these factors engender considerable uncertainty in the mind of a man sitting down to work out whether or not it is worth his while to expand his present enterprise. I do not think that the Government ever takes factors of this kind into consideration. It is so blinded, so blinkered, by its intention to sort out the racial policy on its particular ideological lines that it very often completely ignores economic and practical difficulties which are engendered by its own policy. I do not think the Deputy Minister can escape the accusation which was made in the <i>Financial Mail,</i> to which he said too much attention had been paid, that this Bill does not introduce so much as extend the system of selective employment tax. Admittedly there always has been some form of selective employment tax in South Africa. The fact that employers of Coloureds and Asians and of certain types of African labour like mine labour or farm labour are exempted from many of the taxes which urban employers in industry and commerce have to pay, is in itself indicative of some form of selective tax. Now, within industry itself, with in commerce itself and within the areas themselves in which these people operate, there is going to be further selective taxation. I think this is bad in principle. I think it is also true to say that because of this the suspicion that this measure may be used as a further incentive, or a further forcible measure, to try to persuade industry to set up in border industry areas rather than in industrial, metropolitan areas, is a justifiable suspicion. There is no doubt that all these costs are considered when an entrepreneur decides where he is going to site his factory. In this regard, too, one might say that this measure runs parallel with the Physical Planning Act, in that it tries to dissuade employers of African labour from setting up their industries in the existing industrial areas.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I shall tell the hon. the Deputy Minister why. He should not be so sensitive. It is an inevitable conclusion that people reach, because it is all within the framework of the Government&#x2019;s policy of trying to reduce the number of industrial black employees in the existing industrial areas. It all hangs together. I do not, however, say that this is a part of the Physical Planning Act. I say that it runs parallel with that Act. There are other things that run parallel to it as well. For instance, there is the ratio of labour, which was set out in the Riekert Report, as part of the Physical Planning <span class="col_567-568" refersTo="page_0299"/>Act&#x2019;s intentions. All these things are much the same. I am going to come to a third point in a moment which is more important still, and which really has determined my decision to vote against this measure at Second Reading, and that is the Government&#x2019;s housing policy in regard to the urban areas. That is another aspect of the same broad direction of policy, which is to try to discourage black people from settling in the urban areas, and to try to reverse the flow of black people from the rural areas, be they from White farms or from the homelands, into the industrial areas. All this is part and parcel of the same policy because now additional moneys are going to be channelled away from the existing urban areas and into other areas, presumably like the homelands. There are two aspects to this; the first is where the money is to go to another local authority. I presume that that is mainly in respect of the Western Province. I think the Deputy Secretary made that point; he said that certain authorities in the Western Cape particularly were experiencing difficulty in financing certain projects because of the withdrawal of Africans from the area. I leave that to one side. But there is the other aspect, namely the aspect connected with Clause 9. In this connection the Deputy Minister has put all doubts to one side. Money which was originally intended to be used in the areas where the money was raised for the benefit of the people living in those areas, and for the provision of services for those areas, can now, without any legal doubt whatever, be used in the homelands.</p>

<p>On the Levy Account, yes. Why should there be this surplus&#x003F; Can the hon. the Deputy Minister show me one single local authority area where there has been sufficient provision of housing, transport, recreational facilities, electricity, water-borne sewerage and all those things which go to make up a decently conducted urban township&#x003F; There is not one, from Soweto, which is the largest, to the smallest local authority in one of the platteland towns. All of them are desperately in need of all these facilities. They could build schools, they could build houses and they could lay out parks and football fields and stadiums, all these amenities which we are now supposed to be providing for the Africans, and which the hon. the Minister says they need. Why is there any surplus whatsoever&#x003F; I could never understand it.</p>

<p>There was a time when there was a R5 million surplus in Johannesburg. I could not understand why. They could have spent that straight away. There was no difficulty in deciding on projects on which to spend this money. There is a desperate need for all sorts of improvements, but now we find that local authorities, under the sort of hypnotic influence of the hon. the Deputy Minister, are starting to shove money away and put it under the mattress or somewhere, they are trying to accumulate enormous surpluses which they can hand over to him with a grateful smile. I think the whole thing is nonsense from beginning to end. This money should be used, according to the spirit and the intention of the original Bill which was passed in 1952, the Bantu Services Levy Bill. The original spirit and intention, and indeed the actual wording of that Bill, was that the money should be spent for the benefit of the people in the area where they lived and worked.</p>

<p>I shall come back to the Bill, although I do not really think I ever left it. I want to tell the hon. the Deputy Minister too that I cannot see how this measure cannot be inflationary. It must be inflationary. It is going to add to the cost of production of industrialists and of commercial firms throughout the country and I cannot see why this will not be passed on to the unhappy consumer who at the present stage is still reeling under the impact of the recent devaluation, the increase in the cost of foodstuffs, in the cost of clothing, in the cost of practically everything that people eat or wear or use. These additional amounts, whatever they <span class="col_571-572" refersTo="page_0301"/>are going to be, are going to be passed on. It may not be very much&#x2014;I do not know if the hon. the Deputy Minister intends going up to the full amount of R2,50, I think in certain areas he may very well do that&#x2014;but it is inflationary. However much it is, it is inflationary.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister two questions on two matters which he can possibly clarify in his reply. The Deputy Secretary for Bantu Administration reckoned, when mentioning these self-employed casual people, that there are only about a thousand of them&#x2014;a thousand independent contractors or casual labourers who would be called upon to make these contributions as casual workers. I find the definition in this regard somewhat confusing and I want the hon. the Deputy Minister to make it absolutely clear whether the self-employed people are the only people who are going to be subject to this levy, or whether casual labourers, as all of us understand them&#x2014;charwomen, washerwomen, the itinerant gardeners&#x2014;are also going to come in under umbrella of this levy.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister will reply to that&#x2014;good.</p>

<p>Another thing I should like him to tell me is whether I am right in thinking that after this Bill and its little sister, the Bantu Transport Services Amendment Bill, which we are going to consider shortly, have been passed, all employers of female Africans will fall into line with employers of male Africans. In other words, if you look at the definition, this Bill does not do away, as the hon. the Deputy Minister tells us, with the existing Bantu Services Levy Act, but supplants it as far as I can see. The other one is going to run concurrently until he starts introducing the levies in the different categories, but when he has done that, this Bill will supplant the existing Services Levy Act. That Act only laid the obligation on the employers of male Africans; this one seems to encompass all employees. Am I right&#x003F;</p>

<p>But unfortunately that is not where most of these people come from. Even though it is so, who is going to commute 40 to 50 miles daily to get to and from work&#x003F; Yet these are the plans for which the hon. the Minister is really forming this levy. He wants to be able to place beyond any legal doubt his right to use surplus funds&#x2014;which I say should not exist anyway&#x2014;in order to provide the necessary services for the families of persons he is trying to shuttle out of the existing industrial metropolitan areas into homelands, some of which may be adjoining the existing areas but others which may be many, many miles away. The whole housing policy of the Government has swung round over the last 20 years since the Transport Levy Services Act was passed in 1952. Since then the whole policy of the Government, as far as housing, transport and the provision of services for urban Africans are concerned, has changed radically. For those reasons I shall vote against this Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Houghton has already expressed her regret that she was unable to be here yesterday when the debate on this Bill began. If she had been able to listen to everything that was said from this side of the House she would have realized that we are opposing the Second Reading of this Bill for very deep and cogent reasons.</p>

<p>There is just one thing I would like to say here, and that is that she did perhaps try to fight a little bit of the Johannesburg municipal election in her speech. I do not think that it will get her very far and I am quite sure that we can have a full debate and perhaps a good fight on the question of the surpluses standing to the credit of the Johannesburg municipality on some other occasion. However, in the meantime I want to get back to the Bill itself.</p>

<p>Arising from her speech where she mentioned the surpluses, I wonder whether the hon. the Deputy Minister could just clear up something in passing. During the debate yesterday afternoon the hon. member for Rissik made an interjection when the question of surpluses was being discussed. This interjection indicated that all present surpluses could not be used in terms of this Bill. I wonder if the hon. the Deputy Minister could tell us whether present surpluses could not be used in terms of this Bill.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>Thank you very much. There is just one other thing I would like to mention. I was surprised to hear the hon. member for Winburg say that he had heard of no objections to this Bill. Was he not listening when my colleague, the hon. member for Albany, was talking&#x003F; Did he not hear the contents of the telegrams which he read out or did he perhaps not understand them&#x003F; It seems extraordinary to me that a few moments&#x2014;perhaps not even five minutes&#x2014;after an hon. member on this side of the House had read some clearly stated objections to this Bill, an hon. member on that side of the House can say that so far there have been no objections. While we are talking about objections to this Bill, I want to join issue with the hon. the Deputy Minister again. He himself said that organized industry and by implication everybody concerned with the employment of Bantu workers, was in favour of this Bill. He has already learnt a small lesson from my colleague, the hon. member for Albany. But surely he must have seen the memorandum from the Natal Employers&#x2019; Association. It was addressed <span class="col_575-576" refersTo="page_0303"/>to his department. This memorandum said among other things&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Like all other taxation this should be clear, precise and ascertainable &#x2026;</block>

<p>I wonder whether I could have the attention of the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x003F; I will repeat it for him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Like all other taxation this should be clear, precise and ascertainable. Therefore no power should be granted to permit differentiation in the taxation by area, persons or any other category and the amount of taxation permissible should be fixed and the same for all.</block>

<p>This is a clear objection to this Bill as it stands.</p>

<p>While we are on the subject of taxation, I want to say that I was also surprised that the hon. the Deputy Minister, and the hon. member for Langlaagte, who I am sad to see is not in the Chamber this afternoon, grew very hot under the collar about whether this really amounts to taxation. The hon. member for Langlaagte, in fact, tried to make fun of speakers on this side of the House for suggesting that this is in fact taxation. Just in passing I want to tell both of them that the question whether this sort of levy is or is not taxation, is not a new one. It was raised in fact when the original Bantu Services Levy Bill came before this House as long ago as 1952 when Dr. Abraham Jonker, who should be well known to hon. members on that side of the House, actually protested that the original Bantu services levy was a form of direct taxation. The late Dr. Verwoerd did not challenge this at all. All he would say was: &#x201C;Do not let us quarrel about it&#x201D;. He was not denying it. I am indeed surprised to see that hon. members on that side of the House should get so hot under the collar. This vehemence, particularly of the hon. member for Langlaagte, is to me very interesting. We all know that he is intimately involved in the creation of these new Bantu Administration Boards. It is quite clear that this Bill is aimed at the funding of these boards. Both he and the hon. the Deputy Minister yesterday, and the hon. the Deputy Minister today, made much of the fact that this is nothing more or nothing less than a consolidating measure; it consolidates the three levies to which we have referred, into a single levy. The hon. member for Langlaagte, who seemed to be the spearhead of the reply from the Government side, also claimed that this in fact was not a tax at all.</p>

<p>Let us look at this completely objectively. Let us try to determine what exactly is being done and what this new levy actually is. I have given some thought to how one can best describe it. The clearest way in which I can describe it is that it is an impost on people who wish to employ a certain category of labour. What is more, it can be made variable in that it can be imposed more heavily on some classes of employers or employers who operate in some areas, or both.</p>

<heading>POSITION OF MINEWORKERS</heading>

<speech by="#rossouw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. J. C. ROSSOUW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House with appreciation takes cognizance of (a) the action that has been taken and is being taken by the Government to improve the position of the mineworker and (b) the responsible way in which the mineworker is continuing to serve South Africa with loyalty and devotion.</block>

<p>In looking at the motion I am moving in this House today, one finds that in regard to one aspect of the matter there can be no difference of opinion, namely that gold is one of the most important commodities of the whole world. Over the past few months we have once again witnessed this. As South Africa is one of the major producers of gold, it is obviously of great importance to our country. The people who are helping to produce this product, are as important. It is my pleasant duty to confirm that, as I shall show in a moment, the National Government has always been a friend to those persons and will always remain one in the future as well.</p>

<p>Since the National Government came into power in the year 1948, we have never had a general strike in the mining industry. In looking at what is going on in the world around us, we can under these circumstances do nothing but express our thanks. We attribute this success to the policy of <span class="col_577-578" refersTo="page_0304"/>the National Party towards its workers. The Government has always kept a watchful eye on the workers and the employers in this extensive and mighty industry. There have been differences, but I can tell hon. members that since 1948 those differences have always been resolved in a pleasant manner. As I have said, the fact that there has never been a general strike during this period, can be attributed to that policy. I cannot say this for the years that preceded 1948.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to refer briefly to what has been done in respect of one aspect, something which is of great importance to both the mineworkers and the employers, the mining group that is responsible for the production of gold. I am referring to the health of the mineworker. I am glad to be able to say this afternoon that I hope and trust that in the near future we shall hear that the Pneumoconiosis Act of 1962 will be reviewed by the Government. Let me just tell hon. members what has happened in regard to this matter since 1948. Hon. members will recall that we reviewed the old Pneumoconiosis Act of 1956 and that the Pneumoconiosis Act of 1962 emerged from that. Over and above this Act, the National Government granted certain benefits to the mineworkers back in 1950 and again in 1952, 1965, 1968, 1970 and 1971. In other words, the National Party has always been informed about the complaints of the men in the mining industry.</p>

<p>Let us pause and consider the improvements that have been effected. From 1948 up to now increases amounting to approximately 220 per cent have already been granted in terms of this Act. Hon. members on the other side of the House say that since 1948 the value of the rand has dropped to such an extent that it is worth only 40 cents at present. To this I want to add that in 1948 a widow received a pension of R13 per month, whereas today a widow receives a pension of R60 per month. At that time a pneumoconiosis sufferer and his family received a pension of R38,57 as against a pension of R137 per month paid out today. Over and above that several anomalies have arisen, as has also been the case in other walks of life. One of these was that different pensions were paid to different groups of widows. I want to thank the hon. the Minister and the Government for the fact that these anomalies have now been removed, and that widows now receive a uniform pension of R60 per month. This is a tremendous achievement, one for which we just want to express our thanks.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I wish to express my thanks for the free medical services made available by the State to persons suffering from pneumoconiosis. I have experience of the mining industry, and consequently I know the circumstances under which these people are working. When one has worked underground, and done so under very difficult circumstances, for twenty years of one&#x2019;s life, one knows the views of these people, their history and their activities. The Government has also seen to Republic Day being proclaimed a full-fledged holiday for the mineworker. The mineworker seizes at every day and every sunbeam he can possibly enjoy. This fact is so easily overlooked by the genera] public, those people who are privileged to enjoy the sun and the blue skies above every day. They forget that there are people who work underground and who do not enjoy that privilege. Consequently the mineworkers want to thank the Government for this concession. I also want to express my sincere thanks for the fine building that has been erected for the General Council for Pneumoconiosis Compensation. Those who knew the old buildings, will agree that the new one is a great improvement. It is good to know that mineworkers are examined scientifically in this building. When a person goes there, one need not have any hesitation in asking his family to wait in those spendid restrooms. Furthermore, the research institute is doing everything in its power to combat this dreaded disease, and we are grateful for the results that have already been achieved. A great deal of money is being spent on this matter, but the results are excellent. We may look forward to the future without any hesitation because we know that no stone is being left unturned in the fight against this dreaded disease.</p>

<p>These are the things the Government has done, but I cannot allow this opportunity to pass without thanking the employers, the mine-owners, in the mining industry as well. I want to thank them in particular for the very modern residential facilities which have been created there and which enable mineworkers and their families to lead happy lives. Although a very nominal amount is deducted from the salaries of mineworkers every month, some of the most inexpensive accommodation in the whole world is to my mind being made <span class="col_579-580" refersTo="page_0305"/>available to mineworkers and those involved in mining. Therefore I want to express my thanks to the mine-owners as well. But that is not all. In considering the first-rate sports facilities created there for these people, and the fine townships with all the amenities erected by the various mines, we can do no other than express our thanks for the fact that on the part of the employers everything is being done to make those people happy. In a few minutes&#x2019; time I shall tell you, Sir, why they are doing it and why they are helping those people to be happy.</p>

<p>Now I come to the second point of my motion. In this respect, too, I can do no other than express my thanks to the various persons employed in the mines for the loyalty they have shown the Government since 1948. Therefore they will always vote for the National Party&#x2014;it cannot be otherwise, After all, one does not bite the hand that feeds one, and one always protects the hand that is good to one. I am in a position to say this, because I have experience of this matter, because I know how matters stood in former years. Through our various trade unions we have access to the Government and the State today. It is possible for us to negotiate amicably with our employer, and we know, as has once again become apparent in recent times, that many results have been achieved. But then we may throw out our chests, and by that I mean that the mineworkers are the only group of people whose numbers have shown a marked decrease whilst production has been increased. On the part of the chambers of commerce and various other bodies the plea is being made that we should produce more in South Africa, that we should work harder. I can now say that the mineworkers have responded to that call and are still doing so every day. In looking up the statistics, one sees that the mining industry is producing much more gold than it did in the days when I was working in the mines. But to that I want to add, Sir, that I am glad that the mineworkers are actually the only group of people who are at present still working 48 hours per week. It is not easy to work under those circumstances for 48 hours. We should not entertain the misconception this afternoon that the mineworker goes down six, seven or eight thousand feet underground and then sits down, leaving the work to be done by a non-White person. This is what many people have grown to believe, but I can give you the assurance, Sir, that this is not the case. Many people believe this story because they have no knowledge of the real facts. To my knowledge this is the only profession in which the workers have to work under such circumstances. Do the hon. members sitting here realize that the mineworker has to spend eight hours per day underground, where the temperature is far higher than 100 degrees Fahrenheit, That in modern mines the height varies between 30 and 48 inches, that many days the mineworker has to crawl along on his knees, that in many places he cannot crawl on his knees but has to slide along on his stomach, and that he has to work under very difficult circumstances&#x003F; When that person leaves the mine, I can tell you, Sir, that he has earned his bread in the sweat of his brow. To those people we extend our sincere thanks. It is an achievement that under such circumstances they can still accomplish such feats. Sir, I now want to make an appeal to the employers, for these people have also asked for a five-day week, but to that I want to add at once&#x2014; and I hope that the negotiations will be successful&#x2014;that they are not asking for shorter hours per week. In addition to that I can confirm&#x2014;and it is with full responsibility that I say it in this House today&#x2014;that I believe that in a five-day week the mineworkers will produce more than they are producing in a six-day week at present. Sir, this is not a job where one can simply walk in and by pressing a button start up all the machinery; every morning of ones&#x2019; life one has to start by spending approximately 1&#x00BD; hours on rendering the works safe before one can begin one&#x2019;s daily work. I believe that it would also be to the advantage of the employer if the mineworker could work a five-day week. Over and above that, I feel that the mineworker deserves that extra day of sunshine. I repeat that the circumstances under which the mineworkers are working, often pass us by. We accept the fact that there are people producing gold underground, but very few of us ever stop along the road in order to remind ourselves that thousands of feet below the fine road on which we are travelling, there are soldiers who are fighting for the economy of South Africa under very difficult circumstances.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, one smells electionitis. There seems to be an air of expectancy of defeat about the Nationalist Party. It is not strange that this sort of motion should come before us just a week or two before an election takes <span class="col_581-582" refersTo="page_0306"/>place on the Reef. I cannot blame my hon. friend from Stilfontein at all for introducing this motion; he must make every effort he possibly can to bolster the falling hopes of his party.</p>

<p>I was very pleased to see, Sir, that he divided his motion into two parts, because it makes my task much easier. There is nobody in the House or in the country who will differ from him as regards the second part of his motion. However, in regard to the first part, I think there are very few people that will agree with him, very few people indeed. Who is going to agree with him that we &#x201C;take cognizance of the action that has been taken and is being taken by the Government to improve the position of the mineworker&#x201D;, and do so with appreciation&#x003F; I do not think anybody would do so.</p>

<p>Let us have a look at what has been going on during the past few years. The hon. member says that there have been no strikes since 1948. Why is that&#x003F; That is because of the democratic process that was brought into being before 1948, by the United Party. They were the ones who advocated collective bargaining.</p>

<p>I remember that not so very long ago a prominent member of the Nationalist Party, who sat in that seat over there, did not want collective bargaining.

<p>I know of one occasion not very long ago, when the previous Minister, Mr. Haak, was still here. He sat in the benches over there and was a very worried man because he was almost on the side of the work-giver that time, when their experiment was being conducted on the mines. The present Minister will remember that very well. We, on this side of the House, warned them to go slowly in that matter.</p>

<p>What have we got to thank the Government for&#x003F; How much have they taken out of the gold mines, and how little have they given back&#x003F; I have some very interesting figures here. Last year&#x2014;not since 1948 to the present date, but last year about &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>No. Last year in taxes the Government received R228,7 million from the mines. That is what they got in direct taxation from the mines. Besides that colossal figure, there is the tax on the mineworker, on what he earns. There is the tax on the shareholder and there is an indirect tax collected by this Government on almost every purchase that he makes today. For that the hon. member for Stilfontein expects us to thank the Government, and for that the hon. member expects support from the mineworkers. The hon. member for Stilfontein told us what pension the mineworker gets while he is a very, very ill man; what compensation he gets when he has pneumoconiosis. He receives in the form of a pension, R137. Now that may seem a lot of money to the hon. member for Stilfontein.</p>

<block name="quote">As usual pneumoconiosis &#x2026; once more came pertinently to the attention of the Department during the year.</block>

<p>Then he goes on and says what difficulties they had, and he says that they are very sorry that they cannot increase the pensions at this stage, but that the trade unions unremittingly continue in their endeavour to obtain more favourable benefits for those persons. He does not say that that party, the party which is ruling the Republic, asked for that; he says it was the trade unions who were doing that. Then he says that the department is happy to report that certain conditions could nevertheless be made to mineworkers, and at the end of the paragraph we read this, and I want the hon. member to take this into consideration when dealing with the amounts of money that the pneumoconiosis sufferer gets&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A scheme, to commence on the said date, was also approved to transport pneumoconiosis sufferers free of charge when visiting the clinics.

<p>It says this should be of special benefit to those pneumoconiosis sufferers in needy circumstances. It means that they are not getting enough to live on. I challenge the hon. the Minister when he replies to put any other interpretation on this. I want to hear him tell this House if these people are wasting their money.</p>

<p>There are other matters that I think we could not thank the Government for, and one of them is the fact that they have done very little, if anything, to help to lower the accident rate on the mines. This is a problem that has been facing the mines for years, and the unsatis factory part of this whole problem is that the accident rate if it is not rising&#x2014;the best I can say is that it is static. The House knows that in the first 39 days of this year there were 32 deaths on the mines, and even if we take away the number of people who died during the recent fire at West Driefontein there is still a death every 48 hours. Do these people not deserve more consideration than our simply coming to this House and saying that we appreciate the work which they do&#x003F; We appreciate their loyalty. The loyalty which we appreciate stretches from one end of the country to the other&#x2014;what the miner is doing has world-wide appreciation. But I say that it is not helping the mother of a family, where the husband has pneumoconiosis, to buy another tin of jam. That is what we want; we want to see some material benefit coming to the mineworker.</p>

<p>Oh, never mind that hon. member. Another thing which perturbs me is the amount of money that is accumulating in the coffers of the Pneumoconiosis Fund. The Secretary for Mines was good enough to give me a breakdown of the amount of money that was paid out last year to sufferers. It comes to R10,5 million. In a globular sum it is a lot of money. However, how much money is lying in the pneumoconiosis coffers&#x003F;&#x2014; Over R70 million! That sum is being fed every year by more than is being used up. If you take into consideration that the number of miners is dropping, according to the statement just made by the hon. member for Stilfontein, surely the time has come that the people who are responsible for determining pneumoconiosis pensions should take into consideration the question of increasing pneumoconiosis pensions.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House, time and again, without any lobbying, have pleaded for improvements for the mineworker. In 1958, when I first came to the House, I was condemned by the then Minister, Dr. van Rhyn, for having the impertinence to question the then Pneumoconiosis Act. He came back later on and thanked me. What did he say&#x003F; He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I shall be very glad if the hon. member for Rosettenville will tell me from time to time what his findings have been and I shall be most pleased to consider his advice.</block>

<p>That was said in 1958. We do our best for the mineworkers and we have been doing it in the past. We have not had to be lobbied to do it, we do it. Hon. members here who are interested in the miners today, know quite well that it has not been the practice of the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union to come round and plead with the indidual members for improvements. They expect us to do it, and to keep an eye on what is happening. We are doing it.</p>

<p>What is the use&#x003F; I Find that the best way to make an impression on this Government is to do it here in this House and make requests across the floor. This is the place where we debate it and this is where we can get the Government&#x2019;s answers.</p>

<p>This side of the House have asked for years for an improvement in and an investigation into the question of asbestosis. My hon. friend who was in this House up to the last session, Dr. Radford, made a special study of this condition and he brought it to the fore in this House. We had people who spoke about deafness, about gastric conditions and about skin conditions. All these matters have been brought to the fore by this side of the House. I myself have asked for the retirement of mineworkers who have worked in mines for a certain period of years and I did get some support from hon. members on that side of the House. It fits in with what the hon. member for Stilfontein said today. We said that after 20 to 25 years a mineworker should have the option of coming out of the mine if he so wishes; that he should get sufficient compensation for the work he has done during those years. If the Government can take so many millions out of taxation from the mines and the mining companies, the time has come that they must give more to the workers who have enabled this Government to take so much out of the Industry.</p>

<p>When we talk about loyalty I can say that we have recognized the loyalty of the mineworkers over and over again. It was the mineworker who showed his loyalty to this country when war broke out in 1939. It was a mine battalion which voluntarily went overseas. They helped in their hundreds. Hon. members on that side of the House despised them because they wore red tabs on their shoulders. [Interjections.] I remember that; that was loyalty, and that was their way of recognizing loyalty. The United Party-orientated City Council of Johannesburg has recognized the loyalty of these people. They built a monument for them &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. VAN WYK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not believe that it was the aim of the member moving this motion to play politics here. The lot of the mineworker in the Republic of South Africa is of such great importance to this side of the House that we do not want to make politics of it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville&#x2019;s speech was, as he himself dubbed it, a political speech. He tried to canvass votes for the by-election to be held in Brakpan. He created expectations in the people. It is very easy to make promises, but had the hon. member read the motion and aimed his criticism at it, I should have liked to give him credit for his arguments. But how he can actually want to associate an orange tab with what the Government did not do for the mineworkers, I cannot understand. We do not want to make politics out of the mineworker&#x2019;s lot. In my speech I shall try to keep well away from politics and attempt to state positively what the Government has, in fact, done for the mineworker.</p>

<p>We know that mining is hard work. The mineworker himself says: &#x201C;It is a man&#x2019;s job.&#x201D; It is hard and dangerous work. Therefore, throughout the years attention has been given, particularly by this Government, to measures for ensuring the mineworker&#x2019;s right of existence. At all times attention has been paid to the mineworkers&#x2019; lot. If we now see the mineworker engaged in his mining activities and consider what he does there, we notice two aspects in particular. In the first place he is constantly exposed to danger. There below ground he constantly walks with death, as it were. The possibility of an accident is always present. In the second place there is always the possibility that at some time or other he could contract pneumoconiosis. In earlier years this was the mineworker&#x2019;s fate. If a man entered a mine he contracts pneumoconiosis some time or other. But thanks to the preventive measures instituted through the years, pneumoconiosis is no longer so prevalent today. In recent years measures have been adopted, in the first place, to ensure the mineworkers&#x2019; safety and, in the second place, to improve conditions underground to such an extent that the mineworker&#x2019;s health is not detrimentally affected. Attempts were made to find ways and means for restricting accidents in mines to a minimum. The hon. member for Rosettenville spoke about mining accidents, but he gave a completely distorted picture of them. Steps were also taken to prevent mineworkers contracting pneumoconiosis. The two big questions we are dealing with are therefore those of mining accidents and the contraction of pneumoconiosis.</p>

<p>I now specifically want to confine myself to the steps taken to ensure the mineworker&#x2019;s safety. Since 1947 particular attention has been given to matters concerning the safety of mineworkers. There is the Mines and Works Act which is amended from time to time and which compels mine-owners to adopt certain safety measures. It remains the responsibility of the mine-owner to ensure that the mineworker works under safe conditions. The responsibility of the Government and State is to ensure that those safety measures are implemented. Therefore in 1964 it was registered in the Mine and Works Act that a mine safety committee be appointed. The mine safety committee must assist the Government Mining Engineer and advise him about matters concerning the safety and health of the persons working on the mines. This was done in 1964. There is also a panel of mining experts appointed to advise the mine safety committee and the Government Mining Engineer about any matter within the compass of the Mines and Works Act and also in respect of the regulations connected with it. As a further step the Coal and Mining Research Controlling Council was established. This body is concerned with research in connection with the mining of coal and the relevant safety aspects involved. This was a direct result of the investigation that followed the Coalbrook disaster.</p>

<p>Special attention was also given by the Government Mining Engineer&#x2019;s division to dust problems. Dust prevention control at mines was intensified. In general improvements were made at mines and workings <span class="col_589-590" refersTo="page_0310"/>where previously unsatisfactory conditions prevailed. The dust prevention regulations were also made applicable to mines that were not controlled and to stone quarries, thereby to combat the danger of pneumoconiosis. Apparently the hon. member for Rosettenville knows nothing of these steps that were taken. In passing he could at least have expressed appreciation for them because they are very definitely in the interests of the mineworkers.</p>

<p>Special attention was also given to combating dust conditions in asbestos mines. The hon. member for Rosettenville has already referred to asbestosis. Special steps were taken to combat the dust conditions in asbestos mines and asbestos mills. The dangers of exposure to asbestos have specifically received the Government&#x2019;s attention. After all, we are all aware that the inhalation of asbestos dust is much more dangerous than the inhalation of mineral dust. Therefore the Government is harnassing everything to combat it. Thus mines have, for example, been persuaded to purchase and use efficient dust-extraction installations. The efficiency of these safety measures I have just mentioned, I shall indicate to the hon. House. I shall prove that the number of mining accidents over the years has not remained static as the hon. member for Rosettenville claimed. We must bear in mind that today mining is done at much greater depth than previously, and that the possibility of accidents is therefore much greater. In connection with the accident rate in the mines, I have figures, covering recent years, that indicate the prevention of accidents: in 1964 there were 1,23 per 1 000 cases amongst all mineworkers.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>1,26.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_wyk">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. VAN WYK</person>:</from>

<p>It is 1,23. In 1965 the figure was 1,33; in 1966, 1,22; in 1967, 1,30; and in 1968, 1,09. This is truly a phenomenal achievement. The accident rate is definitely decreasing. The combating of dust in mines is a very important aspect in ensuring the welfare of the mineworker. This is done by periodically determining the presence of dust in the mine, by taking dust readings and then combating the presence of dust by improving the ventilation. A further method applied is the addition of water to certain works. Thus today approved rock drills are used that drill with water to combat the dust. These measures have to a large extent contributed to the decrease in dust. This is all the result of regulations amended a few years ago so that stricter control could be exercised over the quantity of air supplied and the use of water. Statistics are difficult to obtain, but I want to state that notwithstanding the increase in mechanisation, the fact that mining is being done to greater depth and the increase in the tempo of mining activities, there has since 1947 been a definite downward trend in dust concentrations to which workers have been exposed above and below ground. Therefore we cannot but thank the Government for the steps it has taken in improving the lot of the mineworker.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there is no question that the motion which was introduced this afternoon has a definite political purpose, despite what the hon. member who has just sat down, has said. It was very pleasing to note, however, that the House was treated to an outstanding exposition of the mineworker and of what is taking place in the gold-mining industry by the hon. member for Rosettenville who, over the years, has not only had personal knowledge about this industry, but who has also made an important contribution towards assisting the Minister of Mines in trying to solve some of the important problems that face the industry. The country is very grateful to many aspects of our economic life. People have contributed enormous sums of money and the Chamber of Mines, i.e. the association of the various mining companies as well as the gold producers&#x2019; committee have played a vital and important role in the development of the gold-mining industry in this country. They, together with the South Africans and others who have given their skills, have helped to maintain the enormous production which has placed us in the forefront among the gold-producing countries of the world. In that sense they not only played an important part in the development of this industry, but also in the development of South Africa, they have shown loyalty and devotion and have given service to our country, but not to the Nationalist Government and also not to the Nationalist Party, the assertion that anybody is serving this country because of the party is one which I throw back at the Nationalist Party as a lot of utter nonsense. This country has advanced through the sweat, the toil, the blood and sacrifice of South Africans for the good and the future <span class="col_591-592" refersTo="page_0311"/>of South Africa. Any person who has the impertinence to convey the thanks and gratitude of the mineworker to the door of the Nationalist Party, like the hon. member for Stilfontein, just does not know what he is talking about. The Industrial Conciliation Act and other attendant labour legislation which I modestly claim were introduced by the United Party and its predecessors and which the Government claims are amongst the outstanding legislation of the world have played a vital and important role in advancing the good of the worker and the employer. It is they who negotiate for improvement in their wages and their conditions of employment; it is the employer who, through his profits, contributes to the tremendous amount of research that takes place in this country in order to ease the lot of the worker and to improve the conditions under which he works. Who was it who in 1946 appointed the Uranium Research Committee through whose efforts we were able to play an important part in salvaging some of the capital which had been invested in mines that closed down recently and opened an entire new vista of income for South Africa through the sale of uranium and which today has placed us in the position where we can take a leading part in the production of uranium&#x003F; It is a body which will make an important contribution in regard to this mineral in world affairs. All Governments play their part in the development of a country. One does not need to thank the Nationalist Party for anything that they have done. I maintain that the lot of the mineworker has still not been resolved, as has been rightly pointed out. There are considerable numbers of them in the constituency of Jeppes, which includes, the miners of the early days. They are still suffering because so little has been given back. This Government has a record that if they give anything in the form of a pension or gratuity they give it sparingly and begrudgingly, because there is an extraordinary principle involved in their application of social welfare and assistance, and that is to be as niggardly as they can, so that if a man deeds that extra little pittance, he must jolly well work for it. They take no cognizance of what happens, despite the maudlin expressions that flowed from the mouth of the hon. member for Stilfontein.</p>

We have pleaded for a long time now for a complete review of the Pneumoconiosis Act. Now we hear from the hon. member for Stilfontein that he hopes in the near future it may be reviewed.

<p>The hon. members for Rosettenville and Jeppe both referred to an election that is in the air&#x003F; They refer to Brakpan. I want to tell the hon. members that they can forget about Brakpan. Brakpan still remembers the days when they asked for bread and got bullets.

<p>it does not surprise me that hon. members on that side laughed when the motion was moved. This National Government has now been ruling South Africa for 24 years. I therefore say that it does not surprise me that in these 24 years in which the National Party has ruled South Africa, apart from a few exceptions, not one hon. member on that side of the House has represented a mineworkers&#x2019; constituency. Therefore I can understand that when we on this side of the House, who are constantly in contact with those people from day to day, inevitably because we represent that constituency, speak about the problems of the mineworkers in South Africa, hon. members on that side of the House regard it as a big joke. This afternoon they come along here as piously as you please, with Brakpan in mind, and want to imply that they are the so-called champions of the mineworkers in South Africa.

<p>This Government realizes that mining, the mining of our mineral wealth in South Africa, is most certainly one of the large foundation stones on which South Africa&#x2019;s economy rests. Sir, I would shamefully be neglecting my duty if I were not to associate myself with the hon. member for Turffontein and, in our discussion of this important motion, also give the utmost praise and tribute to the large group of men for what they have done over many years under very difficult circumstances for the expansion of South Africa&#x2019;s economy.</p>

<p>Sir, on a previous occasion in this House I referred to those mineworkers as the economic soldiers of South Africa, and I cannot but tell you again today, as the hon. member for Turffontein has already strikingly done, that these people are, from day to day, carrying out a tremendous task for South Africa under conditions endangering their lives. Sir, a few months ago I went to visit a friend of mine in Cottesloe, the mine hospital. Just by the way, this friend is in the flower of his youth, a young man, a good golf player, who had an accident in a Welkom mine. There was a rockfall and a number of Bantu were killed in the process. He broke his back and he will be an invalid for the rest of his life. I walked through that hospital and came to realize the great and responsible work done by mineworkers in South Africa under very difficult circumstances. When you see that heartache you realize that every day the mineworker goes underground he is subject to many dangers; and because that is so, this National Government realizes its responsibility and has, in the 24 years it has ruled South Africa, furnished unequivocal proof that at all times it lends a sympathetic ear to the problems of the mineworkers in South Africa. The mineworkers note with appreciation that in season and out of season the hon. the Minister of Mines&#x2019; doors are open to trade union leaders and mineworkers to discuss their problems with him. The mineworkers of South Africa note with appreciation that the mining group on the National side here in Parliament are wrestling with their problems from time to time. And such was also the case last Thursday when we got together and exchanged ideas because we are in earnest about the mineworkers of South Africa. Since 1948 the Government has continually reviewed the position of the mineworker and his dependants with respect to industrial diseases and the payment of compensation for such diseases, and in addition to the over-all revision and consolidation of the <span class="col_595-596" refersTo="page_0313"/>pneumoconiosis legislation in 1956 and 1962, which brought about considerable benefits for the mineworkers at that stage, benefits were also improved in the years 1950, 1952, 1965, 1968, 1970 and 1971. Sir, it is interesting to note&#x2014;I think the hon. member for Turffontein mentioned this figure, but because it is such an illuminating one I should like to repeat it&#x2014;that since 1948 the benefits in respect of our pneumoconiosis sufferers have increased by more than 220 per cent. In the case of a widow the pension has since 1948 been increased from R13 per month to R60 per month. The maximum pension for a mineworker with a wife and one child was increased from R38 per month to R137 per month. With the introduction of the Pneumoconiosis Compensation Act in 1962, the then Minister of Mines gave the assurance that this Act would be reviewed from time to time, as was the case in past years, but because it is felt that we cannot continue patchworking this legislation, it was decided that the Pneumoconiosis legislation should be revised.</p>

<p>Sir, hon. members opposite mentioned in passing that they lodged a plea for the revision of this Act. I want to point out that hon. members on this side of the House&#x2014;and in this connection I refer you to last year&#x2019;s Hansard&#x2014;in the persons of the hon. member for Stilfontein and others, lodged urgent pleas with the hon. the Minister for the revision of this Act, and today hon. members on that side have the temerity to say that this Bill is being introduced as a result of their pleas. The Pneumoconiosis Act will, it is hoped, be amended in the course of this year, for which we are grateful to the hon. the Minister. Sir, so I could continue and mention to you many milestones erected by this National Government to improve the position of the mineworkers in South Africa. I can associate myself with the hon. member for Stilfontein and tell you that the mineworkers of South Africa are grateful that this year Republic Day is also an annual holiday for them. The mineworkers of South Africa, like any member in this House and any citizen outside it, have also made a gigantic contribution towards giving South Africa that great occasion, the advent of Republic. So I could continue and mention to you, Sir, that the mineworkers are grateful for that graceful building, the Mineworkers&#x2019; Bureau, which stands in Johannesburg and was erected at a cost of more than R1 million. In that building is contained some of the most modern apparatus one can find in the world today, clear proof that this side of the House is sincere and means well with respect to the South African mineworker. I do not have the slightest doubt that in the years ahead this Government will at all times conscientiously and with the utmost responsibility look to the interests of the mineworker, because the Government is serious and has good intentions in respect of the lot of the mineworker. I must say this to hon. members on the other side of the House, and I know what I am speaking about: The mineworkers of South Africa know&#x2014;they knew it in years past and they know it today&#x2014; that their future, the future of their children, their lot and their welfare lie only within the National Party framework.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I listened with interest to arguments advanced here in defence of this statement of the hon. member for Stilfontein. His motion reads that the House with appreciation takes cognizance of, firstly, the steps taken by the Government&#x2014;according to the arguments of hon. members on that side, this is the very first thing they want to sing the praises of&#x2014;secondly, the responsible contribution of the mineworker and, thirdly, perhaps the contribution of others who also made a small contribution to the success of the mining industry. Sir, let us look at the actual position in the mining industry. What is the actual position of the mineworker&#x003F; What would it be if mining and the labour situation were not sound; what would the mineworker&#x2019;s position have been: how would he have fared if the industry itself and the labour situation within that industry were not on a sound footing&#x003F; Let us take a brief look at what the position is. Sir, in 1960 there were about 50 000 Whites in the mining industry in South Africa and about 400 000 non-Whites. By the year 1970 the position had weakened considerably as far as the Whites are concerned, and the figure had decreased to 38 745, i.e. from about 50 000 to 38 000. This is a tremendous decrease. The number of non-Whites remained constant at about 38 000, but while foreign Natives made up about 60 per cent of the total in 1946, in 1970 they constituted 75 per cent of the total; i.e. the Black labour of the mines is chiefly being imported from outside and the percentage of imported foreign labour is constantly increasing. The decrease in the number of Whites each <span class="col_597-598" refersTo="page_0314"/>year totals about 7 per cent to 10 per cent. A very delicate and difficult position is being created here. Let us look at what the President of the Chamber of Mines said last year. He reviewed the year 1969-&#x2019;70; and the President at the time was Dr. Von Maltitz, who is no enemy of the present Government. This is what he said. It is a free translation, but I think an accurate one&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">During the year the mining industry experienced a continual shortage of White labour, and with the growth of the economy as a whole, and the mining industry in particular, there is no reason to expect that any noteworthy improvement will take place without important changes in the application of labour. On the contrary, in the present circumstances it would be realistic to expect that the shortage of mineworkers and artisans will continue to increase until it reaches the point where it adversely affects new mining development. The shortage of skilled labour on the mines is part of a more extensive problem, the inability of the White population to offer skilled labour at the rate demanded by the growth of the economy.</block>

<p>Here we have the situation. On this occasion I do not want to go into the labour policy of the Government, but here in the mining industry we have a reflection of the situation created by the Government and its labour policy, and the artificial shortage that is being created in our entire labour situation in South Africa. It is against that background that the position of the mineworker must be regarded. We heard from hon. members on that side, such as the hon. member for Stilfontein, that all the improvements brought about in the position of the mineworker are attributable to the help or intervention of the Government. He mentioned aspects such as salary improvements. Mr. Speaker, salary improvements are negotiated and arranged by discussions that take place between the mineworkers and the mine bosses, the employers. The salary increases are not paid by the Government. The improvements, the changes in conditions, are not introduced by the Government and neither do they pay for them. It is as a result of the attitude of the mine bosses to the employees, and the good relations existing between them, that these improvements continually take place. It is altogether ridiculous to thank the Government for that.</p>

<p>Let us go further. Let us look at the hospitals. I agree that beautiful hospitals do exist in the South African mining areas. Mention was made of the Rand Mutual Hospital. That is a beautiful and excellent hospital, but the Government did not pay a penny for it.</p>

That is no honest basis on which to argue. Let us look at the research that is done. A tremendous amount is being done through research for the improvement of conditions in the mining industry. Who pays for that&#x003F; The mines do.</p>

<p>Mention was made of the fine sports facilities and the Government thanked for that! The hon. member for Stilfontein made mention of the lovely townships. I know them well. I have frequently been there and I agree wholeheartedly with him that they are lovely. But let the praise accrue to those it belongs to. Where was the Government instrumental in the building of lovely townships, in supplying the sports facilities or the other facilities that exist there&#x003F; What the Government did in fact do&#x2014;and let us now frankly admit this&#x2014;was to promulgate laws and regulations. For that we do perhaps say thank you. The Government has a tremendous output of laws and regulations. Their productivity in that respect is tremendous. When their productivity in that sphere is praised we would be the first to agree. This is still increasing and we foresee no limits. It still goes on.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Virginia spoke of the safety of the mineworkers. Let us go into that. I know that constant research is being done to improve the safety situation in the mines. I agree wholeheartedly with the hon. member, except that he again wants to thank the Government for it. The Government does have an act which it maintains and modernizes, and it has regulations. <span class="col_599-600" refersTo="page_0315"/>The Government also has an excellent Government Mining Engineer to watch over matters, but that is simply by way of regulations. Who pays for this&#x003F; Who takes these steps&#x003F; Who are the people doing the research and adopting it, and the people who implement the actual improvements&#x003F; There is no word of thanks for that. We only thank the Government because it has the production capacity regulations. We also say thank you for that, but let us speak about more real issues. The Government Mining Engineer, who is responsible for these improvements or their supervision, would be the first to acknowledge and confirm that the conditions now existing are attributable to very good co-operation, the tremendous sum of money spent and the tremendous dedication of the mining industry to the improvement of conditions. He cannot sit quite alone in his office and bring about these conditions. He is a superviser, but the work is actually done by the mining industry itself. I do not want to say anything against the supervisers, they also have their duties, but these only contribute in small part to the conditions that now exist. These steps are taken by the mining industry, the mine bosses, the contractors, who also have an interest in the matter. It is also important to them that the mineworkers be happy and healthy.</p>

<p>Mention was made of dust prevention agencies. [Interjections.] Sir, if one really knows the mining industry, if one has spent a part of one&#x2019;s life there, one feels very grateful to various groups of people. Not only to the underground mineworker as such; there are also the officials working above ground. There are the surveyors, who play a very important role, and there are the engineers, all people who make their contributions to the general welfare of the mining industry. This motion which was moved today is a very limited one. It pays no tribute to the people who have contributed so tremendously to the present welfare of our mining industry.</p>

<p>What did speakers on that side of the House say&#x003F; The member who introduced the motion paid tribute, firstly, to the Government, which played the smallest role of all in the whole matter; and everyone who knows the mining industry must acknowledge this. The major tribute was paid to them, and secondly to the mineworker. He is the fine fellow who works so hard underground, and the improvements in his working conditions were brought about by his own employers, according to regulations which the Government, of course, established, but the major part was nevertheless played by the employers, who also paid for it. Many other important contributions were also made, as I have said. The mining industry does not only consist of the mineworker who works underground, or the mine boss sitting in Johannesburg.</p>

He only mentions, firstly, the Government who, according to him, are the people making the largest contributions; secondly, the mineworker, because an election is being held in a few weeks&#x2019; time, but he keeps absolutely silent about the people who also make a tremendous contribution to the mining industry. He takes no notice of them; he does not want to hear anything about that.

<p>Before 1948 there was not even a thought given to pneumoconiosis. It is only since 1952 that silicosis has spread to cover more than just the gold mines. Since then the legislation has constantly extended so that even stone quarries, where work is done under dusty conditions, are regarded as dangerous places. That legislation has been changed seven times since 1947. The most important change came in 1962 when the basis of pneumoconiosis classification was applied not only on the condition of the lungs, but also on the heart-lung function. I remember that in 1951 I began working amongst the mineworkers. I still remember seeing the old &#x201C;pthisis sufferers&#x201D;, as we called them, sitting on their stoeps on a cold winter&#x2019;s day. They sat there with blankets around them, wearing a jersey and with their spittoons in their hands. As the sun moved they moved with it. I now want to ask the hon. member for Rosettenville if that was the golden age; were those the good old times you spoke about&#x003F; Since 1962 the classification of the Pneumoconiosis Council has been based not only on the condition of the lungs, but also on heart function tests. The Miners&#x2019; Medical Bureau has, since 1962, been completely transformed so that it has a completely new approach. I now want to give hon. members a brief insight into the activities of this bureau. This bureau is a statutory body of this Government and must report to this Government. In the first place every miner working in any mine is examined thoroughly. According to the Miners&#x2019; Medical Bureau report there were 8 814 such examinations in the year 1970-&#x2019;71, 85 per cent of which were done by the central bureau in Johannesburg. We must remember that these numbers include an initial full medical examination. In addition each mineworker in the industry, wherever he finds himself, must go once a year for a re-examination. Over the period covered by the last report I have, the period from 1969 to 1970, periodic examinations were <span class="col_603-604" refersTo="page_0317"/>carried out on 54 687 cases. Each time an X-ray is taken, and in that specific year more than 61 000 X-ray examinations were made. Apart from those periodic examinations, people who suffer from tuberculosis are also examined, and those who have recovered can again be certificated by means of that examination. The cases that do show a questionable sign of heart-lung damage are then referred to the certification committee. We still remember well what a stigma attached to the &#x201C;pthisis bureau&#x201D;. Since this Government reorganized the entire organization it became a bureau under the control of the State. In that one specific year 3 110 such cases were referred to them. This bureau has a panel of doctors, specialists and other aids I should like to mention. I have in mind, for example, the &#x201C;Springkell&#x201D; sanatorium where any suspect case of tuberculosis infection can be admitted and then thoroughly examined over a period of a few days. They use the South African Research Institute for all their blood tests and all their examinations to ensure that there is no misunderstanding in connection with their certification. Because the Act deals with the basis of the heart-lung function before one is declared unfit, more than 2 670 cases per year are examined by the lung function unit which is one of the most up to date in the world. This Miners&#x2019; Medical Bureau also has a special research unit. I am glad the hon. member for Von Brandis referred to it. Dust research continues to be done there under the supervision of this bureau. Research is also done on the effects of depth. They do research about how a mineworker feels when he is working 10 000 or 12 000 feet underground, what his reactions are and what conditions have an effect on him. Pathological research is also done on specimens they receive of deceased mineworkers. Research is also being done in the new field of uranium mining. Before uranium was actually mined a start had been made with research into the possible harmful effects of radioactive minerals. This is not all this medical bureau does. It also takes part in international conferences. I remember well that the hon. member for Rosettenville and I were present at the conference held in Johannesburg in 1969. At that conference it was very clear that South Africa was a small step ahead of any other country in the field of research and in its approach to mineworkers&#x2019; diseases. In addition this Pneumoconiosis Bureau also does educational work through discussions and seminars at the Universities of Pretoria and the Witwatersrand about diseases occurring in the mining industry. The bureau also advises the Railways and the Compensation Commissioner.</p>

<p>There are many problems for the mineworker. It is a good thing that we also air his problems here. The mineworker does not always understand what it is all about. Many of the mineworkers are frightened off by the stigma that attaches to the phthisis bureau. They think that the phthisis bureau or the Pneumoconiosis Bureau is controlled by the Chamber of Mines alone. That is not the case. The mineworker does not always understand what degrees and percentage mean. He does not understand that although I am perhaps 20 per cent unfit while another person is 50 per cent unfit, I can still feel more ill than the other person. He cannot understand that every ordinary person could also contract other diseases. Because he works in that dangerous atmosphere underground he always thinks in terms of compensation. He is possibly a sufferer from high blood pressure and heart trouble and consequently might feel it difficult to breathe. Because he could then possibly obtain compensation he goes to the Pneumoconiosis Bureau and wants to ascribe everything to the conditions under which he works. This is where the many problems crop up; this is where the Pneumoconiosis Bureau&#x2019;s unpopularity originates. This is also where the Government is sometimes blamed, just as hon. members on that side of the House always want to blame the Government for everything.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to conclude with this thought. There has been much talk here about mineral dust. Our mineworkers talk about mineral dust; we do not speak about gold. But there is one subject about which we ought to speak much more, and that is the cause for gratitude for the Government&#x2019;s actions on behalf of the mineworkers.</p>

<p>I first want to come to the hon. member for Stilfontein, who introduced this motion. What the hon. member said was from start to finish a song of praise about what the Government had allegedly done. In my opinion, that song of praise is entirely without any real foundation. The hon. member for Stilfontein said here that the mineworker was loyal towards the Government, but today the mineworker is asking why the Government is not loyal towards the mineworker; why, in the face of the increasing number of problems they have, they are not being looked after nowadays&#x003F; The hon. member for Stilfontein employed the age-old method of making a promise and holding out the prospect of something wonderful which the Government might be able to carry into effect. He pointed out quite rightly that he knew of no other occupation today besides mining where 48 hours are still worked. It is not under my Government, but under his, that this situation exists today. He made the promise, or the prediction, or let me say, advanced the idea, that the mines would perhaps get a five-day week. Where is the hon. the Minister of Labour&#x003F; The hon. the Minister of Mines is here. Let us hear from him whether he is thinking of a five-day week for the mineworker, although, according to the member for Stilfontein, the mineworker must still work a full 48 hours &#x2026;</p>

<p>In June, 1948, I was in the United Party. Another promise too was made which came to naught and that was that key industries, of which the mining industry is the major one, would come under the control of the State. What prospects of heaven were not held up to the mineworkers 25 to 28 years ago! What has become of these promises&#x003F; The hon. member for Stilfontein and other hon. members on that side of this House wax lyrical about the so-called peace between them and the mineworkers and about the fact that they allegedly get on so well. <span class="col_607-608" refersTo="page_0319"/>However, let the hon. the Minister of Mines tell us of the difficulties and problems he experienced when he came forward with a new dispensation in the Bantu areas, at which time a dispute arose. Most probably there was a dispute between the hon. the Minister and the hon. member for Stilfontein, too, or did the hon. member approve of everything which the hon. the Minister of Mines did&#x003F; Why is the hon. member so quiet now&#x003F; I remember well how, in the early 1950s, Mr. Daan Ellis, who was the then Secretary of the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union, argued with Dr. Malan, the Prime Minister, and said to him at one stage: &#x201C;Look, Dr. Malan, I put you into office, but I am going to ensure that you will be removed from office.&#x201D; This is how well they loved each other 20 years ago. I have here a cutting from <i>Dagbreek en Sondagnuus,</i> the National Party&#x2019;s own newspaper which illustrates the wild doings between the Government and the mineworkers in 1965 because of the Government&#x2019;s inability to settle a dispute. A leading article in <i>Dagbreek</i> described those disputes as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The dispute in mining circles has taken an alarming turn.

<p>Yes, it was purely a patchwork mess. The Nationalist Party admits that in the past few years it has done only patchwork. Now there is at least talk of legislation being introduced this year. However, I want no speculation about that; I demand from the hon. the Minister to announce today that he is going to introduce legislation this year with regard to the Pneumoconiosis Act in order to bring that Act up to date in the interests of the mineworkers. Last year he speculated about that. We heard about a commission which had been appointed. [Interjections.] That is why I am saying he speculated. But this year we demand that he come forward with legislation, so that we may rightly say that we forced him to do so. Sir, do you know for how many years requests have been made for this Act to be revised and for how many years there have been complaints about faults and shortcoming in the Act&#x003F; I have here an extract from a speech made in 1966, six years ago. The hon. member&#x2014;I shall mention his name later&#x2014;said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Since there is much dissatisfaction and misunderstanding among the mineworkers, especially in regard to the 1962 Act, I should like to ask the Minister whether the time has not come for it to be revised.</block>

<p>Now I want to ask the hon. member for Stilfontein: Does he know who the hon. member is who spoke here about the dissatisfaction among the mineworkers&#x003F; The hon. member for Brakpan; He endorsed the fact and knew that they would have been so dissatisfied that he would not have been able to be a candidate in an election in Brakpan again. In the interests of safety, therefore, he was moved out to a commissionership somewhere in the remote parts of South Africa. As far back as six years ago he asked whether it was not time for a proper conference to be held with all the Members of Parliament who were interested in this legislation. He spoke of &#x201C;unnecessary irritants&#x201D; and &#x201C;great dissatisfaction&#x201D; about the single amount which the mineworker who wanted to draw a tuberculosis pension, received in those days.</p>

<p>He requested that attention be paid to mineworkers&#x2019; pensions and said: &#x201C;We find <span class="col_609-610" refersTo="page_0320"/>that there is dissatisfaction in regard to children&#x2019;s allowances.&#x201D; It is not this side of the House, but in fact that side which has been saying this for the past five or six years, led by the hon. member for Brakpan, who, in the interests of safety is not going to be a candidate in Brakpan again next time.</p>

<p>We must consider that what is being done by this Government against the mineworker and his family, goes much further than merely those few Acts which have been passed. Think of the rising cost of living under which he sometimes has to suffer much more than most of our fellow-citizens here in South Africa. Those rising prices and the rise in the index figure, as well as the higher taxation, etc., affects him, much more than most South Africans because he is not in the highest income group. The Government does not see to the productivity and the higher production costs, apart from wages&#x2014;I am not speaking of that&#x2014;of the mines. The Minister of Transport will quite happily increase the rail tariffs at any time, which is going to be another blow to the mines and the standard of living of the mineworkers. Large-scale unemployment in the mining industry may arise. The hon. the Minister laughs. Does he know what happened at Rustenburg&#x003F; Surely he knows the Rustenburg case; he knows how the work of hundreds and hundreds of mineworkers was threatened. Were it not for the action of the mines themselves, the distress there would have been so much the greater. But I am not the one who says that the Government should do something about this. I have here <i>The Mineworker,</i> the publication of the mineworker. The heading reads: &#x201C;Government and mines must devise a plan about Rustenburg. Why not hoard platinum&#x003F;&#x201D; Their own publication says the Government should devise a plan in respect of what is happening there. In spite of this, hon. members want to sing the praises of the Government for what it is allegedly doing for the mineworker.</p>

<p>Sir, we all know that the gold mines are a disappearing asset. Even with an increase in the price of gold, the gold mines cannot go on existing here in South Africa for all times. What planning has there been on the part of this Government in respect of mines which have closed down or which are going to close down on the Witwatersrand or in the Orange Free State in the future&#x003F; What planning has there been for the future of those areas when there will be no more work for the mineworker of the nature for which he was trained&#x003F; What sort of Acts do we have from the Government&#x003F; We have measures for the compulsory moving of industries from Benoni and Brakpan, and in future the mineworkers will probably have to go to the borders of a Bantustan in order to fine a livelihood.</p>

<p>It is our policy that there should be a new dispensation and, without wanting to criticize the hon. the Minister here, I want to say the following: Under the policy of the United Party, a mineworker working on a mine in a Bantustan or Bantu area, would be safe, but under the policy of that Government, if such a Bantustan becomes completely independent and the mineworker becomes dependent on a strange government and no longer on the South African Government, he will no longer be as safe in that area as he would have been had that area formed part of one great state, one great South Africa, in terms of United Party policy.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, there are several other respects in which the Government could have done much more for <span class="col_611-612" refersTo="page_0321"/>the mineworker and his safety. In this regard I am not thinking of minor matters where the mineworker is being needled. Neither am I thinking of prosecutions which are instituted against the ordinary man in the possession of a lottery ticket, in respect of which one finds that most of these prosecutions are instituted among the mineworkers in Welkom and Western Areas. Why is the mineworker sought out as the scapegoat when prosecutions are instituted because of the possession of lottery tickets&#x003F; I do not want to speak about those matters; they are minor matters, but I have in mind one thing which affected the safety of the mineworker to a very large extent and that is that fantastic whirlwind, uncertain policy followed over a period of 15 to 20 years in regard to sinkholes, a policy of such a nature that the hon. member for Carletonville once felt called upon to say that he admired those people and that he himself would not have gone to live there, a policy through which R26 million &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>If he did not say that, I think there was a time when he would have been fairly unwilling to settle permanently in those areas where sinkholes had appeared. Even those sinkholes were caused by a lack of policy on that side, they could not decide exactly what should be done. We heard of thousands of holes which had been bored in an attempt to prevent sink-holes from developing. Sir, I do not want to elaborate too much on that, but we should remember that more than 40 mineworkers lost their lives in those sink-holes, that 300 houses were destroyed, that 200 were stripped and that the total cost amounted to R26 million.</p>

<p>Sir, I do not want to delay this House much longer. I should very much like to know from the hon. the Minister whether he is going to heed our request in regard to legislation which we should like to see on the Statute Book and whether eventually, after years of unfulfilled promises, a new dispensation for the mineworkers is going to come. Let me conclude by saying that as regards admiration for the mineworker and for the extremely essential task he performs, nobody on this side of this House, in the United Party, for one moment takes a back seat to any member on that side.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Orange Grove has just, with much gesticulation, demanded of me here that I should indicate today whether the pneumoconiosis legislation will be amended during the course of this session. I just want to ask the hon. member where he was last year. After all, I announced here&#x2014;it was not speculation&#x2014;in this House that it would be done, and that work on the amendments was actively in progress and that negotiations were at this stage being conducted with the mineworkers.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>If the mining people are able to reach an agreement with us we shall introduce it this year, and I expect this to happen. But you know, Sir, we all move with the times, organizations and individuals, and mining also moves with the times. The mining industry has moved with the times, away from the days when they used mules and Shetland ponies in the mines. We have moved with the mineworkers of South Africa, and believe it or not, in 1972, Orange Grove still does this to us. I think I must leave the hon. member at that.</p>

<p>Sir, this has been a fine day, a good day and a fine afternoon for the mineworkers of South Africa and their dependants, particularly for that 5 per cent who were so unfortunate as to contract pneumoconiosis. But it is also a significant day. This day is really a remarkable one for its message conveyed by the Order Paper before us. This is the first private members motion and it came from our side. Why&#x003F; Because that side fails to realize the importance of the mineworkers.</p>

<p>Nonsense!</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But the Order Paper is also significant, for what is the second motion set down there, also from this side of the House&#x003F; It relates to the education of our young people, and was introduced by the hon. member for Algoa. They failed to discuss that matter. And the third&#x003F; That is a motion by the hon. member for Swellendam on farming and the farmers of South Africa, for that side <span class="col_613-614" refersTo="page_0322"/>failed to discuss that matter. This is a significant Order Paper, if one considers the private members motions which came from this side of the House. We now have to do what an opposition ought to do if it is worth its salt.</p>

<p>But I should also like to say that the hon. member for Stilfontein not only deserves our gratitude, but also our congratulations for the sympathetic way in which he introduced the motion. He can speak with authority for not only does he know those people, he is one of them. And did you notice, Sir, how this side of the House and not that side of the House spoke perfectly naturally and normally of &#x201C;our people&#x201D;, for the mineworkers are and will always remain our people. I want to congratulate the hon. member and I want to thank the other hon. members, such as the hon. member for Virginia, the hon. member for Welkom and the hon. member for Brentwood for their contributions. Now, this is not my opinion only. There are people sitting in the gallery; after all the Press is up there too. Surely these were contributions from people who had made a study of these matters and who live with these people and who above all have an understanding of a knowledge of and sympathy with these people and have a will to help where one wants to alleviate the lot of other people. I want to say thank you very much to them.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, I come now to the hon. member for Rosettenville. He started off by calling this debate a debate in which we have electionitis, but it followed on laughing at the introduction of this motion last week. The United Party made it a laughing matter, but now it is calling this debate &#x201C;electionitis&#x201D;. I may tell the hon. member that the electionitis is not on this side; it is on the other side of the House. I must also tell the hon. member not to be worried; it is only an interim affliction.</p>

<p>The hon. member also raised the very important question of the accident rate and gave wrong figures to the House. The hon. member said that the accident rate had risen in the past few years. That is not true.</p>

<p>*The following is the truth: Despite the fact that the number of workers in our mines increased by 48 000 in one year, from 1969 to 1970, the position is that the death rate for 1969 was 1,18 per thousand and the accident rate was 45,48 per thousand. I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, but this is the figure for 1970. In 1969 it was higher. Then the corresponding figures as far as deaths are concerned were 1,28 and as far as accidents are concerned, 45,62 per thousand.</p>

<p>&#x2020;But I must also point out to the hon. member that he knows that every single accident on a mine is properly investigated and not in my time, and as far as I can remember not before my time, has a finger ever been pointed to the Government for neglecting its duty; not in one single instance that I can remember, at least not in the five years that I have been in this position.</p>

<p>*However, it was not left at that. The hon. member for Von Brandis rose to his feet, and what did he do&#x003F; Now there is only one way in which we can control the health, welfare and accident situation on mines, and that is by means of laws and regulations. What did he do&#x003F; He made scornful remarks about how many laws and regulations there are, and the other hon. members treated it as a laughing matter. I want to tell him that we will make even more laws and even more regulations if that is in the best interests of the mineworkers. [Interjections.] All I want to say about the accident rate and accidents, and particularly the accidents which occurred at the beginning of the year, is that I want to extend my sympathy again to those people who lost loved ones, whether they are White or non-White, and whether they live in this country or beyond our borders. I want to give the assurance that we will go to the greatest lengths in investigating that unfortunate accident to ascertain whether there was any negligence.</p>

<p>I said I welcome this motion of the hon. member for Stilfontein, for just as it is to him and other hon. members on this side of the House, as was shown today, the well-being of the mineworkers is of the utmost importance to the Government and to me. The mining industry, on which almost the entire South African economy was initially built, has become a colossus, as we all know. There is still a tremendous amount which has to be done. However, it is remarkable that in a country which has during the past few decades shown such a phenomenal industrial growth, experts who look ahead still realize, and say so too, that the mining industry will play <span class="col_615-616" refersTo="page_0323"/>an even more important role in our country&#x2019;s economy and the welfare of our people in future. The reason for that is simply that the good Lord has blessed our country with mineral deposits almost unequalled in the world&#x2014;certainly not in Africa. Let me say that the Government is not only in earnest about the purposeful development of the mining industry in South Africa, but regards it as a matter of top priority. Because we must look after the mine-worker, and want to do so in order to achieve this object in the national interests, the Government has always regarded it as its premise that the happiness, the welfare and the prosperity of our mineworkers must come first. I am grateful to be able to say that I myself, as the responsible Minister, find peace of mind in the Government&#x2019;s actions with regard to the mineworkers since 1948. As far as pneumoconiosis legislation is concerned&#x2014;it is a pity the hon. member for Orange Grove is not present here at the moment&#x2014;it has been indicated here that the pneumoconiosis legislation has already been revised twice since 1948. It has been consolidated and improved not only to increase the benefits, but also to improve the basis of compensation. This has also been done to make the measures safeguarding the health of mineworkers more efficient. Hon. members will recall that in 1962 my predecessor, i.e. the present hon. Minister of Finance, gave the assurance that if experience and research necessitated further adjustments, the Government would make such adjustments. Hon. members will also recall that an international conference on pneumoconiosis was held in 1970, with funds made available by the Government. We brought world experts in this field to South Africa at State expense, and this was done on behalf of the mineworkers. Hon. members will also remember &#x2026;</p>

<p>We were not the only contributors to that conference.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I do not say that. I said that we brought them here at our expense, and of course our own peoples&#x2019; contributions are as good or even better, than those of the overseas experts because South Africa has had a wealth of experience in the field of mining. In addition I also want to place on record the fact that, apart from my periodical and regular negotiations with the Mineworkers&#x2019;</p>

<p>Union, discussions with and representations made to me by members of the National Party caucus on behalf of their mineworkers have also contributed to our being in a position to revise and to improve this legislation properly. The stage has now been reached where the legislation must again be revised and adjustments made. As I have already announced, during the previous session, work on the new legislation is in progress. The new legislation is aimed at expanding the scope of the pneumoconiosis legislation and also at taking care of other health problems peculiar to the mining industry. I may just remind hon. members that the Medical Research Council was established a few years ago for the benefit of the mineworkers and research in regard to the occupational diseases of the mining industry. This Council falls under the Department of Health. Then the National Institute for Occupational Diseases, previously the Pneumoconiosis Research Unit, was established&#x2014; all for the benefit not only of the mineworkers but also of all workers in South Africa. The hon. member was quite right in indicating that we have come a long way; first it was chest ailments and then it became pneumoconiosis. I can inform hon. members that this new legislation we are envisaging will not be known as pneumoconiosis legislation, but will be called an Occupational Diseases Bill.</p>

<p>We are satisfied.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall tell the hon. members what the position is: You do the talking, and we do the job. This legislation is already far advanced and extensive discussions have been held with a representative committee of the mine trade unions and with officials of the Chamber of Mines. I may just add that the original idea was that the mine trade unions would submit a Bill to us which met their requirements. <span class="col_617-618" refersTo="page_0324"/>However, they requested that the Department, owing to the experience it has had, should draft such a Bill itself. As first phase, this has been done solely by the Department. Further discussions, in which I shall take the initiative myself, will shortly be held. After that the legislation will be prepared for submission. I may also add that the Cabinet agreed last year that this Bill should be referred to a Select Committee. It seems to me that there has been so much unanimity in these negotiations and that it was unanimity of such a nature that it will probably not be necessary to refer the Bill to a Select Committee; the House will be able to deal with it directly. In respect of this envisaged legislation, the Parliamentary mining group of the National Party serves a very important function. These hon. members of the House of Assembly are people who are in close contact with the mineworkers and their families. During the discussions which the group or individual members have with me from time to time, bottlenecks are brought to my attention. It is my sincere desire to say that these hon. colleagues are of great help. They are of great value to our mineworkers and they deserve the appreciation and sincere gratitude of the mineworkers.</p>

<p>Pneumoconiosis compensation is an occupational liability for the mines. Levies in this regard form a very important factor in production costs. With the considerable increase in production costs, and no increase until recently in the price of gold, and the fact that many mines had to rely solely on the exploitation of low-grade ores, the stage was reached in the early fifties where the mining industry, and particularly the gold-mining industry, could not bear the burden incurred in increasing pneumoconiosis pensions. The Government then had to take one of two decisions, which were either to peg the pneumoconiosis pensions of existing beneficiaries for all time regardless of the increase in the cost of living, or to bear the burden of an increase in existing pensions itself. Hon. members of that side of the House are so eager to know why this motion of thanks has been introduced. The first possibility would have been extremely unfair to the beneficiaries concerned. In the interests of these people the Government decided unhesitatingly, as long ago as 1956, to accept that burden and to db so every time it became possible and desirable to alleviate the lot of pneumoconiosis sufferers and the dependants of deceased beneficiaries. In this way the Government has since 1956 already shouldered a burden of plus-minus R40 million to alleviate and to improve the lot of pneumoconiosis beneficiaries. When the means to that end can be found and when it becomes possible to give further alleviation, the Government will unhesitatingly take upon itself further burdens for this purpose.</p>

<p>As far as these matters are concerned, the mineworkers already know very well that the Government does not make idle promises. In general benefits have, as was said here, been increased by about 220 per cent since 1948. The hon. the Prime Minister said the other day that the rand is now worth 50 cents. Its value has dropped by 50 per cent, but the benefits of these people were increased by 220 per cent. The examples are given here. In the case of a widow the pension has, since 1948, been increased from R13 to R60. Ask any mineworker whether he wants to live in the United Party era or in the National Party era. The maximum pension for a mineworker with a wife and one child was R37,75 when those hon. members were in power. It is now R137. A widow with one dependant child at present receives approximately 57 per cent more in pension than she received five years ago. Hon. members must listen carefully now. A widow with one dependant child now receives 57 per cent more in pension than she received live years ago, when I happened to take over here. In the corresponding period the consumer price index, according to the official figures of the Department of Statistics, increased by only 21,7 per cent. Hon. members who therefore say that we are not keeping pace with the increase in the cost of living, are simply not telling the truth.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Let me mention another point. In these five years improvements were made no less than three times. Let me state candidly that one can never do too much for these people. After all, ones heart goes out to them. But one must cut one&#x2019;s coat according to one&#x2019;s cloth. As the hon. the Prime Minister rightly stated in respect of other pensioners, one can never of course do enough for them. But, believe you me, the National Party has done a great deal for them.</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from><span class="col_619-620" refersTo="page_0325"/>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>But this is not a social pension. You do not seem to understand that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I understand it very well, they are much higher than ordinary civil pensions. The hon. member knows that. Nevertheless I am grateful that circumstances made it possible for us to do so much for our mineworkers in the sphere of benefits and pensions.</p>

<p>The Government&#x2019;s support and concessions to the mineworkers are not restricted to those I have already mentioned, but not one hon. member referred to this. I can take up much of the time of the hon. House on the Government&#x2019;s assistance in other spheres, but I just want to mention a few examples. Hon. members on this side of the House mentioned a few. After it was disclosed to what extent pneumoconiosis pensioners are compelled to spend their pensions on medical fees and essential medicines I consented in my capacity as Minister of Health to district surgeons providing medical services and essential medicines free of charge to needy pneumoconiosis pensioners. The necessary arrangements have been finalized and the scheme ought to be in full swing soon. Mineworkers who undergo periodical examinations for the issuing of certificates of fitness and the pneumoconiosis sufferers attending a chest clinic for treatment, receive free transportation by train or the approved mile allowance. I may mention that the mile allowance has been increased from 2&#x00BD; cents per mile to 5 cents per mile.</p>

<p>Because the cessation of mining activities for a single day means a loss to the country of several million rands, our mineworkers corps falls under that group of people who arc not entitled to all the public holidays enjoyed by the rest of the population. In this respect as well the Government tried last year, as was mentioned, to alleviate the position for the mineworker a little by introducing a statutory amendment which will in future allow mine workers to enjoy every Republic Day as a day of rest, if they so prefer.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it was mentioned here, and it is true, that there is a shortage of White mineworkers today, but it is also true that our workers on the mines are able to earn proper wages. It must be realised that, if it were not for the Government&#x2019;s attitude in regard to the mining industry, the picture presented today would have been an entirely different one. I want hon. members to listen to me. In this regard I want to mention that in the case of 20 marginal gold-mines, subsidies from the State make it possible for them to exploit low-grade ore. Through this assistance the early or immediate closing down of these mines was prevented, and our gold yield increased. During the three year period ending 31st March, 1971, R37 500 000 was spent on subsidies of this kind. For the financial year which is now coming to a close, and for the next financial year, this expenditure will amount to an additional plus-minus R30 million. This is a total of R61 500 000. If these mines had to close down, approximately 10 000 Whites&#x2014;our own flesh and blood&#x2014; and 125 000 non-Whites would have to seek work elsewhere. I may just mention in passing that during this period the gold production of these mines in one year amounted to R115 million. The Government&#x2019;s assistance to these mines was given in the firm belief that there would eventually be an increase in the gold price. That was our point of departure. Recent developments in regard to the gold price have shown that the decision to assist the mines to remain in operation, was a very wise decision on the part of the Government.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Was the figure you mentioned that for the official price of gold or for gold sold on the free market&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, this was still the official price before the free market price was increased. That was a long time ago. Not only were the large number of workers at these mines able to keep their work where they had established themselves, but our country will now benefit from the higher price which will be paid for gold which is being recovered at the mines in question. It will now be possible to mine at a profit ore which until recently was unprofitable. This will extend the life of these mines and may perhaps create more avenues of employment for our people. The improved gold price inevitably includes benefits for our workers on the mines, but I do not want to make any comment on that, and least of all about the five-day week. The hon. member did not know what he was talking about. The Mineworkers&#x2019; Union are very jealous of their right to negotiate in regard to their remuneration and also in regard to the <span class="col_621-622" refersTo="page_0326"/>five-day working week. These discussions are in progress and I am certainly not going to interfere in any way. That is not the task of the Government or of the Minister of Mines.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But I have already mentioned that. That hon. member also said that one does not know whether unemployment is just around the corner, the point is, however, that these people are working in the mines at present and that that mine can continue to operate. In regard to the gold question, I should like, for the record, to thank the hon. the Minister of Finance; for the untiring and competent way in which he has over a long period worked for a higher gold price. His single-handed attempts definitely made an impression and roused world-wide respect for his person and also for our country. I think we are very fortunate in having had two things in South Africa during this time. On the one hand we are fortunate in having had such a person, who compelled the respect of the entire monetary world, to spear&#x002D;point our efforts, and on the other hand we are fortunate that we have mineworkers who, in spite of diminishing numbers, have maintained production to such an extent that the mines did not go to rack and ruin. The Government has also made considerable financial assistance available for pumping out water. This was done to keep the mines going, this is what the Government is doing to existing avenues of employment for the mineworkers. For the present financial year the amount is approximately R1,6 million, and the Government is at present giving assistance to six major gold-mines which have to cope with a great volume of subterranean water flowing in from adjoining mines. Without this assistance the mines in question would have been compelled to close down prematurely, and the workers would have had to find another means of subsistence. After the recent copious rains the position at two of the mines, i.e. Sallies and Vlakfontein on the East Rand, deteriorated to such an extent that operations at these two mines came to a halt and they were faced with the possibility of having to close-down completely. But the mine-owners, in consultation with my Department of Mines, are making every effort to save these mines, if such a step appears to be justified from an economic point of view. But if the closing down of these mines at this stage appears to be inevitable, for in the normal course of events their ore reserves would have been depleted at the end of the year or later, the Government will, as it has already done to good effect in other cases, make every effort to find other means of subsistence for the workers in question. If it is deemed to be in the interests of our country and our mineworkers the mines are kept going, not only by means of subsidies, but in other ways as well. In this way, for example, a loan of R3,3 million, which will extend over a period of a few years, has been made to an East Rand gold-mine&#x2014;unfortunately I cannot, for very good reasons, mention its name &#x2014;in order to enable the undertaking to do certain re-opening work by means of which the life of the mine ought to be extended considerably. The more than 1 000 Whites and several thousand non-White employees at that specific mine, and for the surrounding townships, it means a great deal that steps have been taken to prevent the early closing of this mine. Where all the paying ore reserves in a mine has been depleted or where there is an inadequate demand for the product of the mine, it is unfortunately unavoidable that operations at such a mine have to be terminated or restricted. I can continue in this vein, but I think I have said enough to indicate that the Government is doing its duty and much more than its duty in regard to the mineworkers. I want to associate myself with the hon. member for Stilfontein and express my appreciation for the responsible and proper conduct of the mineworkers in South Africa over <span class="col_623-624" refersTo="page_0327"/>the years. There is no better team to pull together than the mineworkers and the National Party.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, at this late hour of the debate I should just like to make a few remarks by way of summary. I must tell you that there were high-water and low-water marks in this debate. The hon. member for Orange Grove reached a low-water mark when he referred to the sinkholes. He referred to the suffering and the accidents caused as a result of the sinkholes and ascribed the situation to the Government supposedly having done nothing in this regard. I must draw the attention of the hon. House to the fact that these towns on the West Rand which are being afflicted by sinkholes were all established in the time of U.P. r&#x00E9;gime; they were established to benefit certain organisations financially, without any consideration for the safety of the people who would subsequently come to live there. I think it is high time this side of the House took the hon. member for Orange Grove to task and told him to stop making remarks about the so-called inability of the National Party Government to deal with this matter, the Government is left holding the baby, because the United Party established the towns there and caused people to incur certain financial obligations and make investments in these towns. Now the National Party Government has to take the necessary steps to try to safeguard the investments made there&#x2014;by poor people. I can only say here that the Department of Mines is doing and will do everything in its power to cope with this problem.</p>

<p>There is another matter in regard to which there appears to be a major difference of opinion on that side of the House, i.e. the safety in our mines. The hon. member for Rosettenville levelled accusations at the Government in regard to the unsafeness of some mines and all the accidents caused as a result of that. The hon. member for Von Brandis remarked that it was the mine-owners who took the necessary steps, and that it is they who should be praised for the work which is being done to ensure the safety of the mines. On the one hand there is the standpoint that the safety of the mines is the responsibility of the Government, and on the other hand, hon. members say in the same breath that it is the responsibility of the mine-owners. This puts me in mind of the difference of opinion in that Party in regard to their non-White policy. It seems as if they have an interim policy in regard to mining matters, like the interim policy they have in regard to non-White affairs.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to the high-water mark of the National Party r&#x00E9;gime. I am thinking specifically now of exports in our metal and mineral industries. There were low-water marks as well in the history of our exports. I am referring here to the mineral exports because the production of minerals creates avenues of employment for our mineworkers. It gives them more freedom of movement. If they are not satisfied with an employer, they can work for someone else; it gives them a great deal of leeway. I must refer here to the development in the base metal industry which has taken place since the National Party came into power in 1948. I want to compare the high-water mark here with the low-water marks which most certainly occurred in the period when the United Party was in power, i.e. between 1933 and 1948.</p>
