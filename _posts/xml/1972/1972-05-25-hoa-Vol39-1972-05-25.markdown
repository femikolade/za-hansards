<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, although we were opposed to and divided on clause 1 of this Bill, we as a party support the Third Reading, because this measure will improve the situation which exists today. The overall effect of this Bill will certainly be to bring about an improvement, and we welcome particularly the provisions of clause 10, which remove what has been an unfortunate festering sore which, I believe, has not been to the credit of our country and in the interests of the image of the Force; I refer here to the continuous repetition of sentences upon people who, whether misguided or not, are doing what they believe to be right Therefore we will not oppose the Third Reading of this Bill as it stands. Our view remains unchanged. I believe that without harm to the Defence Force and without harm to the security of the country, we could adopt a more understanding attitude towards those whose religious views differ perhaps from the views of the majority of us. Here I exclude, as I excluded at other stages, those who are being totally unreasonable in their approach to the question of national service. I refer to those who have views which they hold strongly and whom we could meet without harm to the Defence Force. Notwithstanding <span class="col_8063-8064" refersTo="page_0986"/>our failure to achieve what we aimed at in this regard, we support this measure as such.</p>

<p>*I believe this Bill to be an improvement which will be welcomed, apart from the other technical provisions effecting an improvement. In passing, I may just say that I hope the recommendation which was unofficially made to Customs and Excise, will also enjoy the support of the Minister, possibly in another capacity than the one here in this House. The Minister may possibly be aware of the fact that we as private members made certain representations to the Minister of Finance in regard to the question of customs and excise dealt with in this Bill, in so far as it relates to the men serving on the border. We believe that those men are fighting in the interests of our country. They risk their lives; they live under very difficult circumstances, and, notwithstanding the provisions of the Bill which is going through now, I hope that through the negotiations which have been initiated and with the support of the hon. the Minister of Defence, relief will be given in regard to customs and excise on our borders. With these few words I am pleased to give our support to the Third Reading of this Bill.</p>

<p>Sir, there is no need to make a long speech. I just want to thank the hon. member for the support he has given the Bill on behalf of the official Opposition.

<p>No, it is no use bringing pressure to bear on the Minister of Finance; one has to reason with him. In the second place, I just want to tell the hon. member this: We differ on one single minor point in the matter of dealing with national servicemen, but if the hon. member occupied this responsible position on this Side, I believe he would have adopted the same standpoint I did. We must not give people the opportunity of making an onslaught on a principle as long as this Parliament stands by that principle. If Parliament wants to change the principle, then I am in its hands, but as long as Parliament itself stands by the principle of compulsory military service, it is my task, if I want to do my job, to maintain that principle. I think that is the difference between us.</p>

<heading>CONTROL OF THE MEAT TRADEIN SOUTH-WEST AFRICAAMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>This Bill deals with the funds of the Meat Trade Control Board of South-West Africa which was established in terms of Ordinance 20 of 1962 as a body of control for the Territory&#x2019;s meat industry.</p>

<p>At present the Ordinance provides that the Administrator (now the Minister) may make regulations prescribing the way in which the moneys of the board are to be utilized. Such regulations exist at present, but on the basis of legal advice which has been obtained, these regulations are not adequate for the purposes of the board. For this reason it is suggested that the Ordinance, in so far as its provisions relating to funds are concerned, should rather be brought into line with the system followed by the boards of control of the Republic under the Marketing Act.</p>

<p>Consequently provision is being made for the establishment of a general fund, a reserve fund and a special fund, which will be controlled by the board. The usual administrative expenses of the board will be paid from the general fund, whereas expenditure from the other funds will be subject to the approval of the Minister.</p>

<p>The moneys in the special fund are set aside for purposes directly connected with abattoirs in the Territory, and represent that part of the board&#x2019;s levy which previously accrued to the Farming Interests Fund. Therefore the establishment of the special fund does not involve any additional burden for the producers.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, this side of the House is prepared to support this legislation. It is a very short piece of legislation. Its object is to bring the position in respect of meat in South-West Africa into line with the position in the Republic, but I should like to know from the hon. the Minister what the reason is for bringing in section 6 (B) (2), which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The board may with the approval of the Minister utilize money in the special fund for any purpose connected with any abattoir in the Territory or the management or conduct of any such abattoir.</block>

<p>Why is this clause brought in? As far as I know, we do not have a similar regulation in the Republic. If the hon. the Minister is able to give us an explanation in this regard, we are prepared to support the Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>As regards the funds of South-West Africa, there was a special levy for the building of an abattoir in the case of foot-and-mouth disease, and also for having a factory at the Windhoek abattoir. This is only to provide for special cases which are not as essential in the Republic. In South-West Africa the farmers themselves suggested years ago that there should be a special fund for the purpose of building an abattoir so that meat which could not leave the Territory because of foot- and-mouth disease could be processed in a factory and subsequently exported. That section is being brought in simply to provide that the fund may be utilized for this purpose.</p>

<p><b>WINE AND SPIRIT CONTROL AMENDMENT BILL</b></p>

<p>(Second Reading)</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The amendments contained in this Bill provide, <i>inter alia,</i> for metrication in the wine industry at producers&#x2019; level. Terms such as proof strength, leaguer, ton, etc., are being metricated. For example, under the proposed terms, the price of wine will be announced <span class="col_8067-8068" refersTo="page_0988"/>per hectolitre instead of per leaguer.</p>

<p>Therefore the term hectolitre (26,4 gallons) is being substituted for the term leaguer (127 gallons) so as to bring this into line with other countries who have metricated.</p>

<p>The conversion factor of one metric ton of grapes at 20 degrees Balling, being equal to 6,364 hectolitre at 20 per cent strength, is being retained as this affects the effective quantity of wine which the producer may produce under his quota. For metrication purposes the strength of brandy is also being increased from 74,2 per cent to 75 per cent according to volume.</p>

<p>The present set-up is that one fully paidup share of R1 is allocated to each member of the K.W.V. on his becoming a member. When he stops farming or dies, his shareholding is cancelled and paid out. Consequently the position will arise in due course that each member will hold only one K.W.V. share. Based on the present membership and the anticipated entry of new members, this means that the share capital of the K.W.V. is likely to decrease to below R10 000. When the assets and the scope of the functions of the K.W.V. are taken into account, it is in the interests of both the organization and its members for its members to obtain a larger shareholding. This is rendered possible by the issue of bonus shares. Consequently it is the intention to issue such shares in more favourable years, and part of the financial surplus will be utilized for this purpose. The board of directors of the K.W.V. is under no obligation to allocate bonus shares each year. Repayment of bonus shares will also take place only in the event of farming operations being discontinued or in the event of the member&#x2019;s death.</p>

<p>Since non-members also make a contribution to the surplus declared, it is being proposed that any cash bonus declared be paid to non-members as well in proportion to their contributions. The same position will apply in respect of that part of the financial surplus which may be converted into bonus shares in any year. Bonus shares can be issued only to members of the K.W.V. and consequently amounts will be transferred to a special account in the case of non-members until such time as such non-members are entitled to have it paid out to them.</p>

<p>In addition provision is also being made for certain provisions of Chapter II of the principal Act to be suspended. In this regard it may be mentioned that wine farmers and co-operative societies experience problems from time to time with the sale of their liquor to licensed retailers.</p>

<p>At present members have to enter into contracts, with the approval of the K.W.V., with licenced retailers in order to sell their liquor directly to them. Payment must be effected through the agency of the K.W.V. However, the retailers are not willing to enter into contracts with producers. They want to order the wine as required by case and pay directly for it instead of paying to the K.W.V. In terms of the proposed amendment it will be possible to eliminate the present cumbersome sales method. The K.W.V. will in any event still retain sufficient control over such transactions.</p>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The existing surveyor-generals offices were established in terms of the Land Survey Act, 1927, which Act is also applicable to South-West Africa. The four provincial offices have their headquarters in their respective capitals, and those of South-West Africa have theirs in Windhoek. As the Act reads at present, the powers and duties in respect of the prescribed survey functions are vested in the surveyor-general of each province or territory. The Act also provides for a Director of Trigonometrical Survey and lays down his functions. The headquarters of the latter are situated in Cape Town.</p>

<p>Each of the above-mentioned six offices is in fact an autonomous organization, and taken together they form the survey branch which, for ministerial and secretarial purposes, falls under the Department <span class="col_8069-8070" refersTo="page_0989"/>of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure. However, there is no substantive post for handling the purely administrative task in so far as planning, organization, co-ordination and control of the six organizational components as a whole are concerned. The Act does make provision for a survey board for the promotion and the efficient performance of the functions of the survey branch. Another provision contains the appointment of an officer to be styled the Director-General of Surveys, to whom the functions of the board may be assigned. The said officer shall be either a Surveyor-General or the Director of the Trigonometrical Survey or any other land surveyor. The Surveyor-General of the Transvaal is the present Director-General of Surveys and therefore holds a double position.</p>

<p>The rapid development of our country in various spheres is making increasingly greater demands on the survey offices. On the other hand, an increasingly greater shortage of the specific or specialized professional and technical manpower in the survey offices is being experienced. In order to cope with this situation, it is essential to give consideration to taking measures in order to ensure increased efficiency in the performance of the work, to eliminate overlapping services and to bring about more effective utilization of available manpower.</p>

<p>The Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure, assisted by the Public Service Commission, investigated the matter and found that the existing problems could be eased to a large extent by consolidating the functions of the Surveyor-General&#x2019;s offices and those of the office of the Director of the Trigonometrical Survey and establishing a central governing body so as to ensure purposeful, integrated services by this branch. In order to give effect to this, an amendment of the Land Survey Act is necessary.</p>

<p>The necessary amendments are contained in the Bill before the House at the moment. In the first place, provision is made for an administrative post for survey functions as a whole. The appointment of the officer concerned, who has to be a land surveyor and will also be known as the Director-General of Surveys, will be made subject to the provisions of the laws governing the Public Service. Furthermore, this provision has the effect that the present post of Director of the</p>

<p>Trigonometrical Survey will be abolished, a post which will also be incorporated with the overall administrative organization. This will ensure that the loose co-operation of the present set-up will come to an end and that a well co-ordinated service will be established. The new organization will have its headquarters in Cape Town, a step through which any appreciable transfer of staff will be obviated.</p>

<p>In the second place, the proposed consolidation of functions and establishment of a central governing body has had the effect that the first ten sections of the principal Act. which deals with the administration of the survey offices, had to be rewritten. Apart from defining of the powers and duties of the holder of the administrative post, it regulates the establishment of surveyor-general&#x2019;s offices for regions defined by the Minister of Agriculture, the appointment, powers and duties of the surveyors-general and the establishment of the Survey Regulations Board. In fact, this is largely a repetition of the existing provisions, with a few additions.</p>

<p>Recognition is granted to the existing surveyor-general&#x2019;s offices. Although the new provisions now provide for the establishment of offices on a regional basis, additional offices are not envisaged in the foreseeable future. What is in fact envisaged, is standing statutory authority should it become necessary in the future to establish additional surveyor-general&#x2019;s offices or even to consolidate existing offices.</p>

<p>The fact that the Survey Board no longer exists and that the designation &#x201C;Director of the Trigonometrical Survey&#x201D; will disappear, has also given rise to the consequential amendment of certain provisions of the Deeds Registries Act, the Land Surveyors&#x2019; Registration Act, and the Universities Act with reference to the constitution of the Deeds Registries Regulation Board and the Board for the Recognition of Land Surveyors* Examinations, respectively.</p>

<p>Apart from the amendments with reference to the administration of the survey offices, section 30 of the principal Act is being amended with reference to the requirements which are to be complied with before a survey-general may alter or cancel a general plan in respect of any proclaimed township. A judgment given by the Appeal Court in 1968 showed very clearly that an amendment of the existing <span class="col_8071-8072" refersTo="page_0990"/>provision was necessary so as to simplify the matter. As the provision reads at present and in view of the judgment given by the Appeal Court, one single owner, lessee or mortgagee of an erf in a township may obstruct any change in lay-out, alteration, and so forth, by withholding his consent without furnishing any reasons. This means that a surveyor-general may only give effect to a request for alteration when either a court order has been lodged or all erf owners, lessees and mortgagees have granted their consent. Furthermore, in terms of the said Appeal Court judgment, the court will only be able to accommodate an applicant in a case where it is an impossible task to obtain all the signatures and to go into the merits of an objection.</p>

<p>As a result of representations made by the South African Law Society and talks held with the surveyors-general, it has been decided, in consultation with the provinces, to amend section 30 and to alter the various Provincial Ordinances accordingly so as to make provision for an improvement in control. The proposed amendment of section 30 has the effect that the surveyors-general and the Registrars of Deeds will be able to give effect to decisions concerning alterations to plans, which the Administrator will approve after instituting a full investigation and giving notice to erf owners and other interested parties.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House welcome this measure. There are certain items in the different clauses we should like to discuss with the hon. the Minister during the Committee Stage, but as far as we see this is an administrative measure which brings about reorganization within the department: for instance, it brings in trigoonometrical survey under the Director-General of Survey. What is also interesting is that it establishes regions under a surveyor-general in the place of the provinces as has been hitherto the case. We think this is a step forward and therefore we oh this side of the House support the measure.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the few minutes at my disposal before the adjournment last night, I put a number of questions to the hon. member for Langlaagte arising from the meeting that he and members of his Bantu Affairs Committee had with people in King William&#x2019;s Town in January this year. Hon. members will recall that this entire interlude was hallmarked by the fact that he was not prepared to answer certain very elementary questions. I do not intend to dwell on this, but I just want to sum up very briefly by saying that the representatives whom he had met at this meeting were allowed to put their cases even though they had precious little time to prepare themselves. I believe they were allowed to ask two questions, but any suggestion from that side of the House that there was discussion or dialogue is untrue.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>Or discussion then, discussion between members of the commission and the people whom they were meeting. I think we can leave it there. Judging by his silence I should think that by this stage he is probably thoroughly ashamed of the proceedings which took place in King William&#x2019;s Town and of his part in it. I take it that the hon. member for Wolmaransstad will be ashamed too, and the same applies to the hon. member for Aliwal. Earlier in this debate the hon. members for Wolmaransstad and Langlaagte made great play of the attitude taken up by Gen. Hertzog when the 1936 legislation, the Native Trust and Land Act, was debated in this House. They, in line with other hon. members on that side of the House, have tried to create the impression that the terms of this legislation are something to which the Nationalist Party has felt itself bound ever since that legislation was passed. If there are any hon. members who dispute what I am saying, perhaps they would indicate it. But this is hot so. Those who have read the Hansard of that debate, through all its stages, must be well aware of the fact that the official stand taken by the Nationalist Party when <span class="col_8073-8074" refersTo="page_0991"/>this legislation was before the House, was the exact opposite of what we heard from these hon. members yesterday. If they had read Hansard carefully&#x2014;the hon. member for Langlaagte gave out that he had&#x2014;they would have seen that Mr. J. G. Strydom outlined the attitude of the Nationalist Party in the clearest terms when the Bill passed its Third Reading stage on 1st June, 1936. Mr. Strydom had made it clear that the official attitude of the Nationalist Party was that the Government should not indulge in the large-scale purchase of released land. [Interjections.] That hon. member might dispute what I am saying, but I am afraid that if he does, he just does not know what he is talking about. I shall show him in a few moments. Mr. Strydom &#x2014;I am afraid I must spell this out in reply to that&#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oliver">

<from><person refersTo="hansard_za">D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>I am not prepared to answer questions at the moment. Let the hon. member listen to me. Mr. Strydom, on behalf of the Nationalist Party, took the view that the released areas were in fact areas that were to be bought by the Natives, as they called them then, or the Native tribes. The only way in which he saw the Government buying land in released areas was when purchase of areas by Natives&#x2014;Bantu we call them now&#x2014; had been of such a nature that White farmlands were surrounded and the White farm-owner was then prepared to sell. Mr. Strydom put the position very clearly in the Third Reading debate. He said (Hansard, Vol. 27, Col. 4733)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is the policy of the Government which it has now announced, and in view of that I want to tell the Minister that we shall persistently oppose that idea of spending an enormous amount for the purchase of land for Natives, and if the Government after this Bill has been passed, comes to this House for us to vote this enormous amount, then we are going to fight that proposal tooth and nail, because it is conflicting with the idea that the Nationalist Party had in 1927, and with the whole idea that the Select Committee had until the other day.</block>

<p>I do not want to spend too much time on this, but I want to say that Mr. Strydom made the position of the Nationalist Party perfectly clear.</p>

Mr. Strydom made it perfectly clear that the Nationalist Party&#x2014;and this was to be the policy in the future&#x2014;would oppose precisely this type of purchase that has been recommended to this House now. I am not making any judgment on this situation; I just want to tell the hon. member for Langlaagte that his party has in fact done a complete about-face in its attitude. I hope that this is the last that we will hear of their pious protestations that they all along have felt themselves bound by the 1936 legislation. There is one other thing I want to mention. While my colleague, the hon. member for East London North, was speaking last night, he made the point that there was too much doubt among the people of the Ciskei area about what was going to happen in the Eastern Cape. The hon. member for Rustenburg quite truculently demanded of him: &#x201C;Whose fault is that?&#x201D;, suggesting that the fault might lie on our side. I am glad that the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration is here, because if we are going to talk about uncertainty, I want to address some words particularly to him. I trust that he is going to enter this debate and will reply to some of these things. Quite some time ago undertakings were given to farmers&#x2019; associations in this area, and I think that the hon. the Deputy Minister is in fact aware of them. For example, we have it on record that the then Deputy Minister of Bantu Development gave certain undertakings to the East London Western Districts Farmers&#x2019; Association. One of these undertakings was that the East London/King William&#x2019;s Town boundary would not be encroached upon in the purchase of new land. I think the hon. the Deputy Minister is aware of this undertaking, because I think he saw the correspondence relating to it.</p>

<p>As we know, the proposals before the House are in direct conflict with the undertaking that was given and I want to ask that hon. Deputy Minister whether he is now repudiating, or going back on, the promise that was given to this farmers&#x2019; association. Does he feel himself not bound <span class="col_8075-8076" refersTo="page_0992"/>by his predecessor? This is no light matter. This involves the future well-being of farmers in that area. I hope he will tell us what his attitude is towards this undertaking that was given. In fact, it was given on two occasions: It was given in 1963 and again in 1965. Even the proposals before us must inevitably lead to the sort of uncertainty mentioned by my colleague, the hon. member for East London North. We have the commission making a recommendation that the village of Hamburg and certain areas around Hamburg should not be included in the released area. This is also the recommendation before this House. Does it give the local people any sense of security when in the next breath we hear from the Government that, in fact, at some later stage, consideration is going to be given to introducing the necessary legislation in terms of which the property concerned may, by a process of zoning for Bantu occupation, be added to the released area? We have one set of proposals before us, and immediately they are placed before us, we are given a warning from that side of the House that the whole situation is going to be turned upside down at some time in the future. I would ask the hon. member for Rustenburg the very question he addressed to my colleague: &#x201C;Whose fault is it?&#x201D; It is the fault of this Government, and quite clearly so. Now, Sir, the hon. member for Wolmaransstad&#x2014;I am sorry he is not here at the moment&#x2014;made great play of some points that were put forward from this side of the House last night. The one which seemed to concern him particularly, was our assertion that we were prepared to purchase land close to growth areas for occupation by Bantu. Well, I would ask that hon. member&#x2014;I hope his colleague behind him will pass on the question to him&#x2014;whether this is not precisely what his Government has done in the same area. He made great play of this point. He seems to think it was something significant. But I would ask him: What did his Government do in relation to Mdantsane, the Bantu township outside East London? There, as we all know, the position was that the Bantu people lived in several areas&#x2014;&#x201C;locations&#x201D; they used to call them in those days&#x2014;on the fringes of East London, for example East Bank location and Durban Village. This Government then bought land further out of town to establish a township. In fact, this is growing towards a small city in its own right. This land was never Bantu land in the past. How can the hon. member for Wolmaransstad ever suggest that it was? It was White farmland. It was bought to build the modem equivalent of what we used to call locations, just about twelve miles out of town. To make it look like a homeland, his Government bought a corridor of land through to the nearest Bantu area. In Mdantsane they offered the people freehold title if they wanted it. It was placed next to a growth area. I fail to see why, if that is in accordance with Government policy, they should become so terribly excited if we on this side of the House now suggest that it would be more equitable for us to see to it that Bantu are situated whenever possible close to their homelands, but also that they have a chance of sharing in the wealth of the growth points in future. The only difference from what used to be, is that while in the olden days after work a Native went home to his location, now it seems a Bantu goes home to his homeland. It is purely words. If that Government can do it, I do not see why they should be so excited about the prospect of the United Party doing the same, but doing it somewhat better.</p>

<p>One of the other questions that seems to have taxed the minds of the hon. gentlemen opposite, has been the question of the 1936 land quotas. We have been asked, in relation to these specific proposals before us, what our attitude is. I want to say here and now that it is not the view of the United Party that land must be bought willynilly merely for the sake of consolidation or of meeting the quota. That is not our policy at all. Our attitude is that we are living in a modem society, a society that has changed a lot since 1936, although we still say that we intend to adhere to the spirit of the 1936 legislation. 1972 is a long way from 1936, and we have to look to the future of our country and not to the past. Our attitude is that we are totally opposed to indiscriminate buying or presently productive land and seeing it become unproductive. We in this country believe that we cannot afford this type of luxury. That is why we feel that in the interest of fairness to everybody it is our duty&#x2014;and I suggest that it is the duty of every member of this House&#x2014;to look at the entire situation and to try to determine how best we can arrive at an equitable solution for everybody. This equitable solution must have a direct relation to the facts of the situation. And I think one of the facts of our modern-day situation is that we are becoming more <span class="col_8077-8078" refersTo="page_0993"/>and more dependent on industrialization for our workers. More and more of our people of all races are becoming dependent on industrialization. To suggest that we should try to promote the growth of squatters or unproductive peasants on land, is entirely wrong, both to South Africa as a whole and to the Bantu people who would be so condemned.

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. DE V. MORRISON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have no intention whatsoever, nor the inclination, to pass any comments on the first part of the speech made by the hon. member for Kensington last night. To use a phrase often used by his journalistic pals of the <i>Sunday Times,</i> one&#x2019;s mind boggles at his sheer audacity in relating what was supposed to have taken place at a meeting which he never even attended. He had the audacity to ask the hon. member for Langlaagte several questions. He had no right to ask those questions because he was not present at that meeting. His version was a second-hand and distorted version of what happened there. I would advise this hon. member, though, to endeavour to rise above, and to divorce himself from the standards and the methods employed by him whilst he was a journalist of the <i>Sunday Times.</i></p>

<p>*Mr. Speaker, I shall deal with other parts of his speech as I proceed with my argument. We are really having a remarkable performance here by the Opposition. The Opposition is constantly propagating the policy of White leadership. Let us accept that they are honest in their motives as far as White leadership is concerned. One of the cardinal elements of leadership is integrity and honouring one&#x2019;s word. One must honour one&#x2019;s word not only in respect of the Whites, but also in respect of the Black man in South Africa. In 1936&#x2014;whether the Opposition wants to argue about it or not&#x2014;the White man gave his word of honour to the Black man that 7&#x00BC; million morgen of land in this country would be set aside for his eventual occupation. For the sake of the record I want to repeat what the hon. member for Langlaagte said yesterday evening. He quoted the words of Gen. Hertzog, which the latter phrased very clearly as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government wish once more to give the assurance that it is their earnest desire to see that the obligations towards the Natives of the Union arising out of this Bill &#x2026; shall be faithfully carried out</block>

<p>Sir, the then Prime Minister, Gen. Hertzog, regarded this assurance as so important that later in his speech he put the position as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I hope, Mr. Speaker, in view of the fact that this question was put by the hon. member for Zululand, that I may be allowed to repeat this statement in English.</block>

<p>He wanted no misunderstanding about it. He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I say again that from this statement it is clear that the Government is anxious that the land which is to be given out or allotted under this Bill as provisionally intended for natives, will be placed at the disposal of the natives as soon as possible.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington tried to create the impression this afternoon that the National Party of the time was opposed to the principles of this Bill. The National Party of the time was not opposed to the principle. They were opposed to the method. Unfortunately the hon. member did not read the debates. The official Opposition of the time was opposed to the announcement made by the Minister of Native Affairs that this money was to be appropriated within five years. An amount of &#x00A3;10 million to &#x00A3;12 million was mentioned. The Opposition of the time felt that there had been too much haste and that proper investigations had not been made. They were not opposed to the principle involved, as was proved yesterday afternoon. We accept that this promise was made by a White Government. It does not matter to me which Government did so. The fact of the matter is that this assurance was given by a White government and that a solemn undertaking was given to the Bantu peoples. This afternoon the United Party had the opportunity of proving their honesty and integrity. They are the people who want to assume leadership over the Whites as well as the non-Whites. Here they now have the opportunity of proving their integrity. However, at the first opportunity they have to prove it, they fail miserably in their attempt. But this is not all. Apart from the fact that there is a serious contradiction <span class="col_8079-8080" refersTo="page_0994"/>between the statement of the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town and that of the hon. member for Transkei, we had to hear from the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town that &#x201C;we shall purchase much more land than this, but we shall purchase it where it is in the interest of the economy of South Africa, where it is in the interests of Whites, Coloureds and Blacks. We shall have to provide the Natives with land next to the cities.&#x201D; Sir, can you imagine a situation where they want to make available to the Bantu more than 7 million morgen of land around Cape Town, Johannesburg, Vereeniging and Port Elizabeth. In the legislation of 1936, certain guarantees are also given to the White man, namely that the 7&#x00BC; million morgen which will be allocated to the Bantu, will be taken from areas which had been traditionally occupied by the Bantu. But now the United Party, through the mouth of the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town, says that it wants to give the Natives proprietary rights around our White cities, more land than they have at their disposal at present. They are not even able to keep their word of honour to the Whites. Where then does this story of White leadership come in?</p>

<p>I want to repeat something here this afternoon which I have already said in the past. The policy of the United Party as it is unfolding in this debate, is inevitably heading for a racial conflict in this country. That will be the position if they adopt this attitude to the promise which the White man made to the Black man. The Opposition is aware that the Black people are continually agitating for more land. To them it is a basic need for their survival in South Africa. Every so often the hon. member for Transkei levels the accusation in this House that, as a result of the policy of this Government, Chief Minister Matanzima of the Transkei&#x201D; is demanding more and more land. Sir, here where we not only want to comply with these demands, but have to comply with them, the Opposition is leaving the White man of South Africa in the lurch disgracefully. The hon. the Prime Minister has said he considers himself bound by the provisions of the 1936 legislation and that the Black people can make demands until they became white in the face, but that they will not get more than that land, and that we are adhering to that promise of 1936. Sir, what would the position be if, on top of everything, we refuse to allocate that land to the Black people? No, I think the Opposition has proved unmistakably that it is most definitely not to be entrusted with the future of this country. They have revealed it in this debate this afternoon.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to make a few comments in regard to the meeting held in King William&#x2019;s Town on 6th January. My constituency is also affected by the proposals considered in King William&#x2019;s Town by the Bantu Affairs Commission. I attended a meeting there on 6th January, but I doubt very strongly whether the meeting I attended was the same one attended by three hon. members of the Opposition. If I listen to their account of what took place there, it is definitely not in line with the facts as I found them at the meeting I attended. Sir, I have only the highest regard for the way in which the chairman of the commission and his fellow-commissioners acted in King William&#x2019;s Town on that day. It was mentioned here yesterday evening and it is a fact that that meeting was predominantly very antagonistic to the proposals which this commission had to consider, but in spite of great provocation, the commission carried out its work there with great self-control and with a fine appreciation of the situation there. Sir, let us see precisely what the terms of reference of that commission were. The terms of reference of the commission were to gather evidence and to hear people&#x2019;s objections in regard to the way in which certain proposals which had been made were to be implemented. They were not sent there to purchase land; they were not sent there to negotiate with the people. It was explained to the meeting that the department proposed that these lands should be bought by the Bantu Trust, and the terms of reference of the commission were to go and test the views of the inhabitants and to explain this matter to them. The commission fulfilled that function to the letter. Members of the Opposition were also present at that meeting, and their account of what took place there is a damning judgment on themselves if it should be true. Three members of the Opposition were present there on that day, namely the hon. member for Transkei, the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town and the hon. member for East London North.</p>

<p>The impression is being created by the members of the Opposition who were there, that everyone who attended that meeting was opposed to these proposals. The hon. member for East London North alleged here that &#x201C;they did not only ignore the wishes of the farmer in the Indwe district, but what they have in fact done at Whittlesea, where there is a Black spot, is that they have made it larger now than it was before&#x201D;. Let us examine this allegation of the Black spot at Indwe. Why did the hon. member not rise and inform us of the true facts? The facts of the situation are that people rose and said they would like to sell the area known as Guba to the Bantu Trust. Why did the hon. member not add to that that the farmers&#x2019; association of Indwe was opposed to that proposal? Surely he omitted that intentionally.</p>

<p>Yes, the school board of Indwe and the church of Indwe objected to the purchase of that area. But for the sake of convenience, that is suppressed. Why do the hon. members not say either that what also happened there, was that farmers rose and offered their land to the State, in some cases more than what the State had initially requested? No, I say that the account of what happened at King William&#x2019;s Town on 6th January, 1972, as interpreted by the Opposition, is in conflict with the facts of what did in fact take place there.</p>

<p>I want to thank this commission for the sympathetic way in which they received all the representations which were made to them. Let us face up to the facts. I know that some of the groups and people who were opposed to Certain proposals at King Wiliam&#x2019;s Town, approached the commission subsequently and implored them to buy their land. I know this, because I had to act as an intermediary for some of these groups. I want to state this for the sake of the record. I am very grateful that as a result of the proposals of this commission Black spots in the Stockenstroom district <span class="col_8083-8084" refersTo="page_0996"/>are now going to be cleared up. Now a source of great annoyance to the residents there is about to be cleared away and on that account I must convey the thanks of people concerned. It is probably not pleasant for the commission or for any government to take land away from people and to make it available to other race groups, but it is also the duty of any government&#x2014;and now, of course, the Opposition does not know what we are talking about&#x2014;to do also unpopular things in the interests of the country. It is the National Party that is able to do those unpopular things because it is able to do so in the interests of White South Africa.</p>

<p>I do not believe the Opposition has the strength to do so. In this matter it has played for popularity. That is the reason why the hon. members attended that meeting without opening their mouths; they first wanted to see in what direction the wind was blowing. On the basis of that they subsequently determined what attitude to adopt in this House. The future of this country is entrusted to this Government because it does not seek to do the popular thing only, but is also able to do what is unpopular as long as it is in the interests of the country.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I hope the hon. member for Cradock will forgive me if I do not follow up on his argument, which had largely to do with a meeting which I did not attend. I shall leave it to other members on the Opposition side to discuss that with him. There are one or two historical facts he mentioned which I shall be discussing in my own speech.</p>

<p>I want to say that I have listened to this debate with great interest. What struck me, listening to the United Party speakers last night, was the fact that they are using very different arguments about the acquisition of land which is to be added to the African areas, from the arguments which they used over past years. I remember very well, back in the 1950s, the hon. member for South Coast and the then hon. member for Drakensberg conducting a very brisk campaign in northern Natal based on the argument that no more land should be acquired for the Bantu areas because the Bantu ruined the land. Then in 1959 it was &#x201C;no more land for the independent Bantustans&#x201D;, which was of course, the famous, or perhaps the infamous, resolution which was moved by the hon. member for South Coast at the Union Congress of the United Party, which in turn caused the split that subsequently led to the formation of the Progressive Party. I may say that also deprived the House of some of the ablest young members which we have ever had. These were young members who were not only brilliant but could also be distinguished by their courtesy and good manners.</p>

<p>In 1964, when the procedure whereby land could be acquired as is being proposed today, was debated, the talk was all about the &#x201C;creeping paralysis&#x201D; caused by the acquisition of land which was adjacent to the existing African territories. In this debate, however, I find that the official Opposition, the United Party, is using completely different arguments. In this debate the chief Opposition speaker, the hon. member for Transkei, talked about the needs of the economy, growth points and efficient food production. He suggested that consolidating the African areas was not necessary and that it ought to be possible to bargain with the Africans to show them that they did not require any more land. The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town talked about land being acquired near the urban industrial areas. I must say that these are much more modern arguments than the previous ones which were used by the United Party. The hon. member for East London North, very properly &#x2014;and I concede right away that it was very right and proper for him&#x2014;spoke about the interests of his constituents who are going to be seriously affected by this motion if adopted.</p>

<p>The Nationalist Party arguments, on the other hand, centred around two points: The first has been the need to fulfil the obligation under the 1936 Land Act, and the second the carrying out of the policy of consolidation of the homelands.</p>

<p>Now I want to put my own point of view. To me the cardinal issue at stake is the acquisition of land towards the fulfilment of the solemn promise that was made in 1936. I believe that it is a scandal that today, 36 years after the 1936 Act was passed, there is still approximately 1,5 million morgen of land left to be acquired by the Bantu Trust in order to fulfil the land quota as set out under the 1936 Act, <span class="col_8085-8086" refersTo="page_0997"/>of an additional 7,25 million morgen which was granted in terms of that Act, of which nearly 500 000 morgen in fact still has to be acquired in the Cape. I think that Gen. Hetzog must be turning in his grave when he realizes that Parliament is still debating, 36 years after he gave that solemn undertaking, the acquisition of land to be handed over to the Africans. The hon. member for Cradock mentioned something about the solemn promise which had been given by Gen. Hertzog. I want to mention some more of that solemn promise. He stated, and I quote from the 1936 Hansard, Vol. 26, Col. 2829:</p>

<block name="quote">The Government wish once more to give the assurance that it is their earnest desire to see that the obligation towards the Natives of the Union arising out of this Bill &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is the 1936 Land and Trust Act&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; in conjunction with the Representation of Natives Act, recently passed by the Joint Sitting of the two Houses, shall be faithfully carried out, and trust that this statement will be regarded as sufficient guarantee for the due fulfilment of the same.</block>

<p>That to me is a very solemn undertaking. Lest there is still any doubt as to whether the additional land that was promised in 1936 was connected with the removal of the franchise, that is the common roll franchise, I shall give another quote of Gen. Hertzog. I shall quote from a speech of his, a speech he made in December, 1936, at Smithfield. I think that shows without any doubt whatsoever that this solemn undertaking of more land was closely bound up by the fact that Parliament had at a Joint Sitting removed the African people in the Cape Province from the common voters roll. Gen. Hertzog said:</p>

<block name="quote">During the last session of Parliament, barely six months ago, Parliament by almost unanimous vote decided to deprive the Natives of the Cape of their vote, but it was fully understood by all members of Parliament that this will take place only on condition that the Act of 1913 be made effective and that the Government would provide the Natives in the four provinces with certain scheduled land to serve as Native territories. A double promise had thus been made to the Natives of the Union to provide them with land, first in 1913, when the Native was deprived of his rights of purchase of free land and, secondly, when the Cape Native was deprived of his vote this year. All this was known &#x2026;</block>

<p>said Gen. Hertzog&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; to every member of the &#x201C;purified&#x201D; Nationalist Party in Parliament. Yet, scarcely had the Act been passed and the Natives of the Cape deprived of their vote than our &#x201C;purified&#x201D; Nationalists, purified of all conscience and sense of honour, started an agitation to prevent the Government selling the land promised to the Natives.</block>

<p>So there was at that stage a reversal. Now, ironically enough, it is the heirs of the &#x201C;purified&#x201D; Nationalist Party who are doing their best to try to fulfil the quota of land as promised under the 1913 and 1936 Land Acts and it is the heirs to Gen. Hertzog&#x2019;s United Party who are doing their best to thwart this effort. That is the irony of this situation. I want to say finally &#x2026;</p>

<p>The hon. member says that I do not understand, but possibly I understand just as well as he does. I am going to support the motion which we are discussing today. I want to say quite unequivocally that I happen to have the strongest objections to almost every basic principle of policy as far as the Africans are concerned that the Government propounds, though I accept that in many aspects many of the policies are already <i>fait accompli</i> and there is very little that any body is ever going to be able to do about that. To me the absolute minimum starting point is that the 1936 Land Act obligation be carried out. I believe that that was a solemn undertaking that was given in 1936 by Gen. Hertzog on behalf of the White people of South Africa. Having said that, I want to say that although I firmly believe that the acquisition of the remaining land under the 1936 Act is a long overdue debt to which we. the White people of South Africa, should have put paid many years ago&#x2014;it is a long overdue debt that we simply have to pay &#x2014;to imagine that by so doing we can consider the problem of African rural poverty <span class="col_8087-8088" refersTo="page_0998"/>as being solved, is utterly foolish. I hope the hon. chairman of the Bantu Affairs Commission is listening and I hope that he does not think that he can thereby consider the problem of African rural poverty in 1972 is going to be solved by the acquisition, even to the full, of the very last morgen of land under the 1936 Act. I do not believe either that mere consolidation of these areas will solve the problem of rural poverty among the African people. And it does not matter whether the homelands are independent or otherwise; the poverty problem will still remain.</p>

<p>The first important question I should like to ask is how is the land acquired going to be used. I believe that that is an important question. I sincerely hope, and I should like to have some reassurance on this point, that the land will not simply be used for resettlement areas and that thousands of people will not be scooped up out of the urban areas and placed on this land. I hope that the land will not simply be used to house the families of migrant workers. I believe that the solution to Black rural poverty is not only the acquisition of more land. That is desperately required. There is a desperate land hunger, more particularly in the Ciskei, among Africans. But I believe that the problem can only be solved, in fact, by moving people off the land. I do not believe that the African areas, even with all the 7&#x00BC; million morgen acquired and added to them, will be able to support at any decent standard of living, their existing population, the natural increase of that population and still less, of course, the people who will be sent back from the urban areas. I hope that this is gradually dawning on the Nationalist Government. I hope that the reaction of the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration when he came back from visiting those miserable areas like Sada, Ilinge and Dimbaza is at last beginning to penetrate. viz. that one, cannot simply resettle people there, give them minute maintenance allowances and thereafter think that you can wash your hands of them. It does not work that way.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to ask the hon. member for Houghton whether the Whites will have the right, in terms of her party&#x2019;s policy, to buy and own land in the so-called Bantu areas.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Under the Progressive Party policy there will not be a question of the so-called Reserves. You have to have certain protected areas for people under present circumstances who cannot compete with White people who would buy up their lands. But in a society where you have a multi-racial country, where all people are free to move, free to exercise their talents, free to buy land anywhere else, the situation will resolve itself. Those people who want to sell their land, will sell their land and those who do not want to sell their land, will not. That is our policy.</p>

<p>I want to say that I agree with the hon. member for Transkei and the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town when they talked about industrialization and urbanization as being a solution to the problem. It solved the poor White problem and I believe it could solve the poor Black problem. But what I want to say is: Just supposing that already all the land under the 1913 and 1936 Land Acts had been acquired, does it not occur to them that they still have to acquire more land?</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>There was an overall objection in principle, not just to this particular land. The hon. member made a long speech saying that the acquisition of this sort of land was no good and that it had to be near industrial areas and growth points. I have understood every point he made. I say that even with the acquisition <span class="col_8089-8090" refersTo="page_0999"/>of this land, which is a solemn pledge in terms of the 1936 legislation, that further land should and must be acquired in the urban areas near the industrial growth points.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I ask the hon. member whether she believes that land should be bought just for the sake of buying land in terms of the 1936 legislation?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I think that the provisions of the 1936 Act have just got to be carried out. And this proposal must be carried out, because this is adjacent land which has always been envisaged as being land that could possibly be bought up. It is all adjacent land to the existing areas. That was laid down in the Act long ago. When the quota areas, the scheduled areas, were set aside, it was always envisaged that more land would have to be bought. This land should have been bought years ago and I do not know why this House is debating it today. It is 36 years since the 1936 Land Act was passed. It was never envisaged that it would take two generations before the land was acquired. Gen. Hertzog made that very clear and so did the then United Party when they supported that legislation. I want to say that I am dead against cramming people back into these areas, because I do not believe that even with every last inch of the 13 per cent of the land which was set aside under the 1913 and 1936 Land Acts, those areas can ever hope to support the existing African population at any decent standard of living, or the natural increase. I fully support the claims of African leaders for more land if their areas are to be made viable, although I doubt that even this in fact would achieve that purpose. I believe it can fairly and equitably be argued that just as in 1936 there was a <i>quid pro quo</i> for depriving Africans of the common franchise by giving them more land, so we can say that there should have been a <i>quid pro quo</i> in 1959 when they were deprived of the communal franchise in this House. I believe that we should have given more land at that time as an additional <i>quid pro quo,</i> because then the concept of temporary sojourners and a return to the tribal areas by 1978 was envisaged. I think it should have been obvious at that time that the existing land, even if fully acquired under the 1936 Act, would never ever be enough. I am glad to see that one of the architects of the plan, Dr. Eiselen, came out in support of this only this month and stated that the African leaders were justified in their claims for more land.</p>

<p>I want to say finally that I have considerable sympathy for the people who are going to be moved as a result of this motion. I fully understand the plea put up by the hon. members on behalf of their constituents and I believe that that is absolutely right. I am always sorry for people who have to be moved; I am sorry for the hundreds and thousands of Africans that have been moved under Proclamations and Black spot removals. Indeed, even under this resolution, as has been pointed out, Africans are going to be moved from so-called Black spots. I am sorry for the 110 000 Coloured and Indian families who are disqualified people under the Group Areas Act. Thousands of them have already been moved and many of them still have to be moved.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am simply saying that when removal schemes are under way &#x2014;and to some extent this is a removal scheme&#x2014;people always suffer and that I am sorry for them. I believe it is hard to give up one&#x2019;s land. As a rule White people are, of course, handsomely compensated. I want to say that under a rational multiracial policy such as my party proposes, such removals would not take place compulsorily, but only if people desire to move and if they offer their farms for sale so that they may be bought by people of different races. As the reality of the situation obtains, however, we have a Nationalist Party Government in power and we have homelands that are desperately short of land. There is a desperate land hunger amongst Africans and that is going to grow. I believe that the very minimum starting point that this White Parliament can operate from is at least to see that the obligations which were undertaken 36 years ago by another White Parliament are fulfilled. I will therefore support this motion.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am amazed this afternoon to find that the hon. member for Houghton supports this motion. I cannot understand how the hon. member for Houghton, having expressed the views that she has previously expressed in this House, c&#x00E1;n support what can be no more than a move to remove more unfortunate <span class="col_8091-8092" refersTo="page_1000"/>Bantu families and to place them in such places as Sada, Ilinge, Dimbaza and others. She in her own words said that she hoped that this was not going to happen, but surely she knows that under this Government it is the only thing which can happen. Since when has she been bluffed? Of all the members in this House, since when has the hon. member for Houghton allowed herself to be bluffed by people such as the hon. member for Langlaagte? No, Sir, I am afraid that I am completely at a loss this afternoon; unless, of course, she is engaged in her favourite pastime, which is in some way to try and attack the United Party, not the Nationalist Party, with whom she sides so often.</p>

<p>&#x2026; willy-nilly, wherever it might be, as long as it is something like adjacent to existing Bantu land, scheduled area or released area. But she has not even looked at the map to see that half of the land which is now being asked for, is nowhere near adjacent to Bantu land. That is the whole reason for this motion. The whole reason for this motion is to declare that vast area a released area, so that the Government in its wisdom can pick here and there and buy odd bits and pieces all over the place. If this is going to happen, as it is going to happen, we are going to have the further creation of more Black spots. This is not a logical extension. It is merely the Government asking once again for a blank cheque, as far as the Ciskei is concerned, for the right to purchase anywhere within a vast area, and creating in the minds, not only of the Whites, but of the Blacks as well, this tremendous feeling of uncertainty which has been referred to by other speakers on this side of the House. But I want to remind the hon. member for Houghton of what my hon. friend from Transkei said when he introduced the debate on this motion.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#member">

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>She didn&#x2019;t listen.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Obviously she did not listen, because this is what he said:</p>

<block name="quote">Then, purchases should not be supported just because all the land dealt with in the 1936 Act has not yet been made available, but only where such land is necessary for industrial development or the establishment of economic farming units &#x2026;</block>

<p>Bantu farming units, Sir&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; once again against the background of the entire South African economy.</block>

<p>So I ask the hon. member for Houghton: Why can she not support this sort of sentiment? Does she believe it immoral for us to express such sentiments or to stand by such principles? I believe that morality only lies with us in the stand which we have taken. The hon. member for Transkei went further and said:</p>

<block name="quote">The acceptance of these principles will leave Parliament free to judge each case on its own merits in the interests of the South African economy as a whole and all the people that inhabit the country.</block>

<p>Once again I ask the hon. member for Houghton: On whose side is morality? He went further and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On this basis the purchase of land for Bantu residential occupation in the neighbourhood of natural growth points would be justified. Black spots where the presence of the Bantu is unjustified for economic reasons would be eliminated, individual land-ownership amongst the Bantu as opposed to communal ownership would develop &#x2026;</block>

<p>Here I want to break for a moment to say the hon. member for Houghton must not think she is the first one to talk about land ownership for the Bantu people, and not only so far as housing in the urban areas is concerned, but even agricultural land-ownership. When she talked this afternoon about removing the people from the land and concentrating them in towns, she must realize that this has been advocated by this side of the House often before. Here again my friend from Transkei said so. The member for Transkei concluded by saying:</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_8093-8094" refersTo="page_1001"/>&#x2026; and there would be large scale industrial development both inside and outside the reserves.</block>

<p>In conclusion, as far as the hon. member for Houghton is concerned, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On the other hand, it may be necessary, in order to do justice to the Bantu, to exceed the maximum laid down in 1936. We do not want to be bound by questions of geography or acreage. We believe that our first concern should be the welfare of the people for whom we are responsible.</block>

<p>It is on that which we take our stand here this afternoon. It is on that stand that we oppose the motion moved by the hon. the Deputy Minister. I say so because we are responsible for those people, because we are prepared to face up to that responsibility.</p>

<p>I must remind hon. members on that side that when they talk of us running away from the promise that was given in the 1936 Act, that the Act lays down that the land which is to be bought shall not exceed 7&#x00BC; million morgen in extent. Not that we shall purchase million morgen but that is the maximum which shall be purchased. They must not come with any stories that we are running away from our responsibilities. As has been said by speakers on this side, we do not accept that 7&#x00BC; million morgen is the maximum or the limit; we do not believe that in purchasing land for occupation by the Bantu people we should be tied to such land as is adjacent to or adjoins scheduled or released areas.</p>

<p>It is a perfectly reasonable question. I accept it as such coming from a perfectly reasonable member on the other side, something I cannot say of many others. The question is what is the maximum amount of land that we will make available to an individual Bantu to purchase. There is no question of a maximum amount of land that an individual can purchase. We have made it clear that we will make provision in the Bantu townships adjacent to urban areas&#x2014;land set aside for occupation by the Bantu&#x2014; for individual Bantu to purchase and own their own homes and to purchase the land on which their homes stand.

That is quite clear from what we have heard in this House this afternoon. I do not know who is going to be left to judge, but somebody at some stage is going to judge who attended what meeting.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Cradock further attacked my friend for King William&#x2019;s Town. Once again I want to stress that I know that that hon. member is fully conversant with the English language. He said that the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town would make more than million morgen of land available to the Bantu in and around Cape Town, Johannesburg and other large urban areas in South Africa. He knows full well that that is not what the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town said. He did not say that at all; he did not say that the full 7&#x00BC; million morgen of land must be made available in those areas. Why does this hon. member deliberately mislead this House? Because that is what he has done. He understands the language. He is repeating now that the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town said &#x201C;even more&#x201D;, but it was not a question of &#x201C;even more&#x201D; in those areas, and that is what the hon. member for Cradock implies, merely so that he can get this untruth on the record.</p>

<p>Sir, I see the hon. member for Cradock is sitting there with the other two hon. gentlemen who were present at the meeting. He seems to have contradicted his two friends with whom he is sitting at the moment because he said that the commission was sent out with the particular &#x201C;opdrag&#x201D; to collect evidence and to hear opposition to their plans; it was not sent to buy land or to negotiate with the people, or to consult with them. But, Sir, what did the hon. member for Langlaagte say last night? He said that they were sent to consult and that they did in fact consult, and this is why I say that it appears that two meetings must have been held which were attended at the same time by certain members, because the hon. member for Cradock now corroborates all the evidence that was given by the hon. members for King William&#x2019;s Town and East London North, who were present at that meeting where, as the hon. member for Cradock now corroborates, consultations did not take place, because they were only sent to collect evidence. So much, Sir, for the promise of the Government that they would consult with the people concerned here.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, let us go back to the hon. member for Langlaagte. While the hon. member for Langlaagte was speaking last night, my hon. friend, the member for Albany, took a point of order and asked whether we were in fact dealing with the same matters as those which came before the Select Committee on Bantu Affairs. Sir, that point of order was ignored, and I believe that you were right in ignoring it, but I must say that the hon. member for Langlaagte certainly gave the impression to this House last night that we were not dealing with the same matters as we dealt with in the Select Committee. He gave answers last night to many questions which were asked in the Select Committee where we got no answers at all; we were told that there were no answers to these things. The hon. member for Langlaage told us that this land was required to compensate for black spots which are to be removed and also for the resettlement of the Bantu. We accept that, Sir, This is exactly what we were told in the Select Committee. But during the debate in the Select Committee we asked specifically where the Bantu from the black spots which were going to be removed, were going to be resettled, and we were told that they did not know. But last night the hon. member for Langlaagte gave us a long list of the black spots that are being removed and of the areas to which those Bantu are being taken.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>What happened at the Select Committee when we asked this? I am sure it has been made clear to this House by now that we have two particular problems. The one is compensatory land for black spots which are being removed; and under reasonable circumstances and under proper control, we have no objection whatsoever to their removal. Another is the purchase of extra land towards the quota and for the resettlement of squatters, as it was put to us. But, Sir, we could get no definition in the Select Committee of what land was intended for which purpose; in other words, we had to oppose the whole resolution. In the Select Committee we were told&#x2014;and I quote from notes which I made at the time: &#x201C;Compensatory land has not been earmarked for black spots. After the purchase of the land, ecologists will be called in and they will decide where the Bantu from each black spot should be moved to.&#x201D; Sir, this has all been done in the space of 10 days, or two weeks, according to the hon. member for Langlaagte; he has now received this information. Within the space of these three weeks he has made an examination of all these black spots; the ecologists have gone in; they have planned everything, and this is what he expects us to believe. Do you wonder, Sir, that my hon. friend, the member for Albany, takes a point of order and wants to know if this is the same matter as that which was discussed by the Select Committee?</p>

<p>But let us go further with the hon. member for Langlaagte. He gave us various figures last night of the balance of the land that is due in terms of the quota allocated to the Cape Province under the 1936 Act. He ended up with 241 000 morgen, which is the balance still to be purchased. The estimates of the area of this land we are discussing seem to vary from 178 000 morgen to 186 000 morgen; but after that, there are 241 000 morgen left. This is what the hon. member for Langlaagte said last night, and I quote from his Hansard&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mnr. die Speaker, daardie agb. lid moet net eenvoudig aanvaar dat die kwotas vir elke provinsie neergel&#x00EA; is in die 1936-Wet.

<p>Mr Speaker, I concede the point of the hon member for Langlaagte. I discussed this matter with him and put it to him that if this statement was correct, then we had final plans for the Ciskei.</p>

<p>I accept it, but I want the record put straight, that the 241 000 morgen that is left is not only for the Transkei and the Tswana people, but that the Ciskei people can still expect a little bit more. In other words, we now have the situation that a proposal is put to this House, a proposal which has been put to the inhabitants of the Ciskei, Black and White, which is not final, which is merely an interim measure, which is not going to remove any of the uncertainties which have been mentioned by hon. members on this side of the House.</p>

<p>Sir, we are now being asked to consider this matter without any finality whatsoever. How can we be asked to approve, and how can the people concerned be consulted&#x2014;and asked if they are prepared to accept, plans which are not final? Mr. Chairman, the same thing has happened in Natal, and the hon. member for Langlaagte knows what the answer of the agricultural unions in Natal has been. Their answer has been that they cannot accept plans which are not the final plans. Because how is this going to help anybody? I want to quote from a letter that I received only the other day from a firm of estate agents in Pietermaritzburg in connection with the sale of certain properties totalling 6 165 acres&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government expropriated several thousand acres belonging to Mr. Gibson in the Elandskop area, and these three farms are actually adjoining the one bought by the Prisons Department in 1970.</block>

<block name="quote">We feel that these farmers are genuinely affected, and we have tried over the past year to dispose of the properties.</block>

<block name="quote">Any prospective purchaser to whom we show these farms, expresses views to the effect that he could not consider them because of the Reserves or locations. The price which we endeavoured to obtain for these farmers was R55 per acre, and we felt that the farms were really worth it.</block>

<p>[Interjections.] My hon. friend here says that at R55 per acre this was a give-away price. The letter goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">However, after many discussions we have now been mandated to offer the farms to you and they have agreed that they will be agreeable to sell at R45 or R50 per acre. The farms are excellent paying propositions and are being farmed as general farming and dairy farms.</block>

<p>Sir, this is what is happening, because of these interim plans which are being suggested by the Government. Not only are the farmers themselves affected but we are going to be faced with a shortage of food in this country because the farmers will not be prepared to continue. Last night the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration interjected when one of our members was speaking, who asked what does a person do sitting there, knowing that it might be 15 years before he is bought out; and the hon. the Minister said he must go ahead with his development. Sir, who wants to develop under those circumstances, when you have the Sword of Damocles hanging over you which can fall at any moment and cut you off? The point was made earlier that these are young people. They are not old people who are on the point of retirement and who want to sell and go and settle down and live quietly for the rest of their lives in town. These are people who want to make a future for themselves. If this Government is going to persist with this plan, which I know it will do, because it is going to steamroller this thing through, then I say they are in honour bound to buy out every one of those properties <i>now,</i> immediately; and then I want to go further and I want to say that having done so the Government must not drag its feet with carrying out its plans as it has done in other areas where it has purchased land. Having purchased this land, it must get on and move the Bantu people and resettle them and use the land they have bought because we have too much land lying idle in this country at the moment. It is all very well to talk about insufficient land for the Bantu people, but let them use the land which this Government has purchased for them and from which this Government is deliberately keeping the Bantu off. Sir, we oppose this motion.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. D. DEACON</person>:</from>

<p>It is not a historical fact. If the hon. member would look at the debates of that time she will find that the Minister of Lands at that time, Mr. Grobler, specifically denied it when he was piloting the Bill through the House. The second point is that in reply to the question put to her by the hon. member for Transkei, it seems quite clear that she thought that any land, whether it was productive land or not, should be purchased. I wonder whether it is really fair to the Bantu or to the economy of South Africa to take up an attitude like this. I received <span class="col_8101-8102" refersTo="page_1005"/>figures some years ago. Unfortunately I am unable to confirm them now, because I received them from a gentleman who has passed away, a person who was closely associated with the Department of Bantu Administration for many years. He had worked out that on the average of a productive economically active White farm, approximately 45 morgen per Bantu family was required for them to subsist and to live quite well, but that on the Trust ground 90 morgen per family was required. I think that is a point everybody should note very carefully and bear in mind when they think of this sort of thing.</p>

<p>*Last night the hon. member for Langlaagte accused the hon. member for Transkei of having his speech written out by the Eastern Agricultural Union. The hon. member for Langlaagte knows that this was a frivolous and untrue remark. [Interjections.] If that were so, what is wrong with the Eastern Agricultural Union then? You may ask the hon. the Minister and the hon. the Deputy Minister of Agriculture. It is one of the best agricultural unions in the whole of South Africa. What difference would it have made if that statement were true? The hon. member says, &#x201C;Yes, they just want to produce&#x201D;, but this is not what it is all about.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. D. DEACON</person>:</from>

<p>The principle of that Act. when it was introduced in 1936 under a Government which never mentioned sovereign independence, becomes quite a different principle under the same Act when a Government speaks of sovereign independence. So we are pursuing two different policies. Until this Government comes to its senses it will not be easy for us to understand one another.</p>

<p>I want to go further. This hon. member, who is chairman of the commission, submitted the proposals of the Select Committee to this House. When speaking last night&#x2014;we have the report of the Select Committee in front of us here&#x2014;he dealt with exchange lands throughout his speech. A considerable portion of his speech dealt with Black spots which are going to be removed and placed elsewhere and about land which is going to be bought in one place and taken away in another. This report does not mention this at all. The report is incomplete and insufficient information has been submitted to this House in regard to the matter we are debating here today.</p>

<p>Then I want to come to the hon. member for Wolmaransstad. He attacked my hon. colleague, the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town, for mentioning the purchase of land for Bantu occupation in the vicinity of our growth points and around our cities. Today it went even further. But the hon. member for Kensington asked him: &#x201C;What about Mdantsane?&#x201D; I want to go a little further: What about Rosslyn? What about Soweto? What about Ga Rankuwa and what about Hammarsdale? In all these places, except Soweto, the Bantu have freehold. These places are situated next to growth points and cities and have been established by this Government. So there is nothing wrong with what the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town said. All he wants to do, is to take that policy further in a better way. I want to ask the hon. member: What is going on in the vicinity of Newcastle?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. D. DEACON</person>:</from>

<p>What is going on there? Bantu townships are being established there next to a growth point, and what is wrong with that? Nothing! Then the hon. member comes along and says that when the agriculture leaders spoke at a meeting in King William&#x2019;s Town they came along with one version and subsequently, when they were having tea, individual farmers came forward and offered their farms for sale.</p>

<p>Does that hon. member not realize how people feel when they see such a prominent statement in the newspaper to the effect that the scheme is proceeded with and that they are only allowed to stay there and to act as policemen for the Government? Does that hon. member know what life is like in the border areas of South Africa? I do not think they appreciate it. It is easy to draw lines on a map and to <span class="col_8103-8104" refersTo="page_1006"/>sit far away in Pretoria or in an urban constituency and to say that the matter has been solved. It is easy to say: &#x201C;We have drawn up a map; it has been completed now&#x201D;. But then we forget about the people.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Aliwal came along with all kinds of pious talk. He spoke about the Greek islands! I do not know what the Greek islands have to do with land purchased for Bantu occupation. It is easy for that hon. member to come along with all kinds of soft talk, because according to the map and the proposals I have seen, not one little piece or iota of his constituency is sacrificed in these proposals.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I want to come back to those matters that pertain particularly to my constituency. In the original proposal a coastal strip was left White. I led a deputation to the hon. the Deputy Minister representing the people of Peddie asking that that strip be purchased either by the Department of Forestry, the Department of Agricultural Land Tenure or the Department of Defence. Subsequently there was another proposal in which the village of Hamburg was included and it was all going to become part of trust land. On behalf of those farmers I may say that they appreciate the fact that they will not have to stay there but I repeat the request that the coastal strip be preserved for some other use than that of Bantu occupation. I would like to support the hon. member for Transkei&#x2019;s plea. There are holiday resorts being developed in that area, resorts that can mean a great deal, economically, not only to South Africa, but to the embryo Ciskei. I feel that this should be very seriously considered, especially in the light of the fact that Hamburg is now being left <i>in vacuo,</i> a White spot in the middle of the homeland Ciskei.</p>

<p>There is another question I want to raise in connection with Hamburg, namely the lack of liaison between the departments. The hon. the Minister will remember that I asked certain questions, which appeared on the Order Paper for Friday, the 19th May. The one question I asked the Minister of Police and the other I asked the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. These questions were both very similar. I was grateful to see that a post office is to be established in place of the agency and that it is expected to be in operation by 1973. When you place a town in the position in which Hamburg has been placed, a town that is inhabited permanently by retired people, one expects to have a police station there. I am not sure whether the hon. the Minister is aware of the fact that the nearest police station is at Bell which is five miles away, and that that police station will be in the proposed Ciskei. I asked the hon. the Minister of Police whether a police station was to be established in the village of Hamburg in the district of Peddie and if so, when; if not, why not? The answer was as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The establishment of a police station in the village of Hamburg is under consideration, but unfortunately no decisive reply to the hon. member&#x2019;s question can be given at this time.</block>

<p>Surely these matters are gone into before proposals are made; surely these matters should be gone into very carefully before proposals are made.</p>

<p>Then, when v/e come to paragraph 8 of the proposal before the House, you have the exclusions of Hamburg Township and the Commonage and the Peddie Township and Commonage which we asked for. The second leg of this paragraph is really disconcerting. Here the hon. member for Langlaagte requests&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">With a view to gradually making the said properties available for purchase by the South African Trust and Bantu persons, your committee begs to recommend that consideration be given to introducing the necessary legislation in terms of which the properties concerned may by a process of zoning for Bantu occupation be added to the released area.</block>

<p>What is the point of exempting those towns if you add a rider like this and ask for legislation to rezone them? Are we going to have &#x201C;gemengde woonbuurtes&#x201D; in these places as we have in so many of the towns in the Transkei? This sort of thing must be avoided and planned ahead.</p>

<p>Then I want to come to the Chalumna area in East London. The hon. the Deputy Minister will know that I am not satisfied at all with that area. I can see no reason why it should be cut into the north-western area of the East London district. The outlining of that area is far from satisfactory as it is at the moment. What concerns me is that guarantees were given to the farmers&#x2019; association of that area, the East London West Farmers&#x2019; Association, in 1963 by Mr. J. S. de Wet, then Under-<span class="col_8105-8106" refersTo="page_1007"/>Secretary for Bantu Affairs and again in 1965 by his Hon. the Administrator of the Cape, Mr. A. H. Vosloo, who was then the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration. The hon. member for Kensington mentioned these guarantees. The hon. the Minister knows about these guarantees, yet this proposal still comes. I should like to know and have it fully explained what the purpose and the need for that incursion into the East London district is. We are fully aware that there is a plan to build a large township just across, on the King William&#x2019;s Town side, at Gulu. However, I cannot discuss that matter in this debate. In speaking at the end of a debate of this nature, may I say that the major reasons why we oppose the Select Committee&#x2019;s report have been adequately dealt with by hon. members on this side of the House. There is, however, one relevant and very important reason that has not been dealt with, viz. the arrogant disregard of the individual, of his rights and of the guarantees given to him by previous Ministers and officials of this Government. It has long been accepted by the local authorities, the farmers&#x2019; associations and the Border Agricultural Union that no further land for the Bantu Trust would be acquired in that area without first consulting the agricultural union and other interested parties. This guarantee was first given by Mr. De Wet Nel during the period that he was in office. It was subsequently substantiated by the late Dr. Verwoerd, both during the period that he was in office and when he was Prime Minister. Other guarantees such as those I have just mentioned have been given by senior officials and Deputy Ministers. All these guarantees have gone by the board in these proposals. The Border was notified of the original proposals on the 9 p.m. news by the South African Broadcasting Corporation and by the newspapers towards the end of last year without any consultation with any individual or body in that area. Three meetings subsequently took place. If the hon. member for Wolmaransstad protests that all interested parties were notified of the meeting in &#x0026;lt;u&#x0026;gt;Kin&#x0026;lt;/u&#x0026;gt;g William&#x2019;s Town, then I say to &#x0026;lt;u&#x0026;gt;him&#x0026;lt;/u&#x0026;gt; that he is guilty of a terminological inexactitude of the first degree. As a member of Parliament for the constituency that is probably more seriously affected than any other by the proposals, I received no official notification of the meeting. Therefore, I did not attend that meeting. I hope that that hon. member will not have the effrontery to tell me that simply because I happen to be a member of the Opposition in this hon. House, I cease to be an interested party. All matters concerning my constituency are of very extreme interest to me. Democracy certainly does not work in this arrogant manner. This arrogant and despotic manner of dealing with matters of national importance must, I believe, be laid squarely at the door of the Minister himself who had a good many giggles last night and who is so possessed with his own importance that I feel constrained to quote him on article 1 of the Fundamental Laws of the Tsarist Empire as they were published in 1892&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Emperor of all Russia is an autocratic and unlimited monarch. God himself commands that his supreme power be obeyed out of conscience as well as fear.</block>

<p>This self-styled king and champion of the Bantu should take note and read a little Russian history, especially the communal tenure of land. It might sober his arrogance and bring his thoughts to the more important, practical and immediate needs of the peoples and the economy of the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have had a particularly long debate on a very important matter, a matter which affects our country and all its people, in particular the various Bantu peoples and the Whites. I think six different speakers on the Opposition side spoke, and except for those who repeated a little what they or others had said, we heard virtually six different opinions. Of course we also had the special case of the hon. member for Houghton supporting this measure because her party is of the opinion that this land must be purchased! However, it is very clear to me that the Opposition has no clear policy in regard to this matter. Last year the hon. member for Transkei introduced a motion in this House, in which he requested us to determine the boundaries. I do not want to spend much time on this, but I want to remind him on that occasion he said, <i>inter alia,</i> the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sir, it is essential that the Government declare the boundaries of the reserves and that it commit itself to purchase the land in that area &#x2026; I say that the Government should now declare the borders <span class="col_8107-8108" refersTo="page_1008"/>of the reserves, and give the assurance to the people who are affected that they will pay them out if they want to leave.</block>

<p>What is important here is that the hon. member, in a special motion last year, put forward a strong plea here, together with the hon. member for Mooi River who is not here at the moment, and said that we should simply draw lines so that the people could know. In particular they were concerned about the uncertainty, and about the land demands the various Bantu leaders had made. Those were the two points, namely the uncertainty of the farmers and the land demands of the Bantu. Now, however, they say that they cannot agree to this, because it is not consolidation. I now want to ask them: If it is not consolidation what is it then? The hon. member for Transkei spoke of 180 000 ha and said that since 1936 we had never before declared so much land to be released area at one juncture. Last year he advocated that it should be done; but the other hon. members say that it is not consolidation.</p>

<p>I wanted to discuss the contradictions, but I do not want to waste the time of the House. The hon. member for Houghton pointed out to hon. members on the opposite side how the Opposition adopts a different approach every few years. First they say that they do not want to give any more land, for it is going to the Bantustans. Last year, however, they advocated that the land should be purchased. I then gave them the assurance that the policy of the National Party is planning for consolidation and the purchase of land and that we are now going to pursue this policy dynamically. They want the boundaries to be determined, and the land will then be purchased. Here we are consequently coming forward with the first instalment, and I shall elaborate on this in a moment because it is very important. But now that the United Party has had its first taste of the medicine they asked for, they are choking in it.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to let this suffice. I cannot now deal with all the arguments of the hon. members. There were as many arguments on that side as there were speakers. That is why I say that the United Party must get uniformity in their basic approach and policy as far as this matter is concerned. Then we will know where we stand. But now we have on the one hand the policy of the hon. member for Transkei. He says that their approach is that the South African economy as a whole should now serve as a criterion. Said with all due respect, what that really has to do with this matter as a whole I do not know. In other words, there must be economic grounds before land can be purchased. We have this solemn promise made by a White Government, and as far as I am concerned, it makes no difference whether it was the National Party or the United Party that gave this undertaking. A White Government in this country gave an undertaking to the Black man. and as far as I am concerned, it has to be carried out. That is the first reason why we are going to carry it out.</p>

<p>The second reason is that it is a question of the consolidation of these areas. I shall also elaborate on that in a moment. But what did that hon. member go on to say? First they want to be certain about &#x201C;the use to which the land is to be put&#x201D;. First they want to know what we are going to do with that land, and what the Bantu are going to do with it. Must we impose conditions now and water it down? Look, they are entitled to the land according to a law of this country, and according to promises. But now the hon. member wants us to give them the land conditionally. I cannot see how the United Party can make any kind of impression with such a policy and approach, in terms of which they do an about-face every time, and impose all kinds of conditions from year to year.</p>

<p>I want to go further. We have now heard one of the members&#x2014;I think it was <span class="col_8109-8110" refersTo="page_1009"/>the hon. member for East London North &#x2014;asking why we do not purchase land in Saldanha. That shows the lack of planning and of a policy of that party. Surely it is very clear; if you are looking for trouble, all you need to do is plan for Bantu areas in the vicinity of Saldanha.</p>

<p>Now he is asking why we do not buy in the Free State! You know, Sir, that the Free State quota has been bought up; they are the only people who can say with pride today that they have met their obligations under this Act.</p>

<p>I come now to the Cape Province, to the Eastern Agricultural Union. I shall return again to the five points he mentioned. They discussed this with me, but he should really take another look at it and tell me how many of them are practicable. We shall come to that again. Let us continue. I want to tell hon. members briefly and to the point: The National Party is in power. The National Party is governing in terms of a fixed policy. It is the policy of the National Party that the eight Bantu peoples within the boundaries of the Republic of South Africa will each receive their share of the land specified in terms of the 1936 Act. In the implementation of that policy we are now entering, as the hon. the Minister said last year, a dynamic third decade. The department and I are doing everything possible to finalize the planning for that. This is only the first instalment. The people may say now that they want the final boundaries. As the hon. member for Langlaagte indicated yesterday evening, 241 000 ha of the Cape Province quota still remains to be purchased and has still to be indicated by us. I can inform the hon. members here that I will do everything in my power, in conjunction with the department and in collaboration with the Bantu Affairs Commission, which has tremendous tasks, to come to this House next year and submit that final planning, in so far as we are able to declare it finally. I say &#x201C;in so far as we are able to declare it finally&#x201D;, because there may perhaps be minor problems in regard to the finishing touches and excisions which will require a little more time. But we want to lay the overall planning, as we see it, upon the Table of this House. I tell you it is a tremendous task; it is not merely a question of drawing a few lines. Last year these people said we must get a move on. Now they are complaining that they have not had sufficient time to consider this matter; we allegedly did not give these people sufficient notice. I admit that it may perhaps have happened a little hastily, but I can tell you, Sir, that provisionally the Natal Agricultural Union has already been informed. The Transvaal Agricultural Union will be furnished with certain particulars. I, too, have already had talks with them. We shall as soon as possible furnish the North-Western Cape Agricultural Union and the Eastern Cape Agricultural Union with further information. But surely they know this by now. The Eastern Cape Agricultural Union now states that they do not want to surrender any land. They tell me: &#x201C;Rather give them the money or give them the interest on the money.&#x201D; Surely we cannot work in that way. I want to make an appeal to the members of Parliament of that area to bring it home to them that that is an irresponsible approach, and to get them to approach these matters on a constructive basis. These are, as far as I am concerned, solemn promises which have been made. It is an undertaking which was given by the Whites, and we should not deal with these matters in that way.</p>

Now the only thing we can do is to wait for suggestions. We told them what our aims were, and now we are waiting. I told the department to go to them and make certain suggestions to them. In the meantime we have drawn up our plan. I hope in a fortnight&#x2019;s time we will be able to submit our plans to these people, but it cannot be final plans.</p>

<p>*This planning of ours is submitted to them. Perhaps there are people who have better ideas in regard to this matter. We are not going to try to be clever and say that we can sit in an office here and solve everything. Each of those farmers&#x2019; associations may come forward and tell us <span class="col_8111-8112" refersTo="page_1010"/>that they think it should be done in such and such a way. They may come forward with constructive ideas and proposals. Surely it is senseless to lay something in their midst and pretend that it is final while we are considering their suggestions. Surely we need not even give it to them. What would they do with it? If it is final, it comes directly to Parliament. So do you want to discuss something with people if they cannot change it by making suggestions? A charge concerning democracy was made by the hon. member for Albany. That is why we are submitting these things to the people. It is on that score that I have a complaint to make in regard to the Eastern Cape Agricultural Union. They did not come forward with anything constructive; they said that hey did not want to surrender the land. If they do not want to do it, who must?</p>

<p>How can these people decide if it is not final?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>They must make suggestions which we can consider; only then can the final plans be submitted. The plans for the Ciskei are to a large extent final, except that we are still considering minor amendments. It is not possible, even by next year, to have considered this matter quite finally, because minor amendments may still be necessary.</p>

<p>I also want to say that after 1936 a start was made with the application of this Act. Land has been purchased and also excised. We and the department must look up the records in all the deeds registries throughout the country. If we say here that it is final, we want to know precisely what happened along the way, whether mistakes were not perhaps made in the calculations. We are now checking up in the deeds registry of each province to see what the precise figure is. That is why I said in reply to questions earlier this year that we are making inquiries and that we could not furnish precise figures at the moment, but that all these matters must be taken into consideration. I can give hon. members the assurance that we shall try to submit it next year, as close to finality as we are practically able to come. [Interjections.] This is the purchase of quota land which I mentioned, which was promised in terms of the 1936 Act. For the Cape Province it is, as the hon. member for Langlaagte mentioned yesterday evening, 241 000 ha according to the present figures at our disposal.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>But the Ciskei must still receive some of that quota.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The Ciskei must still receive some of it. I can tell the hon. member that I do not foresee their getting very much of it. Suggestions have been made. The hon. member for Albany has been to see me, and there are a few of his voters who feel that we may as well purchase their farms as well, for they are not satisfied with the boundaries. We are taking the complaints of the farmers into account. We are trying to find practical boundaries. If he can suggest a better boundary to us, we could consider it. The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town has certain persons who have problems at Braunschwieg and Frankfort. We are looking into that, and we may differ a little. We are not going to say that we have now submitted a plan, that it is a 100 per cent plan, and that further to that we are not listening to anyone. In other words, as far as the White farmers are concerned, there is a measure of elasticity in the implementation of this planning in order to find final boundaries. Our approach is that we want to accommodate these people and be as practical as possible. I want to repeat that this is implementation of National Party policy. This is the first instalment. I want to request the co-operation of hon. members, if the Opposition is in earnest about this. In Natal and many parts of the Transvaal we find this negative attitude, simply because it is the National Party Government. That is the Opposition&#x2019;s problem; they are not fighting for South Africa; they are fighting against the Nats. &#x201C;The Nats must be thrown out!&#x201D; That is their story. The reason why they are sitting on the opposite side is because they do not come forward with anything constructive or positive in regard to national policy; they are simply fighting the National Party as such. &#x201C;We are fighting the Nats&#x201D;; they are fighting themselves to a standstill, and are not getting anywhere. They are not making any Contribution to this important matter either. I concede that we did perhaps give the people in the Eastern Cape insufficient time, and that we did perhaps spring this on them a little suddenly. But they had every opportunity. Almost every one of those M.P.s came along with representations. The hon. member for East <span class="col_8113-8114" refersTo="page_1011"/>London North merely wrote a short letter. That is all I received from him. He said yesterday evening that something should have been attached to the reply which was not attached to it. It is available, however, and the young woman or clerk who should have attached it, did not do so. Although we said that we would forward the particulars, the hon. member now complains here in the House. [Interjection.] I just want to inform that hon. member that even he is welcome. All of them have already been to see me. But if the hon. member has a little problem now, he must not come along and kick up a row here in a debate. The hon. member ought not to try to aggravate important matters by saying: Look, this is the type of service we are getting and that is why we do not agree. I take it amiss of the hon. member for wasting the time of the House with trifles. The chairman of the Eastern Agricultural Union has been to see me at least three or four times, so have other deputations, and persons who have problems. We shall discuss those farmers&#x2019; problems with them and see what we can do in regard to purchases, and in what way we can accommodate them.</p>

<p>I must say to all the hon. members that this is a comprehensive task. I want to express my appreciation to the members of the Bantu Affairs Commission. I know that a difficult year lies ahead for them. I also want to express my appreciation to all hon. members of this side of the House who are involved in these matters. It is a comprehensive task. Firstly there is the question of planning. In the second place hon. members say that we must simply go ahead and buy. They ask: &#x201C;Why don&#x2019;t you buy in two years&#x2019; time?&#x201D; The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District asked again: &#x201C;Why do you not buy it all immediately?&#x201D; Surely that is an impossible task. I think. I should really explain to the hon. members the procedure which is followed. We declare released areas and, as in the case of the Ciskei, the first priority is the shifting of poorly situated areas and Black spots. But every area purchased has to be planned. One cannot simply say that the Bantu should move in. We will definitely have to lay out towns. It is not possible to allow everyone to live on pieces of land which have agricultural value in the Bantu areas. We must plan towns in which they can go and stay. Those who will be active in agriculture will receive properly planned farming units, which will vary in size from place to place. To give every Bantu a piece of agricultural land which he can simply use to live on, is not economic and cannot lead to the success of Bantu agriculture. That hon. member complained about Bantu agriculture. It is a complicated problem and one cannot solve it overnight. We cannot tell the farmers that their land has been declared released area and that all of it will be purchased overnight. When it is decided that a specific section is to be purchased, negotiations are held with individual farmers. We cannot simply draw up an overall plan and then say that all land in that area is being evaluated at a specific price. Each farmer&#x2019;s improvements are assessed. This is not done by my department, but by the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure. There is approval for adding a percentage to the valuation. That is why we cannot give farmers land elsewhere, as the Eastern Cape Agricultural Union wants.</p>

<p>Could the hon. the Deputy Minister please tell me why Whittlesea is going to remain a Black spot?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Perhaps it was wrong to have bought land in Whittlesea in the first place, but the Bantu have been staying there for many years already. It is not a large Bantu area, but it is definitely not a Black spot. I do not have the extent of the Whittlesea area, available here, but it is a relatively large area. The hon. member asks me why it should remain a Black spot. Why does he not tell me: &#x201C;We regard it as a Black spot?&#x201D; I do not regard it to be a Black spot. We are increasing the size of the area; we are adding to it the separate smaller Bantu areas so that it can become a large Bantu area. But if the hon. member regards it as a Black spot, why does he not come forward with a suggestion; why does he not say: &#x201C;We regard it as a Black spot which should be cleared and we think that compensatory land should be acquired in such and such a place?&#x201D; That would then be a constructive proposal.</p>

<p>Does the hon. the Deputy Minister realize that the Eastern Agricultural Union considers it to be a Black spot? They say so in their memorandum which they submitted to the Select Committee.</p>

<from><span class="col_8115-8116" refersTo="page_1012"/>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I read the memorandum, but I cannot recall seeing that they regard it as a Black spot. There are quite a number of other areas which they regard as Black spots. That is the attitude of the Eastern Agricultural Union; they only say what they do not like, but do not come forward with suggestions which will help us to solve our problem. They simply say that we may not purchase land in their area. The other Whites should surrender land, but they do not want to surrender any land. Sir, I accept that people will not be very keen to surrender their land, but every area throughout the country will have to contribute its share.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, as far as this planning is concerned, it is important to note that we purchase land for two purposes; firstly, there is the quota land, of which just over 1,1 million ha still has to be purchased throughout the country and, secondly, there is the question of badly situated Bantu areas and Black spots which have to be better situated. In this regard I just want to say the following: As Government we receive many complaints from people who say: &#x201C;You are cramming the Bantu into these Bantu areas&#x201D;; the hon. member for Houghton referred to this again today. The general argument from that side of the House was that industrial development is the basis and that they will purchase land and will make land available for that purpose, but this land has to be made available apart from the provisions of the 1936 Act; it has to be made available in any case. We also hear the argument that the Government is in fact the restrictive factor in this connection, and that the industrialists have to struggle along with migrant labour. But I want to inform the hon. members that with this planning in the Eastern Cape, and now in the Ciskei, and with the planning we are going to have throughout the country, ideal conditions are being created for the decentralization of industries. These industrialists and hon. members on that side of the House who say that they want labour in the large urban areas and that the Government must take the blame for their having to make use of migrant labour, should pay a visit to the border areas and see what is happening there, for the opportunities are being created for them there. The Government is not to blame if they have to make use of migrant labour. Why should we still have to bring their labour to them if the water, power and transportation have all been brought to them already?</p>

<p>I think that hon. members of the Opposition must agree here that it is in the interests of the country to decentralize industries. This planning of the Bantu areas fits in ideally here. But because this side of the House wants to encourage the establishment of border industries, they are opposed to it because they must always be opposed to the Government, and in this process they are doing the country a tremendous amount of harm. They ought to encourage the industrialists. They always level the accusation that the National Party and the Government is creating Bantu areas, and that we are making the industrialists dependent on migrant labour. My reply to that is very definitely that the industrialist who has the opportunity of establishing industries in border areas, near to the Bantu where they are able to get their labour on a family basis, have no moral right, just as that side of the House has no moral right, to level the accusation at the Government that they are being forced to make use of migrant labour. If they want to make use of those Bantu on a family basis, then they have every opportunity to do so near the homelands and if they do not they are to blame and not the Government.</p>

<p>Now, it is perhaps necessary for me to refer very briefly to Certain problems which hon. members on the opposite side had. Just before I come to that, I want to say that I am very grateful for the support of this side of the House, and for their interest in this matter, and in particular that of the Bantu Affairs Commission and its chairman. Mention was made of the meeting at King William&#x2019;s Town. I have myself held meetings of this type, where the Opposition obviously stirred up political feelings behind the scenes, for this was the Government&#x2019;s commission which was coming now, and a great fuss had to be kicked up, so much so that you could cut the atmosphere with a knife. Those were the circumstances under which the problem had to be discussed.</p>

<p>I regard it as being absolutely unpatriotic of these people to carry on in this way. Perhaps I should spend a few moments discussing the hon. member for <span class="col_8117-8118" refersTo="page_1013"/>King William&#x2019;s Town, who also complained. He said yesterday evening that he had &#x201C;got on to&#x201D; the telephone. I hope that he has today &#x201C;got off&#x201D; the telephone. He said that he had complained per telephone after he had read about these plans in the newspaper. I just want to mention to him that he indicated to us in writing on 29th November 1971 that he wanted to discuss this matter; he wanted to give evidence. We informed him that a meeting was to be held in King William&#x2019;s Town on 8th December, 1971, and that he could give his evidence there. But he did not reply. I just feel that it is not fair of the hon. members to object in this way if there were opportunities for them. If they do not want to discuss this matter in public, because it will not be in line with their party&#x2019;s policy, or because it will embarrass them, then surely they can make representations to the chairman of the Commission, but they must not complain here and say that we steamrollered this matter through without their having been afforded any opportunity of making suggestions.</p>

<p>I just want to refer to the hon. member for Transkei again. He discussed the compensation which is being paid, and he said the people wanted to know what they are going to receive. I have explained what the procedure is. We cannot tell people in advance what they are going to receive. It has been my experience, throughout the country, with few exceptions, that people come along and offer their land with great confidence. The position in the Ciskei today is such that so many offers have been made that we simply cannot accommodate them all. We have to tell people we are very sorry. People have asked why we are not purchasing their land, in spite of the attitude of the Eastern Agricultural Union, because they know that they are afforded very good treatment. The valuations are made by their own people, appointed by the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure, plus a percentage of that valuation which they receive in addition, and they cannot find better buyers anywhere than the State.</p>

<p>In fact, I am convinced that there is a measure of abuse, but I do not think we must argue about this. We do not want these people to feel that their land is simply being taken from them. I even find this attitude in Natal that they feel: &#x201C;We are not going to give our land to the Kaffirs.&#x201D; That kind of attitude, I would like to ask the hon. members, we must please get out of these people, because I do not think it is the right attitude. But what happens in practice proves that those people are willing to sell, but for us to value an entire area now, I cannot see how that will be practicable. Firstly the land of every farmer has to be valued, and once the land has been valued, it must be planned, and we must have planned occupation. We cannot simply set about doing this in an impulsive way.</p>

The other day I was in Lydenburg in the Eastern Transvaal, when a doctor said to me: &#x201C;But how can you pay these high prices?&#x201D; I said we did not value the land; that was done by the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure; what we did do, was to add a percentage. But I can tell you that on the basis of that valuation my land is worth a great deal of money, and I shall sell for that price any time, apart from the fact that I would have to set an example if my land should be involved. I had no doubts whatsoever as far as these matters are concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think we have in this process dealt with most of the questions. I just want to furnish the hon. member for East London North with a reply since he now wants a guarantee that the Bantu will occupy this land usefully. He expressed criticism of the Minister&#x2019;s earlier reply in another debate, where it was said that the Bantu are not being trained rapidly enough. It is a slow process. We can only go as fast as the ability of these people to absorb it allows. We are training them throughout the country. It is an important problem, which I have already mentioned, that we will have to select these people. Not all of them will be able to farm. In other words, with the land which I foresee we are now going to purchase we can, together with their own people, select the farmers and establish them on proper units. But there will have to be a division among them. Not everyone will be able to live on agricultural land and work for the Whites. The man who wants to farm will have to be established on a farming unit, and then we will be able to achieve an orientation of Bantu agriculture on a sound basis. But to wait until one has trained enough Bantu and then to give them the land&#x2014;when will that happen? And then one would have an occupation of that land in a way which, even if such a man has been trained, would entail that he cannot utilize it to good effect. These two things must go hand-in-hand. I want to emphasize that we have various plans in regard to agricultural development in operation. As the lands become available and we plan them, we will cause them to be occupied in an orderly way, and we hope and trust that the Bantu will be able to utilize in their own interest on these lands the information we are offering them, and the assistance we are giving them.</p>

<p>As far as the hon. member for Kensington is concerned, he did not really say anything. All he did was quarrel here about a meeting he heard of somewhere, and then he mentioned promises which had been made in regard to the road from East London to King William&#x2019;s Town. He said that the promise had been given that in the vicinity of and adjoining that road no more land would be purchased. I do not know whether be ever scrutinized these <span class="col_8121-8122" refersTo="page_1015"/>proposals, for no land is being purchased in the vicinity of that road. In fact, land is being excised there.</p>

<p>I said adjoining the border.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton also asked how the land was going to be utilized. I think I have in the course of my speech given an indication of how we intend to utilize the land. I have indicated that we want properly planned occupation of the land, and that this will require considerable money and practical planning on the part of agriculture as well. It is not possible for me to elaborate on this now, but I just want to mention that there is in the department at present a division which will deal specifically with this type of planning &#x2014;regional and town planning&#x2014;so that we, before we effect occupation of the land by Bantu, first plan properly in order to avoid any unnecessary moving about at a subsequent stage.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District said that we are creating more black spots. I really cannot see how a member who has looked at these proposals can make such a nonsensical statement. Then the hon. member spoke of a maximum of 7,5 million morgen&#x2014;he means 7,25 million morgen. Now, I do not know what the insinuation is. The one says we must not buy now because it is not economically justified; another, the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town for example, says we must buy around the urban areas and that we must buy not only the 7,25 million morgen, but that we must in addition buy a great deal more. Now we find these insinuations being levelled at us from that side of the House. The hon. memder is not the only one&#x2014; and that is why I am paying heed to them &#x2014;on that side of the House who stated here that this Act did not specify that we should purchase 7,5 million. They say that that is a maximum, but that we may purchase less. I feel that the hon. members on that side, the Opposition owe us a very straightforward answer. What is their approach in respect of this matter? When they speak to the farmers, they tell them that is is not necessary that the land be purchased for this 1936 Act only mentions a maximum.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Albany also discussed the Chalumna area. These people have certain problems in this connection, and has been to see me with some of them. I am still receiving suggestions from people; for example, one of them came to me and requested that we purchase his land because it will effect a better rounding-off. Then one still finds people, who of course come from the same side&#x2014;it is their duty to bring these people&#x2014;who say that they do not want to sell. Next year we will, as far as we are able to do this finally, give attention to this matter. I want to emphasize once again that the department and I, we who are involved in these matters, will give all possible attention to people&#x2019;s personal problems. Once again I want to make an appeal to the effect that we should refrain from making use of this matter for whatever petty political gain which we might be able to get from it. I know the United Party is bankrupt. They are looking frantically for votes. They would very dearly like to come into power. They have held out the prospect that this may perhaps happen in 1975. I do want to ask them, in the interests of their own areas, and in the interests of the country, to please refrain from trying to win a few votes on this land issue. In any case, if they speak as haphazardly as they did yesterday evening, they can only lose votes. They cannot win votes in that way. I think that I have now dealt with all the matters, and I shall let this suffice.</p>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it will be impossible to reply to all the attacks, even some personal attacks made on me by the Minister. In respect of the whole question of indoctrination we discussed last time I just want to say that under a United Party Government it will not be tolerated, be it by an Afrikaans organization, be it by an English-orientated organization, be it by a pro-Government or by an anti-Government organization. I now leave that matter.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Chairman, it is most regrettable that we have to enter into this debate without having had the opportunity to study the annual report of the department. With this in mind I wish to refer the hon. the Minister to the following conclusion of the National Education Council:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Without recent and reliable data it is exceedingly difficult to give educational advice.&#x201D;</block>

<p>In this respect I should like to repeat a request I made last year. I believe that the time has come that we must work towards publishing annually or at least biennially a yearbook on education covering the whole field of education. I fully agree that without an authoritative source of comparative statistics or data it is exceedingly difficult to give advice. As long as South Africa lacks such a source, I will remain of the opinion that at times the hon. the Minister and his advisers are perhaps groping in the dark.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister inferred the other day that we are speaking in out-dated terms. He said, in particular, that we seem to be unaware of the transfer of technical schools to the provinces. This, of course, is something essential if you want to put differentiation into practice. I want to say, and we have said it before, that it is something which we on this side of the House welcome.</p>

<p>I now wish to say a few words about the whole matter of differentiated education. I want to say that whether the pupils will derive the full benefits offered by differentiation, will depend on the practical implementation of the system. I think the hon. the Minister will agree with me that the three years of junior secondary education is perhaps the most crucial period of the whole system, because this forms a period of orientation. The pupil&#x2019;s whole future will depend on how well he adapts and adjusts himself to secondary education at that stage. I want to make it quite clear that if we want to make a success of differentiation we must wake up and see to it that we have adequately and sufficiently trained people to act as guidance officers and as <span class="col_8125-8126" refersTo="page_1017"/>psychologists. I believe that this is something which is virtually non-existent in some of our schools. We must also pay more attention to the updating of standardized tests. With the whole system of differentiation the validity and reliability of these tests are of vital importance to the effective implementation of differentiation. I am concerned about this and I would like to know from the hon. the Minister what has recently been done in this field. In this day and age we find it is so easy for norms to become outdated, because we live in a completely different environment. A third problem is the matter of continuity. I think it is absolutely essential to have continuity during the three-year period of orientation. This is where I think the hon. the Minister must agree with me that it is educationally unsound to have this split between the junior secondary and the senior primary school at this stage. It is wrong to expose the pupil at this stage to a new environment with additional adjustment problems. I am quite aware of the fact that there are certain practical difficulties and that we cannot achieve this overnight, but I wonder whether the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department and other educational departments are applying their minds to the reorganization of existing facilities in order to give effect to continuity during this period. I feel that this should be absolutely essential in planning new schools. Lastly, as far as differentiation is concerned, I must say that I am very sorry that the Minister neglected to consult the teachers&#x2019; societies in this respect. I know that he has received complaints about this. I think this was an insult- to them and that should never be repeated. At the same time I want to congratulate the Minister on this matter on consulting with teachers. This is contained in the annual report of the Committee of Educational Heads, which was only tabled the day after we actually started this debate. In this report we find, regarding the various inter-departmental advisory committees, that now at least there is representation&#x2014;I will not use the word &#x201C;adequate&#x201D; because as an ex-teacher I will always feel that they should be entitled to more&#x2014;from the federal councils on these advisory committees.</p>

<p>The next aspect I want to turn to is the matter of the training of the mentally handicapped but trainable children. This is something which was transferred to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department last year from the Department of Health. There are several private organizations in South Africa with schools catering for pupils under the age of 18 years, falling into this category. They also have institutions for people over the age of 18 years. They experience no difficulties with the over 18 age group, because with them they are being assisted by the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions. But the hon. the Minister will know that the Van Wyk Report, which was brought out under the jurisdiction of the Department of Health, made certain recommendations about education, in regard to children under 18 years of age. These organizations are very keen to know whether the hon. the Minister intends introducing legislation, because they would like to put their houses in order.</p>

<p>Then I would also like to say a few words about examinations. Firstly I would like to raise the amazing departure from normal procedure which the department adopted in marking down the English A marks during the 1971 matriculation examination. It was decided to reduce the marks by 5 per cent, but instead of adopting the normal procedure of reducing it proportionately, in other words so that a person who got 50 per cent would then get 47&#x00BD; per cent, in this case I believe a straight deduction of 5 per cent throughout was made.</p>

<p>Which department was that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>The Department of National Education. A person such as I have mentioned would then get only 45 per cent instead of 47&#x00BD; per cent. I believe this was very unfair, especially to the borderline cases and it made a tremendous difference to them. Those with 44 per cent then got only 39 per cent and failed to get university exemption. The point I want to make is that this is contrary to normal procedure. The hon. the Minister and his party believe in uniformity. Let us therefore have uniformity in education. Let us at least have uniformity as far as the marking of examination papers is concerned.</p>

<p>Secondly, I am to a certain extent disappointed at the apparent inability of the department to take quick and decisive action in the event of examination irregularities. I have no desire to name individual schools, and I hope that the hon. the Minister will also refrain from doing so. I <span class="col_8127-8128" refersTo="page_1018"/>know that he is aware of the case I am referring to. I think that to have kept the obviously innocent and the alleged guilty pupils in suspense for 11 months from April, 1970, to roughly March, 1971, about the outcome of the examination results as a result of an alleged irregularity, was something that was irresponsible and unwarranted. As an ex-teacher I know that one cannot prevent these things and that they do occur, but it is the lack of alternative plans that worries me. It is not enough to just hand it over to the Police. After a while you have to make up your mind. Either the Police are going to find sufficient evidence to prosecute, or otherwise you must make up your mind yourself. In this particular case I want to say to the hon. the Minister that it was most regrettable. I hope I am wrong because of course I am not in a position to judge in all these cases because I am unaware of all the examination irregularities, but if this case can be used as a criterion, it shows a tremendous lack of action on behalf of the department and a complete absence of alternative plans.

<p>Mr. Chairman, yesterday evening when the hon. member, who has just resumed his seat, was speaking, like all the other members he expressed his concern, as far as the question of education is concerned, about so-called indoctrination allegedly taking place from the National Party&#x2019;s side, or rather as a result of the Government&#x2019;s central education plans, as they are now revealing themselves, particularly with respect to certain of their aspects, and about small children being indoctrinated if a youth preparedness programme is included in their syllabus. That was actually why several speakers opposite created a big fuss, and I want to say at the outset that I am surprised that people from Natal can make such an accusation. In addition the hon. member, who has just resumed his seat, stated that they would not have tolerated such a thing under United Party rule. However, let us analyse the facts. In Natal 86 of the 248 schools &#x2026; Now the hon. member is not listening.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. P. C. LE ROUX</person>:</from>

<p>I actually do not want to repeat this, because I do not like talking into a void. Only 86 of the 248 state schools are parallel-medium schools. The point I want to make is that Natal, which makes such a big fuss about not allowing influencing to take place there, is not prepared for the two language groups to allow their children to attend school under the same roof. In these 248 schools the percentage distribution is as follow: 34 per cent of the pupils in Natal schools are in parallel medium schools. This is in comparison with 84 per cent in the Orange Free State, 46,9 per cent in the Cape and 30 per cent in the Transvaal. The point is that Natal&#x2019;s education&#x2014;and they are actually the people who want to prescribe to us&#x2014;has thus far been so good that the provincial council, which is the highest authority in that province, has had to have a translator up to last year. They had a translation system that almost looked like that of the U.N., to give translators to the monoglots in the council, in spite of the fact that most of them were born in South Africa and grew up here. They are not all unilingual; almost all of them are bilingual; they speak English and Zulu. I can say the same of their leader. They are the ones who are now implementing and educational system in Natal for good citizens who must live in a country like South Africa, where there are two language groups.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. P. C. LE ROUX</person>:</from>

<p>If you were a horse, you would have been a mare. The result is that there in Natal they endeavour to leave education not so much in the hands of experts, but under the control of political amateurs. They are political amateurs, because the person entrusted with education there, in the United Party controlled provincial council, is a person who knows very little about education. If one knows nothing about the matter, and one depends on experts, one understands the matter. Then one can offer an excuse for such a person. But the hon. gentleman who was appointed there, a certain Mr. H. Rall&#x2014;I understand he is called &#x201C;Horace&#x201D;; if one translates that it becomes &#x201C;Gerhardus&#x201D;&#x2014;is not such a person, and he is in control of education. Sir, I just want to show you how education in Natal is abused. This gentleman is in control of education, and he has a panel of experts who are trained in education. But in the event of any reaction to the advice of <span class="col_8129-8130" refersTo="page_1019"/>this panel of experts he chooses to take his instructions politically from the people who sit here in Parliament. They then try to incite racial unrest and language unrest amongst our groups in Natal, amongst Afrikaans-speaking and English-speaking people, and the German- and Afrikaansspeaking people, because it does not suit them to have the German-speaking people side politically with the Afrikaans-speaking people. I shall give you examples. For instance, we find that when a principal must be appointed the normal procedure is simply thrown overboard holus-bolus and he is appointed without any reasons being furnished, in spite of another recommendation by the experts involved. I am referring, for example, to an incident that took place at Paulpietersburg, where a Germanspeaking person was recommended through the normal channels, whereby promotions take place on merit; in the end he was simply forced out politically, causing the German-speaking people to be offended by the incident. I can give you numerous examples of how this matter is now having political repercussions there. Because it is a ticklish question, involving racial relations and relations concerning people who are living together. I do not want to elaborate too much on it, but the point I want to make is that in Natal the school-going child is specifically being used to eventually become the citizen that will drive them apart. For example, in Natal we find the major percentage of English-speaking children in private schools. But they have a minutely worked out political plan to keep their children away from the Afrikaans children in Natal. Where they do not have a private school nearby they do not establish a nursery school, allowing those children to go to the Roman Catholic school, because the Roman Catholic school gives them an English education in protestant towns. I do not want to fight about the religion; that is not what it is all about&#x2014;it is a matter of the medium of education. From there, in the majority of cases, they are sent away to these English medium private schools, and that is where their children go to school. There are very few hon. members from Natal whose children are in parallel-medium state schools, because they are not good enough for them. They are not &#x201C;elite&#x201D; enough for them. They consequently also use education to stir up a feeling of class differences in the children they have to prepare, since education and learning are the two primary factors, so that they can eventually obtain the type of hand-fed calf we find here in Parliament.</p>

<p>I now come to the question of indoctrination, to which they refer all day long and which they are afraid of. I have noticed each of them mentioning, in season and out of season, certain organizations, such as the Rapportryers, Sabra, the Broederbond and others, in this connection. Do you know, Sir, that they do so so that these children, who are at school, may gain the impression that there are forces and organizations that want to indoctrinate them from without so that they will eventually think like the National Party or like the Afrikaners in our country.</p>

<p>Sir, let them think, then, that these children are being influenced to belong to the National Party. But I want to tell you that if I, like that hon. member, were born of one race, spoke the language of another and belonged to a third one&#x2019;s party, I would at the very least refrain from saying a word about it; then at least, when I am in the service, I would not profess to be what I am not. But, Sir, I am not going to dwell on this point because we shall possibly have an opportunity, at a later stage, to discuss the question of this organization, which is tagged as an organization allegedly introducing indoctrination into our schools, allegedly promoting &#x201C;separation&#x201D;, as hon. members opposite call it, and detrimentally influencing our children in respect of their culture and their future and in respect of their patriotism as far as the country is concerned. Because I accept the fact that hon. members on that side will also furnish me with the names of those people who are involved in the other side of that organization, which does this influencing from the other side, so that we can also try to commit character assassination, as far as they are concerned, as the United Party is committing every day as far as we are concerned.

<p>Sir, I wish to deal with a topic in which the hon. the Minister <span class="col_8131-8132" refersTo="page_1020"/>has certainly not distinguished himself during the past year. It is the subject of television and the delays in the introduction of television over the past 12 months. I go so far as to accuse this Government of obstructing and delaying the introduction of television in South Africa. This happening as a result of incompetence, as a result of reluctance, as a result of verkrampte pressure and the Government&#x2019;s fears for its own newspaper and film interests and monopolies. I have before me the Laon and the Revenue Estimates for the following year, and I ask the hon. the Minister to show me one single cent that is being provided on his Vote for television. Let him tell me where any amount for television is to be found amongst all these items. There is something in the Loan Vote for the S.A.B.C. in regard to FM services, but the word &#x201C;Television&#x201D; appears nowhere, apart from audiovisual work which we know has been going on all along. I am talking about the television service which was promised to this country last year. Sir, we have been having all sorts of propaganda about television and all sorts of reasons for the delay. We have heard fanciful statements about television costing the country R100 million a year. The country is entitled to demand, &#x201C;Stop these excuses and tell us on what date television is going to be introduced&#x201D;. We had the strangest statement in this House the other day when the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ek wil graag beklemtoon dat alhoewel 1974 as die teikendatum vir die instelling van beeldradio daargestel is, daar nog geen finale besluit ten opsigte daarvan geneem is nie. 1974 is die teikendatum, maar dit l&#x00EA; nog in die hande van die Kabinet om te besluit oor die finale datum.</block>

<p>He indicates that 1974 is the target date, not the final date. Is that still the case today? Let us hear from the hon. the Minister. Was the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs speaking the truth when he said this? Because, Sir, once that date is announced, it will take another 3&#x00BD; years before television can be introduced in this country. I want to know what his target is. Let him give us not only the year but the month, too, if that is at all possible. He has not yet told the S.A.B.C., even at this late stage, to go ahead with the introduction of television; at least that was the last reply that I had from him across the floor of the House in reply to a question of mine.</p>

<p>Sir, it is no use hiding behind the economy. The hon. the Minister does not know at this stage what the state of the economy is going to be in 2&#x00BD; or three or four years&#x2019; time when television does come, and he cannot wait until that stage arrives and then suddenly turn off the tap, put television on the shelf or in cold storage and then say that we cannot have it. That is the type of talk, incidentally, that we have been having too, from the hon. the Minister of Finance. Sir, why is this target date so important? The hon. the Minister himself gave the reply. Some time ago he warned local manufacturers of television sets: &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t start the production of television sets before the Cabinet announces the date of the introduction of television; it will depend on the state of the economy at the time.&#x201D; Sir, I say that the time has arrived now to announce the date of the introduction of television, because the whole country is waiting; the S.A.B.C. is waiting, the Post Office is waiting, commerce is waiting, industry is waiting &#x2026;</p>

<p>This Television Commission took evidence from all the bodies concerned; it took evidence from commerce and industry, the Press, the Performing Arts Council, the film industry, the S.A.B.C., the electronics industry and the Government departments themselves. All these people gave full evidence, and their evidence was published more than a year ago, but then the hon. the Minister decided that there had to be some further delay and that he needed some further information, and now this whole question of television is bogged down in this technical advisory committee that we have at the moment. What is happening with regard to that committee? They have given very little information to the country. They have announced the PAL system; they have announced that five companies will be manufacturing television sets, and we have been told a few other things, but only last month in the <i>Government Gazette</i> those <span class="col_8133-8134" refersTo="page_1021"/>people who want to manufacture components of television sets and antennae were at last asked to hand in their names to the Department of Commerce and Industry before, I think, the 31st March&#x2014;that shows how long they have been waiting to get down to the whole question of television in South Africa. After all, Sir, only the cost of the first service need concern us here. The capital costs for a bilingual service, as pointed out by the commission, will not be more than R34 million, and that would include the cost of the satellite ground station. Yet here we have a mystery. The Television Commission says that the satellite ground station will cost R1&#x00BD; million. But the Postmaster-General came along the other day and said that the satellite ground station would not cost R1&#x00BD; million; it will now suddenly cost R4 million. Is the Post Office trying to put a spoke in the wheel of television? Why have these costs escalated so suddenly? The hon. the Minister should know the answer in that regard. After all, the capital outlay will be small. As the commission is at pains to point out, it will be less than one per cent of the country&#x2019;s annual gross domestic investment. Here I take off my hat to Mr. J. M. Swanepoel, Director-in-Chief of the S.A.B.C., who said that the capital needed for television would be peanuts in our economy. The Government must not come along with the argument, therefore, that the costs will be too great.</p>

<p>Why should we be the 119th country in the world to get television, when the smallest countries in Africa already have it? Sir, it is a sign of the lack of ability of the Government. If it were not for the United Party, this country would never get television. Sir, we hear a lot about the labour shortage in this country. We are told that that is also going to create difficulties for the introduction of television. That may be one of the reasons for the present delay and for the fact that they are dragging their feet, but even this problem is not as serious as it is some times made out to be. The S.A.B.C. itself told the Television Commission that it would require only 1 000 persons to operate the service, while the manufacturers and distributors in allied industries would also demand a comparable number of additional workers. This commission pointed out that only 10 engineers assisted by about 140 other workers, could produce 300 black and white sets every day. But what is this Government at present doing in regard to the training of technicians and repairmen for television? I am not talking about the universities where courses have been started, or about the training school at Doornfontein. I want to know what the Government, and its Technical Advisory Committee have done to get this training programme going, because we will need these trained men and every minute&#x2019;s delay is delaying television longer than it should. Of course he has his problems with the Government policy. He is afraid to train too many non-Whites. He has probably read of the case in Jeffreys Bay where a city councillor actually resigned because a Coloured person was appointed as a meter reader. Sir, can you imagine the problems facing that party when a Coloured person goes to repair a TV set in a home? We need this television industry. We need it as a stimulus to our economy, to stimulate activity and growth in South Africa, to stimulate the manufacture of section components, cabinet making, the electronics industry, the chemical industry and the manufacture of precision instruments. In a few short years, and unless some of the stupid things envisaged today are going to be introduced, South Africa can become an exporter of sets to other countries.</p>

<p>It is a long time since we have heard so presumptuous a speech in this House. The hon. member for Orange Grove, who has just resumed his seat, stressed here with great emphasis that the one thing he expects is the immediate introduction of television, that it should be introduced more quickly than it can be introduced. I am now just wondering why he is so concerned about the advent <span class="col_8135-8136" refersTo="page_1022"/>of television. If he would just look at the latest annual report of the S.A.B.C., he would see very clearly what has been done in the past year to make the introduction of television possible in a way that would be best suited to us in South Africa. At the moment I do not have the time to deal with everything, but I think I should read a few extracts from this report, for example&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The first step in carrying out the Government&#x2019;s instruction to plan, prepare and present a coloured television service for South Africa was the formation of a team of experts possessing the necessary knowledge and experience to advise the S.A.B.C.</block>

<p>In contrast with the United Party the National Party has always set itself to carrying out properly whatever it has undertaken to do, and what is contained in this report underlines the standpoint of the National Party, i.e. that the National Party does not over-hastily plunge into everything like the United Party. Here is the first step that has been taken, and it has been done properly. People with this knowledge, skill and learning surely do not fall like manna from heaven. They must first be trained, after all, and here this is being done, and being done properly.</p>

<p>If one takes a further look at other matters that received the committee&#x2019;s attention, one finds that they include the economic implications of our television service, the training of staff, cable systems, the financing of close circuit systems, control of the programmes to be presented over such systems and the protection of the public against exploitation by the import or production of obsolete receiving sets. With these few words, I think, a case has been made out to prove that in accordance with the proclaimed policy of the Government, work is being done along specific lines to make television available to us as quickly and rapidly as possible. But I am now wondering why the hon. member is so keen to have television here so quickly. What is the reason? What is his motive?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Because we are the last in the world.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#grobler">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. S. J. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>I think that a great deal more is at stake, as far as that hon. member is concerned, than the reason he has just given, i.e. that we are the last in the world. What does it matter? If the world jumps into the fire tomorrow, we are surely not going to follow suit. But the fact of the matter is that that hon. member, as the United Party side&#x2019;s main speaker on television, has always hoped that when a television service is introduced in South Africa it will be a service that will be useful to the objects of the United Party; and those objects do not include obtaining a service that will be useful to whatever is peculiar to the Whites of South Africa in the first place&#x2014;I do not want to speak about the other races. They want a commercialized service that will consequently drive in a wedge as far as our culture and religion are concerned; in other words, the obliteration of cultural and religious boundaries, because they hope thereby to condition the people in such a way that they will be able to derive political gain from it. That is the only reason, and I do not think the White population in South Africa will tolerate such a standpoint. It is therefore with the utmost confidence that South Africa places this matter, and the handling of this matter, i.e. the introduction of television, in the hands of this Minister and the Government.</p>

<p>I should very much like to bring a few matters to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention on this occasion. In the first place I want to refer to an allegation that was made very recently to the effect that only 50 per cent of the 1966 Std. VI pupils completed the matriculation examination in the Transvaal in 1970. The figures for the Witwatersrand were only 33 per cent. If the Witwatersrand is not taken into account, 60 per cent of the Transvaal pupils, who were in Std. VI in 1966, completed the matriculation examination in 1970. It worries me that our children on the Rand are falling behind, and I want to ask the hon. the Minister if it is not possible to go into the causes that are driving our children out <span class="col_8137-8138" refersTo="page_1023"/>of school between Std. VI and matric. I do not think it can be ascribed, in every instance, to a lack of intellectual ability.</p>

<p>A second matter I specifically want to bring to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention is the question of the language medium in the education of immigrant children. According to calculations between 10 000 and 11 000 children under the age of 15 years enter the country every year, and about 65 per cent of these pupils are from non-English language countries. I now want to ask why a child who comes from the Netherlands, or a child who is of German decent and who has picked up a few words of English on board ship, should be sent to an English medium school. Why is it necessary to decide that if he knows one or two words of English he will consequently be competent in English and therefore have to go to an English medium school? I think the time has now come, and this is not only in the interests of immigration, but also in the interests of good relations in South Africa, for prospective immigrants, who want to immigrate to South Africa, to be informed in advance about the fact that two languages are spoken in South Africa and that Afrikaans is used by about 60 per cent of the population. It must also be pointed out to them that for the sake of their children&#x2019;s future it would be in their interests to send their children to Afrikaans medium schools. I can give hon. members the assurance that I have discussed this matter on various occasions with school principals. They all agree with me that immigrant children, and I am now speaking of the immigrants from non-English language countries, would be very welcome in the Afrikaans schools. I honestly believe that if this is implemented it would not only promote immigration to South Africa, but that there would also be much better relations between the indigenous population and the immigrants. I also want to tell hon. members that it has been my experience that even English language immigrants tell me they would prefer to send their children to Afrikaans medium schools if it were possible. In this connection I should also like to ask whether the hon. the Minister would not consider the further extension of facilities at technical colleges and other institutions that supply language instruction.

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to continue on the subject of television, briefly. I believe it is time that the Government should take the following steps, and that this should be done immediately, when it comes to the subject of television. First of all, the target date and the target month must be set. I know there is division in Government ranks and in the Cabinet about television, but let the hon. Minister at least try to put his foot down in regard to this matter. I know that some of his young members, the hon. member for Moorreesburg, the hon. member for Vasco and the hon. member for False Bay, are already taking lessons in television presentation, having their noses powdered and all that. [Interjections.] They have their faces made up and they buy powder-blue shirts, but at the same time there are still quite senior officials in certain Government departments, Whom I shall not name, who are spreading the story that television will never be introduced. The second thing the hon. Minister should do is to urge the Technical Advisory Committee to get on with its job. Any member on that committee who has any doubt as to whether television should be introduced should immediately resign from that committee. I was horrified when I heard the hon. the Minister say some time ago that there is no time limit for the work of the Television Advisory Committee to be completed. Surely it is time that he set such a time limit?</p>

<p>Thirdly, I say that the plans for the manufacturing of sets should be speeded up. Here again the Government is the brake on this advance. I admit that the Department of Commerce and Industries has taken some initiative in this matter, but the Minister is the person who is responsible for the work of the Technical Advisory Committee and for the introduction of television. He can do more in that regard. Why did the Department of Industries ask only in March this year for firms to tell which components and which they were able to produce for television?</p>

<p>Fourthly&#x2014;and this is something commerce and industry are waiting for&#x2014;he should announce the percentage local content of sets and the target number of sets for the first year. The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs told me that these things would be announced in the near future. He told me that in February. Since the &#x201C;near future&#x201D; has passed, if I may use an expression which is not quite logical, it is time that these things should be done. It is time that the S.A.B.C. should lay down <span class="col_8139-8140" refersTo="page_1024"/>all the necessary standards for the manufacture of such sets.</p>

<p>Fifthly, the building of that satellite station, which is essential for getting good overseas programmes, should be started immediately. Two should be built: one by the Post Office and one by the S.A.B.C. Something should be done immediately. More than one African country will already have such ground stations before 1974.</p>

<p>Sixthly, universities and technical colleges should institute training and study courses in television for certificates as well as for degrees as a matter of urgency. Do not let him tell me that some have already done so. It should be done on a much larger scale.</p>

<p>Seventhly, the S.A.B.C. should officially be given the green light to introduce television. They have not been given permission as they should be given under the Broadcast Act, by the law of this country. I know there is rumour of a secret little statement having been made to them: &#x201C;Now, look, this is your secret target date.&#x201D; I have also heard the target date. The S.A.B.C. was told: &#x201C;See that you are ready by then, but we cannot publicise it.&#x201D; I think that is not honest towards industry and commerce in this country. This target date should be announced openly.</p>

<p>Eighthly, I believe that all effort should at this stage be concentrated on the first nation-wide service. All the prophets of economic doom can be pacified by delaying the introduction of separate language services as distinct from the single service. Do not come to us with this old story of priorities again, I beg of you, Mr. Minister. We all know that the Government prefers prisons to hospitals, but I am quite sure that the Government would not stop building hospitals on the grounds of preferring prisons. At the same time South Africa needs telephones more than television, but why should it stop television just on account of the fact that we do not have sufficient telephones in this country?</p>

<p>In the few minutes left to me I want to deal with another topic, namely, as the hon. the Minister might have guessed, the South African Broadcasting Corporation of which he is the new unofficial chairman.</p>

<p>If the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s remarks were only as intelligent as Mrs. Warning&#x2019;s interesting although hostile articles, I would have listened to him on the subject of television. Once again we have had a year in which the S.A.B.C. has been entertaining and upsetting, annoying, pleasing and boring its listeners. We have no opportunity as parliamentarians of discussing its activities except for these very few short minutes which are allowed us every year. The hon. the Minister himself, when questions are put to him, is as reticent as ever in the past. I asked him whether the S.A.B.C. consulted him in regard to the buying of the Lourenco Marques station. He said: &#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; Then I asked him: What did they pay, &#x201C;wat is die finansi&#x00EB;le implikasies&#x201D;, what other arrangements were made?

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>The reply in respect to the questions about L.M. Radio? I do not know the reply. Anyhow, I will think of that jingle later. I am serious about this question of Lourenco Marques Radio and its taking over. There have been unsatisfactory developments since then. A radio missionary station broadcasting Christian sermons has been asked to close down its broadcasts on the 60 and 90 metre band since this Government has taken over L.M. Radio. The latter received an income of close to R40 000 per year from that. But now these destroyers of Christianity, one can almost call them, have done that to L.M. Radio and those particular broadcasts are no longer allowed, while there are similar mission stations and mission broadcasts in 55 countries of the world, all the countries of the world, except, naturally as hon. members will know, in the communist countries, Russia, China and their like. We want to know more about what has been happening in regard to L.M. Radio after it has been taken over, and about this religious censorship that has now been imposed by the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p><span class="col_8141-8142" refersTo="page_1025"/>One cannot expect a great advance in the S.A.B.C., not after Dr. Piet Meyer was reappointed as chairman at the end of last year. He will be 65 years old when television is probably introduced. One can also not expect a great advance when one finds that another Broederbonder, who might be one of the big 12, a Mr. J. H. Stander, has now been appointed vice chairman of the Board of Governors of the S.A.B.C. He is probably the chairman designate for the future. That is ominous for the future. As far as I can see, there are only two English-speaking members on the nine-man Board of Governors. If one ever has the right to speak of English-haters, listen to this, Frankie; and talk to your Minister about it.</p>

<p>The S.A.B.C. has a big task in regard to television, one of the biggest tasks of all. The Director-in-Chief is chairman of the Television Advisory Committee. They are going to erect huge buildings. They are demanding hundreds of millions from Parliament. They are asking for permits to raise loans of millions of rands abroad. However, we cannot get the information from the hon. the Minister as to what is happening. Two television transmitters have been bought recently. If I were to ask him something about that, the hon. the Minister would not tell us anything.</p>

<p>The next point about the S.A.B.C. is the slanting which is continuing in the programme &#x201C;Current Affairs&#x201D; and here I am fortunate that I can now quote the newspapers which support the Government. I can show the hon. the Minister the headlines of <i>Rapport</i> of 2nd April this year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Baie s&#x00EA; die S.A.U.K. is partydig. Die luisteraars dink nie veel van die objektiwiteit van die S.A.U.K. nie. Byna die helfte van die Suid-Afrikaners wat in &#x2018;n meningsopname ondervra is, s&#x00EA; dat di&#x00E9; radioprogram bevooroordeeld is.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we have again heard old Jeremiah here this afternoon with all his complaints and nothing positive from his side. Sometimes he makes me think that he is an immature child who has been promised a present and who cannot wait to get it. I do want to say to that hon. member that the National Party Government is not going to allow itself to be dictated to in regard to when television will be introduced here. The hon. the Minister postulated to us a date on which he should like television to be introduced in South Africa, and if it can be done I think that he will do it. If, owing to circumstances, it cannot be done, we will not allow ourselves to be dictated to by the United Party, and even less by the industrialists who have no other object in mind but to make money out of it.</p>

<p>South Africa&#x2014;we know our South Africans&#x2014;knows that the National Party Government has kept every promise it has made. Iscor was promised to the South Africans; Iscor was established. Sasol was promised to them; Sasol was established, despite all the derogatory and destructive criticism we heard from that side.</p>

<p>If they had to introduce television, it would for them simply have been a question of telling the people that they should buy television sets and that they, as the United Party, would import the programmes from England or America. That is what they would have wanted to dish up to our people.</p>

<p>I should like to confine myself to another subject which deals with the Rand Afrikaans University. The latest census analysis is not yet available but according to estimates there are at present approximately 450 000 Afrikaans-speaking persons living on the entire Witwatersrand. It is also calculated that for every one Afrikaans-speaking engineer, there are seven English-speaking engineers. This finding is confirmed by the finding of the Straszacker Commission that the greatest unutilized potential for engineering training is in fact <span class="col_8143-8144" refersTo="page_1026"/>to be found among the Afrikaans-speaking sector of our population. Apart from the fact that we have that unutilized potential there, I think that the shortage of engineers is also having a tremendously restrictive effect on the economic development of our country. The Human Sciences Research Council calculated last year that by the year 1980 South Africa would need approximately 17 800 engineers. In order to eliminate that shortage approximately 540 engineers would have to be produced annually between now and 1980. At present approximately 420 are being produced annually. In order to maintain this average of 540 it will be necessary during the first few years to train approximately 640 per annum. I think, and this also appears to be true, that our existing faculties cannot produce the envisaged number of engineers, even if the necessary expansions were provided. I know that there are other universities which have applied for an engineering faculty, but I nevertheless want to advocate very seriously to the Minister today that this should be granted to the Rand Afrikaans University, because it is in fact on the Witwatersrand where one finds the greatest student potential. What is more, the Witwatersrand is also the heartland of our industries. There are many of our parents who would like to send their children to a university but who unfortunately do not have the economic means of making it possible for those children to study further. However, I believe that if these children can stay at their homes on the Witwatersrand while studying, this training can in fact be given to those students with far less expense. The position is that we on the Witwatersrand are saddled with the University of the Witwatersrand, and no parent who can help it will send a child to that university.</p>

<p>Recently we saw the type of thing that is going on there. When a motion was introduced in this House on that filthy publication issued at that university the hon. Opposition expressed their disapproval of it, but they added that it was merely undergraduate humour. I should just like to quote a short report which appeared in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> of 12th May, in which the following was stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The cartoon in the newspaper &#x201C;Wits Student&#x201D; that created a national storm was not a joke, but a serious critical comment, Mr. Mark Douglas Home, the newspaper editor, who was deported, said when he arrived in London yesterday. &#x201C;This cartoon meant what it said,&#x201D; Mr. Douglas Home told reporters.</block>

<p>I am simply putting it to hon. members on the opposite side that it was not such innocent undergraduate humour after all. I want to ask the hon. the Minister that we should not have to allow our children who come from homes where they have had an upbringing to be thrown to the wolves of the University of the Witwatersrand.</p>

<p>Now I know the hon. the Minister announced last year that a two year course would be introduced at the R.A.U. and at Potchefstroom University and that it would be possible to establish liaison with the other universities so that they could go on to complete their courses there. I made inquiries, and the guarantee could not be given to me that all the subjects taught at those universities at which the two year course is being offered will be recognized by those universities with the full-fledged faculties. Therefore I do nevertheless want to make a serious appeal to the hon. the Minister, on behalf of the Afrikaans-speaking parents of the Witwatersrand, to give those children of ours that faculty so that they can receive training there.</p>

<p>Thank you, Sir, I went to that university myself and &#x2026; [Interjections.] There are many other Afrikaners who also studied at that university, some of whom are Nationalists. There are a tremendous number of Afrikaners who are receiving good training there. If you speak to anyone of them, they will tell you that they received the best training in the country, in the particular direction in which they studied. [Interjections.] If that hon. member wants to allege that I am a typical product of the University of the Witwatersrand, I wish them everything of the best.</p>

<p>There is something else the hon. member for Boksburg failed to do, he did not listen to the hon. member for Orange Grove when he spoke. He said that he made no suggestions and did nothing positive. But of course he did! I have here a whole long list of suggestions he made to the hon. the Minister, but the hon. member did not even hear these.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Springs made precisely the same mistake He said that there was far more at stake for the hon member for Orange Grove because the United Party supposedly wants to indoctrinate the people by means of television. Sir, that is nonsensical, for the hon. member for Orange Grove not only said that the United Party would introduce television when it comes into power, but he also made strong representations to the effect that the Government should introduce television. If he is agitating for the Government to introduce television, surely he is not doing so because he has the idea at the back of his mind that the United Party wants to indoctrinate people. But that hon. member obviously adopts the attitude that attack is the best form of defence. He feels guilty himself, because he is himself implicated in this matter, and that is why he is trying to foist his sins and the sins of that side on us, which is of course the lowest possible form of politicking.</p>

<p>Sir, there is another problem in regard to television, and here I want to associate myself with what the hon. member for Orange Grove has already said. He referred to this delay in the introduction of television, and the ignorance in which this entire question is at present shrouded. We realize that there are various problems in regard to the establishment of a television service in South Africa, but we deplore the fact that the Government is keeping the entire matter in the dark. The entire country is at the moment still uncertain about the details of the system. The country wants to know how these problems which are going to crop up are going to be dealt with by the hon. the Minister, for we want television to become a reality, we want to make certain that we are going to have a good service, and that we are going to get it as quickly as possible. That is why I want to know, and I believe that we are entitled to know, how the Minister is going to deal with these problems. I want to mention a few ideas to the hon. the Minister and inquire along what lines he 1s thinking in this respect. The Minister stated in the past that we are going to have black and white television. He also said that we are going to have four screen sizes. As we know, a screen is the most important component in coloured television. It is also the most complicated and consequently the most expensive component.</p>

My information is that even in the first year the loss in foreign exchange could amount to as much as R22&#x00BE; million if we had to import all the tubes. If we manufacture them here we will have to have four different manufacturing plants, one for each size of tube, because one plant cannot manufacture more than one size of tube. This is in itself a tremendous task, particularly if one takes into account that there are five major world wide companies that will want to distribute their products here. If we allow all of them to manufacture tubes here, then there will be 20 manufacturing plants, and we should like to know what the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attitude in this regard is.</p>

<p>The next aspect I should like to deal with is the question of service, for in television after-sales and maintenance service is one of the most important matters. I think that we can learn a tremendous amount here from the experience gained by the major international telecommunications companies in other countries in the past. My information is that one receives an average of five calls per set per annum for service, in the case of colour television, and three calls per annum for service for a black and white set. Sir, I am only counting emergency calls now; in other words, when there is really something wrong. One also receives many nuisance value calls which of course require a great deal of time as well. But there the fault is usually that the set has not been switched on, or that the aerial has not been connected. I am talking now about emergency calls. The average is five for colour sets and three for black and white sets. If we are able to sell 50 000 colour sets in the first year&#x2014;and I do not think that this is impossible&#x2014;and 200 000 black and white sets, there will during that year be 1 350 000 calls which will require technical skill. Every call takes an average of one hour; in other words, in the first year we will have to spend 1 350 000 technical man hours on service. In addition it will mean that in the first year we will require 680 trained television technicians. Calculated on the same basis we will after five years require 3 500 trained technicians, working full time on television. We must take into account that at the moment there are no trained technicians in South Africa. The quickest and easiest solution will be to train existing telecommunications technicians because they already have most of the basic knowledge, but there are no large-scale facilities for training these people, as the hon. member for Orange Grove has already pointed out. Thirdly, today we only have two-thirds of the telecommunications technicians we require to maintain our present telecommunications services, and our telephone service is in fact deplorable. We cannot therefore take any of those technicians and use them in regard to television since, in the first place, the telecommunications services will then be even poorer than they are at the moment and, secondly, since the service for television is also going to be hopeless as a result of the shortage of technicians there.</p>

<p>I should like to know how the Minister is approaching these problems. Sir, the second problem I can foresee will be caused specifically by the use of four tube sizes, for as I have already said, there are five major manufacturers, and each one of them makes tubes of four different sizes. There are therefore 20 different sets on the market, each with its own chassis and each with its own wiring diagram. [Time expired.]</p>

He spoke about things he actually knows nothing about, and I believe the hon. the Minister will <span class="col_8149-8150" refersTo="page_1029"/>accordingly give him the necessary information.</p>

<p>I want to come back to another matter, and that is the question of indoctrination, which was condemned by the hon. member for Wynberg, the hon. member for Durban North and several hon. members on that side. Sir, I want to tell the Opposition that if youth preparedness is indoctrination, then I am a supporter of indoctrination.</p>

<p>*Mr. F. J. LE ROUX (Hercules): I want to emphasize that we should then indoctrinate as energetically and quickly as we possibly can. Sir, the fact remains that a tremendous onslaught is being made on the human spirit; a war is being waged for the soul of man. That onslaught is mercilessly being launched on a world-wide scale. The onslaught on South Africa is that much fiercer and more specifically directed at our youth. We shall have to aim at being more intensely interested in this programme of youth preparedness in our schools. We shall have to plan and organize, because who but the Communists are planning and organizing these onslaughts in South Africa? I shall quote to you what Lawrenti Berk said, and I would appreciate it very much if hon. members opposite would listen very carefully. He was the former head of Russia&#x2019;s secret police, and he himself became the victim of Kruschev and his comrades. He was shot dead by them. He said this (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">By making certain drugs easily obtainable by praising wildness and by stimulating young people with reading matter about sex, the psycho-political operator can create the necessary atmosphere of chaos, idleness &#x2026;</block>

<p>*Mr. F. J. LE ROUX (Hercules): I shall ask only this one question. What are their norms? What are their standards? What else would they like to have? Or do they not believe these things that Beria prescribed to let Communism take root? If one has lost one&#x2019;s principles one has lost everything, because then one is no longer fighting. Then one has nothing more to fight for. The human heart is the centre of the whole personality. The centre point and origin of human thought is will and feeling. This is the source of every expression of life, and if we do not watch over the heart of man, if we do not guard our own hearts, we shall decline and pay dearly for it. I therefore want to ask the hon. the Minister to give a great deal of attention to this matter&#x2014;there has already been a plea in that connection.</p>

<p>Well, last year I spoke of Nusas, which wanted no part in the Republic Festival. I have said that the devil finds work for idle hands. I afterwards received a letter from Nusas in which the chairman informed me that they have a great deal of work to do, that they are even making funds available in the homelands for hospitals and schools. I made inquiries at the Department of Bantu Education. They told me they had absolutely no knowledge of that. I am just mentioning this for your general information. Since people are speaking about idleness, and since these Communist influences want people to be idle, they surely know they will achieve their object.</p>

<p>I want to come to the question of rands and cents as our monetary units and to the metric system which our Government introduced, aspects that make the process of calculation much easier for our schools, etc. I just want to say in passing that in my humble opinion there is no such thing as a &#x201C;r&#x00EA;nd&#x201D;. There is definitely no such thing. When the monetary system was introduced, it was found that the name would be &#x201C;rand&#x201D;, which is derived from &#x201C;Witwatersrarid&#x201D;. After all, we do not speak of &#x201C;White Watersrand&#x201D;. Neither do we speak; of &#x201C;Koekemoer&#x201D; as &#x201C;Koukemouer&#x201D;: Neither do we speak of &#x201C;Koekemoer&#x201D; as &#x201C;Kou&#x00EA;kemdor&#x201D;. I now want to <span class="col_8151-8152" refersTo="page_1030"/>express my appreciation for the fact that there are English-speaking people in our country who pronounce the word as &#x201C;rand&#x201D;. Since we have done these fine things, I want to ask the Minister whether the time has not come for us to look at our method of counting. Our method of counting actually creates problems at our primary schools. If I may mention the figure &#x201C;27&#x201D; as an example, it is found that the &#x201C;7&#x201D; is actually emphasized and that we are, in actual fact, counting from back to front, instead of from front to back or from left to right, the way we do when we write. If I may take the figure &#x201C;345&#x201D;&#x2014;we pronounce it as follows. We start on the left and then jump right across to the right-hand side, and then we come back to the middle. We would not be the only people or the only country that could do it in an easier and more acceptable way, i.e. if we were to speak of &#x201C;twintig sewe&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;sewe-en-twintig&#x201D;. Then we would, in any case, be linking up with the English usage of &#x201C;twenty-seven&#x201D;. South Africa is a bilingual country. The Greeks, Italians and other people do it in this way, without having any problems with fractions or whatever the case may be. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. A. VAN HOOGSTRATEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I hope the hon. member will pardon me if I do not react to the argument he has made. This evening I welcome the opportunity to deal with a particular matter.</p>

<p>That is the report of the committee of inquiry into the treatment, education and care of autistic children. This report has just been issued by the Department of National Education with the report No.</p>

<p>R.P.26/72. I want to commend the Minister and his department for their sympathetic consideration which they have shown to the plight of this little-known group of children, whose distress has only become more pertinently known in recent years. It is because only too few members in this House have any knowledge whatsoever of the incidence of what is known as early childhood autism and of the children who suffer from such defects, that I want to deal briefly with some of the recommendations of this report. I also want to deal with their decision as to how the young children can best be handled. It is only recently that autism amongst children has been recognized as a specific ailment. Members who have not either studied this report or who are unaware of it, may well ask what autism is. It is important that they should have an answer. Autistic children are those who from the beginning of their lives are unable to react to people. Whenever possible, they disregard and shut out everything that comes to them from the outside world. They show a severe self-centred aloneness, are almost unable to speak as they grow older, and they seem to do everything within their power in order to maintain the sameness of their environment. These children do not react socially, they avoid eye-to-eye gaze, and they fail to develop any normal relationships with people. For example, and herein lies their special tragedy, they do not seem to form any bonds with their parents, nor with their brothers or sisters. It is only recently that it has been recognized that early childhood autism constitutes a clinically recognized syndrome starting before the age of three years and characterized by self-absorbed and detached behaviour, language disturbances and ritual compulsive phenomena. Autistic children are found in every group of our population, their parents are amongst the wealthy, the intelligent, the poor and the not so intelligent. Amongst the White population group in South Africa the probable number of children who are suffering from this ailment lies between the figures of 300 and 600. These children are suffering from one of the most frustrating handicaps imaginable. They live in a baffling state in which the symptoms are non-communication, lack of responce and an apparent inability to use a locked-away intelligence. But in all other respects they may be perfectly normal physically. If these children are to be restored to normal functioning and behaviour, it is important that highly individualized treatment and very special methods of education should be made available to them from pre-school years. Should this help not be given at this critical time, the child will almost certainly become increasingly withdrawn and emotionally abnormal and unstable and his intellectual potential will be lost to our country forever. I was first brought into contact with autistic children when I was asked to assist in the raising of funds to finance a shool in Claremont, Cape Town, which offers a haven for these little children and which is under the care of a specially qualified teacher who has had long experience with autistic disturbances. This <span class="col_8153-8154" refersTo="page_1031"/>school is the School for Autistic Children in Claremont, Cape Town. It was an act of faith made imperative by the knowledge that with each month of delay in providing for special intensive care, these little children could well be denied the hope of living a full and normal life. If there are hon. members in this House who are parents of an autistic child, they will know the agony of despair which is shared by families into which an autistic child is born. Clearly autism is now coming to the notice of educational authorities, so much so that the hon. the Minister of Education, through the Department of National Education, has given deep thought to how autism amongst our South African children can best be dealt with. In the report itself, the committee has recommended that children suffering from early childhood autism should be considered as handicapped children who should have the opportunity of receiving special education in a special school and that early childhood autism should be added to Schedule I of the Educational Services Act, No. 41 of 1967. The committee has gone even further and recommended that children with early childhood autism should be given sympathetic consideration and that subsidies should be granted on the same basis as is the case in other specialized subsidized schools. The committee has also recognized that the treatment of these children is specialized, and that the maximum number of children in such a school should be 30. Where there is a boarding establishment, the maximum number of boarders is only 12. This highlights the fact that the handling of these children is inordinately expensive. In fact, it has been established that in a school of this nature the cost per child is in excess of R1 600 per annum. It has also been found that parents can often not afford to pay more than R100 annually. Experience has also shown that the ratio of teachers to children is one to three and that in addition a principal and a viceprincipal are necessary. There must also be psychological assistance. I therefore plead with the hon. the Minister today to investigate the possibility of the State playing a greater part in bringing about the existence of these schools, not only in the Cape, where there is one already, and the Transvaal, but in every major centre where autistic children are requiring assistance. I feel that if this can be done, we in South Africa shall have recognized this ailment for what it is and we shall have realized that we, who are privileged to have families who do not suffer because of the existence amongst all ranks of one of these children, and the State, can well afford to bear that additional expenditure which is necessary. Possibly the State itself can create these institutions, but if not, I ask whether the hon. the Minister and his department will give sympathetic consideration towards far more liberal allowances and subsidies being made available to those persons and those institutions who are prepared to sacrifice themselves and their lives and to dedicate themselves to the handling of these children between the ages of one and three and thereafter in the slightly older stages where they may be able to be given education, between the ages of four and twelve. If we can achieve this in this department which has such a responsibility for our young people, then we shall have achieved something more than merely discussing doctrination and indoctrination at various levels.</p>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens raised an important matter. These are children who, of course, cannot gain anything from ordinary education and they are actually known as uneducable children, or &#x201C;onopvoedbare kinders&#x201D; in Afrikaans. The hon. member advocated that greater allowances be allocated. These are children we all sympathize with, and I believe the hon. the Minister will reply to him about that in due course.</p>

<p>The other day, and again this afternoon, the hon. member for Wynberg made this remark, by way of an interjection, about the subject youth preparedness: Why teach the girls to shoot? One of the biggest complaints she has against youth preparedness is that girls are being taught to shoot &#x2014;as if a great war is on the way. I found it interesting a few days ago to come across a leading article in one of the English-language newspapers. I should like to quote the article. It appeared in the <i>Pretoria News</i> of 15th May of this year and reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A course starts in Pretoria next week to teach women how to handle firearms. It is being organized by the Junior Chamber of Commerce with the help of the South African Police who will provide the expert knowledge. The idea is not to breed a tribe of emancipated gun-women, but to teach the average <span class="col_8155-8156" refersTo="page_1032"/>housewife how to react when a fire-arm comes into her hands. Too many women, even in these days of women&#x2019;s lib, do not know the difference between a muzzle and a trigger or where the cartridge goes in and the bullet comes out. It is this lack of elementary knowledge which could lead to dangerous situations.</block>

<p>If this well-known organization thinks it important that even women should know how to handle a weapon, why does she make such a fuss because young girls in matric, or whatever the case may be, are also being taught to handle weapons under expert tuition? I hope the hon. member will now stop asking each time why girls must be taught to shoot.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove, and also another hon. member, spoke about television again. I find it interesting that the hon. members, and particularly the hon. member for Orange Grove, are demanding here quite theatrically that the hon. the Minister must mention the date&#x2014; he must state &#x201C;what is the date and what is the target&#x201D;&#x2014;for its introduction. The hon. member therefore wants television to be introduced at a certain time, regardless of the cost and regardless of the country&#x2019;s economic position. The Government has said in the post that we do not want to introduce television here solely with a view to its being a status symbol or with the idea of its being a prestige project. This is what many countries of Africa, who could not afford it, did in fact do. When the hon. member for Springs spoke and asked why hon. members are in such a hurry, one of them replied: &#x201C;Because we are the last country that does not have television yet.&#x201D; Just imagine, that is now the reason why the United Party wants to hurry so with the introduction of television.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove also referred to the old matter that he always deals with, i.e. radio and the bias of the South African Broadcasting Corporation. He also referred to the programme &#x201C;Current Affairs&#x201D;. All of us know that the S.A.B.C. is a widely branching communications medium which regards the supplying of information as an extremely important function. They also fulfil that function. The S.A.B.C.&#x2019;s news staff makes a masterful success, in my opinion, creating a news image, from that great diversity of news reports every day, which presents listeners with a factual report of events. This report is kept separate from the analysis and interpretation of that report. This purely objective mentioning of hard and concrete news facts is no longer adequate to furnish comprehensive information. That is why this 1971 annual report of the South African Broadcasting Corporation states the matter so convincingly on page 8, as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">Not only must the hard news facts be completely and continually reflected to all the peoples of this country and also all target areas abroad, but as soon as possible afterwards the important or significant developments must be located and analysed; a critical view must be taken, and comment within a total context made; and important situations must be examined and elucidated in depth.</block>

<p>This is exactly what the S.A.B.C. does in a particularly competent and successful manner. By means of the informative analysis and interpretation of the flood of occurrences, the in-depth image is projected and focused on South Africa. I am thinking, in particular, of the short though forceful daily news commentary of only two minutes that is supplied after the news broadcast at 7 o&#x2019;clock in the evening on the Afrikaans and English services. One just thinks, for example, of the brief report yesterday evening in connection with the hijacking of the aircraft, which was a correct and neatly summarized report.</p>

<p>Except for the meaningful analysis and interpretation, the microphone is brought to the news scene or the newsmakers come to the microphone. With these news broadcasts the S.A.B.C. has, in my opinion, gained a unique achievement. According to the report to which I have referred, 239 news bulletins are broadcast in 18 services on a week day. This is done in 19 languages in the internal and external services and Radio Bantu. In addition there is still the great variety of background commentary. There are the variety of opinion programmes, and one of these daily news programmes is, <i>inter alia,</i> the well-known &#x201C;News at 9&#x201D; and &#x201C;Nuus om 9&#x201D;. Then there is also &#x201C;Week-end Newsroom&#x201D; on the English service. Here there is chiefly a sketching and interpretation of the background to events and trends.</p>

<p>Now we come to the much criticized &#x201C;Current Affairs&#x201D;. Just these few thoughts about that, Sir, I should like to refer with appreciation to this report, which is actually <span class="col_8157-8158" refersTo="page_1033"/>regarded as the leading article of the South African Broadcasting Corporation. I now just want to tell hon. members that they should take a quick look at this report. The number of listeners to this report, both Afrikaans and English, has increased further during the past year. If the people do not like this broadcast, why is the listenership increasing? Some listeners label this valuable and highly necessary concentrate mere propaganda, and thus do a disservice to this excellent, informative report which, as I should like to put it, reacts barometrically local and world events.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the few minutes available before the adjournment, I do not intend to reply to the points raised by the hon. member for Koedoespoort as I wish to raise another matter concerning the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s position in regard to the training facilities of medical students at medical schools in the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>On a number of occasions this matter has been raised with this hon. Minister during the discussion of his Vote as well as with his predecessors. From time to time we have had reports that steps are to be taken so as to improve the position as far as the number of students that are able to be trained in medical faculties at our various universities is concerned. During the course of 1971, following the appointment and then the report of the Monnig committee of enquiry into the availability of training facilities for medical students, the hon. the Minister of National Education replied that a greater intake of medical students would be provided for at the existing universities. The intake of medical students could be doubled as a result of extensions to the Universities of Pretoria, Stellenbosch, the Witwatersrand, Cape Town and Natal, and would be achieved in the course of the next five years. That was last year but in the meantime one can see from other figures that have been provided by the hon. the Minister in reply to another question this session, that the number of successful applicants, instead of increasing at the various universities, have decreased. The hon. the Minister, in quoting these figures, showed that at the beginning of this year, out of 3 196 applicants, only 830 were accepted and commenced their studies. Then the hon. the Minister said that, as far as extending the existing facilities were concerned, it would not be proceeded with owing to the financial situation and that no steps would be taken for the time being in this regard. Here I would like to ask the hon. the Minister to make a statement to the Committee setting out the position as far as the future of the medical schools at the various universities in the Republic at the present time is concerned. It would appear from a reply that the Minister of Indian Affairs gave in this House, that the Chancellor of the University of Durban Westville announced that the next phase of the development of that university would be a medical school for 600 students. It would therefore appear that the policy of the Government is now to establish these medical schools at the universities on a racial basis. If this is to be the case there will be considerable costs involved. It will also involve a shortage of training lecturers and of clinical hospitals. Here I make a special plea for the University of Natal in that this is the only province in South Africa where there are no training facilities whatsoever for White medical students. The medical school that exists in Durban, is restricted to non-White students. Bantu, Indian and Coloured students, and of course, the training hospital where the clinical work is done, is the King Edward VIII hospital. But as far as White students are concerned, the English-speaking student has to seek admission at Cape Town University or at the Witwatersrand University. It has become a great tragedy that many of these prospective doctors are unable to gain admission to these universities. A loss is being suffered by South Africa, since there is a shortage of doctors. These young people are unable to achieve their potential and play their part as doctors in the future of South Africa.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we come to the end of the debate on a Bill which we hope is going to have far-reaching effects on the marketing of agricultural products in this country. As I pointed out during the Second Reading debate, most members have dealt with the wool industry and the Minister himself has personally pointed out that the amendments here are primarily to satisfy that industry. Sir, we accept that on this side of the House. We wish the industry well and we sincerely hope that the industry is going to have a far better future under the new deal which is planned for it than the position it has had in the past few years.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the hon. the Minister of Agriculture is not here, Sir, but I must express my resentment at the attitude which he adopted in his reply to the Second Reading debate. It was quite apparent that he was not prepared to listen to any constructive suggestions from this side of the House, that he was merely indulging in cheap politics, and I will now proceed to show why I say this. Sir, if you look at the long title of the Bill, you will see that the board will now have certain powers in respect of the propagation of certain plant material. I put to him a perfectly logical request for information as to why this was limited only to plant material and why it was not also applied to animals as well. But all I got was a little bit of cheap politics from him, to the effect that was I suggesting, and did the United Party support, that the control boards, the Livestock and Meat Industry Control Board, the Wool Board and the Dairy Board, should actually propagate and market bulls, rams, calves, etc., and as far as the Egg Board is concerned, that they should propagate chickens as well? I want to draw his attention to the provisions we have here and which we welcome, because I believe it is a good thing, but I still want to know why it is limited to plant material; because the provisions include such provisions as to finance out of the board&#x2019;s funds, the development, improvement, multiplication, etc., of such materials. Is it his intention that the board itself will do all this sort of thing, or does he intend also using the funds of the board to assist the breeders, the experts who know about these things? Will he allow the board to assist them financially to propagate these things and, if so, why should it be limited to plant material and why should the same assistance not be given to the breeders of livestock in this counry? Or is he satisfied that we have got as far as we can go with our livestock in this country, and that no such assistance is necessary? I accuse him once again of making cheap politics instead of answering the question.</p>

<p>I must go further in regard to the provisions regarding the marketing of agricultural products, where we have in the Long Title that there are provisions &#x201C;to amend the provisions of that Act relating to &#x2026; the undertakings and research work that may be assisted by a control board; the stimulation by a control board of the demand for a regulated product&#x201D;. All I said was that I welcomed this and that at last we had some sense coming into our marketing <span class="col_8161-8162" refersTo="page_1035"/>system, where the board was going to be used to stimulate the consumption; that they must now market their products; that they must promote their products. But what was the inane reply of the hon. the Minister? Am I now asking that the boards themselves must physically sell each package of their particular product? That is the sort of answer we get from this Minister. Do you wonder that we have the inefficiency that exists in the agricultural sphere in this country today when you have that sort of Minister who is not prepared to debate a matter at a reasonably decent level, and is not prepared to consider accepting suggestions that are made, but just indulge in cheap politics? I repeat what I said before. This Bill is a great step forward, and these provisions which have been made, these additional powers and additional instructions that are being given indirectly by the powers which are being taken in this Bill, are going to work for the benefit of agriculture. Agriculture can only benefit from these, and we wish the whole of the agricultural sector well. We sincerely hope that what we see as the positive aspects of this Bill today, will benefit the agricultural industry.</p>

<p>The Minister replied very clearly. This clause was to allow the Deciduous Fruit Board, for instance, to have virus-free, clean plant material distributed amongst nurseries and to help those people to distribute it to the farmers, so that they can have virus-free plant material. It includes the Potato Board or any plant material which can be produced by some of these boards. But the hon. member asked the Minister specifically why not allow the other boards, for cattle and sheep to do the same, and the Minister asked him what his intention was; does he want the Wool Board or the Meat Board to have bulls and rams distributed in competition with the farmers? That is ridiculous. We cannot take away the living of the farmer and give it to the boards. But the farmer has neither the machinery nor the mechanics to have his own virus-free plant material. I cannot see where the Minister made a mistake.</p>

<p>Clause 6:</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>We have in this clause provision to establish a board. I think we can call it the Survey Regulations Board, which will have specific power to make regulations in regard to the subjects mentioned in clause 7. Sir, I am sure you will allow me briefly to mention some of the subjects for which regulations may be made. These are the fees to be paid by an owner of land, the manner in which surveys should be performed and the degree of accuracy. In other words, the Board will make regulations controlling the actual practice of these land surveyors, but we find that in a later clause the Minister takes the power to make these same regulations, but subject to the proviso that any regulations so made shall not repeal or be inconsistent with any regulation made by the Survey Regulations Board, and approved by the State President. To me it is a little incomprehensible that we establish a board&#x2014;and let me say right away that we welcome the establishment of this board; we believe it is the right thing to do&#x2014;which will have one function only, and that is to make regulations in regard to the subjects mentioned. I wonder if the hon. the Deputy Minister can tell us why we require this dual control. Why do we take the trouble to establish a board and give it that particular function&#x2014;only that particular function and no other function whatsoever&#x2014;and then give the Minister the power to do exactly the same thing as the board is doing? To me it is a bit incomprehensible and I wonder if the hon. the Deputy Minister can explain this to me.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member will notice in clause 6 that the regulations are subject to the approval of Parliament and the State President. In addition the Minister has powers to exercise control. Even if this Survey Regulations Board should take decisions, such decisions would still be subject to decisions of Parliament, the State President and the Minister. The hon. member will actually find the reply to his question in clause 8, because the whole matter is set out there. It is very clear to me that a board cannot just be appointed, and even if it is a United Party Minister, he will not appoint a board with full powers to do just what they like to their heart&#x2019;s content, without his having the power to exercise control. This question of the hon. member is covered under clauses 7 and 8.</p>

<p>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</p>

<p>In moving the Second Reading of this Bill, I must, on behalf of the Rhodes University and myself, thank you for exercising your discretion under Standing Order No. 1 (Private Bills) and permitting this Bill to be dealt with as a Public Bill. Our appreciation must also be extended to the hon. the Leader of the House, who has allowed time, during a busy session, for this Bill to be dealt with. A most important debt of gratitude is also owed to Mr. van der Merwe of the Department of National Education, because without his assistance and expert advice we could not have shaped this legislation into an acceptable form in time for this session of Parliament.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to make a long Second Reading speech on this Bill. The preamble sets out the intent and purpose very clearly. Nevertheless, to avoid confusion, I believe it is necessary to explain the various clauses briefly. Clause 1 provides that the Dean of Students and the registrar shall become constituents of the university. It also clarifies and extends the powers of the university as a body corporate.</p>

<p>Clause 2 provides merely for an improvement <span class="col_8165-8166" refersTo="page_1037"/>of grammar in both the Afrikaans and English versions. Clause 2 (b) omits the words &#x201C;and the procedure&#x201D;. It is felt that, the procedure being standard and accepted, if it was to remain in the Act, it could only cause confusion. These words are also omitted in clause 3 (a) (5).</p>

<p>Clause 3 clarifies the rules and the delegation of power by the senate subject to the control of the council. In clause 3 (b) provision is made for a consequential amendment which was omitted when the Bill was previously amended.</p>

<p>Clause 4 is consequential on clause 1, providing for the inclusion of the Dean of Students and the registrar as constituents, and it also removes the two years&#x2019; limitation on students who qualified before 1949 when the university was still a university college. This means that all past graduates may now apply to become members of the convocation.</p>

<p>Clause 5 is aimed at avoiding confusion between an Act of Parliament and the statutes of the university; clause 6 further clarifies the rules and the disciplinary code, while clause 7 provides that the powers of the university as a body corporate shall not be affected by vacancies or deficiency in numbers. Clause 8 contains the short title.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I request leave to make the following statement: Hon. members are aware of the hijacking of the S.A.A. aircraft on flight SA 0929 between Salisbury and Jan Smuts on Wednesday, 24th May, at approximately 2 p.m., near Jan Smuts. Near Jan Smuts two hijackers who had dynamite with them, first forced the aircraft to fly to the Seychelles. By adroit action, Captain Flemington succeeded in causing the aircraft to land at Salisbury. When nothing could be done there to save the situation, attempts were again made, after most of the passengers and a few members of the crew had been allowed to leave the aircraft, to force the aircraft to fly to the Seychelles. Again the captain succeeded in his attempts to make the hijackers change their minds and to have the aircraft land at Blantyre.</p>

<p>Within half an hour after the hijacking the General Manager of the South African Railways and the Acting Manager of the Airways had assembled an efficient team who maintained continuous contact with the situation. All the necessary steps were taken to protect both the passengers and the members of the crew and, if at all possible, to keep the aircraft intact.</p>

<p>The object of the two hijackers was, firstly, to blackmail Mr. H. F. Oppenheimer into paying an amount of money to which one hijacker, Kamil, laid claim. He wanted to meet Mr. Oppenheimer on the Seychelles at all costs.</p>

<p>The latest position is that the head of the Malawian Police this morning at 6 o&#x2019;clock issued an ultimatum to the hijackers, who were alone in the aircraft, to leave it immediately or else they would open fire on them. They did not respond and shortly afterwards machine-gun and rifle fire was directed at the aircraft. The hijackers emerged from the aircraft via the back door and surrendered themselves, whereupon they were removed to the Zomba gaol. Negotiations in regard to their extradition are taking place on the diplomatic level. Damage to the aircraft is such that we hope to bring it back to South Africa soon. A repair team of South African Airways is already on the way to Malawi.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<p>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</p>

<p>Hon. members will recall that quite recently the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs introduced a Water Amendment Bill. Clause 6 of that measure dealt with the modification of precipitation. With that is meant a modification of the natural occurrence of atmospheric precipitation which could have an effect on the run-off of water or on the quantity of subterranean water.</p>

<p>The Bill is supplementary to the relevant section of the Water Amendment Bill to <span class="col_8167-8168" refersTo="page_1038"/>which I have just referred. It deals with weather modification, under which is understood the artificial promoting, accelerating, increasing, aggravating, impeding, suppressing, retarding or altering of the natural occurrence of rain, snow, fog, hail or similar atmospheric precipitation, or lightning, or a tornado or cyclone, or a similar atmospheric phenomenon. During the Second Reading of the Water Amendment Bill the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs emphasized the increasing importance and interest in the modification of precipitation, and pointed out the importance of the proper control and planning thereof.</p>

<p>This Bill is necessary in order to obtain control over the matters in respect of which the Water Amendment Bill does not make provision. The one Bill supplements the other so as to eliminate loopholes. The one without the other loses its value as far as effective control is concerned.</p>

<p>Present-day developments in the sphere of technology are spectacular and scientists are venturing into more and more fields in order to find methods to make the existence of mankind on earth more pleasant.</p>

<p>In a country such as South Africa, with a low average rainfall and a high frequency of thunderstorms, which are often accompanied by hail damage, it is to be expected that farmers in particular will be eager to take note of any progress which is being made in the field of meteorology, and more specifically of the attempts to increase rainfall artificially and the possible reduction of hail damage.</p>

<p>Work in this field has been done for a considerable time in overseas countries, but in our own country we have only recently proceeded to take positive steps in this sphere.</p>

<p>It is very important to remember that any deliberate human action with the object of effecting a modification of weather conditions will not simply produce positive results every time. Numerous projects carried out in the past in overseas countries were poorly planned, and it was subsequently not possible to determine whether or not they had been successful. So, for example, it is pointed out in a recent publication of the World Meteorological Organization that commercial projects in particular are prone to such deficiencies. Out of hundreds of projects tackled since 1946 in the U.S.A. only 23 were carried out in such a way that reliable analyses of the results could subsequently be made, and by far the most of these were done by universities or State institutions. Another disturbing conclusion drawn was that in the majority of these projects human intervention had led to a decreased rather than to an increased rainfall, although it is equally certain that in a considerable number of cases an appreciable increase was caused. After further developments in the scientific investigation of this aspect of meteorology it is at present possible to explain where mistakes were made which led to the unexpected decreases.</p>

<p>The foregoing emphasizes the need to allow only well-planned, strictly scientific projects, carried out by highly-trained and qualified meteorologists if we want to ensure that the country as a whole, as well as the more local interests, derive the maximum benefit from any project of this nature. Provision is being made in the Bill for the issuing of licences to enable persons or organizations to undertake weather modification projects. With the issuing of the licences the technical skill, qualification and financial means of such a person will count as the primary consideration.</p>

<p>With the allocation of permits to carry out activities in given areas, representatives of the different interested parties will be afforded an opportunity, on the advisory committee, of considering the desirability or otherwise of such activities.</p>

<p>Precautions will at all times be taken to ensure that only work of the best quality is carried out, and that data is continually collected in such a way that independent assessments of the results will be possible. This means that any commercial operator will have to take constant pains to ensure that his activities do not perhaps lead to undesirable results. In this way we are hoping to safeguard the country from the activities of organizations that are more interested in making a profit than in furthering the interests of the country.</p>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House naturally support this Bill. The other half, as the hon. the Deputy Minister said, was before us in the Select Committee on the Water Amendment Bill. We passed it there. It probably is strange that this Parliament finds it necessary to consider two Bills dealing with exactly the same matter in one session. We deemed it necessary to act as we did be <span class="col_8169-8170" refersTo="page_1039"/>cause the interests of the two departments are affected so intimately by the activities that are dealt with by this Bill. We must now get a very clear explanation from the hon. the Deputy Minister on how the administration of this Bill and that part of the Water Amendment Bill which also deals with this matter, will be done by these two departments. As the hon. the Deputy Minister said, this field is undoubtedly a very large one for research, also for people who want to make a few cents out of it. We should like to have the assurance that the way will be open for people who want to undertake this kind of work.</p>

<p>&#x2020; Overseas snowfall is being sold as a commercial commodity. There are companies which contract with power companies in the United States to increase the snowfall in certain areas in order to give a more regulated flow of water into the power dams. Just think what could be done in our country if that sort of thing was possible, for instance for tourism by creating snow in the mountain areas. Just think for this one instance what could be done. We should like to know that there will not be any falling down of administration between the two departments. I raise this particularly because the Water Act controls the modification of precipitation whereas this Bill will control, amongst other things, the increase in rainfall. The problem is to whom does a person make application and whether there will now be joint administration? Will there be one committee to whom application will be made, one scientific advisory board and so forth, so that there can only be the closest possible coordination in respect of this activity? We want to know that the attitude of the two joint departments will be sympathetic towards this kind of activity. It is really an open question&#x2014;and I merely raise it here &#x2014;whether it is absolutely necessary to have two Acts of Parliament which cover virtually the same thing. Thinking about this, I personally feel that it is going to take a very astute lawyer indeed to decide as to which of the two departments is going to be involved either in the increase of precipitation or the modification of precipitation and the increase in rainfall. I wonder whether it might not be advisable at some later stage for the hon. the Deputy Minister to consult with the law advisers to find out if there should not be merely the one channel. In terms of the Water Act, the power was taken to give immediate control over something which could have developed into a serious threat to the farming community, among others. Now the hon. the Deputy Minister, from the side of the department which deals with the Airways and natural conditions which may affect the flight of aeroplanes, has taken control. I think it might pay us to consult with the law advisers at a later stage perhaps to find whether this cannot be ironed out so that we have merely the one channel of control. We support this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. J. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to convey our sincere thanks to the Department of Transport for the competent way in which this Bill has been drafted. One appreciates the fact that the Opposition is supporting this Bill at this stage. I think the importance of a Bill such as this also makes it essential that there should not be a difference of opinion about the Bill in this House. The hon. member for Mooi River expressed his concern about the fact that there are two different State Departments that are exercising control in this new field at this stage. I do not think this is altogether strange. In the United States of America there are five State Departments at the moment which deal with the weather modification scheme. I think the opinion on this in South Africa, which has developed from a scientific point of view, has made it essential for the experiments which affect two departments to be controlled by them. In the first place Water Affairs wants to stabilize the catchment area of the Vaal Dam in this way as far as water is concerned, and on the other hand it also affects the weather conditions and the control over aircraft, which in turn affect the Department of Transport. As regards the desirability of being very strict in respect of various organizations that want to enter this field, I think we should express our thanks to the hon. the Deputy Minister for this strong stand. When one thinks that this is a field over which there is still a mystic veil of uncertainty, it is a field in which some irresponsible persons, the uninformed, could very easily be taken in.</p>

<p>When one studies the history of these techniques, one finds that in 1946 a certain Vincent Shaefer in the United States succeeded in establishing that dry ice, when placed in an ordinary food freezer, produces large numbers of small ice crystals of nucleus size. Subsequently, with the cooperation of Dr. Bernard Vonnegut, he <span class="col_8171-8172" refersTo="page_1040"/>also conducted experiments with aircraft in the clouds. Then another person, Dr. Langmuir, found that silver iodine is a catalyst for the formation of these nucleusforming particles around which the ice then accumulates. As far back as 1951 the father of this development, Dr. Shaefer, said the following in respect of these mushroom organizations which have sprung up in America&#x2014;I may just mention that only five years after this project was begun in America one-third of America was already involved in weather modification. Then Dr. Vincent Shaefer said&#x2014;and I quote from the <i>World Meteorological Organization Technical Note No.</i> 105&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The rash of entrepreneurs and rainmakers which developed shortly after these experiments were announced and their expansive claims and brash attitudes played on the relative ignorance and desperate situation of groups of farmers and ranchers mulcting them of hundreds of thousands of dollars, and at the same time putting the entire field of experimental meteorology in disrepute.</block>

<p>Therefore we are grateful that the hon. the Deputy Minister wants to eliminate organizations of that type in South Africa. The hon. the Deputy Minister referred in his Second Reading speech to the large number of reports which have already been written, of which only 23 serve the statistical purposes. The hon. the Deputy Minister also indicated that only six cases showed that an increase in rainfall had been obtained; in seven cases there was no change and in 10 other cases there was a definite drop. It is very easy to make statements based on superficial personal observations. It is a field in which very spectacular changes are brought about when the clouds have been sprayed with silver iodine. When these statements are made the uninformed can very easily be taken in. To give an example, in Soviet Russia they claim to have been 90 per cent successful in hail prevention. But none of their reports qualifies for the statistics standards set in the Western world. Then it may also be interesting just to mention that in Russia they use a type of bomb which is fired from a cannon. The container of the bomb may weigh up to 315 kg. Apparently Russia is not so concerned as we are about where or on whom the splinters of the bomb will fall afterwards. In South Africa we found that there were some persons who claimed early this year already that the weather bureau would also achieve success in South Africa in reducing the occurrence of hail. These statements were made purely on the strength of the ratio between the number of claims received by an insurance company this year as against the number received last year. What these persons seem to have lost sight of is that the C.S.I.R. has established that in the Wit-watersrand area, where no weather modification scheme was undertaken, there has also been a drop in the incidence of hail this year. It certainly does not give persons the right to make these statements just on the strength of one attempt of a few months.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I certainly think that South Africa has not left things too late in this field, but that we are certainly in time to prevent the irresponsible entry of some groups into this field.</p>

<p>I should like to express the hope that this Bill will contribute towards enhancing the status of the Weather Bureau in South Africa. For some reason the Weather Bureau in South Africa has not yet attained that status which one finds in Britain in particular. In Britain it is one of those departments which offer choice positions only to the select few. In South Africa we have not adopted that point of view in respect of the Weather Bureau up to now and we really want to express the hope that the Weather Bureau will also gain in prestige when this Bill has been piloted through this Parliament. We certainly have the people who can compete with the best in the world. At the moment South Africa is still a member of the International Meteorological Organization, which has also made a request in its publication for cooperation in respect of statistics in this connection to be combined in order to ascertain in which way the world can be served by this scheme. I do not want to assert that South Africa will be responsible for a dramatic break-through in regard to weather modification. When we think that in 1947 South Africa, with its research in respect of polio, was the first country which was able, after Dr. Salk had developed the vaccine in America, to apply it in South Africa, we believe that it is essential in South Africa for this department, too, to keep abreast of developments, so that if dramatic break-throughs are made, they can be applied in South Africa as well.</p>

<p>Finally I should just like to put a request <span class="col_8173-8174" refersTo="page_1041"/>to the hon. the Deputy Minister. The weather modification in South Africa is taking place mainly in the eastern Free State at the moment, with Bethlehem as the central point. Now the position is that the period during which research in regard to weather modification can be conducted only lasts from October to about the middle of April. It is unfortunately the position that during December and the first part of January that region is harvesting the winter grain, the wheat crop. So there is a very short period in which to harvest these crops. The danger exists that if the research were to be conducted there during December or January, the rainfall might be such that it might be difficult to harvest the crops. Consequently I should like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister that this department should consider offering the farming community of that region the necessary co-operation and that it should be decided on a very high level when it will be desirable to continue the experiment, also as regards the rainfall. We want to convey our thanks to the hon. the Deputy Minister and we should like to wish the weather bureau every success in this almost unknown field.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think you would agree with me that it is a great pleasure to listen to a person who is master of his subject and who knows what he is talking about. I want to congratulate the hon. member for Bethlehem on this very thorough study he has made of a very important scientific subject. I want to congratulate him not only on that study, but also on the clear and positive way in which he stated the results of his studies here to the advantage of everyone of us in South Africa. One can understand why he is able to do this; I think it is necessary for me to tell this House that one of our most competent men in the Weather Bureau, Mr. Du Toit, is at Bethlehem. Apparently they co-operated to some extent in this regard. While I am mentioning this, I want to point out that what the hon. member said was true, i.e. that it might be necessary for us to take the position of this section of our department into consideration. I think it is necessary for the Weather Bureau to be given more status. Often, for example in Budget debates, etc., we tend to select a few minor matters and not to discuss these all-important matters which affect South Africa in so many respects. I want to thank the hon. member for this suggestion; I personally believe that this legislation will have the effect of giving more status to the Weather Bureau, or at least of more knowledge being available. I want to associate myself with an appeal he made which was that we should have more people in choice occupations in this division of the department. Furthermore, I want to give him the assurance at once that since we are engaged in these experiments and research, we shall take local circumstances into account and that we shall make use of the co-operation of that farming community. What is more, we shall continue the harmonious mutual consultations which are in progress there.</p>

<p>In replying to the hon. member for Mooi River, I cannot neglect to express a word of thanks also to the Select Committee which inquired into the Water Amendment Bill. I also want to mention the names of the hon. members for Piketberg and South Coast specifically. Those hon. members saw immediately&#x2014;and this, to a certian extent, is also my reply to the hon. member for Mooi River&#x2014;that that legislation of the Department of Water Affairs, as far as weather modification was concerned, could not remain in the hands of the Department of Water Affairs only. It is impossible, because as hon. members know, the Department of Water Affairs is concerned with the flow of water and with subterranean water, but they are on the ground and my department is up in the clouds. [Interjections.] No. it is not up in the clouds in any wrong sense. We are up in the clouds not only with aircraft; we are also up in the clouds in this regard, where we have to provide security, etc., and weather modification belongs with this department. The hon. member asked whether it was essential for us to have two Acts. I think that the Select Committee also realized that this was essential for the time being. The hon. member also pointed out the duality, and wanted to know whether the control would be effective. Hon. members will see that we are making provision for this. In regard to the composition of this advisory committee, etc., the Minister of Transport shall act in consultation with the Minister of Water Affairs, as it affects Water Affairs as well. There is an advisory committee which will advise us in this regard, and which will be appointed by both these Ministers.</p>

<p>Yes, only one committee. In other words, each department will not have a separate committee. There will be one committee which will advise us. This means that the control will not be dualistic and that it will be co-ordinated.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said: &#x201C;Snowfall is sold as a commercial commodity.&#x201D; This very thing is one of the problems. It is true that this is so, but the hon. member for Bethlehem also pointed out that the statistical data and the actual data were complicated for the very reason that in the past so many people applied themselves exclusively and without control to the commercial benefits they could obtain by modifying the weather, either to prevent hail or to cause rain. We may be on the threshold of an investigation, but I want to tell the hon. member this: With the necessary co-operation, as he himself requested, we shall take further action with the other department. May this investigation and the work being done, always be controlled in such a way that generations to come may also enjoy the fruits of proper statistical and scientific data made available in a controlled way. The whole object is to have proper control.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Hon. members will recall that the Minister in his Budget Speech during March this year indicated that Parliamentary approval would be sought for the construction of two new lines of railway, namely one to serve the new harbour extension in Table Bay and one from Drummondlea Station to a terminal point on the farm Grasvally in the Northern Transvaal.</p>

<p>The Railways and Harbours Board examined both proposals and has recommended the construction of the proposed lines. Full details are furnished in the Board&#x2019;s report which has already been tabled and my remarks will, therefore, be brief.</p>

<p>A double line is required to serve the new harbour extension in Table Bay and will be utilized exclusively for departmental purposes, i.e. for the conveyance of goods traffic to and from the harbour extension. As the Paardeneiland yard from which Table Bay Harbour is presently served, is being utilized to the extent where no additional traffic can be handled, the new harbour extension will have to be served from the Bellville yard.</p>

<p>Five possible routes for a rail connection were investigated and the implications of each route were thoroughly considered. The route finally decided upon will branch off from the existing railway line between Kensington and Chempet at a point approximately 8,28 kilometres from Cape Town. After passing to the north of the Ysterplaat Air Force Base, it will run between Rugby and Milnerton to the beachfront from where it will follow the coastline to Paardeneiland before entering the new harbour extension. The proposed line will be approximately 7,19 kilometres long and will also link up with the proposed railway line between Kensington and Bellville. There will also be a direct link between the Woltemade/Epping industrial area and the new harbour extension.</p>

<p>When it became known that it was intended to construct a railway line through the area in question, representations were received from the residents of the Milnerton area in regard to the route of the proposed line. The objections were thoroughly investigated and the matter was also discussed at a meeting which representatives of the residents and other interested parties had with the Minister.</p>

<p>The route has been so determined as to cause the least inconvenience to the owners of adjoining properties and/or residents of the area concerned. The line will be electrified and there will be no level crossings; bridges or subways will be provided where streets and roads cross the line.</p>

<p>As a result of the construction of the railway line approximately 40 residences will have to be demolished. It is, nevertheless, considered that of all the routes, the proposed location would cause the least disruption to existing structures and residential areas. It will take approximately four years to complete the work and the estimated cost of the project is R9 million.</p>

<p>I will now deal with the proposed line from Drummondlea Station to the farm Grasvally. Grom ore Limited, a subsidiary <span class="col_8177-8178" refersTo="page_1043"/>of African Metals Corporation Limited, has approached the Railway Administration in regard to the construction of a guaranteed single line of railway between Drummondlea&#x2014;a station on the main line between Pretoria and Pietersburg&#x2014;and the farm Grasvally, approximately five kilometres from Drummondlea Station, for the conveyance of chrome ore mined on the farm.</p>

<p>The company originally intended to build its own private line, but as difficulties were experienced in obtaining the necessary rights of way for the line, the company formally requested the Administration to acquire the land at the cost of the company. The company has undertaken to finance the line and to construct it and the associated facilities to departmental standards and on completion thereof, to hand these over to the Administration who will then exploit the line under guaranteed conditions. This offer is acceptable, especially as the Administration will not be called upon to invest any capital in the construction of the line.</p>

<p>The guarantee period will extend over a period of 25 years only, instead of the usual 30 years. The company will not receive any compensation when the line is taken over by the Railways, but during the term of the agreement the company will be compensated in respect of its capital investment in the line. As the Railways will also be indemnified against operating losses during the guarantee period, provision is being made in the agreement for the payment of special surcharges which will be utilized on the one hand to defray any losses which may be sustained in the working of the line during the agreement period of 25 years, and on the other hand to refund the company its capital investment. The special surcharge which the company will be required to pay in respect of the capital investment will be credited to its ledger account, so that the company will in effect not pay any surcharge for that purpose. The Administration will operate the line at cost until such time as the capital investment of the company has been fully accounted for; only then will the Administration effectively be in possession of the line.</p>

<p>Although the Administration will not be guaranteed against operating losses for the full period of 30 years, there is no objection to this arrangement as the capital which will be invested in the line will already have been recovered in full at the end of the guarantee period of 25 years.</p>

<p>The proposed line will be almost 4,14 km &#x2014;approximately 7,28 km with the inclusion of sidings&#x2014;long and the cost of construction is estimated to be of the order of R750 000.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, at the outset we on this side of the House would like to object to the very, very short time that has been given to us to consider this Railway Construction Bill. Sir, the one line is a guaranteed line, and I do not wish to say anything about that. The Minister has outlined the arrangements in regard to that particular line. I wish to confine myself to the other line. That line is going to run from a modern commercial dock and then through a built-up residential area. I feel that more time should have been given to us by the Government so that the whole plan could have been examined. This plan has only just recently been put before us. We have not even had the chance to go out and hold an inspection <i>in loco,</i> to which I think we are entitled. I feel that an important item like this should not be sprung upon us like this in this House. More time should have been allowed for a proper examination of the whole position, as was done in the case of the planning of the Cape Town harbour. We know that it took a long time to plan that harbour. There was a controversy about the whole scheme; there was a departmental commission appointed to go into the whole matter; there was consultation with the Chamber of Commerce and there were alternative suggestions as far as Rietvlei was concerned. Sir, one wonders whether the department ever considered the possibility of the rail link. When you read this report, you see that consideration was given only recently to the question of a rail link. Five routes were apparently examined and they came to the conclusion that this route would be the best one.</p>

<p>Sir, to those of us who know this area, it does not look like the best route. Future extensions to the harbour may be contemplated, but one wonders whether proper consideration was given to the whole planning of this scheme when one bears in mind that this railway line is to be constructed solely for the conveyance of goods through a built-up area; that it will involve the demolition of houses, and what <span class="col_8179-8180" refersTo="page_1044"/>effect it will have on the residents concerned and on the city itself. Sir, the construction of a railway line through an urban area has a terrific dividing effect. Once this line is built and it crosses over from the beach through my colleague&#x2019;s constituency, it will be fenced on both sides, and this will have the effect of completely dividing the residential area. We know what difficulties are being experienced in a city such as Durban, where there is a railway running through the centre of the city. We are faced here with the fact that the Administration has selected this particular route, which I do not think is the very best route, but one wonders why provision was not made for the building of the line, from the point where it leaves the beach, in a closed cutting.</p>

<p>A cutting from where to where?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>From where it crosses the road from the beach to where it links up with the line on the Kensington side. The soil there is sandy and there is a certain amount of gravel. This may be a little bit more expensive, but I do not think that the line would then have this dividing effect to which I have referred. Sir, when one goes to a city like Barcelona, one finds that all the main railway lines run underground, under the main boulevards of the city. I think it is all wrong to build open railway lines through built-up urban areas. Sir, some ridiculous statements have been made in the Report about the effect that this fine is going to have on the beach. A lot of people use this beach. The section near the Total oil tanks is one of the finest surfing beaches that we have. Once this line has been built, the whole beach from the dock will be closed, except for a portion at the Milnerton end of the beach.</p>

<p>We are told that the building of this line will not affect the beach to any extent but, of course, that is not correct. I would like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister to give consideration to the question of building tunnels under the line. There is a big industrial area at Paardeneiland. In summertime the people working there are accustomed to going down to the beach for a dip. On Sundays quite a lot of people use this particular beach. It is also a favourite surfing spot. I wonder if it is not possible for the department to give consideration to the building of access tunnels under the line so as to avoid the closing off of this particular beach to the public. I think it would be all wrong to close this beach off. The excuse they make is foolish, namely that the sea water there is so cold that nobody uses the beach. It says in this report that as the result of the construction of the line, possibly 40 residences will have to be demolished but it appears that only a small portion of the beach in the vicinity of Milnerton will be affected.</p>

<p>I agree with that, that a small portion there would be affected, but the major portion down at the oil tanks will of course be closed off completely by this line. Then the report says that it must be borne in mind that the water in the area is very cold and therefore it is not suitable for bathing purposes; and it is considered that the part of the beach which will be lost will be of little value. Sir, honestly, whoever composed this report is not acquainted with conditions in the Cape, and this is a ridiculous statement to make. One might as well say that Clifton must be closed down or the beach at Blouberg must be closed down because the water is too cold. It is a ridiculous statement to make. I want to ask the Minister to give serious consideration to providing an access to the beaches. I think the public are entitled to that access and I would like the Minister to accede to it. If one looks at this plan, one wonders why the railway line was not taken up the Salt River canal. There is a broad river canal there and I am quite certain the line could have been taken up there and then linked to the main fine.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>I know that we are dealing with a Minister who is not very well acquainted with engineering, and he may find difficulty in really understanding it. but in Japan they build a railway line right over a river.</p>

<p>I know he has been to Japan and has seen that. You can take a railway line up a canal and I think the same thing could have been done here. Furthermore, in the opening sentence of this report it says that it is the intention to have a direct link through to the Bellville yards. If you look at the plan you find that the proposed <span class="col_8181-8182" refersTo="page_1045"/>link with the Bellville yard is only a proposed line. This House has never dealt with it and the Minister is not asking us for money to build this link line to Bellville. I know it has been in the thoughts of the Government for a long time, and that it has been on the Brown Book, but there is no line going to be built at present. That is the position. If you look at the plan it looks like a complete Heath Robinson affair. One wonders what planning was really put into this scheme. I am certain that with a little more consideration they could have produced a much better plan than this. If it is the intention to use the Bellville yards, that are being replanned, then why are they building this line to link with the main line?</p>

<p>As I said, in the short time that has been given to us, the effect of building a line through an urban area, its effect on the city and on its town planning, is serious. It is said that there was consultation with the various local authorities, but from what I have heard they were just told about it and they could do very little about it because the Government had made up their minds to build the line.</p>

<p>Anyway, I would make this appeal to the Minister to give consideration, when this line leaves the beach, to put in a closed cutting all the way until it reaches the other link on the main line, so that it does not act as a dividing element in this community; and furthermore to make access from the road to the beach under this line available. I do not think it will be very costly, and at least those people who use the beach for surfing will still have that facility left to them.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister will know that virtually the whole of the railway line which will link up the new harbour area with the existing railway line will be situated in the constituency which I have the privilege to represent. The hon. the Minister also knows that I was a member of the deputation which came to see him and the Minister of Railways about the matter and pleaded with him to see whether it is not possible to find an alternative route for this railway line. The hon. the Deputy Minister will also know that his standpoint and that of the Minister and the engineers was that there was no other alternative and that this railway line was the only one that could be built.</p>

<p>I want to say immediately that there is deep concern among a great many people about the construction of this railway line. The people feel that there might have been another way out. However, I want to add that even those people who are concerned about the matter are not people who should like to stand in the way of progress. These are people who realize that when one deals with a new harbour area it is necessary for you to have an exit from and a railway link with such harbour area.</p>

<p>But what I should like to point out, is the fact that construction work on this new harbour extension has been going on for a number of years now. I think they are busy with the second leg of the extension. Only recently, however, representations were made to the hon. the Minister in regard to this railway line. I am not an engineer, but what worries me, as a layman, and the public outside, is this: How is it possible that, when this harbour was initially planned, no thought was given as to where the exit should be? It is unbelievable that at this advanced stage, when one thinks of a new harbour area which costs tens of millions of rand, representations still have to be made in an attempt possibly to find an alternative. Surely, there must have been people in the initial stage, when the new harbour area was considered, who have wondered how the existing railway line was going to be reached. And, Mr. Speaker, when you look at the map made available by the hon. the Minister, I am convinced that any person who was aware of the extensions to that harbour, must have had only one thing in mind, and that is that this railway line which has to be linked up with the harbour, must go along the Salt River canal. This is the obvious route the ordinary man would have thought about. But what is even more serious, if I am correct in saying that consideration to this exit has been left for too long, I say to the hon. the Minister, with all due respect, that it seems to me that what we are dealing with here is a serious case of a lack of planning. I hope the hon. the Minister will try and furnish me with an explanation in that respect if I am wrong in my views.</p>

<p>We are told in the report that all the local bodies, the provincial council, the City Council of Cape Town and the City Council of Milnerton, all three bodies which are most deeply involved in this matter, <span class="col_8183-8184" refersTo="page_1046"/>have been consulted. The hon. the Minister makes no mention in this regard in his report, but I should nevertheless like to know from him across the floor of the House whether he received permission from the local bodies? Have they agreed to the road as it is shown here now? But now the hon. the Minister comes along and presents us with a <i>fait accompli.</i> He also presented the deputation with a <i>fait accompli,</i> and that is that this was the only way out.</p>

<p>What are we dealing with? Let us consider all the disadvantages this entails for the public. In the first place, one is going to destroy completely that small portion of the beachfront that was available to the people of Ysterplaat who used to visit it on Saturdays and Sundays. Many of those people do not have their own transport, and it is within walking distance from Ysterplaat. As a matter of fact, this was one of the main reasons why Ysterplaat objected to the establishment of a possible lido, because they regarded it as their local beach. That beach is now going to disappear. Those people will no longer enjoy that privilege. In the second place, this railway line will cause 40 housing units to be demolished, and in these times when we are experiencing a housing shortage in the Peninsula I think the hon. the Deputy Minister will know what I am talking about when I tell him that this is an extremely serious matter, a matter which has a profound effect on many people. In the third place, what we are doing here, is to introduce the noise of a train into a quiet area, an area in which there is no noise at the moment. In addition. I notice from the report that although the line is going to be electrified or that diesel traction may probably be used, steam locomotives will be used initially. We are therefore going to introduce not only pollution in the form of noise, but also air pollution.</p>

<p>I now come to the question of the linking-up of the line. We have to accept the position in that regard. We are being told that, technically speaking, there is no other alternative. However, I want to say that when one looks at this map the ordinary man simply cannot understand why there is no other way out. He simply cannot accept it. However, as I say, we are the ordinary people. We are not engineers. The Railway Administration says that it has consulted all the authorities and that they are satisfied. The Railway Adminis tration is also satisfied that the railway line has to be built. I should like to know from the hon. the Deputy Minister to what extent he has obtained the consent of the local authorities in this regard.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I should like to make a few requests to the hon. the Deputy Minister. In the first place, I want to repeat what the hon. member for Salt River has already asked, and that is that some or other attempt should be made to allow the public to have access to that little portion of the beachfront. I am not talking now only of the beachfront of Milnerton, but also the Ysterplaat/Paardeneiland beachfront. This is the first request I want to make. In the second place, I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister that, if steam locomotives are going to be used initially, this initial stage be made as brief as possible. I simply cannot believe that this area will not be immensely disturbed. In passing, I also want to mention that the railway line which is going to be built there is going to divide a church parish in two. I am referring to the parish of Sonnekus. The Rugby portion will be cut off and Milnerton will remain. I foresee that the practical effect of this will be that the parish will in due course be divided in two.</p>

<p>In the third place&#x2014;and this to my mind is far more serious&#x2014;I should like the hon. the Deputy Minister not only to say that he will notify the people well in advance that their houses are going to be expropriated. This is not enough. Those houses are not expensive ones; they are not expensive in that houses of R15 000 or R16 000 will have to be expropriated. The majority of these houses are probably not so expensive. I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister to co-operate with the Department of Community Development in an attempt to provide those people with alternative houses. This matter affects the socio-economic aspect of this community and unless the hon. the Deputy Minister wants to damage seriously the image of the State, he will have to see to it that there is perfect co-operation between Community Development on the one hand and the Railways on the other hand in an attempt to provide these people with alternative houses. The Railway Administration must not only expropriate, but it must also try to provide people whose houses have been expropriated with a similar house under similar circumstances.</p>

<p>I have already told the hon. the Deputy <span class="col_8185-8186" refersTo="page_1047"/>Minister that I support his case, because there is no other way out. Finally, I just want to say that I cannot understand why construction of this railway line should take four years. I have learnt recently that construction of the railway line from Sishen to Saldanha Bay will take four years. Here we are dealing with a distance of five miles or eight kilometres, and I believe construction of this railway line will also take four years. The longer the construction period the greater will be the inconvenience experienced by the area through which the railway line is going to run. I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister to have this railway line built as soon as possible and that it should not, in the first place, take four years to construct this line, but a considerably shorter period. In the second place, I ask the hon. the Deputy Minister that the necessary liaison be established as soon as possible with those people whose properties have to be expropriated. They have to be told what the Railways are prepared to pay for those houses and they must also be given the undertaking that the Railways on its part and in conjunction with the Department of Community Development will try to provide them with alternative houses. If this matter is going to be handled in this way I believe that the deep concern there is at the moment will to a certain extent be eliminated. I want to make an earnest appeal to the hon. the Deputy Minister to see to it that this matter will be handled in this way.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Maitland repeated the representations made and the many objections raised by the hon. member for Salt River. In the first place, I want to deal with the first aspect and this is not an objection the hon. member for Maitland had, but one which was raised by the hon. member for Salt River. He said: &#x201C;We object to the very short time to examine this proposition and this line.&#x201D; The hon. member for Salt River has been a member of the House of Assembly for quite a number of years now and he surely knows that, before submitting legislation to Parliament on the construction of a railway line, we have always carried out the necessary investigations first. What is more, all the bodies concerned are consulted as is, in fact, mentioned in this report. Before we approach Parliament, a report &#x00E1;lso has to be prepared by the Railway Board, a report which must be tabled in Parliament. It takes time to do all these things.</p>

<p>The hon. member and other hon. members were therefore well aware of the negotiations and the possibility that such a railway line would be constructed. As a matter of fact, the hon. member for Maitland quite rightly said that he had led a deputation right at the beginning because I have here in front of me the minutes of a meeting which took place on 7th February this year. That deputation had an interview with the Minister and the Railway Board. The deputation consisted, <i>inter alia,</i> of the chairman of the Milnerton Ratepayers&#x2019; Association, the mayor and also representatives of the Dutch Reformed congregation Sonnekus in Milnerton. The hon. member for Maitland, the responsible M.P., led the deputation. All these circumstances were discussed with us at that time.</p>

<p>Both the hon. member for Maitland and the hon. member for Salt River mentioned as first accusation the fact that there was apparently no planning and that it was only afterwards that we had discovered that a railway line had to be constructed there. Surely, this is a stupid thing to say. In the first place, the harbour has been constructed and after it had been constructed the Railways knew from the outset that it must be linked up. The Railways knew right from the outset that the railway linkup at Paarden Eiland was carrying too much traffic and would not be able to cope with this link-up. However, it is not necessary to have a railway line surveyed prior to the construction of a harbour. This is done as and when it becomes necessary. Surely, the railway line cannot be constructed up in the air; it has to be on the ground, not so? To level the accusation now that there has been no planning since we intend constructing this railway line at this stage, is nothing but a debating point the hon. member wants to score for the sake of convenience.</p>

<p>It makes no difference what the viewpoint was in regard to what route the line was to follow, <span class="col_8187-8188" refersTo="page_1048"/>because the Railways have a planning engineer. They know there will have to be a railway link-up and for that reason five different routes were investigated. I want to ask the hon. member a question in return: Should the Railways first have said that they were not going to build the harbour because they possibly had to let the railway line run through a township and possibly had to expropriate 40 houses and because they were not sure exactly where the line had to be constructed? In the first place, the harbour must be built; this is essential. On account of the development of our sea traffic, as a result of the development of Cape Town, as a result of the industrial development we have, this harbour becomes a necessity. I now want to ask hon. members whether they now want to tell the voters and this Parliament that the harbour development should be subject to a line which may not be constructed through a township? If this cannot be done, a harbour must not be allowed. This is the kind of argument hon. members advance. The hon. member for Maitland quite rightly says that the ordinary man would have thought that the railway line should have followed the Salt River canal. The hon. member for Salt River said himself that the line should be constructed along the Salt River canal. But the engineers investigated all the various aspects. The hon. member for Maitland says quite rightly that he is not an engineer. I do not believe that the hon. member for Salt River is an engineer either. The Railway Board investigated the various alternative routes submitted to it, and then decided that it would be the best to construct the line as is being suggested now.</p>

<p>The hon. member, on account of this report, now asks whether the hon. the Minister obtained the permission of the local authority for the construction of this line. Does this Parliament now want to make the Minister of Railways and the progress of South Africa subject to the permission of the local authority?</p>

<p>What is the difference? The hon. the Minister and the department consulted the Provincial Administration in regard to the routing of the whole of the road, the road construction programme, the overhead bridges and the subways. Consultation also took place with the local authorities involved in and affected by this matter. The Minister went so far as to grant an interview to a deputation led by the hon. member for Maitland. That deputation consisted of the local authority, the chairman of the Maitland ratepayers, the mayor and representatives of the church communities and they had personal discussions with the hon. the Minister. He gave them the assurance that there was no alternative and that this line had to be built. They accepted it as such.</p>

<p>The hon. member said that this railway line is going to be constructed to run through a quiet area and is going to create a noise there. Throughout South Africa we have railway lines running through townships and densely populated areas. If this is really such a terrible inconvenience, if this is such a terrible evil, do all those people simply have to put up with it there, but not these people? When that hon. member and his deputation had an interview with the Minister, they were told by the General Manager of the Railways (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Part of the railway line will be constructed in a cutting. As a matter of fact, directly opposite the major runway at the Ysterplaat aerodrome it will be completely below surface level and, from that point. will follow a downgrade in the direction of Koeberg Road. Most of the noise of train traffic running through a cutting is deflected upwards by the walls of the cutting.</block>

<p>We have many railway lines running through built-up areas and we have never had any trouble about noise. On the contrary, human beings find it easier to adjust themselves to such circumstances. As a matter of interest, I want to say that it is not only human beings who adapt themselves to noise. Here at the D. F. Malan Airport we find that even game adapt themselves to the noise. We had to have the steenbuck there caught. They adapt themselves to the noise of those large aircraft coming to land there. We had to catch them so that they did not go onto the mac. So this argument about noise holds no water.</p>

<p>Another argument advanced by the hon. member was that the construction of this line would cut a whole church parish in two. Surely, the report indicates that there are not going to be any open level crossings anywhere, and that the necessary crossings, the necessary bridges and subways-<span class="col_8189-8190" refersTo="page_1049"/>will be built. How can the hon. member now say that a church parish will be cut in two by this line? Surely, this is not a factor which has to be taken into account in this matter. The hon. member also wanted to know why it would take four years to have the line constructed.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<p>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</p>

<p>The Sale of Land on Instalments Act, No. 72 of 1971, came into operation on 1st January, 1972. The Act contains provisions relating, <i>inter alia,</i> to the contents of contracts for the sale of land to which the Act is applicable, and the amount which the seller may recover from the purchaser in terms of such contracts is restricted by the Act.</p>

<p>Section 4 (1) (o) of the Act requires each contract to which the Act is applicable to contain an indication of the party who shall be liable for the payment of the costs incurred in connection with the transfer of land to the name of the purchaser. The parties to such a contract may, as indeed often happens in practice, agree that the purchaser shall pay the transfer costs. On the other hand, however, representations have been submitted to the Government claiming that section 6 (3) of the Act prohibits the recovery of transfer costs by the seller from the purchaser, and in addition it has been alleged that an irreconcilable conflict exists between sections 4 (1) (o) and 6 (3) of the Act.</p>

<p>Whatever the legal position created by the relevant sections of the Act may be, it is clear that differences of opinion on the interpretation of the Act may arise. Under these circumstances it is deemed desirable to amend the Act suitably in order to state the provisions thereof more clearly in so far as the possible payment of transfer costs by the purchaser is concerned.</p>

<p>The proposed amendment to the Act, which is being submitted to this House for its approval, will amend section 6 (3) (b) of Act 72 of 1971 so as to state clearly that a seller may in fact recover transfer <span class="col_8191-8192" refersTo="page_1050"/>costs from the purchaser provided the contract makes the purchaser liable for the payment of such costs and the costs have actually been incurred by the seller, and provided that the transfer of the land to the name of the purchaser has already taken place or is tendered against payment by the purchaser of the amount due.</p>

<p>I have to point out that various contracts have in all probability been entered into since the coming into operation of the Act, contracts to which the Act is applicable. If the Act were to be amended at this time and if the amended provisions of the Act were not to apply to those contracts, it would create considerable uncertainty with regard to the legal position in respect of those particular contracts. The only way in which this uncertainty can be eliminated, is to make the proposed amendment to the Act of retrospective effect as from the date of coming into operation of the Act itself. Consequently it is being proposed that the Act be amended as from 1st January, 1972, in terms of the provisions of the Bill which has now been submitted to this House for its approval.</p>

<p>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</p>

<p>The Hire-Purchase Act, No. 36 of 1942, requires that an appraiser shall, for the purposes of the Act, be licensed as a sworn appraiser in terms of the Licences Act, No. 44 of 1962, or shall be exempted from such licence in terms of that Act.</p>

<p>Arising out of the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry into Trade Licensing and Allied Problems, full and effective powers to make ordinances in relation to the licensing of trades and occupations were allocated to the provincial councils during 1968 in terms of the Financial Relations Further Amendment Bill, No. 69 of 1968. Section 8 of that Act provides that a provincial council may repeal the provisions of the Licences Act in so far as such provisions apply to its province and relate to trades and occupations in regard to which it is empowered by section 14 of the Financial Relations Consolidation and Amendment Act, No. 38 of 1945, to make ordinances.</p>

<p>The provinces appointed an inter-provincial committee to make recommendations to the Executive Committees of the various provinces in regard to a uniform Ordinance on Licences, as envisaged by the Commission of Inquiry to which I have referred. According to report the inter-provincial committee has now completed its task and the provincial council will repeal the Licences Act by ordinance with effect from 1st January, 1973. In view of this it has now become necessary to amend the definition of &#x201C;appraiser&#x201D; in the Hire-Purchase Act.</p>

<p>In terms of the provisions of the Licences Act which will now be repealed by ordinance, sworn appraisers as well as assessors who have not been sworn, may act as appraisers for the purposes of the Hire-Purchase Act. In order to maintain this position in practice, it is being provided in the proposed statutory amendment that an appraiser shall be any person who, by virtue of his experience, knowledge or skill as well as his ability and reputation, is competent to determine the value of goods for the purposes of the Hire-Purchase Act. Since the courts may in terms of section 16 of the Act exercise control over the appointment of assessors for purpose of the Act, it is regarded that the proposed provision in regard to persons who are competent to act as appraisers will provide adequate protection to the parties involved in a hire-purchase transaction in which the value of goods has to be determined.</p>

<p>Since the Licences Act is to be repealed with effect from 1st January, 1973, it is being proposed that the Hire-Purchase Amendment Act, 1972, shall come into operation with effect from 1st January, 1973.</p>

<p>The Explosives Act, 1956 (Act 26 of 1956), came into operation on 2nd May, 1956, and makes provision for control over the manufacture, storage, sale, transport, importation, exportation and the use of explosives in the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>The Act is not applicable in the territory of South-West Africa, but matters relating to explosives are controlled by means of the Ordinance on Explosives, No. 31 of 1962, and Regulation 52 of 1958 of the territory of South-West Africa. In accordance with Government resolutions on financial and administrative relations between the Republic and South-West Africa, matters relating to explosives were entrusted to the Minister of Economic Affairs, while the Department of Mines undertakes the administration of the Ordinance and the regulations on explosives in South-West Africa on behalf of the Department of Commerce.</p>

<p>It has been deemed desirable to exercise control over explosives in the Republic and South-West Africa in terms of one Act. With a view to this the Explosives Act of the Republic is being made applicable in the territory of South-West Africa, including the Eastern Caprivi Zipfel, and the ordinance and regulations of South-West Africa dealing with explosives are being revoked.</p>

<p>The South-West Africa Ordinance and regulations are in almost all respects iden tical to the Act and the regulations relating to explosives which apply in the Republic. The minor exceptions will cause no inconvenience to those who have to comply with the provisions of the Act. When the Explosives Act comes into effect in South-West Africa, the control over explosives in the Territory will be taken over from the Department of Mines by the Department of Commerce.</p>

<p>The Copyright Act, 1965 (Act 63 of 1965), came into operation on 11th September, 1965, and is also applicable to the territory of South-West Africa. This Bill provides, <i>inter alia,</i> for the protection of copyright sound recordings, cinematographic films, television and sound broadcasts and literary, dramatic and musical works. During the last few years reproductions of overseas cinematographic film productions have been imported by certain bodies which make it available to the public to be shown privately without royalties being paid to the manufacturers of the original cinematographic films. The result of this practice is that the provisions of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (Copyright) are violated and that the interests of the authorized importers who do, in fact, comply with the requirements of the Convention, are in this way seriously prejudiced.</p>

<p>Authorized distributors of cinematographic films have found that there are certain deficiencies in the present provisions of <span class="col_8195-8196" refersTo="page_1052"/>the Copyright Act which make it difficult to apply the Act in such a way that their rights will be adequately protected. As the Act reads at present, producing evidence when violation of copyright cases are heard in courts of law entails considerable expenses because persons have to come from abroad to give evidence here.</p>

<p>In order to make it easier for authorized distributors to protect their rights against the unauthorized distributors, it has therefore been deemed advisable to amend the provisions of the Copyright Act so that copyright will exist in the case of all cinematographic films, whether published or unpublished, and for the name of the person appearing on a published or unpublished cinematographic film to be recognized as the manufacturer of such cinematographic film.</p>

<p>Modern developments in the manufacture of cinematographic films make it advisable to promulgate, by regulation, the instructions in regard to the identification of the manufacturer of the cinematographic film so that these instructions may easily be adapted to ensure that this Act is applied effectively.</p>

<p>Such an amendment to the Copyright Act will be in accordance with the amendment affected at a diplomatic conference in Paris in 1971 to article 15 of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (Copyright) and will comply with international requirements.</p>

<p>The Bill amends sections 14 and 21 of the principal Act to give effect to the objects I have referred to.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I shall not detain the House long. I merely want to ask the hon. the Minister a question in regard to a provision of this Bill. I agree, naturally, with my hon. friend that it is good that copyright should be protected, particularly where the hard work of artists, writers, and so forth, is involved. There are, however, going to be new developments in this country in the next 5 or 10 years, in regard to the copyright of material which can be broadcast on one&#x2019;s own television screen. I should like to know to what extent this Bill is providing for matter of that nature. Let me explain shortly. As the hon. the Deputy Minister knows, it is possible abroad to obtain video-casettes, or tapes, on which there is a whole television programme. You could, for instance, have a BBC programme such as a serial, on such casettes. These casettes can then be shown privately in one&#x2019;s own home on a television screen. Does this Bill in any way affect, say, the renting of such a video-tape for private use in one&#x2019;s own home on a television screen, or does the Bill not cover cases of that nature?</p>

<p>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</p>

<p>The Nama, who according to the provisional returns of the 1970 population census number 32 853 belong to the Khoisan group of peoples, and their language contains the characteristic clicks of the Khoisan languages. After the Bushmen and Damara, the Nama are among the oldest inhabitants of the southern part of South-West Africa, formerly known as Great Namaqualand. Consequently they are the first indigenous nation with whom the Whites from the south came into contact. <span class="col_8197-8198" refersTo="page_1053"/>Traditionally they consist of different groups each of which has its own form of Government in its own territory.</p>

<p>With the arrival of the Hereros and their penetration <i>circa</i> 1830 into the pastures of the Nama, fierce and protracted conflicts arose between these two groups which lasted until almost the end of the previous century. This struggle was aggravated by the arrival of the Oorlams early in the previous century from the old Cape Colony.</p>

<p>After the Oorlams had conquered the Nama and had virtually amalgamated with them, forces were joined in continuing the earlier struggle against the Hereros. With the arrival of the Whites the struggle was terminated and the German r&#x00E9;gime made land available to the Nama who, after great loss of life, were exhausted, impoverished and fragmented. After the establishment of the Mandated Territory under the Union of South Africa, these areas were recognized, and in due course some were enlarged and a few additional areas were also made available to the Nama.</p>

<p>With the arrival of the Oorlams the Nama were strongly influenced by changes since the former had adopted various aspects of the way of life of the Whites south of the Orange River. In addition, the Nama had already come under the influence of mission work during the previous century. With the development of a new economy in the southern part of South-West Africa, considerable numbers were employed by White employers. In their areas, however, the Nama still maintained a great measure of subsistence economy based exclusively on animal husbandry.</p>

<p>As far as the government and administration of the Namas are concerned, it may briefly be mentioned that the administration of Native Affairs, including the Nama, since the suspension of military rule in South-West Africa, has been controlled by the Administrator in terms of powers allocated and adapted from time to time by proclamation of the Governor-General or legislation of Parliament.</p>

<p>In terms of the South-West Africa Bantu Affairs Administration Act, 1954 (Act No. 56 of 1954), the powers in respect of the administration of Native affairs were transferred to the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. With regard to certain local legislation affecting both Whites and Natives and which does not fall under the ambit of the abovementioned. Act No. 56 of 1954, the Legislative Assembly of South-West Africa provided in the South-West African Native Administration Ordinance, 1955 (Ordinance No. 4 of 1955), that the implementation of such local legislation, to the extent to which it is applicable to Native territories and to Natives, will be done by the Minister.</p>

<p>A readjustment was made in terms of the provisions of the South-West Africa Affairs Act 1969 (Act No. 25 of 1969), when the administration of matters aEecting the Nama in particular was transferred to the Minister of Coloured Affairs on 1st April, 1969. In this way, in terms of existing Acts applicable to the Natives, a separate administration was established for the Nama. In terms of the provisions of the South-West Africa Bantu Affairs Administration Act, 1954, the existing position remains unchanged, however, in respect of land (and certain mineral rights attached thereto) which has been or is to be set aside for Natives, and in respect of certain funds established for Natives and which in terms of the latter Act were transferred to the South African Bantu Trust.</p>

<p>To adjust said matters to the separate administration of affairs relating to the Nama, supplementary legislation is required.</p>

<p>Furthermore, arising out of the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry into South-West African Affirs, 1962-&#x2019;63, the Odendaal Commission, an enlarged and consolidated area was held out in prospect for the Nama. while the reservation of a number of separate reserves was to be suspended. Such progress has already been made with the acquisition and reservation of land for the said consolidated Nama territory that only three more properties, with a combined area of approximately 27 000 ha. still has to be purchased. On the other hand, inhabitants of the separate reserves, with a few exceptions, have already been settled in the consoldiated area. It is therefore opportune and desirable to give expression by law to this undertaking given to the Nama, in order to further the development of their territory, the introduction of a suitable settlement system, the overhaul of the administration and the rehabilitation of the Nama. with which progress has already been made.</p>

<p>The object of this Bill as set out in the long title, is consequently to make provision for the abovementioned matters. The <span class="col_8199-8200" refersTo="page_1054"/>most important proposed provisions are the following:</p>

<p>Clause 2:</p>

<p>The establishment of Namaland through the reservations and setting apart of specific land for the Nama.</p>

<p>Clause 3:</p>

<p>The transfer of that land to the Minister of Coloured Affairs in trust for the Nama and the withdrawal of certain of that land which is vested in the South African Bantu Trust.</p>

<p>Clause 4:</p>

<p>The recission and declaration as unalienated State property of certain separate reserves vested in the South African Bantu Trust.</p>

<p>Clause 5:</p>

<p>The transfer to the Minister of Coloured Affairs of certain funds established for the benefit of the Nama but which are still vested in the South African Bantu Trust.</p>

<p>Clause 7:</p>

<p>Prospecting and mining in Namaland in respect of which arrangements have become necessary owing to the withdrawal of land in Namaland vested in the South African Bantu Trust and to which certain mineral rights attach.</p>

<p>Clause 8:</p>

<p>Provisions in regard to existing laws through which the <i>status quo</i> in that respect is maintained, but by means of which executive powers in so far as such Acts apply to Namaland, are conferred on the Minister of Coloured Affairs.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, on behalf of this side of the House I want to inform the hon. Minister that we support the Second Reading of this legislation. The hon. gentleman sketched for us the historical background to how the Nama originated as a tribe, and also how they obtained their territory. I must say that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s explanation in this regard was very interesting. The hon. the Minister also sketched for us how these people will all be settled and already have been settled, with very few exceptions, in certain areas in Keetmanshoop, Gibeon and Bethanie. In this regard I want to tell him that although we support this legislation, he must not think that because we do we in any way support it with a view to agreeing with the Government&#x2019;s ultimate policy of making all these small nations and small territories completely independent and sovereign. Since these territories belonged to these people historically, and it is in fact possible to give them some or other form of government I think that the hon. the Minister understands the attitude of this side of the House which, of course, as far as the end result is concerned, differs entirely from the direction which his Party advocates.</p>

<p>It is also interesting to note that with the passage of time the Nama not only established themselves in their own area, but have to an increasing extent been taken up on the farms in the territory of South-West Africa, and that more and more of these people have also in due course entered commerce and industry. One can therefore expect that in due course there will be ever-fewer of these people in their own area. Consequently they will become established in the White area to an ever-greater extent. While some of these people are at present employed in the White area and in this way enjoy a high standard of living, it will also be desirable if those people are able to utilize in their own area more of the money and income they are earning, so as to uplift the rest of their population group. In that respect we have no objection to this legislation and if it is the intention of the hon. the Minister to teach the Nama better farming methods in due course, good and well. We have no objection to that, because we think it is in the interests of those people. Another thing we would not like to see in these areas which are being given to them is a loss in any way in soil fertility and therefore it is necessary for them to acquire far better farming methods.</p>

<p>I think that as a result of their animal husbandry background, this is probably the most important aspect of their agriculture which ought to receive attention. We on this side hope that the hon. the Minister, with his administration, will do everything in their power to improve animal husbandry among those people so that they may become better farmers. With these <span class="col_8201-8202" refersTo="page_1055"/>few words I want to say that we support the Second Reading and the passage of this legislation.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as one of the South-West Africa representatives I should also like to welcome this legislation. It is a good thing that this Parliament is in this way according recognition to one of the oldest population groups of South-West Africa. As the hon. the Minister rightly said the Nama are members of the Khoisan group. The word &#x201C;Khoisan&#x201D; is actually derived from the Nama word &#x201C;Koikoi&#x201D;, and from the word &#x201C;San&#x201D;. The &#x201C;San&#x201D; is the Bushmen group, and the &#x201C;Koikoi&#x201D; are the Hottentots. The White population of Southern Africa made the acquaintance of this particular group in South-West Africa for the first time on 1st May, 1670, when G. R. Muys, a Dutchman, disembarked from the Grundlingh along the west coast of South-West Africa. Muys is the person after whom Muizenberg was subsequently named. He saw five of these people and a dog along the coast. He landed there and followed them to a distance of three miles from the coast, where a little skirmish took place and one of them was killed. The landing party then returned.</p>

<p>Actually the Nama consist of seven different groups. They have their special names. There are the Khaugoa, the Gei/- Khauan, the Kara/gei/khoin, the Nara/- nin, the Gamu/nun, the Ogei and the Hawobe.</p>

<p>The farmers were unable to pronounce these names successfully, as the hon. member on the opposite side has also indicated now. For that reason they simply gave them fine discriptive names, namely the Velskoendraers. the Topnaars, the Swartboois, the Grootdode, the Fransmanhottentotte, and so on. These people played a special part in the history of South-West Africa.</p>

<p>One thinks in particular of one person whose life history is really engraved on the early history of South-West Africa, namely Hendrik Witbooi. Hendrik Witbooi had a very good schooling. He could write High Dutch very well. He left behind a diary of 192 pages, written between the years 1884 to 6th April, 1893. This Hendrik Witbooi was really a very interesting person. He grew up along the Orange River wnere he was a sheep-herder for his father, Moses Witbooi. He had an uncle by the name of Paul Visser. Paul Visser was a verger in the church, and a very religious man. One evening, while Hendrik Witbooi was walking along the banks of the Orange River, he heard someone speaking. He went closer and saw Paul Visser on his knees, saying a prayer. He approached even closer and realized that the man was praying, and tried to imitate him. It made a tremendous impression on Hendrik Witbooi, so that in fact he also received a very good religious training. Subsequently Paul Visser and Moses Witbooi had a fall out. They took up arms against each other and in fact Moses Witbooi was executed by Paul Visser, after Paul Visser had made him dig his own grave and sing Psalm 57. All this is very interesting.</p>

<p>This same Hendrik Witbooi was a good man. I now want to mention his good qualities in order to emphasize what good people these Nama were. Hendrik Witbooi was such a good man that after his father had stolen cattle from other tribes Hendrik drove them out through the back-door and returned them to their owners. On one occasion&#x2014;this I must really mention to you&#x2014;he was making a journey to the north, towards Windhoek, and was captured by a Herero patrol, and his entire group was executed. When they eventually came to the last man&#x2014;this was Hendrik Witbooi&#x2014;one of the oldest Hereros said: &#x201C;But look, I know this man&#x2014;he is a very good Christian, and you must spare his life.&#x201D; This they did. They left him with just his horse, and told him that he could return. He returned, and was a very disheartened and lonely man. On another occasion, while making a return journey, he rode past the farm Hoabetsaus, between two koppies, and there Hendrik Witbooi saw a vision. It was a vision which descended from the clouds, and he later described it to missionary Ebner.</p>

<p>In this vision he received a command. There were in fact three messages, complicated messages which I do not want to repeat to you. Nevertheless, Hendrik Witbooi regarded it as a command, a Divine command, to wipe out the Herero population of South-West Africa. Consequently, this is what he tried to do throughout his career. He actually kept a record of how many he had killed, and this amounted to <span class="col_8203-8204" refersTo="page_1056"/>thousands. At one stage leaders of the other population groups of South-West Africa said to him: &#x201C;Man, in heaven&#x2019;s name, put a stop to your wars.&#x201D; But he just did not want to. Subsequently Dr. Goering&#x2014;this was the father of the later notorious Hermann Goering&#x2014;made a special appeal to him. He then replied to him in High Dutch. It was a very interesting letter, and in it he stated that he was unable to do so. He said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I stand in blood. I stand as a servant who must carry out his master&#x2019;s behest. I shall carry on with this war until God says to me: There now, Hendrik, that is enough. Stop now.</block>

<p>But he went on to say in that letter that before he received that message he would not stop this war of extermination in South-West Africa. Hendrik Witbooi died in the battle of 1905 against the Germans. With that one of the finest chapters in the history of the Nama was closed. His was such a reign of terror that the rest of the population, and particularly the Hereros, continued to speak of Hendrik Witbooi long afterwards, and do so even to this day. They called him &#x201C;the short one&#x201D;, because he was so short. The Hereros still ask today &#x201C;Otjikorta, tji ri pi&#x201D;? (The short one, where is he?) They think he is still living in South-West Africa. Sir, with this I just want to indicate that these Nama have really played an important role in the history of South-West Africa. They engraved their particular pattern and qualities on it. It is a good thing that this Parliament should on this particular occasion accord them recognition in this way.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am rising to say a few words because most of the territory which is being consolidated for the Nama by means of this legislation is situated in the Mariental constituency. Therefore I shall not confine myself to the past of the Nama&#x2014;I shall confine myself to those of them who are still living, and to what is being done for them. That is why I am also pleased that the hon. member for Newton Park on the opposite side of the House also supports this legislation, on behalf of the Opposition, because it is in the interests of the Nama population.</p>

<p>If one considers the past history of the Nama population, one finds that they were distributed over a host of small areas in South-West Africa, with the result that it was not possible to give very much attention to them. If I may mention this, they lived to the south of Warmbad in two reserves, namely the Warmbad and the Bondelswart reserves. They also lived in Berseba and Tses, as well as in other small reserves to the west of Bethany by the name of Soromas, at Kranzplaas and west of Maltahohe at Neuhof. Now Kranzplaas, Tses and Berseba have been joined. Upon the recommendation of the Odendaal Report, to which the hon. the Minister referred, a lot of White land has been purchased and added. This took place in terms of resolutions adopted by this Parliament, the Legislative Assembly of South-West Africa, with great majorities by the White population, and also in co-operation with the Nama. That is why we believe that this legislation can constitute only advantages for the Nama in future. Because they have been consolidated into one large region and now fall, as the hon. the Minister said, under the Department of Coloured Affairs, it is possible to give proper attention to these people, which holds great promise for their future.</p>

<p>We know that the department is even now providing them with information in various spheres, including the sphere of agriculture. They are stock farmers first and foremost, and they are receiving instruction in this. Attempts are being made to improve their livestock. We think that the position is far better than it was in the past. Therefore we are pleased that there is unanimity in regard to this this morning. In regard to the recommendations of the Odendaal Report, I may say that the Opposition of South-West Africa crossed swords frequently with the Administration and the Government. We are pleased that this Parliament has today achieved unanimity in this regard. Consequently we hope and believe that the remaining land will be cleared shortly. As far as I know Warmbad and Berseba to the south have almost been completely evacuated. The people have already been moved to Namaland. The reserve to the west of Maltahohe, Neuhof, has also been completely evacuated. We think that the land will subsequently be transferred back to the Administration of South-West Africa, which will then decide in what way it will be utilized. We hope that this will in future be done.</p>

<p><span class="col_8205-8206" refersTo="page_1057"/>I want to thank the hon. the Minister for this Bill which he submitted to the House this morning, and we, as South-West Africans, support him wholeheartedly. By way of repetition I also want to say that we are pleased that we also have the support of the Opposition in this regard because it is in the interests of the Mama population as a whole.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should just like to express my appreciation of the fact that this Bill has been received and welcomed so unanimously by the House. I think the discussion was interesting; we enjoyed it very much. Actually, I want to inform the hon. member for Newton Park, the entire House, as well as those people from South-West Africa, that we will take pains to preserve the soil of the consolidated Namaland in the best condition for the future. Our department has well qualfied extension officers in its employ. I may also say for the information of the House that we are already working on the planning of Namaland. It is true that individual farms will not be subdivided and transferred to individual Nama farmers, but we are undertaking planning for that area and we are establishing our paddock system for collective grazing. My department and I will take great pains, and will go out of our way, to preserve the soil of Namaland for future generations.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not think there are any further observations I need make. I just want to repeat that I appreciate the support hon. members have given this measure.</p>

<p>Mr Chairman, when the debate on the hon the Minister&#x2019;s Vote was adjourned, various matters of considerable importance had been raised. Many of these matters will, of course, be replied to when the hon. the Minister replies to the debate. One particular aspect in which I am interested and, indeed, in which many people in Natal are interested, is the question of the provision of a medical school for the benefit of White students in the province of Natal. It has been said on many occasions that there is a considerable shortage of doctors in the country. The hon. the Minister himself and his predecessors have had a committee of inquiry investigating the position. The hon. the Minister has made a statement on a previous occasion indicating that during the period of the next five years, the intake of medical students will be doubled at the existing universities. The latest position is that the hon. the Minister, in reply to a question earlier this Session, said that it would not be possible to take any such steps apart from one step at the University of the Witwatersrand, but in the light of the financial situation of the country, he was unable to take any further steps at this particular stage as far as the other universities were concerned.</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, just before the adjournement I was dealing with the question of the training of medical students and medical doctors in South Africa. It appears that, as the situation is today, we have the ridiculous position that there is a tremendous shortage of doctors. Indeed, many hospitals, both Provincial and State hospitals, are having an enormous struggle to meet their staff requirements. Yet, at the same time, we have a situation where a large number of potential doctors are unable to obtain admission to any of the existing medical schools. The number of applicants has increased considerably over the years. I should like to refer particularly to the position as far as English-speaking students are concerned. There are only two medical schools available to them, viz. one at the University of Cape Town and one at the Witwatersrand University. If one looks at the figures over the past few years, one immediately sees that at present only about 20 per cent of the applicants are successful in gaining admission to these medical schools. For instance, over the pat few years, 1971 and 1972, no fewer than 3 396 applications were <span class="col_8207-8208" refersTo="page_1058"/>received at the University of Cape Town and the Witwatersrand University medical schools of which a total of 708 were able to be accepted as the intake for the commencement of their studies during those years. Consequently we have the situation that the English-speaking students are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain admission. If one looks at the figures for 1965, for instance, one sees that the figures have certainly grown since those applications were received in 1965 when, of the 687 applications received from White students, 246 were accepted. The number of applicants increased enormously. Many of the young people in Natal are at a distinct disadvantage without any medical school in existence in that province. They have to face the additional expense, if they are fortunate enough to gain admission to the University of Cape Town or the Witwatersrand University medical schools, that is involved in studying away from home. In addition to that, the shortage of doctors at our hospitals is indeed tremendous in Natal. There appears to be no reason why a medical school should not be established at the Natal University either in Pietermaritzburg, where the Grey&#x2019;s Hospital could be used as the teaching hospital, or in Durban where Addington Hospital could also be used as a teaching hospital. The question of the provision of these facilities is one about which the people of Natal are most anxious to receive some further information from the hon. the Minister. There are other young potential doctors who have found that, even after enrolling at the university in Pietermaritzburg and completing virtually a first-year medicine course and passing all their subjects, they are still unable to gain admission to one of the medical schools either at the University of Cape Town or the Witwatersrand.</p>

<p>The other matter which I want to raise with the hon. the Minister is in regard to the item of reform schools appearing under his Vote. These reform schools and the schools of industry, which are established in terms of the Children&#x2019;s Act, are the responsibility of the hon. Minister of National Education. These schools play a very important role in the re-education of the young people. Particularly as far as the reform schools are concerned, juvenile offenders and others who have committed offences are committed to a reform school to undergo the treatment that is available at the reform schools, where there is only one reform school for boys and one for girls. The position here seems to be that, in spite of the fact that a degree of success is obtained in the rehabilitation of these young people, there appears to be a necessity for a further amount of research to be undertaken in this regard as far as the training and re-education of the people at the reformatory and reform schools is concerned. It is alarming to note that the number of persons amongst young people committing offences has increased considerably over the past few years. If one makes a study of statistics of the Department of Justice and also of the Department of Police, one is immediately struck by the fact that there is a large number of young people, an increasing number of young people, committing offences. There is a tendency amongst these crimes for there to be an increase in sexual crimes. The number of cases involving sexual offences has almost increased by 50 per cent over the past five years. I mention this because we have had cases where young juveniles have been convicted of sexual offences and committed to reform schools which falls under the jurisdiction of this hon. Minister. If one looks at the only exhaustive inquiry and survey that was undertaken some years ago by Dr. hotter entitled &#x201C;Die Rehabilitasie van Blanke-jeugoortreders&#x201D;, it appears that he conducted a follow-up survey of 544 former students of the reform school at Constantia. Looking at the figures that were provided at that stage, it appears that almost 70 per cent of those who are undergoing rehabilitation and re-education at the reform school, have been convicted of criminal offences. The follow-up of these cases also shows that only 26 per cent could be classified as having been successfully rehabilitated, as the balance were found to have committed offences within the five-year follow-up period after their release, discharge or abscondment from the reform school. These figures show that there was also an increase in convictions involving sexual offences after the release of these persons from the reform school. The figures show that some 5,5 per cent of those they were able to follow up and trace, which constitutes 382 former pupils of the reform school, were convicted of sexual offences within five years of leaving the school.</p>

<p>We have recently had the position, too, where a young man was convicted of five cases involving rape and attempted rape, and was sentenced to death. This person was also unfortunately one who attended <span class="col_8209-8210" refersTo="page_1059"/>the reform school at Constantia and had a previous record. He evidently absconded from the reform school and, from the information I have received, was never returned to the reform school at Constantia. I should therefore like to suggest that the hon. the Minister should institute an investigation into the effectiveness of the rehabilitation that is being carried out, particularly amongst this type of case that is receiving attention at the reform school at the present time.

<p>That hon. member has no cause to speak. That was when the wool prices were still good and when doctor&#x2019;s degrees were not obtainable for advertising or commercial purposes. [Interjection.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, today I should like to make a request to the hon. the Minister. In the first place I want to ask the Minister whether he cannot consider removing all the obstacles and bringing the schools, in which retarded children are today accommodated, schools which are at present under the Department of Labour, under the auspices of his department. I am merely asking this question; the Minister can elaborate on it himself.</p>

<p>I want to begin by saying, in the discussion of this Education Vote, that our coun try has incomparable physical sources, but man is the most valuable of all our sources. Man accommodates the forces which, through the proper utilization of those sources, will eventually determine the outcome of the power struggle in which we are involved. There are two elements in God&#x2019;s creation which are of primary importance as far as the educationist&#x2014;the teacher&#x2014;in the education process is concerned. One is the unfathomable depths of the human spirit and the second is the sublimity of the achievement in developing to maximum human capacity that power sources, the beauty and the diversity of creation. The sublimity of the achievement in the education process, and in the Creator&#x2019;s revelation to man, is inextricably bound up with man&#x2019;s ability to order his brain power, his capacity and his knowledge, and to follow this up productively to the greater veneration of God and the greater happiness of man. As far as I am concerned, that is the great meaning that lies locked up in that. That is why I say that the spiritual and intellectual creation of capital is infinitely more important to us than the economic creation and investment of capital. It is primarily the educationist &#x2014;the family and the teacher&#x2014;who is able to allow the measureless, unfathomable, hidden forces that reside in man to develop in the right direction and to let them unfold to transform the crises, in which the Republic of South Africa and the world around it move today, into greater opportunities. We in the Republic will have to challenge our own crises, with all the fronts that are today arranged against us, and all the boundaries of the unknown future, and we shall have to do this chiefly with our own intellectual powers and the tenacity of our moral fibre. We have no alternative. Our ability to transform the passions welling up in Africa and the world outside, and which dominate the relationships towards us today, into relationships which are motivated by realism and correctly balanced, non-militant considerations, will determine our future. Our ability to transform this will be determined by two big factors. The first is our scientific and technical ability, and the second is the faith and the intellectual equipment of our citizens which is supported, and will inevitably have to be supported, by greater responsibility, loyalty, perseverance, ethical relationships between people, regardless of colour and creed, and respect for authority. Here the teacher occupies a central <span class="col_8211-8212" refersTo="page_1060"/>position. No people will be subject to greater demands during the last half of the century in which we are living than specifically ourselves. Even if we could militarily defeat all the militant enemies active on various fronts, the need and the pressures for higher standards of living, the elimination of the sweat and the strain, the struggle to free from ignorance and poverty all those who stand within our ranks, and around us, in the process of economic and political emancipation, cannot be escaped from.</p>

<p>I want to say that in this entire process, and in this whole task that lies before us, the teacher has vanished as the central figure in the whole hierarchical structure. His disappearance has gone hand in hand with the greater rejection of authority amongst the youth, and with a shift of emphasis from the spiritual and knowledge-founded norms to the utility level on which we have evaluated the teacher. The teacher has been deprived of his status, his image of authority in his own sovereign sphere in his class-room. He must exercise authority according to a lot of prescriptions. Today he shares his sovereign level of authority with parents, principals, the department and a lot of regulations. The recognition of his position as a central developer, architect and supplier of the product that goes to the universities and elsewhere, has indefensibly been undervalued by all of us in the recent past. His denigration was the result of an undervaluing by us of his social status, his financial demands on service and his own sovereign level of authority. Today I appeal to those of us sitting here as a Parliament to recognize, within the framework of this tremendous task entrusted to our educationist, the authority of the teacher as being central to the whole process. I appeal to us all here to give the teacher the recognition he deserves. Through that recognition of his authority and his status we will share in the beneficial consequences that will result, that will illuminate the heart of the Child, and that of the young man that goes to university and elsewhere, with the essential, interwoven components of respect for authority, loyalty, a sense of responsibility and. above all, a re-emphasis and a revaluation in our youth of that which has eternal value and is more valuable than money, and the position and newer obtained by money. This is the serious appeal I am making today. May we as legislators succeed in giving more serious thought to the place of our teachers, and may we have a greater appreciation of our teachers, who occupy the central position in our whole education process.</p>

<speech by="#venter">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. D. M. VENTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there are two matters I briefly want to mention. The first is that I should very much like to express a few words of sincere thanks and appreciation to the Minister and the department for the concession that has been made in respect of the schools for children who are badly retarded intellectually. In any area there is one of those schools, a school that is doing a very big job. Up to now that school has had to depend on an allowance of 25 cents per child per school day, and that is why we were very pleased when we saw in the Estimates that instead of 25 cents per child per school day, the amount is now R1 per child per school day. Of course, this is not yet what was requested at the time by the Van Wyk Commission&#x2019;s report, but we know that that report is still receiving the attention of the Minister and his department. In the meantime it means a tremendous amount, and for that we want to say thank you very sincerely.</p>

<p>The second matter I want to emphasize here very strongly has a bearing on the valuable work that is being done&#x2014;this falls under this Minister&#x2019;s department&#x2014;by the Human Sciences Research Council, the HSRC. While I was listening to the various Estimates submitted here, the Estimates of the Railways, of the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs and of the Minister of Finance, two aspects permeated the various Estimates like a refrain. The one is the great manpower shortage, and everything in our power must be done to discover, retain and utilize our manpower to a greater extent. The second matter that was emphasized is that everything must be done to increase productivity. These two matters are emphasized very strongly today. I want to say that it is disquieting, for example, to see certain figures furnished in the 1968 South African statistics. According to those statistics it was found, over a period of 12 years, that only about 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the boys who passed Std. 6, and a little more than 60 per cent of the girls, reached Std. 8. But what is more alarming is that only about 30 per cent of the boys who were in Std. 6 during those 12 years, reached Std. 10. In the case of the girls the percentage was even lower. Sir, one asks oneself where these talented young people <span class="col_8213-8214" refersTo="page_1061"/>were lost. The scientists tell us that one of the causes will perhaps now be removed when we have more to do with differentiated education, so that children&#x2019;s talents can be summed up and measured at an earlier stage and so that they can be channelled in a direction in which they will achieve the very best they can. But, Sir, it is impossible to have differentiated education unless one has the necessary scientific means of measurement that can gauge the ability, aptitude and the interest of those pupils so that they can subsequently be placed in certain homogeneous groups where they can make the best use of that educational system, and this is where the HSRC&#x2019;s psychometric division plays an extremely important role. As far as productivity is concerned, it is generally accepted that one cannot make a person more productive unless one places him in a job or in job surroundings for which he has the necessary aptitude and interest, and which he can cope with. This not only enables him to realize himself, but it motivates him and moves him towards higher productivity. One is amazed to see what a tremendous number of tests have already been standdardized by the HSRC, and are continually being improved, but then one is saddened to learn, as is apparent from the HSRC&#x2019;s annual report for the year 1970-&#x2019;71, that at the end of that year there were about 200 tests and other projects on this institute&#x2019;s waiting list. At the end of the 1971-&#x2019;72 financial year this had increased to 400. With the scant growth the HSRC is allowed, this backlog will increase from year to year. Sir, if this work the HSRC is doing is virtually the laboratory that must give birth to those aspects that make it possible for us to better utilize our manpower and increase our productivity, one asks oneself if something drastic must not be done to enable this important institution to meet the great need that exists, not only in respect of the Whites, because one cannot, after all, apply to the non-Whites the tests that have been designed and standardized for Whites. One needs other types of tests, particularly for the various ethnic groups, tests that have been standardized according to their mental abilities and their specific aptitudes. Sir, since there is a big shortage even in respect of the Whites, since the demand for the work that is being done by the HSRC&#x2019;s psychometric division increases by the day, and since it is an investment for us to utilize each of our work forces properly, one asks oneself whether it is not essential that more be done to enable them to continue to develop their extremely important work. I saw recently what a saving it was for America to determine whether young men who are selected are fit for military service. Those young men, who are not fit for military service, are excluded and separated so that unnecessary money is not wasted on their training. A phenomenal amount was saved in this way. Sir, when one is lodging a plea for this type of work one feels one is lodging a plea for something that will bring about a saving for the State and, what is more, that will enable all population groups in this country to produce more and maintain a better standard of living.</p>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the subject that I wish to discuss with the hon. the Minister today is the question of children suffering from minimal brain dysfunction. In March 1969, an extremely interesting and very comprehensive report was submitted by what was known as the Murray Commission on this whole subject. It would appear that of the approximately 126 000 children with learning difficulties in our country, some 45 000 to 50 000 fall into this category of minimal brain dysfunction. These are children with either average, or even higher than average, I.Q., and who only suffer certain disabilities, which the commission felt should be recognized and dealt with. In 1971, when I asked the hon. the Minister a question about this report, he replied that he had received the report, that he had considered it, that he had accepted it, but that he had not at that stage implemented it, as certain of the recommendations concerned various educational bodies to whom he was referring the matter. Then during this year, in reply to a question put to him by the hon. member for Wynberg, the Minister said that his department accepted the responsibility for Group C pupils, that is to say, children for whom special schools would be required in terms in this report, and that the Administrators had been asked to consider the implementation of the recommendations with regard to children in Groups A and B, that is to say, children who would have attention given to them within the framework of the normal schools and through the medium of a specific class, where they would be taught during the normal school hours, so that they are not removed from their normal surroundings and so that they do not grow up with the <span class="col_8215-8216" refersTo="page_1062"/>complex that they differ from ordinary, normal children; because in every other respect, except for this difficulty that they experience in learning, these children are perfectly normal. Sir, these children in the minimal brain dysfunction group represented somewhere in the region of 7 per cent, I think, of the total number of school-going children in our country. It is almost certain that half of these children would be in the Transvaal and the balance distributed over the other provinces. In the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply of 3rd March of this year, to which I referrred earlier, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Cape Education Department is already taking steps to provide facilities. Representations have also been made to the universities to provide, in their courses for the training of clinical and educational psychologists, for the new field of knowledge concerning the psychology of the children with learning disabilities.</block>

<p>Sir, the concern of parents who have children of this type is that nothing has been done with sufficient haste to promote what has been so strongly recommended in this report. One of the most important difficulties is the provision of teachers who have received proper training to deal with children of this kind, because they cannot be dealt with by the normal school-teacher, no matter how able that teacher may be. There is a certain technical knowledge which teachers of these children must acquire. The commission bases this opinion on the experience gained in the United States and on works written by educationists in other parts of the world. It is a recognizable type of difficulty and it needs teachers who have received proper training, and my plea to the Minister is that this must be done as expeditiously as possible. I was very disappointed to find in this reply that only the Cape Education Department had already commenced to try to do something. I feel that the hon. Minister should regard this as a matter of urgency because above everything else it will keep within the viable community some 50 000 children who will be citizens who can be properly prepared to find their place in our normal society and make their contribution to the welfare of the community and the country. I feel that every year&#x2019;s delay is retrogressive in so far as the fate of these children is concerned. Of course the number of children does not remain static. It increases. In Johannesburg an experiment was started before the hon. the Minister acted in terms of this report. It was started through the efforts of a mother who herself went to the U.S.A. in order to receive the necessary training to handle these children. This mother was herself a qualified medical practitioner and a class was started in a normal school. Then friction arose because of the introduction of a teacher who had not been trained in this specific manner and unfortunately the whole system broke down despite the fact that some R10000 had been spent on special equipment which is now apparently just a wasted asset. This mother at the moment&#x2014;I am not sure whether she has the legal right to do so&#x2014;is continuing with the training of her own child and some six or seven other children of friends of hers. My point is that taking into account the tremendous complexity of the problems which the Department of Education faces, some of which were referred to by the hon. member for Kimberley South and also by the hon. member for Carletonville, who dealt with the importance of the teacher, I believe that where we have an opportunity to avoid further deterioration and retrogression in the standards of the M.B. Dysfunction child with his normal, if not above normal, IQ, there should be a very much greater sense of urgency in our approach to this problem. I believe that the Minister should perhaps confer with universities and point out the urgency of the problem and confer with the administrators so that whatever assistance can be given, can be given immediately, even if that assistance comes from people who are not on the permanent teaching staff or part and parcel of teachers&#x2019; organizations. Everyone who can possibly assist in this problem, I believe, should be brought together at some sort of conference so that the Minister can get this work moving as fast as possible. I feel further that financial provision should also be made, and I think the Budget gives the hon. the Minister sufficient scope to enable him to make that financial provision. He should make provision to give every opportunity to the various bodies to proceed with the work so that Parliament can from time to time have a report on what is taking place. I believe this is a matter of very great concern and importance. I feel that the problems which the Minister has faced &#x2014;we know that at that time he was unable to do very much&#x2014;must indicate to him that there may be certain barriers that one <span class="col_8217-8218" refersTo="page_1063"/>has to break down. One has to break down difficulties in the thinking of principals who do not like anything abnormal in their routine school administration. That is possible. I do not allege that it is taking place, but it is possible. There can also be a clash of personalities, and so on. But if the Minister lays down a policy after a conference of this nature and makes it absolutely clear that as far as his department is concerned this is what he expects to be done, I do feel that he will find a very much different attitude and a greater response, and above all, he will bring home to the people who look at this problem with a sense of hopelessness, because of the lack of facilities, a greater measure of harmony and joy. He will bring harmony into the lives of families who have children of this nature. We as citizens of the country in addition will feel encouraged by the fact that here, where expeditious steps can be taken and the matter can be accelerated, the Minister is sufficiently aware of the problem and needs as little encouragement as possible because he knows himself that this is something which will be to the benefit of the welfare of the nation.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>We have now come to the end of the discussion of the Education Vote. Before I forget, I should like to express to all the speakers on both sides of the House my sincere thanks for their participation. You will have noticed, Sir, just as I did, that the second and the third parts of this discussion&#x2014;I almost feel like saying this debate which has unfortunately been cut into so many pieces&#x2014;passed off in a much more tranquil and positive manner than the first part of it did. You will probably have noticed too, Sir, that even the hon. member for Orange Grove, who actually raised the matters relating to the S.A.B.C. and television, was much quieter and calmer than is usually the case. You will probably think that he has now undergone a change for the good, and that he now wishes to adopt a more positive attitude. But I want to warn you not to be too optimistic. I think the hon. member has completely overtaxed himself. I shall tell you why I think so. I have gone through the Press reports published over the past few months on the hon. member&#x2019;s actions, and I must tell you. Sir, that when I see how he worked and carried on, I find it a pity that the Americans did not know about him, otherwise they would probably have had him in the boxing ring against Joe Frazier last night. For, what do we read? This is what we read here&#x2014;and all of these are headings supplied by his good friends, the English-language newspapers &#x2014;&#x201C;Malan challenges the S.A.B.C.&#x201D;; &#x201C;Malan hits at the S.A.B.C.&#x201D;; &#x201C;Malan slashes the S.A.B.C.&#x201D;; &#x201C;Malan slams the Broederbond plot&#x201D;; &#x201C;Malan slates ban on religion&#x201D;. I think all of us have sympathy with the hon. member for the fact that his friends, <i>The Star</i> and the <i>Natal Daily News</i> and the <i>Pretoria News,</i> plunged him into all these miseries, for what did the hon. member do? What is the only thing he did? According to those newspaper reports he put a question to me in this House, a question in which he objected to the S.A.B.C. because this body had allegedly imposed a prohibition on religious broadcasts from Radio L.M., and because I was ostensibly unwilling or did not have the courage to reply to that question. But, Sir, do you know what the joke of the matter is? He never put that question to me. All he did, was to place that Question on the Order Paper to be replied to by the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, and the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs wrote a letter back to him because he wanted a written reply. As a result of that one finds all that exaggerated language which the newspapers are now imputing to their hero. But while I am referring to that, let us rather get serious in the limited time that is left.</p>

<p>The hon. member touched upon the matter of the S.A.B.C.&#x2019;s co-operation in regard to Radio L.M. and its actions in regard to religious broadcasts, and I want to reply to this matter at once. I want to tell him that it is known as a result of public announcements that the S.A.B.C. is acting as the commercial manager of Radio L.M. Now I do not know whether the hon. member has ever heard of a commercial manager placing his services at someone&#x2019;s disposal free of charge. Then the hon. member asked me. by way of a supplementary question in Parliament, whether I had so little consideration for all the thousands of licence-holders that I could allow such a thing. I want to tell the hon. member that the S A BC. is earning a good fee through this function it is performing, and that this will benefit the listeners in South Africa. Regarding the religious broadcasts from Radio L.M., I want to say that the S.A.B.C. is probably one of the few broadcasting <span class="col_8219-8220" refersTo="page_1064"/>organizations in the world which does not commercialize religion but leaves ample time for free broadcasts of religious programmes. The hon. member knows that this is the policy of the S.A.B.C., and that this is the policy which is also being followed in respect of Radio L.M.</p>

<p>I said that the S.A.B.C.&#x2019;s religious broadcasts were free of charge. This is a matter of policy with them; they do not commercialize religious programmes.</p>

<p>Sir, now I come to another point mentioned by the hon. member in passing. He objected to the reappointment of Dr. P. J. Meyer as chairman of the S.A.B.C. Control Board. I want to tell the hon. member that I am convinced, and this goes for the Cabinet as well, that Dr. P. J. Meyer is the best and the most competent person for this particular task. I want to make an offer to the hon. member. If, with a view to the next appointment, he knows of a better person&#x2014;excluding himself, of course&#x2014;then he may submit such names to me and I shall consider them.</p>

<p>The hon. member also commented on &#x201C;Current Affairs&#x201D;. He objected to &#x201C;Current Affairs&#x201D;, claiming that this amounted to indoctrination and that it was one-sided.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Not I; <i>Rapport</i> did.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>And he quoted <i>Rapport.</i> quite correct. But I wonder whether the hon. member read that whole report in <i>Rapport.</i> The heading of that report in <i>Rapport</i> was contradicted completely by the article. I have the data here in front of me. The first question put by <i>Rapport</i> in that survey, was whether the listeners thought the S.A.B.C. was politically impartial. Those who replied that the S.A.B.C. was in fact impartial, were as follows: All those questioned&#x2014;44,8 per cent; Afrikaansspeaking people&#x2014;59.7 per cent; English-speaking people&#x2014;23.2 per cent. Now. the hon. member actually spoke on behalf of the English-speaking people, who are objecting so much to this &#x201C;Current Affairs&#x201D; programme. Only 23 per cent of them responded to this survey, saying they thought the S.A.B.C. was impartial. But, Sir, we know what the value of surveys of this nature is. We may as well leave the matter at that. In this regard I also want to read out a brief report which was published in <i>Rapport</i> on 21st February and in which this person wrote the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Over three or four weeks of close attention there was not a sentence in it&#x2026;</block>

<p>This is a reference to &#x201C;Current Affairs&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; to which I could take serious exception.</block>

<block name="quote">*Mr. P. A. PYPER: Who wrote it?</block>

<block name="quote">*The MINISTER: He wrote&#x2014;</block>

<block name="quote">I came to the conclusion that &#x201C;Current Affairs&#x201D; is a pretty good instance of a dog being given a bad name. If it seeks to indoctrinate us all in nationalism, it does no more than its detractors who seek to indoctrinate us in internationalism.</block>

<p>The hon. member at the back there wanted to know who had written it. It was written by a regular columnist of <i>Rapport,</i> Mr. Calpin. Sir, let us now leave these matters at that.</p>

<p>The hon. member touched upon the important matter of television. He tried to suggest that over the past year, since the announcement had been made, nothing on earth had been done by the Government in regard to television. We know the hon. member; he has a penchant for exaggeration.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Very well, I accept the hon. member said we had done too little. But I want to point out to the hon. member what we have done, and then I want to ask him whether he does not want to reconsider his opinion. In the first place, I want to call to mind our Afrikaans proverb, namely &#x201C;Trou is nie perde koop nie&#x201D; (marriage is a serious thing). I want to tell the hon. House that the introduction of a television service with the objects which the S.A.B.C. has in view, as far as efficiency and satisfactory service are concerned, is no minor task either. It is not merely a matter of a building being erected. It is not merely a matter of another railway line or another dam having to be constructed. What is involved here, is something much <span class="col_8221-8222" refersTo="page_1065"/>more comprehensive. Now, I do not wish to repeat. In the first place, I want to refer the hon. member, as the hon. member for Springs also did, to the report of the S.A.B.C., in which important information is furnished. There is no need for the hon. member to consult the report now; I am only going to refer to it in passing. In that report important information is furnished up to the date of its completion&#x2014;it is, of course, last year&#x2019;s report. Reference is made in it to the important project committee constituted by the S.A.B.C. The names of those committee members are furnished. All of them are technically qualified people, experienced people, reliable officials. In addition reference is made to the technical advisory committee. I do not think I have ever heard any criticism against the constitution of the technical advisory committee. It includes the best scientists we have in this country.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, we do not have a representative of the Department of Labour on the technical advisory committee, but we do have representatives of that department on the manpower committee, with which I shall deal later on.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>That is a subcommittee.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it is a sub-committee. I also want to refer to the financing of the planning and the preparation phase of our television, a matter which is also reported in that annual report. Now we have the curious observation made by the hon. member in this House that not one single cent has been voted for television in these Estimates. That is true, Sir, To the man outside, who is uninformed, this may perhaps be a very serious omission. But, surely, to a member who ought to be informed, a person such as the hon. member for Orange Grove, this is an unforgivable statement to make. Surely the hon. member knows that in our Estimates we only find particulars on loans made to the S.A.B.C., for instance, in respect of its external services, its indigenous services for South-West Africa and the development of the F.M. mast system and, in addition, in respect of the smaller amounts from Revenue Account which we recover from the South-West Africa Account. Now, by making that statement the hon. member thinks he can put us off with fair words. Surely that does not become a member sitting in a front bench. After all, the hon. member knows that we authorized the S.A.B.C. in this House this year to negotiate a foreign loan. We read in the newspapers that a foreign loan of R18| million had in fact been negotiated for the preparation and planning phase of television, and that it was a revolving credit with a term of six years.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>In that case, may I ask the hon. the Minister why the S.A.B.C. has not yet been given permission to proceed with the introduction of a television service?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I did of course expect that question, because on a previous occasion the hon. member put a question to me in this regard and had replied to it in the negative. The interpretation attached to it by my advisers, is that we should give them instructions when we fix the date on which they are to start with the service. But the Cabinet&#x2019;s instruction that the S.A.B.C. should get this service to be assigned to it, is the instruction which the S.A.B.C. requires.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<p>In that case, why do you give them permission to borrow money overseas?</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<p>Because you have not yet given them permission to introduce television.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. member is now trying to make this an academic matter. The Cabinet gave the S.A.B.C. permission to plan and prepare the service. The formal consent which I as the Minister must give, will be granted to the S.A.B.C. on that day when the Cabinet&#x2014; we may as well emphasize this point, too &#x2014;decides on the date on which a start will be made with transmission. For the information of the hon. member and the House I should like to mention a few facts on the planning which has been done by the S.A.B.C. since October, 1971. In the first <span class="col_8223-8224" refersTo="page_1066"/>place, I want to say that the S.A.B.C. found the site south of where the present radio complex is being built in Auckland Park &#x2014;as the hon. member comes from Johannesburg, he will know that this is the site on which the Auckland Park police station is still situated at the moment&#x2014;to be suitable for a television complex. The excavations required for the building have already been done. A master plan for the planning of the television complex has already been drawn up, a master plan which holds considerable advantages. One of the most important advantages which that complex will hold is its elasticity with a view to the longterm development of the complex. The studios for all phases are on the same level, and the studios with their control rooms in phases II and III are mirror-images of those in phase I. That work has already been completed. This is great and important work if one wants to start with a television network.</p>

<p>Now I come to another point. The hon. member referred to the training of staff. His hon. colleague for Florida, who apologized for not being able to be here this afternoon, responded to this particular point. He also called attention to the enormous need which would exist for trained staff. I could speak about this matter for a long time, and there are various aspects to this matter of manpower. In the first place, I want to tell you, Sir, that the S.A.B.C. itself, as behoves any undertaking which plans and controls its affairs properly and thoroughly, has taken upon itself the task of undertaking the training of the staff it requires. What has it done? It has planned for a training centre for television staff. This will be housed in one of the buildings forming part of that large complex. The hon. member knows that area. He will know that there are many buildings which will be serviceable for a long time. The training centre for television staff will be housed in one of the buildings on the site of the old police station. But that is not all it has done. The S.A.B.C. was keen to learn from people who knew more about this matter than they themselves did &#x2014;I want to say at once that the S.A.B.C. knows a great deal about this matter&#x2014;and it made inquiries of its overseas contacts. Inquiries were sent to five different organizations abroad with a view to acquiring an expert knowledge in regard to the training of staff for television purposes. The services of the Belgian Radio and Television were accepted, and two of their officials came to South Africa in April of this year already. In conjunction with the S.A.B.C. staff they immediately started to draw up a master plan for the training of staff. This work has already been completed and will, <i>inter alia,</i> imply that the S.A.B.C. will have to recruit&#x2014;on a contract basis, of course&#x2014; a number of instructors, each of whom will have to be a specialist in some technical sphere or other, to assist in this training. In other words, the S.A.B.C. has done the spadework. In addition, we know that for a long time already the S.A.B.C. has been having its technical staff trained mainly at the Wit-watersrand College for Advanced Technical Education. I want to add that as far as the private sector and industry are concerned, a considerable amount of preliminary work has been done, and later on, when I talk about the technical advisory committee, I want to come back to this point. I want to say, furthermore, that the S.A.B.C. has its plans in order for the purchase of suitable film material abroad for stockpiling purposes. Of course, in conjunction with that, facilities are also required for doing the necessary language dubbing. If one wants to broadcast film material in Afrikaans, one has to see to it that the language is Afrikaans, but if its language medium is English when it is purchased, it goes without saying that dubbing is not always necessary. The S.A.B.C. is well on its way to making these preparations.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>May I put a question to the hon. the Minister? Is the S.A.B.C. also going to make use of the films of the South African Film Board and also of the film board for the production of motion pictures?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to that in a moment. I just want to say that a second language dubbing facility will be installed in the old police buildings on the Auckland Park site, with which the hon. member is familiar too. Now I come to the point on which the hon. member has just asked me a question, namely the compilation of programmes on film. It is essential for the S.A.B.C. to have its own facilities on a limited scale, particularly with a view to flashes. That goes without saying. In addition, just as the S.A.B.C. avails itself of sources abroad, it will also have to avail itself of other sources, including <i>inter alia</i> those of the Film Board which are already available here in South Africa. The <span class="col_8225-8226" refersTo="page_1067"/>film studio facilities to which I referred, will also be housed in a part of the old police set-up at Auckland Park.</p>

<p>Next I come to the work of the Technical Advisory Committee. In this regard I could furnish the hon. member with a mass of information. I shall try to cover the matter quickly. The hon. member wanted to know what had been accomplished. The report of the S.A.B.C. contains certain references to it. I shall omit them. The hon. member knows what the constitution of the committee is. He knows that the committee published a report on the choice of a colour system; I shall therefore omit that too. The hon. member also knows that a report was published on the socio-cultural influence of television.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Is that available to us yet?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It became available after the hon. member had put the question to me. This report has not yet been considered, but it has in fact become available in the meantime. I may tell the hon. member that the S.A.B.C. has decided to make available at its own expense R12 000 per annum to the Human Sciences Research Council for starting with this important project, for which interest is also being shown abroad. I do not wish to discuss the further implications of that report at this stage. It is a matter which is still to receive the attention of the Cabinet in due course.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member spoke about a satellite ground station or ground stations. Actually, he pleaded for two of them. The Technical Advisory Committee has recommended that for the time being one satellite ground station will have to be sufficient, and that the Post Office ought to make provision for it. The hon. member referred to the enormous cost. Well, this hon. member knows how the cost of living and the cost of manufacture has risen throughout the world. It stands to reason that he should not expect it to be possible for a satellite ground station to be erected at the same cost that was mentioned in the report at the time. The recommendation made by the Technical Advisory Committee is therefore that the Post Office should provide the facilities for a satellite ground station.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Could I ask the hon. the Minister why the estimated cost of that satellite station has increased from R1 million to R4 million within such a short period?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member and his colleagues take delight in attacking my colleague the Minister of Public Works from time to time on the increase in the cost of building houses, and in attacking my colleague the Minister of Finance on the increase in the cost of living. The hon. member may simply ask himself why his own salary has increased over the same period, and then he himself ought to get the answer as to why the cost of a satellite ground station has increased too. The hon. member will, of course, agree that one can make a start with a television service without having a satellite ground station, although in that case one&#x2019;s system will, of course, not be so effective that it will be possible to join up with the rest of the world. That is something we are taking into account as well.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the hon. member put questions to me on antennas and cable systems. In the course of the debate on the Vote of my colleague the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs, mention was made of the problem of common antennas so that antenna jungles such as those found in many countries abroad, would not result. I may tell the House that one of the advantages of the late introduction of our television system, is that we need not build up such an artificial jungle. These reports are available and will receive attention in due course.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member spoke about manpower and training. His hon. colleague for Florida actually contradicted him to a certain extent, so much so, in fact, that I had to ask the hon. member for Florida whether he was pleading against the introduction of television. The two of them will simply have to settle the matter between them. Regarding the training of staff, the manpower needs, I want to say that this Technical Advisory Committee and its sub-committee, in conjunction with the Department of Labour, has done very important work. Major, important calculations were made, calculations taking various starting-points into account, for no committee can determine an exact figure of precisely what is required. They adopted various standpoints and made projections on that basis. As far as my own department is concerned, I want to remind hon. members that I spoke about this matter <span class="col_8227-8228" refersTo="page_1068"/>on the occasion of the graduation ceremony at the College for Advanced Technical Education in Johannesburg last Wednesday. I pointed out that one needed technicians; people who had matriculated or obtained an equivalent certificate or had completed a course of intensive training of at least three years. A technician is not simply a person who can tamper with apparatus or perform conjuring tricks on a motor-car and so get the apparatus or car to go again. A technician, as we understand it, is a thoroughly trained person. Next year the colleges for technical education throughout our country&#x2014;and there are six of them &#x2014;will start a course concentrating <i>inter alia</i> on training for our television service. Moreover, at training colleges throughout the country, training will be provided in accordance with syllabuses adapted and drawn up with a view to this for the other grades of trained staff, i.e. people who have to instal sets, maintain them and have to do rerepairs. These are people who require a training period of one year or, in any case, of less than three years! I think the hon. member may rest assured that that aspect is in good hands.</p>

<p>Then he asked me what investigations had not yet been completed. The investigation that has not yet been completed, is the influence television will have on the Press. The hon. member has been trying to suggest that this is the reason why the Government does not want to introduce television sooner.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Is that so vitally important?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is very important. I shall now tell the hon. member how important it is. Perhaps he does not realize how important it is. This is also bound up very closely with the other aspect of the investigation of the Technical Advisory Committee which has not quite been completed, i.e. the implications of television on the economic and financial position of our country. I want to tell hon. members that thorough preparation has also been made. The Committee also adopted various standpoints and made its calculations accordingly. It will eventually be the task of the Cabinet to take a decision, with due regard to those various possibilities and needs, on how and when it will deem the time opportune for proceeding with this matter.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That brings me to the next point&#x2014;which is actually the &#x201C;sixty million dollar question&#x201D;&#x2014;i.e. to what the hon. member wants to know. He wants to know when television is coming on the air. That is actually what he wants to know. I may just remind him of my announcement on 27th April of this year, when I said the Cabinet had found, in view of certain factors explained by me, that it would not be possible to commence transmission within four years of that date, i.e. by 1975 at the earliest. But I want to emphasize, as I also did a moment ago, that this is a matter on which the Cabinet, and the Cabinet alone, will decide; i.e. whether we are going on the air and when we are going on the air.</p>

<p>Yes, at a specific stage, I mean. It has already been decided in principle that we are going on the air, but when we shall do so, is a matter on which the Cabinet will decide.</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. the Minister a question? Is he going to inform commerce and industry and other interested organizations in good time as to what that date is going to be, as it is going to take at least years to introduce it?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I agree with the hon. member that it is necessary, even for the S.A.B.C., to know in good time what the date is. But, of course, what he understands by &#x201C;in good time&#x201D;, and what the Government understands by it, may differ. However, I think we are agreed on the principle that it is desirable for this decision to be announced well in time.</p>

<p>Then, as far as this television aspect is concerned, only two matters are left according to my notes. The hon. member spoke about the local content of sets. His colleague the hon. member for Florida also referred to the manufacture of image tubes and to screen sizes. I want to tell the hon. member that this is actually a matter he should have raised on the Vote of my colleague the Minister of Economic Affairs. This matter falls under the Industrial Committee.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<p>No, it is a matter which was specifically referred to the Minister of Economic Affairs. In the announcement it was stated explicitly that the Government was desirous of seeing in the beginnings of the television industry also the beginnings of an electronics industry. Whereas the hon. member has apparently missed the opportunity of putting this question to my colleague the Minister of Economic Affairs, I may tell him &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<p>I have his speech here as it appeared in Hansard.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; that thorough preparations have been made and that that committee has also made a great deal of progress and done important research work. I do not want to take this matter any further than that. I want to tell the hon. member for Florida that the S.A.B.C. is obviously not going to manufacture the sets and the tubes. As far as sets are concerned, i.e. the exterior or the Cabinet itself&#x2014;of course, this has nothing to do with the actual inner works of the set; one can get a large variety of cabinets with the same inner works, to put it in simple language. One should therefore not think that an excessive number of sets will become available.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to ask the hon. the Minister a question. Does the Minister envisage these tubes being manufactured in South Africa, or are they going to be imported?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>This matter does not fall under me either, but since I am a member of the Cabinet, I may say that if it is one&#x2019;s endeavour to establish an electronics industry here, one cannot build it up on the manufacture of those components which are least expensive. One must also have a money-maker amongst those components that are manufactured domestically. Therefore this committee is also investigating that possibility. This would be very desirable, but that committee must find whether we can in fact do it.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Now I want to proceed to the Education aspect of my Vote. The hon. member for Durban Central quite rightly pointed out that differentiated education could only succeed if one provided the right guidance and had enough psychologists and the right teachers providing guidance to make this possible. I do not want to say that this is the only basis for success, but it is a very important contributory factor. I want to agree with him on that score. The hon. member for Kimberley South also referred to this matter when he spoke about the important work done by the HSRC, the work it does through its Institute for Psychometric Research. In studying that report of the HSRC, the hon. member will see that several pages have been devoted to the work done by the Institute for Psychometric Research. This institute concerns itself mainly with standardizing existing tests and drawing up new ones, not only for Whites, but also for the other population units we have in this country. Therefore I want to tell the hon. member that, coupled with the research and the training taking place and the boost which teachers trained in psychology will now receive, I have high hopes that we shall be able to meet all the needs in due course. It stands to reason that one cannot meet all the needs at once. But if one has to wait until the day when one can meet all of them, one will, of course, never start. The hon. member also referred to the junior secondary phase in the differentiated education set-up. He pointed out the fact that we were grouping Std. V with Std. VI and Std. VII in this phase, but that physically Std. V was attached to the primary school. Of course, the whole system is a renovation; it is a whole revolution. One cannot draw a line through the past and start on a new page; one has to adapt the system, and for that reason I said the following in the announcement I made on the radio&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_8231-8232" refersTo="page_1070"/>I wish to make it clear that I am not implying that Std. V students must of necessity be transferred to secondary schools.</block>

<p>Sir, what did I mean by that? I meant that it was not the object of the Education Departments to take away the Std. V classes from the schools where they are at the moment. This would obviously give rise to revolt throughout the country. But where one starts with new planning in urban areas, one will obviously take that into consideration. This is what I actually meant by that announcement.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to a case of the adjustment of examination marks obtained in the English question paper of the Department of National Education. Sir, this is of course not a new concept amongst educationists. I do not know whether it is necessary to go into the reasons. As an ex-teacher the hon. member will know that the object in adjusting marks is to maintain and normalize the standards, and that this is actually effected through co-operation between the examiners and the moderators and is done on the basis of a curve representing the distribution of marks. If he does not understand this clearly, I am sure that the hon. member for Hillbrow will be able to give him the information, for we are now dealing with his subject. As far as this particular case is concerned, I assume that what happened was in keeping with the general practice followed in the Education Department.</p>

<p>The hon. member also mentioned here a specific case, at which I want to express my regret. He asked me about an irregularity which occurred in an examination in Durban. I want to tell the hon. member that my department is the biggest examination department in the whole country. I am not referring to the provincial departments now. There are several hundreds of thousands of subject entries in my department, and I would not find it astonishing if an occasional error crept in. The hon. member made inquiries about that case, and I informed him that a serious case was involved. What was involved here, was a case of irregularity, which, according to law, I referred to the Police for investigation. The hon. member had all that information, thanks to the fact that I trusted him and informed him of these facts in confidence. The Police reported back after a long time, for it is not easy to investigate such a matter; they reported back that they could not find evidence for laying a charge against the guilty parties, but that it was unquestionably true that an irregularity had occurred. What did we do? We gave the 13 candidates involved in the matter the benefit of the doubt, and today those 13 candidates are probably walking about with certificates in that subject, for which they may have obtained higher marks than they would have had if that irregularity had not crept in. But I want to ask the hon. member: Is it cricket to discuss across the floor of this House a matter such as that one, which has a very serious implication, after I had taken him into my confidence?</p>

<p>Would the hon. the Minister reply to the point I made? It was the long delay I criticized.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I have already replied to that. I told the hon. member that the Act laid down certain procedures to be followed by me in the event of irrgularities occurring. In this case the instruction is that I must report it to the Police. I cannot tell the Police that I have a case of irregularity here; I want a report from you tomorrow or the day after that or next month. It is obvious that these people, who have many duties, require time for investigating such metters, and that is the reason for the delay.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I am indebted to the hon. member for Gardens for his positive approach to the care of the retarded and handicapped child. In this context I could also mention the hon. members for Durban Central and Jeppes and Carletonville. They all raised the same matter. The hon. member for Gardens referred specifically to the report on early childhood autism. I fully agree with him that it is indeed a very important report, the investigation having been headed by one of the senior officials in my department, an official whom I have now lost to the University of South Africa. But all the same, it is a very important report and I very much appreciate the positive way in which the hon. member for Gardens approached this matter. This report has been tabled in Parliament, as you know, and it has been referred to the universities and also to the provinces. That is the usual procedure. I have to refer this type of report to the provinces. In due course they will let me have their views and then we will determine how to set about implementing <span class="col_8233-8234" refersTo="page_1071"/>this report. The hon. member will be happy to know that I have accepted the recommendations of this report, and that I am only waiting for the provinces to comment on the report. I already have three replies and I am waiting for the fourth, and then we will start. But the hon. member will also appreciate that in the present financial circumstances it will be exceedingly difficult to implement this report immediately. I shall in due course also refer to some of the other reports and explain what we have achieved in the meantime. I start with the speech made by the hon. member for Jeppes, who referred to the report on minimal brain dysfunction. The hon. member will know that as far as this type of handicap is concerned, we have identified three categories. Let me say that in this field we have made very important progress. Due to research work done, especially in the medical, psychological and psychometrical fields, we are able these days to identify and to diagnose various forms of handicaps much sooner than was the case in former years. I am very happy to say that although I did not know much about this sector of my department&#x2019;s work when I took over, this has become one of the very interesting aspects of my work. I am glad to say, and I think we can all be proud of the fact, that the achievements we have attained in South Africa in the field of special education are second to none.</p>

<p>*The hon. members for Durban Central and Carletonville spoke about the mentally handicapped, but first, with reference to what was said by the hon. member for Jeppes about minimal brain dysfunction. I just want to point out that we have identified three categories as far as this type of handicap is concerned. After talks with the provinces we decided that two of those categories should become the responsibility of the provinces. They will make provision for those children, and only the most severe form of handicap will be my department&#x2019;s responsibility. The factor of the training of people is bound up with this. It is no use starting a class for handicapped children if one does not have a teacher who has a knowledge of that subject, for all of this is specialized work. For instance, we referred a report such as the one on children with minimal brain dysfunction to the universities and asked them to start immediately with the training of teachers who will be able to give special attention to this handicap. Good progress has been made in this direction, and once the provinces get into their stride&#x2014;the preparatory work has already been done&#x2014;I think it will be possible for them to identify what children are candidates for further attention by my department. Without entering into too many details, I think I may tell the hon. member that this matter is taking a very satisfactory course. I have high hopes that in due course we shall also be able to make provision for these children, on a satisfactory basis. I want to say, since the hon. member referred to it, that I am also familiar with the case to which he referred. I know the family and I know what their problem is. I may tell you this: Any parent who has a handicapped child, has a very heavy responsibility and burden to bear, such as few other parents have. On our part we shall do everything possible to help them to bear that burden.</p>

<p>That brings me to the point mentioned by the hon. members for Durban Central and Carletonville, and this concerns the care of mentally handicapped children. Actually, it was more specifically concerned with the training of these mentally handicapped children. You know the position at the moment, Sir, namely that the mentally handicapped children are the responsibility of the Department of Health. In so far as they are not living in their own homes, they are cared for in institutions by the Department of Health. We had the Van Wyk Committee of Inquiry, which determined that there were educable mentally handicapped children amongst them and that those children had to become the responsibility of my department. It was decided, furthermore, that as from the age of 18 years those children who were trained &#x2014;now, in using the word &#x201C;trained&#x201D;, I mean that they can perform the most simple routine tasks; they can acquire good habits, dress themselves, eat by themselves, etc.&#x2014; could become the responsibility of the Department of Social Welfare, by which they could either be placed in sheltered employment, or where other provision could be made for them. My department has, in accordance with the Cabinet decision, already done that preparatory work. We have prepared a detailed draft Bill for making the take-over of those children possible, for what is actually involved here, is a few&#x2014;20 odd&#x2014;day centres which have been established all over the country. These are day centres to which these children are brought by the parents or by a <span class="col_8235-8236" refersTo="page_1072"/>small bus. They attend school and in the evenings they return to their homes again.</p>

<p>There are a number of these institutions where members of the public were so generous that they made it possible for hostels to be built and for these children to live in them. In needy cases the Department of Health contributes R35 per month per child living in such a hostel. After we had done all this preparatory work, the Government was confronted with the financial and economic position in which we find ourselves at present, and the Government was of the opinion that it would not be able to provide in the Estimates this year the approximately R1 million which would be required just for the running expenses of these few centres which are already in existence. That is why the introduction of that legislation has been delayed. It is lying in my office, and the moment financial circumstances permit, it will be introduced and those children will become the responsibility of my department. This will then be effected on the basis on which we take over the other schools. In other words, we shall bear the responsibility for buildings, the staff, equipment, etc. This, then, is the reply to the question put by the hon. member for Carletonville.</p>

<p>I do not wish to waste the time of the House unnecessary and shall only use five minutes of its time in this regard. If the Press really wanted to do something good, they would do a great and important deed if, arising from this discussion, even if this were all they did arising from this discussion, they would only make an appeal to our public not to leave in the lurch these organizations which care for our handicapped children, and more specifically for these mentally handicapped children, simply because they, the public, are under the impression that the State has taken over the care of these children. This also applies to the School for Autistic Children and the school for children with minimal brain dysfunction. There we have truly meritorious undertakings which came into being as a result of the love of the public and which are maintained with great difficulty. If the Press would only make an appeal to members of our public not to withdraw their assistance from those institutions! For it is as yet not the time to do so&#x2014;the State have not taken them over yet. It cannot take them over at this stage already. In this manner the Press can make a very great and important contribution. I should also like to express my sincere appreciation to these institutions for the work done there, for this work is truly of an astonishingly high standard.</p>

<p>I have now devoted a great deal of time to special education. Bound up with this is the whole matter which my colleague the hon. member for Kimberley South mentioned, namely psychometric research, which is extremely important. Without that we cannot do this work. I agree with him wholeheartedly, and he may rest assured that if it is at all possible the Cabinet will increase the amount of money voted to the Human Sciences Research Council, apart from the self-evident annual increase.</p>

<p>Now I come to my hon. friend for Hercules, who spoke about our method of counting. He wanted to know whether we could not change over to a more logical method of counting. I am aware of this trend which exists in our country, I want to tell the hon. member that, judged on paper, the system advocated by him is not without logic. It contains a great deal of logic. But in saying that it is logical, I do not know whether the change is psychological. You know, Sir, language is a strange thing. Language also has a strong emotional bias. It is true that Afrikaans, Dutch and German have this method of counting. To change it, to bring this home to our people, is not so easy. I want to tell the hon. member that the Suid-Afrikaanse Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns, having given careful consideration to this matter, has taken a stand against it because they regard it as too drastic a change. You know, we are in the process of metricating. Some of our people are still referring to pounds, shillings and pennies today. At the moment we are metricating weight, or rather mass, and all of us are still struggling with it. I think if we were now to change our method of counting as well, some of our older people would have a very hard time. Perhaps we should simply leave this to the future.</p>

<p>He also spoke about the pronunciation of the word &#x201C;rand&#x201D; in English, i.e. whether the Afrikaans or the Anglicised pronunciation of the word was to be followed. I think the hon. member may consult our good old friend, Mr. Flippie Moore, who actually introduced that motion in this House and who obtained permission from his caucus to vote with the Government when we introduced metrication, and call upon him to bear witness to the fact that <span class="col_8237-8238" refersTo="page_1073"/>he said the Afrikaans pronunciation of &#x201C;rand&#x201D; should be followed for this monetary unit. I can but hope that our English-speaking people in the country will follow Uncle Flippie&#x2019;s good example. I do not know whether one can do more about it than that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Springs spoke&#x2014; later in the debate he also gained indirect support from the hon. member for Kimberley South&#x2014;about the standard six pupils who dropped out and thus did not get to matric. He claimed that more pupils dropped out on the Rand than was the case in the rest of the Transvaal. This is a very interesting topic, but I want to tell hon. members that the figures I have here &#x2014;I do not want to quote any more figures now, because I notice that I have already been speaking for an hour&#x2014;show that more pupils are in fact dropping out on the Rand than is the case in the rest of the Transvaal. One would actually expect this if one considers that a far larger number of jobs are offerred on the Rand than is the case in the rest of the Transvaal. However, this position is improving consistently. I believe that when we start with our system of differentiated education, with all the aids we have now and with the termination of our divided control on the secondary level, and once we get properly into our stride with this system, this position will progressively improve to an even greater extent. I hope the hon. member will forgive me for dealing with the matter so cursorily, but time does not permit me to deal with the matter in detail now.</p>

<p>He also pleaded for more language laboratories at our technical colleges, where immigrants could learn our languages. I want to tell him that this is a very important aid. I have in my personal possession letters from people who came to our country from France and America in connection with, for instance, nuclear research, people who sojourned here for a few months and who subsequently wrote letters to me in Afrikaans, the standard of which would astonish many of us. This aid is undoubtedly a successful one, but it costs a great deal of money and we cannot allow it not to be fully utilized. But as the means permit, we shall extend those facilities.</p>

<p>The hon. member also brought up a point of which we have probably not heard the end for a long time. He referred to the language medium of immigrant children. I want to tell the hon. member that my department, with the assistance of the Human Sciences Research Council, has caused a very thorough and comprehensive investigation to be made into immigrant pupils. In other words, the education departments know exactly where these people are, what their problems and needs are and how we should try to make provision for them. As a general statement of policy I want to say that it is the policy of my department that all immigrant children who come here should become bilingual as soon and as effectively as possible, and that we should help them to become so. But in saying that, I want to make the plea to hon. colleagues that we should not revert to spreading those indoctrination stories tomorrow or the next day. We shall do this on lines which can be justified educationally. At the moment the Committee of Educational Heads is in fact dealing with this extremely important matter. I think that at this stage I should not say any more about it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Boksburg pleaded for a faculty of engineering at the Rand Afrikaans University. The hon. member for Potchefstroom sent me a note saying I should remember him too. I know that the hon. member for Algoa also nodded at me all the way from over there. I know that there are universities that are keen to obtain such a faculty. In the Senate I dealt with this matter at length, and I just want to remind hon. members of the various scientific inquiries we had over the past number of years into this matter of the training of engineers. We had the Straszacker inquiry and reports. Then we also had the A. W. Schumann Report, as well as the recent report of the Human Sciences Research Council. The figures we obtained from these reports indicate that it is to be doubted whether a new faculty of engineering is an absolute necessity at this stage. In this regard I want to mention a few figures. According to the report of the Human Sciences Research Council it was found that our universities would have to train an average of 540 engineers per annum between the years 1968 and 1980 if we want to meet the demand. At the end of last year our universities already produced 718 engineers, of whom 9 were non-White engineers. In other words, we have already passed the target set by all these inquiries. I want to conclude the discussion of this matter by saying that all the data is in the hands of my department and that a decision will have to be taken on this matter <span class="col_8239-8240" refersTo="page_1074"/>in the light of this data. I just want to mention that five faculties of engineering exist in our country at the moment, and that the capital programme of those five existing faculties for the next five years amounts to R16&#x00BD; million. One asks oneself whether it is advisable to start a new faculty when one considers what the needs of the existing faculties are before they have been properly rounded off. I do not even want to mention staff problems. However, as I have already said, we are fully informed about this matter and hon. members should leave the eventual decision to the Cabinet.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Umbilo raised the possibility of establishing a medical faculty for Whites at the University of Natal. During the course of this sesison he also asked a few questions in this regard. I would like to point out a few things to the hon. member. In the first instance I would like him to know that up till 1971 the capital expenditure for the medical schools, excluding the proposed transfer of the Witwatersrand medical school, amounted to over R17 million. The hon. member also referred to some extensions and expansions of existing faculties. This work will cost another R15 million. The hon. member will, therefore, realize that the financial implications are enormous. Apart from that the hon. member also referred to the statistics and I would plead with him not to be misled by them. It is a fact that if you total all the students who applied for admission to these faculties, and you take into account how many of them were admitted at the various faculties, there is a large discrepancy indeed. The fact of the matter is that medical students apply for admission to all or to several of these medical faculties. I can give the hon. member figures to prove this statement. At a very well-known medical faculty last year 221 applicants were approved of. The university provided for 221, but only 146 actually turned up, which goes to prove that they must have gone somewhere else. They went to their first or second choice rather than to the one where they were permitted to enter. As far as the demand for doctors is concerned, I would also like to give the hon. member statistics. In South Africa we have one medical doctor for every 400 Whites, which we consider to be more than we really require. The position is satisfactory. For every 900 Indians in South Africa, we have one Indian doctor, which is comparable to the ratio in overseas Western countries. As against that, for every 6 200 Coloureds we have only one Coloured doctor and for every 44 400 Bantu we have only one Bantu doctor. The hon. member will now see where the emphasis really falls. I am sure he will appreciate that the Cabinet, in the circumstances, took the decision that until the extensions at the existing faculties have been completed, no consideration can be given to the establishment of a new faculty for Whites.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask the hon. the Minister a question? Is it still the intention of the Government to complete these additional facilities during the course of the next five years as was indicated last year?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I cannot give the assurance that it will be completed during the next five years, these things take a long time. First you start by increasing the intake facilities and then, of course, it takes six years to produce the ultimate result. I am afraid I am not so well acquainted with the particulars of the development at each of these faculties so as to be able to give a reply across the floor of the House.</p>

<p>*The hon. member also referred to our industrial schools and our reformatories and to the increase in the number of juvenile offenders. This, of course, relates to a very serious matter. A moment ago I spoke about one of the pleasant sub-parts of my department&#x2019;s work, but now I want to be honest and without being dramatic about this I want to say that the most unpleasant part of my work to me is the fact that sometimes, too often, cases come before me when I have to give my signature for the removal of a youth from a reformatory to a prison. This still bothers me every time I have to do so. Therefore I agree with the hon. member that we should do everything within our power to prevent this. Regular investigations are in fact conducted in co-operation with the people who run these institutions. However, this problem is bound up with the permissive spirit that is developing. That is why, in the first part of my reply, I quarrelled as I did with the hon. the Opposition and said we should come forward positively for our young people and that we should take up a positive stand against any form of erosion <span class="col_8241-8242" refersTo="page_1075"/>of our standards and against permissiveness in whatever form it may manifest itself. I think I should tell the hon. member that with the work done by the Human Sciences Research Council, with the experience we have gained in our department and in these institutions, we are doing everything we possibly can. I want to tell the hon. member that the figures of this country do not compare badly with those of comparable countries abroad.</p>

<p>One other matter still remains, a matter raised by the hon. member for Carletonville, i.e. the importance of the teacher. I referred to that before. I said that in my opinion our educationists, in whatever branch of education they are engaged, were not always rated at their true value by our parents. That is not always true. I am generalizing. One of the problems is the undermining of the authority of the teacher and of the principal in his school and in his classroom. I still grew up in an era in which the word of the school was law. I would never have had the courage to go home and tell my father that the principal did me an injustice in some way or that the teacher did not quite play the game in this or that case, because then I would probably have been punished by my father as well. This may sound oldfashioned, this may be out-dated, and perhaps it will not be found in modern psychology, but I stand by the fact that our parents should form a solid front for the protection of the school and our body of teachers.</p>

<p>With these answers I think I have replied to all the questions. Once again I thank everyone who participated in this debate. As I said before, I think this was a positive debate in the main, and I personally feel happy that we could have devoted these hours to it.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I request the privilege of the half-hour. This Vote, Planning, covers a very wide field, and from the nature of the case I shall be able to refer only to certain aspects of it, but my hon. colleagues will discuss certain matters further with the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>I want to say at once that we accept the necessity of long-term planning and that we support the concept completely in principle. In saying this, I also want to say at once that our argument is, and indeed our theme will be, that this department is not able to make an optimal contribution, for two reasons in particular. In the first place, so many administrative matters are entrusted to it that they overshadow its true functions. In the second place, the department must act within the framework of an ideological programme as formulated by the Government, an ideology which as such is still changed and manipulated by the Government from time to time.</p>

<p>Just in order to give an indication of what I have in mind as far as these administrative matters are concerned, I want to say that we notice from the department&#x2019;s report for last year that more than 1 000 permits, proclamations and appeals had to be handled in one year. Everything comes under this heading of areas demarcation. That, of course, involved tremendous amount of work. We also notice from the annual report that in one year there were more than 600 applications for zoning and the subdivision of land in terms of section 2 of the Planning Act. In terms of section 3 of that particular Act, there were also more than 3 000 applications for the employment of Bantu during this period which had to be examined and handled by the department. Our argument is that this demands a tremendous amount of energy and that it is detrimental to the actual planning activities of this department. Let me put the matter like this: Recently we had a problem. It was a particularly important economic problem for us in South Africa. It concerned the two projects, the Saldanha project and the St. Croix project. I do not want to go into the merits of these two cases, but there was dissension on the merit of these two projects. The Saldanha project undoubtedly is the one which has long-term advantages for South Africa, but it requires a tremendous capital investment which we probably cannot afford at the present time. On the other hand, the St. Croix project has immediate economic advantages for South Africa, although we accept that in the long-term it would be inadequate. There was a difference of opinion of this. There was dissension which was reflected even in the Cabinet. There is a possibility, of course, of integrating the one with the <span class="col_8243-8244" refersTo="page_1076"/>other, of phasing the one into the other.I should like to know from the hon. theMinister to what extent the Department ofPlanning was involved in this matter. I amnot referring merely to any personalopinions which the hon. the Minister mayhave expressed in the Cabinet. We wantto know to what extent the Department ofPlanning was requested to carry out a feas-ibility study. To what extent did the de-partment make a motivated analysis pro-ject of these two different projects in orderto see in what way they could be inte-grated with the broad economic require-ments of South Africa? If this was in factdone, we should like to ask whether theserecommendations and this study could betabled, and indeed what the recommenda-tions of the department were. If the de-partment was not involved in this matter inthat way, then we should like to ask whyit was not done. We gain the impressionthat although this department does out-standing work of a technical nature, itsrole is often one which is fragmentary be-cause it is not given that general, thatbird&#x2019;s-eye view role in the macro-economicplanning of South Africa. We should liketo hear from the hon. the Minister howhe intends rectifying this matter, becausewe accept that he has a plan. We do notknow whether, as he said prior to theOudtshoorn election, he still have to makea plan. If he still has to make one, hemust do so quickly.</p>

<p>In order to illustrate how this depart-ment&#x2019;s planning is taking place within aneconomic straitjacket, I should like to referto the economic development programmewhich is drawn up by this department. Thisdepartment recommended that we shouldaccept a 5,5 per cent growth rate in ourgross domestic product as a target rate.Once again I do not want to go intothe merits of whether a growth rate of 5,5per cent is too high or too low, but let usfor the moment accept it as a target. Whathappened in the past year, was that wedid not come near this target. There isevery indication now that in the past yearour gross domestic product grew by only3,7 per cent in real terms. In comparingthis to the population increase of 2,7 percent, we see that the real growth in <i>percapita</i> terms, the increase in our standardof living last year, was only 1 per cent.This, of course, is not an achievement ofwhich we can in any way be proud. In1970, Japan grew 12 times more rapidlythan this. Indeed, if we take the last 10 years, because this period was the period in which our economy flourished, the so-called boom period of which the Government tells us so much, we see that as far as economic growth was concerned, we caught up with only one country in the world, and that was Venezuela in South America. To what is this poor achievement due? Why do we grow so slowly and why do we compare so badly with the target rate set by the department? In the first place, because Government expenditure is much too high. It exceeds the estimate in the economic programme by far. In the second place, because fixed deposits in the private sector and especially in the manufacturing sector have been much lower than proposed by the department. In the third place, because productivity has not come near the sort of level set by the department. In the fourth place&#x2014;and this is the main cause of everything&#x2014;because there has been too much interference in the economic process by the State. I do not want to work through all these details once again, but let us take a quick look at them. As far as State expenditure is concerned, the figures show us that over the last decade, State expenditure has increased by 8 per cent per annum. This is 20 per cent more than the increase in our national product. At present capital expenditure by the State is 12 per cent of our gross domestic product. This is twice as much as in Canada and four times as much as in the United States of America.</p>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>I am mentioning international norms to the hon. member. Why is he becoming so sensitive about them?</p>

<p>In the second place I said that fixed investment, especially in the private sector and in manufacturing industry, was far too low. I do not want to quote all these figures again, but in its 1970 report the department itself said that fixed investment in the manufacturing sector would have to be increased by at least 20 per cent&#x2014; this means approximately R150 million per year&#x2014;in order to come near the target set by the department itself.</p>

<p>The third reason why we cannot reach the target set for us by our economic planners, is that there has been such a slight increase in production. This entire economic programme is based on the supposition <span class="col_8245-8246" refersTo="page_1077"/>that productivity would increase by 2,7 per cent annually. Of course, we do not come anywhere near that figure. Indeed, I see that Mr. Jan de Necker, the president of the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut, said the following recently (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In order to establish a stable economy and to counteract inflation, the maximum increase in productivity is essential. Indications are that South Africa is fighting a losing battle on this front.</block>

<p>This hon. member is always so sensitive when we refer to other countries. Allow me just to tell him that at the moment productivity in Japan and Germany has increased by 10 per cent. In the manufacturing sector in South Africa the output per man hour is decreasing. Last year, even under circumstances of a high rate of inflation, productivity increased by 4,5 per cent in France and by 7 per cent in the Netherlands. We do not come anywhere near those figures. We have reached the situation in South Africa that at present the compensation of the employer has reached the unprecedented figure of 67 per cent of our national income. How can we achieve productivity under these circumstances? From 1920 to 1960, increases in productivity were responsible for 40 per cent of the improvement in our national income. During the post-war years&#x2014;and these are the years we see in relation to this particular Government&#x2014;that percentage decreased from 40 per cent to 23 per cent. Therefore, productivity is dropping lower and lower.</p>

<p>We want to ask the hon. the Minister what he is going to do about it, because he is the man who draws up these programmes. He gives us the target rate and now we do not come anywhere near it. I think he owes this House an explanation and he must tell us what action he is going to take now. Why is the increase in productivity so much lower now? There are, of course, a large number of reasons for that. In the first place, there is the lack of training for our workers. One can write volumes about this, but I do not want to take it any further now.</p>

<p>Productivity, as far as the human factor is concerned, is also brought about by a greater mobility of one&#x2019;s workers in both a vertical and horizontal sense. One&#x2019;s workers should be allowed to move up in the existing hierarchy of jobs. By means of its job reservation procedure, this Government is preventing this. It is placing an artificial damper on the professional development of our Bantu. The second important fact is that workers should be able to move in the horizontal sense. They should be able to move from the less productive sectors of our economy to the more productive ones. Once again the hon. the Minister is preventing this by means of his physical planning procedures. Under these circumstances, one shall not be able to obtain higher productivity either. On a previous occasion the hon. the Minister told us that he was bound by this measure. In 1970 he expressed himself as follows&#x2014; and I quote from column 5202 of Hansard&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is the policy of this Government to implement it &#x2026;</block>

<p>He even implicated the Prime Minister in that, because he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Week before last we once again said, through the mouth of the Prime Minister that we would stand by that policy.</block>

<p>That is, by his physical planning policy. We saw that it could not work and warned against it. In my own case I said that if the Government persisted with this, we would have to pay a big price for this policy. The price we shall have to pay for that, will be a lower national output. And this is what has happened, because surely anyone who has any insight can see that if all these restrictions are introduced, will lead one to greater capitalization. This is what has happened, hence the present pattern in our import and export balance. It will lead to higher and higher wages, and this is precisely what has happened. It will give rise to inflation, and at present inflation is higher than it has probably ever been before. In the last place, it will bring about a lower growth rate. Last year South Africa&#x2019;s growth rate was probably lower than in any year during the past ten years. Because the Government saw that this policy was a failure, they had to put up a smokescreen once again, and that is how we came to have the Riekert Commission. Dr. Riekert was then told to try to pull the chestnuts from the fire.</p>

<p>&#x2020;This Riekert Report was made available to Parliament just before we prorogued last year. Since then we have had <span class="col_8247-8248" refersTo="page_1078"/>an opportunity to examine it in detail. What is quite clear when you look at the White Paper which was issued as a result and as a consequence of the Riekert Report, is that the Government is in full retreat from the position it had previously occupied. In fact, the position we had previously taken up has been fully vindicated. What did this White Paper do to the Physical Planning Act? It diluted it to such an extent that only the skeleton remained. The Government has substituted the carrot for the stick, something that we had consistently advocated. Thirdly this White Paper makes provision for the massive training of non-Whites for industrial occupation. Every time we proposed this or suggested it, we were told that we wanted to open the sluice gates. This is precisely what the White Paper is trying to do. It shifts the industrial growth from the metropolitan areas to the so-called border areas. However, these border areas are still part of White South Africa. Are they not? Is Rosslyn not in White South Africa? Is Brits not part of White South Africa? Here arises the unusual situation that the Government is prepared to go to all sorts of lengths to stimulate the growth in these areas and to induce the absorption of greater numbers of Black people, even to the extent that they are threatening that they will suspend the industrial conciliation machinery in these border areas.</p>

<p>And in fact, if industrialists and trade unions do not co-operate, they threaten to come back to this Chamber to introduce additional legislation. That is the extent to which they are prepared to go in the border areas, Sir, But the question arises: If it is permissible to do all these things in the border areas, why cannot it be done in the rest of South Africa? If it can be done in Rosslyn, why can it not be done in Germiston? If it can be done in Brits, why can it not be done in Randfontein? We would like the hon. the Minister to give us an answer to this. Because by one stroke of the pen the Government&#x2019;s White Paper has completely invalidated the Physical Planning Act, and it is about time, too, that this were done. This legislation has been in existence for four years and over this four-year period they have dealt with over 8 000 applications for additional Bantu labour. If you look at the end result of it, according to the figures supplied to me recently by the hon. the Minister, you find that over this four-year period, all they have succeeded in doing is to retard the inflow of Blacks to our metropolitan areas to the extent of 13 000 workers a year&#x2014;surely a massive effort, and a very meagre result.</p>

<p>Additionally, Sir, this White Paper on the Riekert Commission introduced two other concepts. They said that certain racial ratios had to obtain in future. These were taken quite arbitrarily. Apparently it must be 2,5 to 1 at the moment, but by 1973 it must come down to 2 to 1. One does not know where they obtained this from, but it makes South Africa unique. We must be the only country in the world that has a programme of industrialization based on a norm of racial ratios. But, Sir, it also introduces a second concept, the concept of locality-bound industries. Apparently if you are locality-bound, then all these provisions disappear and then you can employ as many Bantu as you want to. But who is going to define what is &#x201C;locality-bound&#x201D;? Take a simple case such as that of a baker. It might be held that if you bake bread and sell bread, then you are locality-bound becaus you must be near your market. It might equally well be said that if you bake biscuits you are not locality-bound, because you can transport your produce. Anybody who knows anything about bakeries, knows that normally you cannot survive and normally you cannot make a profit unless you bake both bread and biscuits. What is going to happen to the baker now? Is he locality-bound, or is he not? No, Sir, the whole thing is a half-baked affair, and it was quite obvious to us that it was. That was why even last year, when this measure came before us the very first time, I myself said (Hansard, Col. 8508)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This sytem cannot work. We therefore envisage the Government coming back to us again in the near future to change even the Riekert proposals.</block>

<p>What happened this year? When the hon. the Minister of Finance came with his Budget, he threw the whole thing overboard; he changed the whole thing, because as far as labour is concerned, he said&#x2014;this was new policy for that side of the House&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Within our basic social structure &#x2026;</block>

<p>Sir, you will notice that there is no mention whatever of economics or politics; he has now reduced it all to a social structure&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_8249-8250" refersTo="page_1079"/>Within our basic social structure the Government&#x2019;s attitude towards labour problems remains flexible.</block>

<p>Sir, we would like the hon. the Minister to indicate to us precisely what that means, because &#x201C;flexible&#x201D; can be held to mean anything. This was seen immediately, by all academicians in this country as a complete elimination of the Riekert proposals. Indeed, Dr. Piet Neuwenhuizen expressed himself as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hierdie toegewing takel die Wet op Fisiese Replanning af omdat dit die verhouding van 2,5 tot 1 omvergooi.</block>

<p>Dr. Human of General Mining said precisely the same thing, but hon. members on that side of the House, who are accustomed to political acrobatics, put it somewhat differently; the hon. member for Paarl said that in future it will not be necessary to apply this provision with the vigour with which the Government has applied it in the past. But Mr. Kosie Pansegrouw, the hon. member for Smithfield, was quoted by <i>Rapport</i> as having said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die toepassing van di&#x00E9; Wet sal nou nie meer so strong wees nie, maar as die omstandighede verander, gaan die Wet weer streng toegepas word, seifs strenger as wat dit in die verlede toegepas is.</block>

<p>Sir, this introduces a new dimension into the whole problem. How can industrialists prepare and plan for the future when they have no guarantee that the provisions which the hon. the Minister of Finance has put before us will remain? Indeed, the whole substance of his argument is that he is holding a stick over their heads: &#x201C;We will reintroduce it and we will make it even more stringent than it was before&#x201D;. It is a deliberate threat to industry, and that sort of approach does not help anybody.</p>

<speech by="#chairman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">Chairman</person>,</from>

<p>I believe that we have now got to the stage where we have to review this whole situation; it is getting out of hand. The Government is changing its mind from day to day. They have built up a massive structure of organizational machinery; there is now a Cabinet Committee; there is a decentralization board and a growth points committee and a host of subcommittees. But, Sir, what are we achieving by this? We are paying an immense amount for this procedure, but what benefits accrue to South Africa? Let us look at the two aspects. First of all, let us look at the homelands. To what extent do the homelands benefit as a result of this border area concept of the Government? The Government&#x2019;s idea is that these areas must be made politically independent. If that is so, give me one reason then why they should not be made economically viable. Surely the Government wants to increase their industrial and economic carrying capacity. If we accept that as a legitimate objective. Sir, then I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether the homeland leaders have been consulted about this border area scheme and whether they approve of it, because certainly Chief Minister Kaiser Mtanzima is on record as having said that the border area scheme is not acceptable to the Transskei.</p>

<p>Where did he say that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>It was reported in the newspapers. Will the hon. the Minister give me proof that the others have been consulted and that they approve of it? Because if he does not even please the Bantu homelands and the Bantu homeland leaders, what do we achieve thereby? Is that one reason why the Transkei, this Government show-piece of its separate development scheme, has not got a single border area industry of any consequence?</p>

<p>Sir, there is a second thing to which I want to draw attention. Everybody, including Prof. Tomlinson, told us that South Africa constitutes one economic entity and that it is indivisible. If this is so, how can you achieve economic planning when the Bantu homelands are specifically excluded from this planning? How can you plan South Africa when major sectors of it are left completely beyond the field in which you plan? Sir, I want to go further. If the Government&#x2019;s intention with this scheme is to decentralize industry and to take it to the biggest concentrations of Black workers, why then is industry not sited inside the homelands? Then at least they would get some benefit from it, socially, economically and otherwise, because now you are perpetuating the migratory system; they must move over the border and work in White factories for White bosses who pay White taxes to the White Government. As far as the homelands are concerned, the benefits that they get from this scheme are entirely marginal. But what is happening to our <span class="col_8251-8252" refersTo="page_1080"/>bigger economy? We are paying an immense price for this system, Sir, It has been estimated that it costs from R5 500 to R6 000 for every additional job that you create in the border areas. Look at all the incentives that the Government has provided: Tax reimbursements, loans, rail subsidies and rebates. What does all this amount to, Sir? What is the bill that we are paying for it? South Africa wants to know.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>I only have five minutes left. Sir, we want to know from the Government what this scheme is costing South Africa. The hon. the Minister should have the answers because it was precisely for this purpose that the Reynders Commission was appointed. We have never seen that report. Will the hon. the Minister table it? Because, Sir, we are paying a massive price, quite apart from all the indirect costs&#x2014;the wastages, the delays and the frustrations which add up and which are reflected in our rising production costs pattern. We want to know from the hon. the Minister what this scheme is costing us. South Africa wants to decide whether in fact we are getting any worthwhile benefits from it. Our contention is that this Government now finds itself between two stools. With the border area scheme, it is not creating additional jobs in the Bantu homelands, and yet at the same time it is inhibiting economic growth in White South Africa. It is costing immense sums, and yet we are not achieving the kind of economic separation which the Government tells us is necessary for our survival. So we are in the worst of both worlds. Let me say right away that we on this side of the House endorse the principle of selective industrial dispersal, but we also say, as Dr. Rautenbach once said, that unless visible and tangible benefits flow from this scheme, it will not in the long term succeed. I do not think the Government has any idea of the magnitude of the problem they are up against. Some 90 000 Black people come into the labour market every year. On present indications the border areas can absorb at most 16 000 and possibly in two years time about 23 000. If we were to absorb only the Black people who graduate from high school, we will have to have an investment of R1 500 million in industrial development over the next ten years. This is the magnitude of the problem. The marginal cost of border areas will furthermore increase as a greater and greater proportion of industry is diverted. Let me say right away that we on this side of the House will not subvert the foundations of South African prosperity for the sake of dubious ideology. We on this side will not decentralize for ideological purposes only, but our objectives would be to maximize the utilization of all South Africa&#x2019;s resources so that we can achieve the greatest possible growth in our national income. It is on that that South Africa&#x2019;s future survival depends.</p>

<speech by="#pansegrouw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. S. PANSEGROUW</person>:</from>

<p>There are two reasons why I am not going to react to the hon. member&#x2019;s argument. The first is the lack of time and the second is because the hon. the Minister will reply fully to the hon. member in due course. Thirdly I want to say that since we have had to listen for half an hour to merely negative aspects with regard to this department, we want to try, in the 10 minutes at our disposal, to bring something more positive to the fore in only one small section, the control of this department.</p>

<p>At the very outset we want to give sincere thanks to the hon. the Minister and his department, and to the erstwhile president of the CSIR, for the invitation they extended to members of this House to pay a visit to the CSIR in Pretoria. I want to tell you, Sir, that it is very greatly appreciated. The visit we had the privilege of paying to that institution not only excited our admiration for what that institution is doing, but it also stimulated our curiosity, if I may use the word, to such an extent that we were compelled to make a closer examination of the activities of that institution. I want to begin by taking this opportunity to try to give a brief explanation of the activities of that institution. For example, we want to refer to the assignments for state and non-state bodies given to this institution, with the accompanying revenue for that body. From this we can then obtain an idea of what this organization means to us and of what national importance it is to us. This afternoon we also want to underline, in particular, the international assignments that go out to the CSIR with the accompanying of foreign exchange earned by the CSIR. What struck us initially were the assignments from state departments and provincial administrations in the first place. There is not a single provincial administration, South-West Africa included, which has not given important assignments <span class="col_8253-8254" refersTo="page_1081"/>to this department recently. The provincial departments of the Transvaal, Natal, the Orange Free State, the Cape Province and South-West Africa all gave assignments to this department to do research in respect of the erection of hospitals, the design of school buildings, etc. All these provincial departments, with a few exceptions, gave assignments to the CSIR for investigations and for advisory services in respect of water and the effluent problem. I am not going to tell you at this stage what the CSIR&#x2019;s earnings were from each of these assignments, but eventually we shall show you comprehensively what the sum total of all the assignments amounted to. We refer also to the Department of Health. We had one motion last year and two motions this year in respect of pollution. The CSIR is still dealing with the matter, but it has already earned more than R20 000 from the Department of Health this year, solely in connection with the investigations relating to air pollution. As far as I am concerned another very interesting assignment, which I want to mention to show you how extensive the activities of the CSIR are, is that of the Department of Bantu Administration and Development for the improvements of the technology and the processes in the manufacturing of Bantu beer. I find this assignment interesting, but what I find even more interesting is the fact that it has gained an income of more than R300 000 for the CSIR. For the same department assignments have been carried out in the homelands to the tune of more than R100 000. For the Department of Public Works, for example, in respect of improvements in the building industry, a gigantic amount has been earned. Then there are the bodies outside the Government departments, control boards and semi-state bodies. What also impressed us on that visit by members of this House who represent agricultural regions, is that we were witnesses to what the CSIR is doing in this connection, and therefore we made more comprehensive inquiries. We can only say that the CSIR did research for the S.A. Wool Board to promote the use of wool in the textile industry, and an amount of no less than R202 000 was spent on that. For the mohair industry the CSIR did research, and more than R20 000 was spent on that. The Mealie Control Board and the Kaffir Corn Control Board harnassed the CSIR, which made tremendous progress with respect to these industries, and there was the accompanying revenue. Road safety is one of the most important matters we are dealing with today. On the instructions of the National Transport Commission the CSIR did research for better and more economical methods of design, construction and maintenance of roads, including the safety aspects. In respect of this matter it deserves to be mentioned that here we had earnings of more than R800 000. I could continue in similar vein, but there is insufficient time.</p>

<p>Therefore I want to skip what is being done in South Africa, and just refer to what the CSIR has done for us outside South Africa, and to their contribution in the gathering of foreign exchange. The CSIR received an assignment from Nasa in the United States of America to do research in connection with the tracking of satellites. The realization of this target by the CSIR brought us an amount of more than R2 100 000. In passing, before I forget, I just want to say that Government departments, semi-Government departments and control boards furnished the CSIR with an income of more than R3 million. These assignments to the CSIR from the U.S.A., from the British Council of Research, from the Rhodesian Government, from the Government of Malawi and from several firms in the U.S.A., meant an additional income of almost R2&#x00BD; million as far as we are concerned. This is a grand total of about R5 800 000 that this body furnished us with. While the hon. member, who has just resumed his seat, could only criticize, it is a pleasure for us to have the opportunity this afternoon to point to the contributions the CSIR is making to South Africa, and this is made possible as the result of the aid and assistance that is being obtained from the relevant Minister and his department.

<p>Mr. Chairman, there is a widespread illusion in Nationalist circles that our economic problems are temporary and that the wealth of this country will endure and ensure that the Government&#x2019;s uneconomic policies can be justified. Nothing is further from the truth. I want to reinforce the sentiments expressed by the hon. member for Hillbrow that in South Africa we must gauge the economic wellbeing of our people and base our planning not on the gross domestic product as such, the total domestic product, but on the <i>per capita</i> growth. In the ten years up to 1968, while the gross domestic product was 5,3 per cent per annum, the <i>per capita</i> growth was <span class="col_8255-8256" refersTo="page_1082"/>only 2,4 per cent. In 1968&#x2013;&#x2019;69 the <i>per capita</i> growth fell to 2,6 per cent, in 1970 to 2 per cent and in 1971 to 1,1 per cent. These are the chickens of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s economic planning coming home to roost.</p>

<p>I want to deal, in the brief time available to me, with some aspects of the Economic Development Programme for the period 1970 to 1975, as produced by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department. The current Programme, in contradistinction to the previous programme, deals only with the concept of a 5,5 per cent growth in the gross domestic product and not with three varying percentages, such as were used previously. But I should like to quote the preface of the latest economic development programme, written by Dr. Riekert. He makes this amazing statement and admission&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No estimate has been made in the calculation of this programme of non-White labour because the complete findings of the 1970 population census were not yet available at the time. As a result it was not possible to determine to what extent a 5,5 per cent growth rate complied with one of the main objectives of this EDP, namely the reduction and eventual elimination of unemployment amongst our non-Whites.</block>

<p>This frank statement by Dr. Riekert epitomizes more than anything else the false premises on which this Government and this hon. Minister are prepared to base their planning for the future economic progress of our country. We on this side of the House have stressed again and again that we regard South Africa as a country with a population of some 21 million people and not some three million people, and it is for the total population that we would like to see a programme produced. In their planning the Government appear to ignore the vast labour potential which is available to South Africa. I believe it was in the 1970 No-confidence Debate that my hon. leader appealed to the hon. the Prime Minister to allow his Economic Planning Committee to produce a plan based not on the Government&#x2019;s present shackled ideological labour concepts, but on the total availability of the total labour and capital resources in South Africa. To this challenge the hon. the Prime Minister has never replied. Now I want to ask how the hon. the Minister of Planning can operate effectively in his department while he and the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration ignore the Bantu in their calculations.</p>

<p>Then I want to deal briefly with the White Paper following upon the Riekert committee on the decentralization of industries. The Government has had forced on it the realization that neither their job reservation legislation nor their Physical Planning Act have achieved the desired results. Dr. Riekert has now been called upon to produce a White Paper to unscramble and clarify the first contentions of this inter-departmental committee. You see, Sir, none of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s planning legislation has proved practicable in its original form. So the committee on the decentralization of industries was appointed for the purpose of clarifying this muddle which resulted from the introduction of the original Act, something which, I may say, was pointed out to the Government time and again by this side of the House and also by commerce and industry. In the short time available to me, I want to appraise critically this White Paper on the Riekert committee&#x2019;s report. The paper itself is perhaps the most important policy document of the present Government in the economic field, since it outlines this Government&#x2019;s policy with regard to decentralization and labour. Further, it lays down, or endeavours to lay down, the broad guidelines for the implementation of the Government&#x2019;s decentralization policy. The White Paper recognizes a very important point, namely that it is a fact of South African society that there are large numbers of unemployed persons, mainly Black, in areas far removed from the present centres of industrial development. This refutes absolutely and repudiates the view expressed on more than one occasion by the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, who consistently claims that there are almost no unemployed Bantu in South Africa. The White Paper recognizes, as has been stressed by Opposition speakers again and again, that as a result of the apparently unsuccessful progress of decentralization, the Physical Planning and Utilization of Resources Act has had many defects. These have been resented by commerce and industry. The White Paper recognized too that the further implementation of the Physical Planning Act has caused confusion and uncertainty in industry. And certainly, according to organized industry, it has had most adverse effects on investment. Furthermore, <span class="col_8257-8258" refersTo="page_1083"/>the falling rate of unemployment amongst Whites, Coloureds and Asians, has brought to a head the issue of a fuller utilization of the Bantu. It is clear from the White Paper that the hon. the Minister of Planning has had to introduce greater flexibility into Government thinking. The hon. the Minister has had to recognize too the private sector&#x2019;s repeated assertions that the implementation of the policy of decentralization as first applied has had adverse effects on the economy and that sound growth performances in the existing industrial areas are a prerequisite to the successful decentralization in the border areas or homelands. This has never been explicitly accepted by the Government before. Now, however, the White Paper states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is important that industrial development in general, and the development in the White areas, should not be harmed in the process of decentralization.</block>

<p>How many times have the Opposition not tried to drum this home? This principle is considered so important that it is referred to on three separate occasions in the White Paper. To enable the Government to obtain its Economic Development Programme target of an average rate of 5,5 per cent per annum, the White Paper emphasizes that the Government would have to accept the principle of flexibility in its planning policies. One of the face-savers which was introduced in this programme was marked by the new concept of locality-bound industries referred to by my hon. friend, the member for Hillbrow. Unfortunately we find that in the implementation of the Government&#x2019;s policy of decentralization, they still have to use a combination of the carrot and the whip. By its insistence on the whip, the Government has implicitly recognized that the carrot is inadequate. It is significant that, whereas the object of the exercise was to apply the policy of decentralization in a more effective manner, and so eliminate, where possible, the uncertainties and problems that the Government anticipated, this has not been achieved. The field of uncertainty has been narrowed, but not removed. The continued reliance of the Government on the whip, rather than the carrot, must inevitably have severe repercussions on our economy.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, let me, for a start, leave the hon. member at that, because there are two aspects to which I should call the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention. Since the Department of Planning came into being in South Africa eight or nine years ago, our general planning structure has actually taken on a completely new form and shape. There are facets of our larger, broader planning machine on which, I think, we can only look back with great pride today in the light of what has been achieved over the past few years.</p>

<p>But, Sir, there is one facet of this planning structure that I really think deserves a great deal more deliberate attention at this stage on our part and on the part of the department. What I am thinking of now is regional planning as such. Regional planning is being taught as a subject today at several of our universities. As far as that is concerned I think we have already come far. But as far as the practical side of regional planning is concerned, there are various facets which, I believe, the Department of Planning will have to give much more express attention to from now on. Firstly, these regions have been divided up today, and there are actually no areas for which we can say: &#x201C;Look, this is where this specific area ends&#x201D;. In other words, throughout the entire area, particularly in the Cape Province, there are parts where development associations do not function at all. I do not know what the situation in the vicintiy of the Transvaal is, but I now know the Cape Province very well. There are areas here, for example our northern urban areas, the parts around Cape Town, and so on&#x2014;I am thinking of an area like Stellenbosch&#x2014;where we really feel that with the help of the Minister, or whoever it may be, we must do something about this situation.</p>

<p>Another point I should like to mention is that we do not make a point of encouraging our people to imbue the various citizens with a new spirit of development. One can compare these development areas with the situation that prevailed there years ago. I am now thinking of our coastal areas in particular. Many Strandlopers roamed about in these specific areas. They made small holes in ostrich eggs and filled them with water. After they had taken a drink, they hid them at some or other spot in those grasslands. However, when it comes to the creation of development possibilities in those areas and to instilling new power into those areas, there are no longer these people on whom one can depend. <span class="col_8259-8260" refersTo="page_1084"/>They take no notice of the cold Atlantic Ocean with its rich fishing grounds; it just passes them by. It is when the new people get there that they build on the future that lies in store for them with a certain attitude of mind. We need this new creative ability in man. Where man&#x2019;s creative power is lacking, poverty reigns. I feel the time has now come for us to take note, firstly, of the true power of the individual there in respect of this new trend of development with the new regions and regional organizations we must now create. It is not the gold, the copper or the other minerals that are the most important factors in such a region. The most important factors, in the first place, are the people who carry the creative power and who want to develop and create their own environment.</p>

<p>I now want to advocate that the department should come to the fore and bring a new constitution for all these regional development associations. Today there are numerous regional development associations of this kind. I have pointed out that there are between 60 and 70 of these associations. What is the result of this? Each of them virtually has its own voluntary organizational machine or their own voluntary agendas according to which they work. I think the time has now come for uniformity. I now want to ask the hon. the Minister whether we cannot, even before the end of this year, get round to bringing these regional development associations together so that we can examine the differences in the various regions and so that proper lines can be drawn for them. We can then bring them to the fore as the bodies that will actually constitute the new practical basis of our planning machine. There is going to be a difference of opinion about where these lines must be drawn, but I really think the department must take the initiative so that we can make this division as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>In addition I also think the time has come for the Department of Planning to set aside one or two of its officials to initiate and stimulate the correct creative spirit amongst our people in these regional development associations. We do not look at these regional development associations as associations that must exert pressure on the Government, or exert pressure on the Minister from time to time. These must be people who will have to build up the future of their own region with a spirit of individuality and with a love for their own region. If the Department of Planning wants to make one of the most important basic investments today in respect of this useful philosophy, it will have to take a new look at its whole planning structure, in fact at the whole format of development associations. I want to ask the hon. the Minister that even before the end of this year we give our full attention to this aspect, not only in respect of the Cape Province, but in respect of the whole Republic.</p>

<p>The second aspect I want to mention here is the attention that a region like the Langebaan lagoon has obtained in recent years from the Department of Planning. The time has come for us to take a new look at this very important asset in the Boland region. There are bodies that are interested in the unfolding and development of this specific region. In many respects their interests clash. I am thinking, for example, of the intention of letting salt pans develop for South Africa at a specific spot in this lagoon. There is the Oude Pos Syndicate in this specific region where there is a large concentration of game today. This clashes in certain respects with other plans being proposed in the specific region. There is the military set-up at Langebaan. On occasion the hon. the Minister of Defence has made it apparent that this set-up can be shifted to Langebaan. I think it is a very important decision. There are also other bodies, for example the yachtsmen, who are interested in bringing new development to this specific region. These are all aspects that will have to be looked at in the future. There is the old whaling station at Donkergat which has, <i>inter alia,</i> its own water and power supplies. But because we have no general planning, and because we do not know what we want to do and in what direction we want to move as far as the overall unfolding and development of this region is concerned, the intentions of these people are hanging in the air. There are numerous bodies who, at this stage, are pressing to start a fish hatchery there, particularly in the vicinity of Rietbaai, such as we have on a large scale today in a country like Japan [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. VAN Z. CILLI&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Moorreesburg and I have clashed in this House about various matters on numerous occasions. But this afternoon I want to congratulate <span class="col_8261-8262" refersTo="page_1085"/>him on the plea he lodged. I want to tel] him that I associate myself with the sensible approach he displayed as far as this matter is concerned.</p>

<p>The economic development programme of South Africa is a comprehensive plan. Unfortunately this plan does not always evolve according to expectations. What worries me is that the hon. the Minister and his department do not &#x201C;up-date&#x201D; this plan systematically, to &#x201C;opdateer&#x201D; this plan, if that is the right word, to adapt it to the country&#x2019;s altered circumstances. With our limited resources, e.g. labour and capital, we must take note that South Africa must keep the economic objectives in view and leave what I would almost like to call its ideological obsession. It is indeed true that the border industries are adversely affecting the metropolitan industries. Several training courses that have been introduced, several of the objectives that are being pursued, labour agreements, etc., can eventually boomerang to such an extent on the metropolitan industries that they kill the goose that laid the golden egg. I should like to tell the hon. the Minister that the point of departure in respect of planning must surely be the economically sound development of the country as a whole. It is not only shortsighted, but it can also prove dangerous if some or other part of the country or some section or other of the population is neglected.</p>

<p>Therefore I should like to come back to the Port Elizabeth / Uitenhage complex, which is an important component of the metropolitan industrial areas of South Africa. The area, as the hon. the Minister knows, was divided up, and to the west of the Humansdorp/Colesberg line it was a Coloured labour area, while the area to the east of the Fish-Kat River was a Bantu labour area. The strip in between was a dual labour area, but then the area in between, i.e. the Port Elizabeth/Uitenhage complex, was converted into a Coloured labour preferential area while the area has a Bantu-Coloured ratio of four to one. I want to emphasize that the Bantu are indigenous to the area and that they were not brought to that area.</p>

<p>The businessmen and industrialists in this area find great difficulty in obtaining a measure of permanence as far as their labour forces are concerned. The strong bargaining position in which the Coloureds have now been placed, because it is a preferential area for Coloureds, causes up to 100 per cent absenteeism in some of the industries, and liquor and drugs also play a big role amongst the bottom group of Coloureds employed there. In the past we have advocated that the Government reconsider declaring this area a dual labour area, but the hon. the Minister did not think fit to do so. He has, nevertheless, made an important concession as far as Port Elizabeth is concerned and said that if there is up to 2 per cent unemployment as far as Coloureds are concerned, this will be accepted as being full employment and Bantu can then be employed.</p>

<p>Today I want to advocate that the Minister should reconsider this percentage and possibly double it, or increase it so that the Coloureds will have a slightly weaker bargaining position and so that the contracts that are given to industrialists to employ Bantu labourers are extended over and above the period of service that is granted today. There are Bantu labourers who work on a permanent basis today. Those people are trained to do skilled and semi-skilled labour, and I want to give you the assurance that they are doing good work. But if a Bantu is merely employed for a year or two it is an extremely expensive process to give him the training, then to lose him and have to start from scratch again. I have previously said in this House &#x2014;and my hon. friend, the member for Pretoria North, blamed me for having done so&#x2014;that Port Elizabeth &#x2026;</p>

<p>Port Elizabeth North. He blamed me when I said the Port Elizabeth/Uitenhage complex can today be regarded as the sick man in South Africa&#x2019;s economy. The reason is that our industrial growth is, to a very large and dangerous extent, dependent on and linked to the economically sensitive motor industry. I think the hon. the Minister will agree with me that it is very important for further development of the economy to take place in this complex with Government encouragement. One of these days the water of the Orange River project will reach Port Elizabeth; we shall also be obtaining additional supplies of power from Escom; the labour is there; the business acumen is there; the harbour is there; and the necessary infrastructure is there. What is lacking is Government permission for the better utilization of the labour that already exists there. Pretoria, Durban, East <span class="col_8263-8264" refersTo="page_1086"/>London, Brits and other parts of the country today have the benefits of border industries. Why can similar benefits, or other equal benefits, not be offered to the metropolitan areas that do not border on Bantu homelands, for example Port Elizabeth and the Western Cape?</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Chairman, the Stellenbosch Bureau for Economic Research has sounded a call for dynamic enterprise on the part of private business in order to bring about a new phase of growth. Optimism, regrettably, is not enough. Optimism must be soundly based. That is where the Government&#x2019;s responsibility comes into the picture. Those who wish to pursue the dynamic enterprise that Stellenbosch advises, need the assurance that they will not be frustrated by official restrictions or discouragements. The Government must be an active agent for encouraging enterprise. They must realize fully how economic growth is stimulated. Professor Arthur Kemp pointed out recently that economic growth is a process of change but what we need is the freedom to make the changes that are required. The Government&#x2019;s approach must be bold so that South Africa may go forward in the seventies with faith to avail itself of the temporary benefits brought about by devaluation.

<p>My hon. friend, the hon. member for Moorreesburg, waxes lyrical in this House every year about the growth potential of the Boland, the larger Boland, and the West Coast. I am acutually jealous of the way he advocates benefits for the future of the development of the Western Cape. I appreciate this and admire it in him.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>I now want to go to another part, i.e. to the Hendrik Verwoerd project in the Northern Cape. Just as lyrical as the hon. member for Moorreesburg waxed about the development in the Western Cape, I should like to become about the future development in that area. The Orange River project consists of two parts: The portion to the west of the dam or below the dam; the other part is the catchment area of the Hendrik Verwoerd Dam. The catchment area of the Hendrik Verwoerd complex consists of three parts: the Free State part, which stretches up to Ficksburg in the North Eastern Free State; then there is Lesotho, about which we cannot say or do anything, of course; but the third portion, which is the portion I should like to speak about, is the North Eastern Cape. When I speak of the North Eastern Cape, I have a desire to wax lyrical. I said just a moment ago that the Western Cape is the Cape Province&#x2019;s foundation in South Africa. Similarly the North Eastern Cape is the roof of the Cape Province.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the hon. member for Carletonville should just contain himself a little. There are sinkholes in his constituency; here there are no sinkholes. When I am speaking of the North Eastern Cape, I mean the funnel-shaped portion for Whites between Lesotho, Herschel on the north and between the Ciskei and the Transkei for a long stretch on the south. It covers quite a few districts, including a few districts situated in the constituency which the Minister represents, in addition to a few districts in my constituency. A few years ago the Free State University conducted a socioeconomic survey in that area, and it was proved that a retarded economy prevails there. I now come back to the North Eastern Cape area. That area really has the potential, but at present there is a depressed economy as a result of certain demands being made in certain circles. Because there is a depressed economy there is no out <span class="col_8265-8266" refersTo="page_1087"/>side capital coming in. It differs from the rest of South Africa. Therefore I want to advocate to the hon. the Minister today that planning should take place. I have here the list of objectives of the Hendrik Verwoerd project, a few of which I am going to quote to hon. members. I quote (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; contributes towards decentralizing South Africa&#x2019;s industries with a view to making the best and most economic use of the country&#x2019;s labour sources.</block>

<p>The second is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">By the establishment of stable farming communities to help check the population flow from the rural areas to the cities. To let a network of electric power installations develop that can provide about 229,1 megawatts of electricity.</block>

<p>The last one I want to mention here is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; to create tourist and recreational facilities in the interior of South Africa.</block>

<p>Here I also want to refer to what Mr. Kuhne wrote in <i>Die Burger</i> the other day when he went camping on the mountains there for the week-end. He said one could buy fresh air there. In the Northern Cape one does not need to buy fresh air; one can go there and enjoy oneself in the mountains. There are spots that are 9 000 feet above sea level. Another cause of a retarded economy in this area is the transport, the lines of communication. As a result of the fact that it is far removed from the markets&#x2014;far is a relative concept&#x2014;and does not have proper road links, particularly to the east, the agricultural industry is struggling. These are the things that must be speeded up to link this area with the eastern area, where their natural market is.</p>

<p>I also want to mention that there is no rail link from Maclear to Matatiele. I do not think there will be one in the near future as a result of the fact that the agricultural economy does not justify such a railway line. When the Hendrik Verwoerd project has developed further to the west, the economic development will justify the construction of that railway line. That is why it is of the utmost importance that attention be given to this important area in South Africa. Timely attention must be given to it, because in time the creeping paralysis can strike those parts and this could mean those parts becoming useless to the Whites of South Africa. We want the White community in those particular districts to be strengthened and not weakened.</p>

<p>As a result of these facts, I want to urge the hon. the Minister to ensure the planning of that area. My hon. friend for Moorreesburg spoke a while ago of the regional development associations that function individually without any actual general planning. I want to agree with him in that respect. There must be planning in that specific area because it has the water, the power and the labour. We do not have &#x2026;</p>

We can also develop industries there using agricultural raw materials. It is in that spirit that I am today advocating the cause of the North Western Cape, and it is in that spirit that I feel we must now plan, because tomorrow or the day after it could be too late for the planning of that area.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just sat down excused himself for not replying to my colleague who preceded him. I am afraid that I must ask him the same indulgence, because I want to deal with another matter.</p>

<p>I should like to deal immediately with the question of group area proclamations, for which this hon. Minister is responsible. In the first instance, I think it is unnecessary to say that group area proclamations affect the lives of every single South African citizen, regardless of colour. As the population grows, these group areas will continue to be proclaimed and reproclaimed despite what the Minister would like to do. Group areas are going to be reproclaimed <i>ad infinitum,</i> for the simple reason that as populations grow, it will be found that isolated islands for the occupation of different race groups surrounded by particularly White areas will become far too small, so that new group areas will have to be proclaimed. Therefore new masses of people will have to be removed. The time will come, of course, when the people being removed will be White people in the main and no longer non-Whites. Then White people will get a taste of the medicine which had been dished out to the <span class="col_8267-8268" refersTo="page_1088"/>Coloured and Indian people over the last 10 years in particular.</p>

<p>What I should like to say here is that this is inevitable under the Government&#x2019;s policy. One then turns immediately to the question of how much confidence we can have in the Group Areas Board and its initial proclamations or deproclamations. I should like to show that in fact one can have no confidence in the Group Areas Board and the Group Areas Board hearings. Very often these hearings which take place are nothing more or less than a farce. I say this because experience has indicated in South Africa that over the years, since the activities of the Group Areas Board started, very seldom, indeed hardly ever, has the Group Areas Board paid any attention to the evidence or the weight of evidence given to it in a particular instance. All the decisions in regard to group areas, such as group area proclamations and reproclamations, appear to be made in Pretoria, regardless of any of the facts produced at the various hearings which have taken place throughout the country.</p>

<p>I should like to show to the hon. the Minister that in some instances the decisions of the Group Areas Board have in fact been taken before the hearing takes place. Prior to the hearing taking place, in other words, the decision has already been made. Before I do so, I should like to refer to a statement made by the vice-chairman of the Group Areas Board, Mr. Van Wyk, as reported on 15th July last year. He was talking to a collection of children taking part in a course on the South Coast of Natal. He made the following statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Group Areas Act was not discriminatory, but because more non-Whites had entered White areas, more of them were affected by it.</block>

<p>I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he agrees with such a statement. Does he agree with the statement that more non-Whites were affected by the Group Areas Act because more non-Whites had moved into White areas? It needs hardly anybody in South Africa to point out that before the Group Areas Act came into operation, there was no such thing in South Africa as a White area. How more non-Whites could have moved into White areas, I should like to know. If this statement had been made by the ordinary rank and file of the members opposite, I believe it could be ignored, but coming from the vice-chairman of the Group Areas Board, I believe it is a matter of very grave concern. If this is his attitude when he sits on the board, I believe that it supports my contention that many of these hearings are no more or no less than a farce.</p>

<p>Now I should particularly like to come to the matter of the hearing at Newcastle. It is on record that when the then chairman of the Group Areas Board opened the proceedings at the recent hearing at Newcastle, he said that the board was not prepared to listen to criticism of the proposed master plan. In other words, a master plan had been drawn up for Newcastle, and no matter what evidence was brought before the board at its hearing in Newcastle, the board was not prepared to listen to any criticism of this plan. In other words, what then happened was that a master plan had to be drawn up for Newcastle, as the hon. the Minister has mentioned before in this House, but when the hearing took place no criticism of this plan was allowed. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister how in heaven&#x2019;s name you can hold a hearing and ask for evidence from the various groups affected when the chairman turns round, when evidence is to be presented by leading legal authorities, and tells them that he will brook no criticism of the plan itself. It came to light a little later on that apparently the chairman had participated in the drawing up of this master plan. Sir, I do not know which strong words I can use in this matter; I am not one for using strong words, as the hon. the Minister knows, but I will say to him that this sort of hearing makes a mockery of the whole system of holding hearings under the Group Areas Act. I would like the hon. the Minister to deal with this particular matter in detail. I see no purpose in the Government drawing up a plan for a particular area, then holding a hearing in regard to that particular plan, and then saying that the people who give evidence cannot criticize it. Why does the department not simply scrap group area hearings and say, &#x201C;We have declared this area for Group A, Group B or Group C,&#x201D; and then leave it at that? Why go through this whole farce of holding a hearing when the opinion of people who have gone to the trouble of obtaining expensive legal advice, is simply ignored completely? Sir, I believe that I am justified in making this accusation, because if one studies the various group areas which have been proclaimed throughout South <span class="col_8269-8270" refersTo="page_1089"/>Africa, one seldom finds that they conform to the weight of evidence given at the particular hearing which affected the group concerned. Furthermore, I object most strongly to officials of the Group Areas Board making public statements such as the one, to which I referred earlier, made by the vice-chairman. I believe that this is not their function. Public statements come from the Minister and from the Minister alone. Sir, what confidence can the public have in these group area hearings? I couple that with what I said earlier on, and that is that group areas are going to be proclaimed and deproclaimed for a very long time in South Africa as we sort out our population groups, because as the population groups grow, they will in fact never be sorted out.</p>

<p>When I looked at this statement made by the vice-chairman, in which he said that no discrimination was involved, I was immediately reminded of District Six. I have said before in this House that if we returned District Six to the Coloured community&#x2014;and it is not too late to do it&#x2014; we would be rendering the greatest possible service to the cause of good race relations between Whites and Coloureds in South Africa. I would propose that we take immediate action and agitate for the return of District Six to the Coloured people without delay, before the relations between the Whites and the Coloureds become worse than they are today. Unlike District Six, the Malay quarter of Cape Town has been allowed to stay because apparently it is a tourist attraction. What a pity it is, from the point of view of the thousands of people who lived in District Six, that District Six was not also regarded as a tourist attraction. So much for the principle of group areas.</p>

<p>Sir, in the very short time left to me I would like to deal very briefly with one or two other matters. The first one is the proclamation of Stockville recently. Here is an area not wanted by the Coloured people, an area which in fact is of no use to the Coloured people for the purpose for which it was allcated to them by the Group Areas Board, who probably made their decision even before they had looked at the ground. No suggestion has been made as to what is to happen to the people affected. In his reply to a question this morning, the hon. the Minister could not even tell the House what amount of produce was produced in that area and how many people depended on that area for their livelihood. Surely, Sir, these are the things that must be investigated when one proposes to move not one family, not five families, but over 100 000 families, who have already been moved under the Group Areas Act. If this is the type of investigation that takes place before people are removed, is it any wonder that there has been so much unhappiness and discontent? I can cite another classic example. In Durban an area was set aside for the development of high-class Indian houses. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF PLANNING</person>:</from>

<p>I think I should reply at this stage to a few of the points which have been raised here, and I might just as well start with the hon. member who has made the latest contribution to the discussion, and then work my way backwards to the first speaker. I hope he does not mind.</p>

<p>The hon. member raised the question of group area proclamations, which he says affect the lives of many people. He says that as he sees the position, there will be proclamations and deproclamations for many years to come<i>&#x2014;ad infinitum.</i> Sir, if time allows me, I will deal with the question of planning, because what the hon. member has said, actually affects the whole question of planning in South Africa. If you can plan, as far as planning is possible, for the foreseeable future or for a reasonable length of time into the future, and you can proclaim group areas under such a plan, then I can visualize that a group area proclamation could be either permanent or very nearly permanent. Perhaps in the past our planning in South Africa has been on a fairly <i>ad hoc</i> basis and that is why we have made mistakes. We have sometimes found, because of new developments, that what we did before was not the correct thing and then we have had to scrap our former plan, which originally was regarded as a good one. That plan might have been prepared by a local authority or by a province. We are now definitely moving in a direction where we hope to lay down certain over-all guide lines for the various metropolitan areas in South Africa, and also for the smaller towns and cities so that everybody concerned, will be able to know more or less within limits and as far as humanly possible, what can be expected for a certain time to come. That is what we tried to do at Newcastle. At Newcastle, as the hon. <span class="col_8271-8272" refersTo="page_1090"/>member will remember, there were certain advertisements with regard to group area investigations. I do not think that anybody in this House or in the country will blame me for looking into the situation at Newcastle to see where people have been living, and for looking at the ground available in that area to see where people are going to live in years to come&#x2014;say up to the year 2000. Newcastle, if I remember correctly, has a population of about 20 000. By the end of the century it is possible that 200 000 to 300 000 people may be living there. Therefore I make no apology for the fact that we had to go and look at the group areas position in which our different population groups will have to live in the years to come, and how Newcastle has to be organized to accommodate this vast influx of people.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I call the whole House to witness. The Government decided that the third Iscor would be sited at Newcastle. I have just said that this could mean, with all the industries that may go there, a population of 300 000 by the turn of the century, and the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District asks me what that has to do with it! The hon. member for Port Natal will remember that I withdrew those advertisements. I announced in this House that I first wanted to have a guide plan for the Newcastle area, and I instructed my department and we set the necessary machinery in motion and a guide plan committee for Newcastle was appointed. On that guide plan committee the town council of Newcastle was represented and took an active part in the preparation of that guide plan, through its town consultants. The province of Natal was on that committee and also Iscor and the National Transportation Board, the Railways and the Department of Community Development. It was under the chairmanship of one of the officials of my department. The plan was laid before everyone concerned and after complete agreement, as I can say here today, I finally endorsed that guide plan for Newcastle and it was published. Only then did we draw up new investigation proposals with regard to group areas in Newcastle. The town council also made certain suggestions and the plans were incorporated in the advertised plans, as well as that of my department and the province and everybody else concerned. Then we advertised it and held a public inquiry at Newcastle. Even before that time, the hon. member will remember the very severe criticism that appeared in the Natal newspapers, criticism which I considered at the time and still consider today, to be quite unfair, in some cases most unfair. At the hearing which was held at Newcastle, the counsel who appeared for the town council and for the Indian community made accusations and allegations which I think was not fair towards those people conducting the investigation. They were accused of being stooges and various other things.</p>

<from>Mr. L. E. D. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask the Minister whether he thinks it is right or fair that the chairman of the board at the hearing should have said that he was only prepared to discuss the guide plan?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I have made a note of it. I must voice my disapproval of the way in which senior counsel came to that investigation and voiced certain sentiments which I feel were not worthy of men belonging to the legal profession. In any case, there is the point which the hon. member makes today and which I have not heard before. The hon. member says that various people, or perhaps those same advocates, criticized that guide plan but that the chairman of the investigating committee ruled them out of order. Well, I must say I only heard it for the first time this afternoon, but I must say to the hon. member that I feel like siding with the chairman. What was relevant? What was before that committee of inquiry? The guide plan was not before the board. The guide plan was something with which they did not have anything to do whatsoever. The guide plan was something for a completely different committee. It was finalized <span class="col_8273-8274" refersTo="page_1091"/>and it was published, and they had no right to discuss the guide plan, to say that it was good or bad. I think the chairman of the investigating committee, who is also the chairman of the Group Areas Board, was quite right. What was before that committee, what was relevant was the advertised plan for group areas siting at Newcastle. They could have argued that it does not fit in with the guide plan. That would have been another matter. That would have have been relevant to my mind, because why do you have a guide plan for any area, and why must you have a proclamation that does not fit in with your overall plan? That is the reason why you want an overall plan. So it was relevant to argue that the group areas proposals which they were investigating and on which they had to decide one way or the other&#x2014;because there were various alternatives&#x2014;could not be reconciled with the overall guide plan. But you could not say the guide plan was of no value and must be rejected, because it was not part of the job that committee was doing at the time. Now I come to the point the hon. member made at the start when he said we will always have proclamations and deproclamations as long as we live. That could be so to a certain extent. Nothing in this world is final. We think we have a good plan, but then conditions change, as they changed in Newcastle, and as they may change in various other parts of the country, and then you find that you have to change your plan. But if we have an overall guide plan for a certain area, and if we plan well into the future, which we consider should be about 30 years ahead, and if we bring everybody concerned in that area together, the province and the local authority and Bantu Administration and the Railways and the people who construct the roads, and if we bring in everything, including industry, and we then declare something for the future, and under that plan we then proclaim group areas, then I think we have a better chance to have a group area proclamation which will last longer,&#x2014;although it may not last for all time.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#winchester">

<from>Mr. L. E. D. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister has mentioned various bodies he would consult in arriving at the guide plan; I accept that, but he seems to have missed out the most important one of all. He has missed out the representatives of the people who will be affected&#x2014;not the local authorities nor the Government departments, but the very people themselves&#x2014;the Indians, the Coloureds and the Whites. Surely they should have a say in it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>At this stage we are not bringing on our guide plan committees representatives of, for example, the Indian Council or the Coloured Council. That is so. When we have our group area hearings, as the hon. member knows, they appear at those hearings and they are well represented and they can argue their case very well. They also argue their cases through their departments. The Department of Indian Affairs and my Department of Coloured Affairs also put their case before the Group Areas Board. We also make representations on their behalf. That is my answer to the point the hon. member has just mentioned.</p>

<p>So, Sir, with further regard to Newcastle, I want to say that I have received the report of the board. I am still awaiting the final reply from the province. Subject to the reply of the province being received, I can say that all the noise and all the mischief that has been created in Natal on this point by the newspapers, could well turn out to have no foundation at all. In any case, if I do not finalize this matter by Monday afternoon, during my Vote, I shall finalize it before the end of the session of Parliament. Up to 2 o&#x2019;clock this afternoon, I had not yet had the province&#x2019;s reply, so I cannot say for certain what the decision will be. I think, however, that all the people who were so concerned about the matter, had no real justification for their fears. They never had, and perhaps they will not in the future.</p>

<p>I now come to Stockville, and I am pleased to see that the hon. member for Pinetown is present. Stockville, as we all know, is near the Mariannhill Coloured township. It is at present an area occupied by Indian squatter farmers. It is 1 053 ha in extent. I can only say that Stockville, as far as my information goes, is a natural extension of the Mariannhill Coloured group area. It is bordered on the west and north by a European area, but my information is that there is a ridge and a plateau which practically isolates it from the European area. On the east side there is an industrial area and on the other side the Coloured group area, which at present has not yet been developed.</p>

<p>May I ask a question? Why do you classify this as a <span class="col_8275-8276" refersTo="page_1092"/>Coloured area when there are Indians there?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>As I have said, the area is 1 053 ha in extent. On about 364 ha in the northern part of the area there are 200 Indian small farmers, and my information is that the total population is about 2 000. That area is in any case completely cut off from every other Indian area in the complex of Durban. It can never really become an Indian group area. In the long term its future is Coloured. I have not quite been accused, but the hon. member has said that we continually deproclaim and never reach finality. Here the position is that if we develop Mariannhill in future, this Stockville area will form a natural extension to Mariannhill. That was why I felt that although we do not need this ground at the moment &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. A. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>There are no Coloureds there at all.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, there are no Coloureds there at all. Although we do not need this ground at the moment, if we proclaim it Coloured, we will be giving an indication that in the future this ground will be needed for Coloured housing. We shall need such land in Durban in future; there is no doubt about it. The area now being developed is Newlands East, and when Newlands East is full, we shall have to go over to that Mariannhill-Stockville area. I have consulted the Department of Community Development and they have given me the assurance to be able to say that those Indian farmers will be able to remain there for at least ten years. They will be able to remain in Stockville for at least ten years. But they now know well in advance that Stockville will not permanently remain an Indian area although there are Indian people living there now. After ten years the Government of the day can reconsider their position. All I can say to the hon. member for Pinetown is that I was under the impression that the area would be needed sooner and that is why I signed this proclamation. If I had known that it would take at least ten years before we might need the ground, I could have left it as a controlled area. In any case, nothing can happen to it unless I give my consent. As I have said, I am going to look at the Stockville area after I return to Pretoria. I must say that I honestly do not feel that I have made a mistake, but I am one of those people who, if they have made a mistake try to rectify it as soon as possible. I do not think I have made a mistake here, but I can give those Indian farmers the assurance that they will be left there for at least ten years. Some time or another, however, the area will be needed for residential development. There is no doubt about that. It will not be needed for Indian residential development; it will be needed for Coloured residentail development. Those were the reasons which prompted me to give my consent to the recommendation of the board for Stockville to become Coloured.</p>

We are speaking of Mr. Odell as a person and if we speak about his politics, then we are speaking about other matters. He is a person of intelligence and one who possesses sound judgment.

<p>Who is the other member?</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The other member whom I am appointing as from 1st June, is Prof. Dr. Erika Theron of the University of Stellenbosch. I am appointing her because I have as much confidence in her, because I know that she has been interested in the Coloured people all her life, that she has made studies, both social and otherwise, of and published works on the Coloured people, and because I think that, as far as group areas planning for the Coloured people of the Cape Province is concerned, she will bring to bear primarily a scientific, but also a sympathetic view which will only be to the good of the board in its planning as far as the Coloured people of our country are concerned. As she is still attached to the University at present and will only retire in December, she will for the rest of this year be expected to devote about a quarter of her time to the business of the board. I have already asked her to take a look at the housing position in a few towns in order to write reports for me. She will, therefore, have enough to do. But, as from 1st January next year, she will, like Mr. Odell, be a part-time member of the board on a 50 per cent basis&#x2014;in respect of both time and remuneration.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Aliwal spoke to me about the North-eastern Cape, which he termed an area with potential, but as an area which is lagging in the economic sphere at present. I would agree that it could only be in the interests of South Africa if that area could be strengthened in the economic sphere. He pleaded that we should plan in respect of that area. I may tell the hon. member that we shall do so. If I still find time this afternoon, I shall speak about it&#x2014;if not, I shall speak about it on Monday. We are also dividing the country into certain regions in respect of overall national spatial planning. Subsequently we shall plan each one of these sub-regions as a region. I shall not go into that asepct now. Accordingly, that part of the country, which includes everything east of the line between Aliwal North and Port Elizabeth, will be one of our sub-regions, and we shall plan that entire area. Its potential, what one can get from it, how one can strengthen it, its needs in respect of transport, roads, etc., will all be determined. I may tell the hon. member that, as he knows, we have on our programme a national road through that area. The province is busy with other roads, but we shall take a look at all the transport networks to see how adequate they are. We shall examine the greatest potential of the area at the moment, its wonderful scenic beauty and what it can offer in that regard along its rivers, streams and mountains, and then we shall plan that area as a whole. In this respect, I may tell the hon. member that I give the undertaking that we shall look at the planning of that area.</p>

<p>The speaker who spoke before that hon. member was the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central. Now, I do not want to discuss the E.D.P. with that hon. member, because I have to discuss it later with the hon. member for Hillbrow. Every two was the one who said that we do not adjust the programme. But surely the hon. member cannot tell me that we do not adjust this programme. Surely the hon. member knows&#x2014;or ought to know&#x2014;that we do adjust the programme. If he does not know this, he should only ask the hon. member for Hillbrow. Every two years we adjust the programme in the light of the new facts and figures we have obtained in regard to what the various ramifications of the economy have actually realized. On the basis of those facts and figures we readjust the programme for two years to come. If one has a five-year plan and one adjusts it, one adds two years at the end and lops off two years at the beginning, and it remains a five-year plan. The five-year plan is continually being adjusted in its actual figures and projections, on the basis of the actually realized results one has.</p>

<p>The hon. member spoke of the P.E./ Uitenhage area as a preferential one for Coloured labour, and that is so. But the hon. member will also know that I met the industrialists in Port Elizabeth and that I made representations. The report of the Riekert Committee is very satisfactory on <span class="col_8279-8280" refersTo="page_1094"/>this point. The hon. member asked whether we were making further relaxations, but the Riekert Committee said that as soon as Coloured unemployment in that area fell below 2 per cent, it was deemed to be full employment of Coloureds. Then Bantu labour was granted to industrialists; not only on a temporary basis, as the hon. member said, but on a permanent basis. That is so. Since the hon. member asked me to allow Bantu labour to be employed in that area permanently, I may therefore tell him that under these circumstances it is already being done in the P.E./Uitenhage area. The industrialists are highly satisfied with the position. I may tell the hon. member that I see those industrialists from time to time and they all tell me they are now quite satisfied with the labour set-up in the Port Elizabeth / Uitenhage area.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member asked for the subsidization of the industrial activities in Port Elizabeth. I am sorry, but I cannot even consider it. The fact of the matter is that if we were to subsidize our industrial activities as a whole in South Africa, one would not in the long run have a sound industrial economy. We cannot, in areas where industry has got off the ground, where it has at least gained a little momentum of its own, subsidize industrial activities. The Port Elizabeth/Uitenhage area to my mind really does not qualify for that. We have given that area a great deal of assistance in other ways. Through the various phases of local content for the motor industry we have nevertheless stimulated a great deal of industrial action in that area. If the hon. member speaks to the motor manufacturers in that area, he will hear that they also received certain concessions from the State for the transport of their motor vehicles to the Rand market. The hon. member knows that. I do not think we can go any further than that. I am sorry.</p>

<p>Then I come to the hon. member for Moorreesburg. He said here, quite rightly, that regional planning is one of the most important facets of our entire planning activities in South Africa, and that the various regional associations have to play an important part in this regional planning in South Africa. The hon. member asked whether he could not bring them together and whether my department could not take the initiative. Then he raised a very important point which I want to emphasize at this early juncture. He said that the view we should take, is that these regional associations should not become pressure groups, but should be positive groups which should make a positive, creative contribution to the overall planning activities. There are 52 regional development associations in our country today. Some are completely inactive, but there are others which play an important role, which are very active and which even form an important link today in the planning machinery maintained by my department. One of the reasons for our welcoming their participation so strongly, is that to us they represent the local viewpoint. Since I began to understand this work, it is my view too that one cannot plan without the local viewpoint. That is why I am in various ways trying to include the local viewpoint in my planning. It has nothing to do with politics, and I have now started to do this with the Opposition by consulting them where certain matters in their constituencies are affected. I need not take their advice and of course they need not give me any opinion. However, I think that the local viewpoint is very important in our planning activities. In the whole set-up of regional planning it is very important. When we want to draw up regional plans, we need these regional development associations. I just want to tell hon. members that in one of the sub-regions of the Cape Province&#x2014;a while ago I mentioned the division of our country into certain sub-regions for planning purposes&#x2014;my department is convening a conference for later this year, a conference of all the regional development associations in that sub-region. Then we want to discuss the boundaries of the various regional development associations with them, because their boundaries are in actual fact determined on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis only. We feel there could be far better planning in respect of the boundaries of such regional development associations as well. In some cases, the boundaries overlap and we feel that doing this and organizing them properly and placing them on a permanent basis, we shall be able to give them a place in our country&#x2019;s planning machinery. After that congress we shall also proceed to do this with the regional development associations in other sub-regions of the country. I think the hon. member will be satisfied with what I have now said.</p>

<p>As far as the Langebaan Lagoon and related matters are concerned, I want to tell the hon. member that my standpoint on this matter is known. Ever since I paid <span class="col_8281-8282" refersTo="page_1095"/>a visit to the Langebaan Lagoon for the first time and subsequently, I have adopted the standpoint throughout that I do not think the lagoon should be used to produce salt. It is such a wonderful place and it has so much potential in other respects, that we should rather develop it in that respect. I cannot do more than that. It is a fact, and I also said it at that time, that a valid agreement or contract entered into years ago exists. The people who held or hold this contract have renewed it every year by paying the necessary amount. In my opinion there is an agreement therefore and the negotiations taking place are still taking place in this regard. Only recently, I think it was last week or the week before, I read in the newspapers that a conference was held in Cape Town in regard to this whole matter. I cannot say more than that, and I only hope that everything will work out in the end.</p>

<p>As far as the hon. members for Cape Town Gardens and Hillbrow are concerned&#x2014;I mention this only in passing, because I first want to reply to the hon. member for Smithfield before returning to the two hon. members&#x2014;they have today really paid my department the best compliment they could possibly have paid it. In regard to the really fundamental work my department does in the field of physical planning, which is in the interest of our country and the future of South Africa, they expressed not one single word of criticism. No criticism whatsoever was levelled at the policy or at the administration of my department. I appreciate it, because I do not think there is any reason &#x2014;and I do not want to be conceited&#x2014;for criticism in that regard. Their criticism was levelled simply and solely at the economic planning of my department&#x2014;I shall speak about that later&#x2014;and at the Physical Planning Act as it was and as it is now starting to take shape as a result of the report of the Riekert Committee and the White Paper. The hon. member for Smithfield expressed appreciation for the CSIR, and strongly commended the work which is being done by the CSIR for South Africa in the field of research and many other fields one may mention, for industry, and therefore for the private sector, as well as for the various State departments. He also mentioned the very good work which is being done by the CSIR in respect of our foreign relations, which are maintained in the fields in which the CSIR operates. He also referred to the satellite tracking station we are running for the American Space Administration. I appreciate the fine tribute which the hon. member paid to the CSIR and to myself, and I am certain that the CSIR will also take note of them with great appreciation. I thank him for those words and I shall convey them to the CSIR. I want to associate myself with what the hon. member said. The CSIR falls under my department and they do not give me much work. It is a pleasure for me to cooperate with them. They are people of outstanding calibre who are doing outstanding work for South Africa.</p>

<p>I come now to the hon. members for Cape Town Gardens and Hillbrow. Those two hon. members spoke in much the same vein and in the time at my disposal, and also on Monday, I should like to say a few words about that. I just want to tell the hon. member for Hillbrow and the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens that they should at least draw a distinction between drawing up an economic programme and the determination of economic policy. I do not lay down the economic policy in South Africa, and I am not responsible for fiscal and monetary measures and for general economic policy. That is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister of Finance. Much of what the hon. members wanted to lay at my door, has nothing to do with me, and I think they will grant me that. These are matters they should have discussed, and did indeed discuss with the hon. the Minister of Finance, and as we firmly believe, without any success. That is why they are again coming to me with those matters today. The hon. member for Hillbrow again said how badly our economy fared last year with a growth rate of only 3,7 per cent. The hon. member will grant me that he is a little too late in the day, because everyone is already speaking about a growth rate of 5 per cent this year.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Cape Town Gardens also spoke about the growth rate and I just want to say to him that in the period covered by the previous five year programme our growth rate was at least 5,4 per cent. It was only 0,1 per cent less than the target growth rate. So in actual fact there is nothing to criticize. It is a fact that the growth rate dropped last year, but that has also happened before. I am not sure about the year, but I think in 1968 the growth rate was only 3,8 per cent. In spite of that <span class="col_8283-8284" refersTo="page_1096"/>we had an average growth rate of 5,4 per cent during that five year period which included 1968. If we have a growth rate of only 3,7 per cent or 2,7 per cent, it will certainly be a serious matter in the long run, because our population increase is such that if it is deducted from the increase in the growth rate, very little is left to ensure an increase in the standard of living. But surely this is not the case each year. Surely this must be taken over a period of time, because this is what determines the standard of living. The standard of living is not determined by whether the growth rate is temporarily low today and high again tomorrow. There are reasons for this. We had a serious drought. We produced far less in the agricultural sphere. As far as that portion of the agricultural produce is concerned that we were able to export we received far less money on account of an overall recession in the world markets. It also coincided with a major drop in the world price of the minerals we export. That is understandable.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, then the hon. member for Hillbrow told me that Government expenditure is too high. Of course, that is an argument which hon. members also used during the Second Reading debate. As I said, that is not a matter for the Minister of Planning. My reply to that is that we have a country which can hardly be compared with some of the other countries. I have not been to Japan yet, but I imagine that in Japan everything is in close proximity so that no problems are experienced with basic services. But in South Africa Cape Town is situated here and Johannesburg a 1 000 miles away. Just look at our railway system, our road network and the entire communications system. South Africa is a large country and one of wide expanses and the infrastructure, as they call it, is expensive compared to production. That is one of the reasons why our State expenditure is so high. We have debated this matter on so many occasions in this Parliament that I do not want to debate it any further today. Moreover, the Opposition continually brings pressure to bear on us to spend more in certain directions.</p>

<p>Then it has also been argued that investment in the industrial sphere has dropped. That is a fact. We know it. It causes us concern. But investment in the industrial sphere already began to rise at the second half of last year. It began to rise sharply. We hope that in view of the measures we have taken, i.e. devaluation and import control, there will be substantial improvement. In the last few years we had many problems in selling of our gold. Those hon. members know it. They know about the uncertainty which developed in the international monetary system. People sat waiting for things to happen and they invested their money in those countries they expected would revalue. At one stage they were withholding their money from South Africa, from America and other countries as well. The hon. members know it.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member also spoke about productivity which dropped. That is a fact. At one stage productivity dropped in our country. It is characteristic of all countries where inflation prevails. Wages and salaries increase and they increase more rapidly than production. England has experienced it. The strong country, Western Germany, experienced a year or two ago that its productivity was dropping. That was the experience in all countries where one had an inflationary situation in the economy. As soon as things change, the opposite happens. I want to tell the hon. member for Cape Town Garden that comparisons are continually drawn in respect of the <i>per capita</i> real growth of our national product, but the fact of the matter is that one cannot compare South Africa with Western Germany or France. South Africa is a country with different population groups. That is the reason why we cannot be compared with other countries.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, on Monday I hope to reply further to the question of whether my department drafted the E.D.P. well and correctly in terms of the facts and the information at my disposal, because that is my only task. I shall then proceed to discuss the role played by the Physical Planning Act and the amendments there to affect our economy for better or for worse against the general aspects of the planning activities in South Africa.</p>

<summary>(Committee Stage)</summary>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to deal with the definition of &#x201C;weather modification&#x201D;, which is dealt with in this clause, because of the difficulty in which we find ourselves when we relate this particular Bill to the Bill which was introduced by the Minister of Water Affairs, also dealing with weather modification.</p>

<p>Our difficulty stems from two features. The one will be dealt with by the hon. member for Mooi River, and the other one I should like to deal with now. The definitions of &#x201C;weather modification&#x201D; in the two Bills, viz. the Bill introduced by the Minister of Water Affairs earlier, and this Bill, are different. This definition before us mentions in detail the kind of modification which is dealt with in this Bill. The definition reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Weather modification&#x201D; means the artificial promoting, accelerating, increasing, aggravating, impeding, suppressing, retarding or altering of the natural occurrence of rain, snow, fog, hail or similar atmospheric precipitation, or lightning or a tornado or cyclone or a similar atmospheric phenomenon, but excluding any modification of precipitation as defined in section 33A of the Water Act, 1956 (Act No. 54 of 1956).</block>

<p>The Water Act, 1956, was amended earlier this session, and I take it that the exception mentioned in this definition excludes the definition in the Water Amendment Act which was passed this year. That there can be a clash in these definitions is what we fear. We fear that, notwithstanding the fact that this definition deals with certain aspects of weather modification, these specific provisions can clash with the definition in the other Act which we have already passed. We feel that when the time comes for a prosecution, the prosecutor is going to be put in a position where he will have to determine whether he is going to prosecute in terms of the Act of the Department of Water Affairs, which has already been passed, or whether he is going to prosecute in terms of this Bill, when it is on the Statute Book. In other words, Sir, we fear that a person or a concern which wants to go in for weather modification can in fact make an application to the wrong Minister under the wrong Statute. Whilst provision is made in the Act which has been passed, and in this Bill, for the two Ministers to work together, in practice it may be very difficult indeed for a person or a concern wanting to go in for weather modification to know precisely which department to apply to. An infringement may then result, for example if the person concerned engages in such a practice without a permit, and if this should happen, the prosecutor has to take action in terms of the punitive provisions of one of these measures. He can act in terms of the measure introduced by the Minister of Water Affairs, or he can act in terms of this Bill. It seems to me that the definitions in these two measures, which are there to guide such a prosecution, are such that they in fact overlap, notwithstanding the fact that it says in this definition that the definition in the Water Act is excluded <span class="col_8287-8288" refersTo="page_1098"/>here. This is what worries us, and this brings me to the suggestion made by my hon. friend the other day, in my absence, namely that we should one day scrap these measures and start again with one completely new Bill, dealing with weather modification. All these matters can then be brought together under one measure. We feel that this definition can conflict with the definition in the Water Act which has already been passed this session, and from that can flow a whole sequence of errors. We do not want errors; we want certainty. We want a person who is going in for weather modification to know exactly to which Minister and which department he must apply for a licence or a permit. Once the matter has been dealt with, he will then know which Act he is dealing with. If there is an infringement, he will know that the prosecutor will be in no doubt as to the basis upon which the prosecution will be conducted. He must not be in a position where he can go to court and say: &#x201C;I have been charged under the wrong Act. I plead not guilty because I have been wrongly charged under the wrong authority and the wrong Act.&#x201D; This is what is worrying us, Mr. Chairman, in regard to this definition. As I have said, it is not the same as the definition in the other Act which has already been passed.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, in the absence of the hon. member for South Coast the other day I paid tribute to the work done by him and other members of the Select Committee in connection with the Water Act. I also said that I wanted to thank him and the hon. member for Piketberg and the other members of the Select Committee for the assistance they gave me in bringing this Bill before the House, because the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs and the hon. the Minister of Transport held conflicting ideas.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast knows that the Weather Bureau falls under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Transport and not under the Minister of Water Affairs, and he knows that the Water Act deals with the results of weather modification upon the flow of water, subterranean water, etc. That being so, we had to draw up a measure which would be administered by the Minister of Transport, under whom the Weather Bureau falls, but in conjunction with the Minister of Water Affairs, with the necessary agreement between the two of them as far as the appointment of the advisory committee is concerned. Sir, the definitions do overlap, but they can clearly be distinguished by the exclusion, namely any modification of precipitation, in the Water Act&#x2014;the same exclusion holds good for the Water Act in so far as this Bill is concerned. Should, in prosecution cases, there be any doubt, the person charged can be charged in the alternative, or he can be charged under either or both Acts, and I think the solution would be that if a person does oppose the Minister, or is summonsed, it should be done in the alternative to both Acts until we have this Act properly administered and see whether a change should be necessary. As the hon. member for South Coast knows, we think it is urgently necessary that we should at least have an Act whereby we could have control from now on. In future, in the light of experience, we may come along with a further amendment.</p>

<p>Sir, could I just ask for a clarification of the procedure? People wanting to undertake weather modification are going to have to approach either the hon. the Deputy Minister of Transport or the Minister of Water Affairs. They are free to approach either. An application will have to be made, and this will be made to the joint committee which will be established by the two departments by delegation to two officials.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, later on, under another clause, I want to point out to the hon. the Deputy Minister that there is a difference between the penalty under the Water Act and the penalty under this Bill, in clause 12. The point that worries me about a prosecution is this. You know, Sir, how clever lawyers can be. What is going to happen when they come to distinguish <span class="col_8289-8290" refersTo="page_1099"/>between &#x201C;a modification of the natural occurrence of atmospheric precipitation&#x201D; and &#x201C;the artificial promoting, accelerating, increasing, aggravating, impeding, suppressing, retarding or altering of the natural occurrence of rain&#x201D;? In the Select Committee we agreed that it was urgently necessary to get this thing on to the Statute Book so that people should not have trouble as a result of unqualified, inexperienced people undertaking this sort of work. But we do feel that in these two measures there is the danger of our falling between two stools. I asked the hon. the Deputy Minister at the Second Reading whether he would not consider referring this back again to the law advisers to find out whether it would not be advisable to have merely the one body which is going to exercise control so that there can be no danger of any difference of interpretation. I think it is a real danger.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>I am once again very glad that the hon. member said that they as a Select Committee all realized the necessity of having an Act so that one may exercise control. This whole House realizes that. Secondly, I am happy to know that the House also realizes that the Weather Bureau, which exercises control over modification, research, etc., falls under the department of the Minister of Transport, and that it is inconceivable that one can place the Department of Transport under the jurisdiction of another Minister as far as a certain branch of its work is concerned. That is why it is essential that the Minister of Transport with the Department of Transport should make the necessary arrangements in regard to weather modification, especially with regard to what is done in the air, not what is done on the ground. What is done on the ground, whether it be water works, contours for draining water, boring or whatever, falls under the Minister of Water Affairs. Before the Committee Stage is taken in the Other Place, I am prepared to discuss this matter with the law advisers once again to find out whether they are of the opinion that an amendment should be effected in this regard. But hon. members must realize that we should not, in this stage, amend the Act in such a way that we shall not be able to exercise the necessary control. I am glad the hon. member agrees with me. We do have the problem that we are dealing with two departments here and that an application may be lodged either with the one or with the other Minister. There is also the possibility that control may be exercised either under one Act or under the other Act. The hon. member rightly said that lawyers are sometimes difficult people; they are always looking for loopholes; that is correct. Nevertheless, we are at the initial stage of a new development here, a development which may already have adversely affected certain parties and over which we will now have to exercise control. I want to give hon. members on that side the undertaking that if we come up against the problems to which they referred here, I shall come back to this House with the necessary amendments.</p>

<p>Clause put and agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 12:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I have some difficulty with this particular clause, and that is that there is a difference between the penalties provided for in this measure and the penalties imposed under the Bill which we passed in the Select Committee on the Water Amendment Bill. The provisions of the two measures are the same in the case of a first contravention, but in the case of a second contravention, where a person has been convicted of a first offence against the provisions of the Act &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>That is subclause (2).</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>No, Sir, it is at the top of page 7, where provision is made for a fine of not less than R500 or imprisonment for a period of not less than three months. In the Water Amendment Bill which we passed the provision related to section 172 of the Water Act, where any person who is convicted of an offence shall be liable to a certain fine and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine of not less than R500 or to imprisonment for a period of not less than six months. There is therefore a distinction here between this Bill and the Bill submitted by the Select Committee in connection with the Water Act in that the Select Committee recommended a period of imprisonment of six months whereas the Bill now before us makes provision for a period of imprisonment of three months. I think the penalty of imprisonment in respect of a second or subsequent <span class="col_8291-8292" refersTo="page_1100"/>conviction should be the same in both cases, i.e. six months.</p>

<p>Time.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister has referred to the fact, a fact which has been confirmed by the hon. member for Mooi River, that he was desirous of getting this Bill on the Statute Book. In this we are willing to assist him. The fact that the legislation which was piloted through this House earlier on by the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs impinges upon interests of the Department of Transport, is well known to the hon. the Deputy Minister. Everybody has so far assisted in an endeavour to iron these difficulties out. In fact, I have already paid tribute to the officials concerned in both departments who assisted the hon. the Deputy Minister and the Select Committee not only to get out of our difficulties but also to pave the way for the smooth passage of the Bill piloted through by the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs and now also this Bill.</p>

<p>We have no intention of delaying the passage of this Bill through the House, witness of which is the willingness of the Chief Whip on our side to allow the hon. the Deputy Minister also to take the Third Reading now. In that way we want to speed up the passage of this Bill, which to our minds is necessary.</p>

<p>The point the hon. member for Mooi River has raised in regard to clause 12, i.e. the question of penalties, and the point I have raised in regard to the term &#x201C;Eastern Caprivi Zipfel&#x201D;, have been raised not because we are trying to create difficulties, but merely because we are trying to foresee the possibility of difficulties arising, difficulties which could appropriately be tackled if not here, then in the Other Place. We do not necessarily expect the hon. the Deputy Minister to deal with these points here on the spot but we have given him the opportunity to examine the position with his officials and to put things right in the Other Place. I am only concerned about having a workable measure, a workmanlike measure, so that we shall not have any cause for regrets afterwards on account of the fact that the difficulties which we foresee can eventually result in a person who is guilty of some contravention of the provisions of this Bill, or of the Bill already piloted through this House by the Minister of Water Affairs, escaping the penalty of his wrongdoing.</p>

<p>We believe that the other measure is watertight and we want this Bill to be watertight too. Ultimately it rests with the Deputy Minister and with the Government to decide whether they believe that the cause of weather modification will best be served by having two separate legislative enactments remaining constantly side by side on the Statute Book, or whether the <span class="col_8293-8294" refersTo="page_1101"/>cause of weather modification cannot be best served by repealing both enactments and coming forward with an all-embracing measure at some later stage&#x2014;next year or the year after, or whenever the case may be. We believe that weather modification&#x2014; here we agree entirely with the Deputy Minister&#x2014;is now in its infancy. This is the time to deal with it and to take the necessary measures to prevent abuse of scientific processes which, put into the hand of inexperienced men, can result in grave damage being done to people and to our country. The time for control to be exercised is now, before the thing gets out of hand. That we accept, and that we agree on entirely. Whether it may be possible hereafter, when the two departments concerned have had the opportunity of studying the two enactments quite objectively and in cold blood, to see whether in fact the cause of weather modification will not be better served by having one enactment, is a matter which we must leave in the hands of the hon. the Deputy Minister. It is not within the power of the Opposition to say what should or what should not be done in that regard. We do believe, however, that the inconsistencies between the two enactments point to the danger of having two separate enactments of this kind. The whole question of weather modification is of such importance and stretches far beyond the limits of this Bill and far beyond the limits of the Act. With every year that passes, with new scientific developments taking place, with new natural laws being examined a bit further, the further we go, the more do we believe that an all-embracing measure can probably go, even today, a good deal further than what is embodied in the measure already passed and the one that is before us this afternoon.</p>

<p>This we will have to leave in the hands of the hon. the Deputy Minister and the Government. There is going to be no hurry once this is placed on the Statute Book. There will be the initial control and from that point we go forward. I can assure the hon. the Deputy Minister that if they come with an all-embracing measure in which matters are tightened up and provision is made to meet the scientific achievements which our scientists are making month by month in regard to so many aspects, not only of weather modification, but of natural forces that can have a bearing on weather modification, he can rely upon the help of this side of the House to see that such a measure in the interests of South Africa is placed on the Statute Book with a minimum of delay and hindrance. But, Sir, may I also say to the hon. the Deputy Minister I hope that when that time comes he will agree once more to send the Bill to a Select Committee before its Second Reading because, surely, the lesson we have learnt this time will show to the hon. the Deputy Minister that that was a very wise step to take and that it should be repeated in future where a delicate subject of this kind is concerned.</p>

<p>As regards this legislation relating to weather modification or change, I think it is necessary for us to pay some attention to the legal consequences of such action in cases where permits are granted for modifying or changing the weather either to increase or to reduce the rainfall or to modify the pattern of rainfall. I think that, as a matter of interest, I should just point out that in the United States, where this matter is still in a purely experimental stage, quite a number of interesting court cases are in progress. There is one court case which has probably been going on for a decade now. A number of farmers who wanted to market cherries did not require rain at that given moment, for if it rained, the cherry fruit would burst open and this would harm the quality. Not far from that place there were a number of farmers whose wheat was on the point of ripening. These farmers wanted rain at that stage. The cherry farmers then employed a certain company to reduce the rainfall as they did not want any rain to fall on the cherry trees. However, the wheat farmers on the other side of the ridges got another company to make rain for them, because if they could get some rain at that stage, the bushel weight of the wheat would be far greater.</p>

<p>How does one reduce rainfall?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#greyling">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>It is only the knowledgeable people who can speak about these matters. Then each of the two companies carried out their instructions and the company that won was the one that made rain, in other words, the one that had been commissioned by the wheat farmers. According to my information, that court case has been going on for ten years now. Then there are other cases that have been pending since 1966, cases that have therefore not yet been finalized. <span class="col_8295-8296" refersTo="page_1102"/>I think we should take note of the important fact that this legislation is not the alpha and the omega of what we may expect in the future. This legislation is a highly experimental attempt by means of which we are trying to achieve some control. I want to make a prediction today. We in South Africa are also going to have many court cases arising out of rainmaking. There is no doubt about that.</p>

<p>The second thing I want to say in regard to this matter is something of a more general nature. Having accepted this legislation in principle, we must also accept that we are dealing with an experimental matter here. I cannot emphasize the word &#x201C;experimental&#x201D; enough. In the whole world there is not one single country which has even started to penetrate the surface as far as weather modifications are concerned. If one changes or interferes with one component in the water cycle, it must necessarily affect some other component which has an equally great effect on the water cycle. When I speak about a water cycle, I mean the cycle from the point at which water evaporates from the ocean under certain temperature and pressure conditions. Through advection this water is then borne from the oceans to the continents, to the land mass. Under certain pressure and temperature conditions the water vapour develops a natural tendency to rise. This water vapour subsequently condenses and splashes down from the clouds on to the earth in the form of precipitation. During this process of precipitation, there is a loss of water as a result of evaporation. For the sake of interest, I may just mention that on the basis of certain experiments conducted in Mexico the following findings were made. The evaporation of water from a thunder cloud, since the water leaves the cloud until it reaches the ground, was, under certain temperature conditions, found to be four times as great as the amount of water reaching the ground. The water only starts falling to the ground when its weight is so great that it is attracted by gravity and pours down. Any attempt made by us to bring about a change in the water cycle from the time the water vapour leaves the ocean until it reaches the ground in the form of rain and again ends up in the ocean as run-off water&#x2014;for the information of the hon. member for Orange Grove, that is the water cycle&#x2014;any such attempt we make by means of the milking of clouds, the seeding of clouds or any other scientific method to create an artificial change in this water cycle, should be accompanied by great caution, yes, extreme caution, because we do not know yet what effect interfering with one component in this cycle will have on the other components. We do not know yet; science does not know yet.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that we should therefore be extremely careful. May this Bill lead to this first step guiding us to greater wisdom in the future as we are guided in the future by experiments undertaken and methods applied by man.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have a note here that I should like to bring to the attention of the hon. members for Mooi River and South Coast. My department says that the penal provisions in this Bill are exactly the same as those in the Water Act. That is what the department says, but I shall also take a look at the matter at a later stage.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the penal provisions are exactly the same.</p>

<p>As far as this matter is concerned, I do not want to venture into the field of science. I think that was done very effectively by the hon. member for Bethlehem the other day. However, I want to give the hon. member for Carletonville the assurance that we are engaged in research. As no research was undertaken by any bodies in the past, as I said in my Second Reading speech, we had no properly controlled statistical data and hence we had to introduce legislation so that control might be obtained. It is true that one should be very careful, because if one in any way upsets the balance in nature, and not only in the water cycle, problems may possibly arise. The hon. member for South Coast knows that, for example, we upset the balance in the rivers by killing the crocodiles and now we have to breed crocodiles so that the balance may be restored. When man upsets the balance, a chain reaction takes place at some future time, a reaction which may cause problems. Therefore we should be careful.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank the hon. members, especially the hon. members for South Coast and Mooi River, and all the members of the Select Committee, for the assistance rendered by them. It is so <span class="col_8297-8298" refersTo="page_1103"/>that we are only in the infancy of research and we do hope that the scientific achievements derived from this Bill in the future will be to the benefit of South Africa as a whole. I want to assure the hon. member for South Coast that in administering this Bill when it becomes an Act, I shall take cognizance of the suggestions which he made, of the suggestions made by the Select Committee as a whole and also of the doubts that he has expressed in connection with the administration of this Bill. We shall be very careful. I also want to assure him that if we may find it necessary to come back to this House, we shall be able to have an open discussion as this is not a political matter. It is to the benefit of South Africa as a whole.</p>

<heading>RAILWAY CONSTRUCTION BILL</heading>

<summary>(Committee Stage)</summary>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, at this stage we have already accepted the principle of building this particular railway line. The replies given by the hon. the Minister were not very satisfactory and after a close inspection and an examination over the weekend, of the course this railway is going to take, I realize that much more time should be given to the consideration of the construction of this particular line. I am now speaking about the line from the Table Bay harbour extension to a junction on the Kensington-Chempet line. Reference is made to this line in the First Schedule of the Bill. What will the effect of this railway line be? It is not just the building of a link from the new Cape Town harbour to the main line and eventually to Bellville. It is a double, electrified line and is going to be used for the conveyance of large quantities of goods from the harbour. As a matter of fact, I think the planning, allowing for only two tracks, is ridiculous. We all know that a third or fourth line might be necessary in the future, and I think that now is the time to plan for it. The extension of Table Bay harbour is very extensive and the tonnage expected to be handled by this harbour will exceed the tonnage handled by the present harbour at the moment. Through this extension the harbour is going to be enlarged considerably.</p>

<p>I would like to get back to the point and discuss the effects of this line. In his usual casual way the Minister brushed away the question of putting this line through a covered cutting to avoid the break-up of the urban area. In this regard I would like to refer to other examples in this country. I think the Minister will know the line between Pretoria and Silverton. Where at tremendous cost the process had to be reversed. That line used to run on the surface, which resulted in a large number of level crossings. This line divided up the urban section of Pretoria to a large degree. At tremendous cost to the Government that line was sunk, and this has made a terrific difference. As a matter of fact, today the one-time division of that part of Pretoria has almost totally disappeared. The same thing could happen here. I am not particularly worried about the water. The hon. the Minister might not know this, but there are quite a number of railway lines overseas which actually run under rivers. Water is therefore not a great difficulty today. I am fairly certain that the railway line leaving the harbour could probably be rerouted to greater effect by putting it into a covered cutting similar to the crossing planned at the airfield at Ysterplaat and then joining it up with the main line. If the engineer&#x2019;s report is correct, and I have no doubt it is, one realizes that the extra cost cannot be so high. In giving the topography of this area, the following is stated:</p>

<block name="quote">The terrain between the Kensington-Chempet line and the coast consists of sandy flats and the first portion is undeveloped. with pans which usually contain water during the winter months. The area near Ysterplaat Air Force Base is partly covered by Port Jackson trees. The area between Otto du Plessis Drive and the coast is marshy and is now largely drained by the Salt River canal. The foreshore is covered by low sand dunes with occasional low-lying outcrops.</block>

<p>I do not think there is any great hurry about building this line. The report says it is going to take four years to complete. The necessity may arise at a later stage to extend it. I wonder whether the Minister should not hold up the project and have another look at it. He could devise a line where we could have a couple of extra tracks, a line which could be sunk. I am <span class="col_8299-8300" refersTo="page_1104"/>fairly certain the outlook of his department towards this line is: &#x201C;Well, we just link it through, even if we have to take down a few houses. But we stick it under the airfield, because we do not want the aeroplanes to run into the trains.&#x201D; I think that is the way it was looked at by the Minister. But we want something different in Cape Town. We want to see this line disappear underground if they want to build it there. It could be done quite easily. The day of the underground railway in this country is coming rapidly. It has been done in other parts of the country. I can remember the position of the old famous Jeppes crossing when I was a schoolboy, and how they had to sink the line there. Public opinion forced them to do it, at terrific cost. I would like to make an appeal to the hon. the Deputy Minister. He is spending R9 million on this particular line. It is going to take four years to build. I suggest to him to have another look at it. I think he has plenty of time to do so. I feel, first of all, that two tracks are insufficient. I am fairly certain that they will find, in time to come, that they will at least need four tracks out of the Cape Town docks area when the present dock is extended. I think this is the time the Deputy Minister should start planning for that. He should acquire the ground and build the line accordingly. That is my appeal to the hon. the Deputy Minister at this stage.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to tell the hon. member for Salt River in the first place that it is not necessary for him to try to lecture me on underground railway lines. It so happens that my eldest brother built the first underground line in Johannesburg, the one which leaves the Eloff extension. In other words, I am quite familiar with the problems and also with the advantages of underground railway lines. I pointed out to hon. members in the Second Reading debate that a very thorough investigation had been conducted by the planning engineer, that four alternative routes had been planned, and that a calculation of expenses had been drawn up for all four of these various alternative routes. I also pointed out in the Second Reading debate that where the line passes the runway of the air force base, it is almost flush with the ground. But I also pointed out to hon. members that this is a railway line to serve the harbour. Besides, the harbour lies on the level, above sea level. I gave hon. members the assurance that these various aspects had been examined, also in the light of the interview which we granted the hon. member for Maitland and his delegation. I want to tell hon. members that it is not true that the Minister simply said that 40 houses would have to be taken down, and &#x201C;so what&#x201D;. That is not the case. I want to give this Committee the assurance that this Minister is very concerned about housing in South Africa. I know this from other actions of his in regard to the provision of funds for housing, etc. Where we can save houses, this will be done. Our engineers have investigated the matter thoroughly. They are among the best engineers in South Africa and they are equal to any in the world. They told us, in regard to the cost structure, &#x201C;This is the line&#x201D;. Since it has also been examined by the Railway Board the Minister has no option but to accept this line.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it does one&#x2019;s heart good to hear that the hon. the Deputy Minister has proper experience of underground trains. He has also told us that the matter has been very thoroughly investigated. I accept this, and I should not like to say that the Railway Administration and its engineers have not investigated the matter. But I think that a fact which the hon. the Deputy Minister should not lose sight of is that the investigation always takes place on the basis of the cost.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Of course.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The Deputy Minister will remember that he was told by the deputation which came to see him that he should be careful not to think of the cost alone when we are dealing with a matter which affects such an important neighbourhood so radically. The hon. the Deputy Minister told us that the line was already going to be covered to a certain extent and that the line was going to be underground. But where is it going to be underground? The line will be underground where it passes the airport. But where the line goes through the residential area, and where it really causes alarm, it is going to run through an open cutting, as it were. The matter put to the hon. the Deputy Minister by the hon. member for Salt River is very reasonable. Let us take a good look at the matter now. That railway line from the new harbour extension runs along <span class="col_8301-8302" refersTo="page_1105"/>the coast for almost a mile. Then there is an elbow turn where the line turns in the direction of the air-field; the hon. the Deputy Minister knows this. There is no reason whatsoever why the line, after having left the harbour area, cannot sink slowly where it runs along the coast for almost a mile, so that when it reaches the residential area it will be almost underground. As soon as the line is then underground, it should be covered. A road could be built over it, for example. Why should the train be above the ground when it goes through the residential areas? It may cost more; it may cost R1 million more, but the Deputy Minister will have to be the first to recognize that even if it should cost R1 million more to remove that alarm of the people in that residential area, it would be worth-while. It would at least show the residents of that area that the Minister tried. At the moment the cost of this railway line amounts to R9 million. Would it really make such a difference if it should cost R11 million or R12 million? We must remember that it is a line which will not be there for today and tomorrow only.</p>

<from>*Mr <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Deputy Minister must not tempt me. I have a very good reply to him, but I suppose it is not appropriate here in the Committee Stage. Let me return to my point. I believe that the hon. the Deputy Minister should do his very best and should perhaps reconsider the matter in an attempt to get this railway line underground as far as possible. If this can be done, it should then be covered so that the new roads extension which is being planned by the Provincial Administration and the Cape Town City Council could pass over the covered railway line. This would prevent that line from always being a source of irritation in that neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Clause put and agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 3:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause provides the following, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<p>In respect of the construction and equipment of the said lines of railway the State President shall have the powers conferred by the Railway Expropriation Act, 1955 &#x2026;</p>

<p>I consulted this Act and it appears that the Railways will be obliged in terms of the Expropriation Act to pay these people a price for their properties, for their houses, which shall not exceed the market value, in ordinary language. This is the price which a willing seller is prepared to accept from a willing buyer. I want to put in a plea to the hon. the Deputy Minister in this regard. The construction of this railway line has been accepted in principle. I want to plead that when this expropriation takes place, the hon. the Deputy Minister should stretch that Act just as far as he possible can. We are dealing here with people who in many cases are not of the wealthiest. These are people who attach more importance to a house and to whom a house means more than just accommodation. To these people it is a place to live and I should like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister to stretch to the utmost the elasticity of the Act, if such a thing exists.</p>

<p>The clause goes on to say that the width of the land taken for each line shall not exceed 35 metres. Where we are dealing here with a double railway line, does this mean that it is regarded as two railway lines for the purposes of the Bill? If this is in fact the case, it means that together the two lines would occupy a width of almost 70 metres, and surely that cannot be. I take it that it will be 35 metres for the double line?</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to tell the hon. member for Maitland that it is the policy that the Government under no circumstances enriches itself at the expense of the individual. In other words, the Government is obliged to pay the individual his full value. But the hon. member for Maitland and the Committee will also agree with me that we are the treasurers of the money of the taxpayers of South Africa, and as treasurers it is also our responsible task to see to it that the funds of the Railways and the funds of the taxpayers are spent in an absolutely economic <span class="col_8303-8304" refersTo="page_1106"/>way. It must be spent in the best economic way. [Interjections.] No, it is not pennywise, pound foolish. I repeat: The Government will not enrich itself at the expense of the individual, but the Government cannot allow the Opposition or the Auditor-General to charge the Government tomorrow or the day after with having favoured certain people with public funds. Therefore the matter must be dealt with on an economic level. We shall take into consideration what the hon. member said. We know that people are being displaced and we shall take it into consideration.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is not our suggestion that Government money should be wasted. The position is that we are not building this line for today or for tomorrow; we are building it for the future. I take it that in the planning there was some sort of forecast of what the line would carry and what its costs would be. Costs will increase in future, and we can surely not build another line like this. Surely all this was included in the estimated costs. It must have been included.</p>

<p>It does not appear on the Estimates. The Estimates only contain the cost of the building of the line. When we appeal to the hon. the Deputy Minister to think not only of today and tomorrow, but to look to the future, we are not trying to waste the Government&#x2019;s money, but to save it, because if this line has to be improved&#x2014;and public opinion will force him to provide something better&#x2014;then it will cost very much more than at the present time. That is all we are asking. We are trying to save the Government money by looking to the future. We know this area, and all we are asking the hon. the Deputy Minister is to look a bit further ahead than he is at the moment.</p>

<p>Sir, it is now very clear to me why the official Opposition is opposing and disputing the activities of the Department of Planning. It is clear to me that we are dealing with an official Opposition which is completely opposed to the implementation of the Physical Planning Act. In other words, they are opposed to the decentralisation of industries. We are dealing with an Opposition that is opposed to group area development; we are dealing with an Opposition that last week broke a solemn agreement with their political antics in connection with the 1936 legislation. I could never understand in the past how the official Opposition could oppose an Act like the Physical Planning Act and the Natural Resources Development Act, but now it is clear to me, and the official Opposition owes it to this House and to the public to say where they stand as far as the future geographic, demographic and economic development of the Republic is concerned. It is a foregone conclusion, as far as I am concerned, that this official Opposition is working towards economic integration; that they are obsessed by that concept and by the policy of this side, i.e. the right to self-determination for the various peoples with the preservation of their own identities.</p>

<p>On Friday the main speaker on the Opposition side, the hon. member for Hillbrow. attacked this Government because the growth rate last year was not up to expectations. Everyone acknowledged frankly that our real growth rate last year was not the growth we would have liked to have and have had in the past. The hon. member now suddenly holds it against the hon. the Minister and his department because our growth rate last year was not as high as indicated by the projection of the economic development programme. In recent years we have had a greater real growth for South Africa than the economic development programme had planned. That was the only year the hon. member can mention in which our real growth was below 5,5 per cent, and there are good reasons for this, reasons beyond our control. The hon. member is fully aware that on an international level we were up against an economic set-up that has caused trouble, not only in South Africa, but also in America, England and all the big Western countries. He is fully aware that we were up against an overheated economy. He is fully aware that we were up against the problem of the creation of capital in the Republic. The hon. member blamed us for the ostensible overspending by the State. That was one of our big problems, but with the big growth that took place in South Africa there had to be large capital expenditure, but in this year&#x2019;s Budget capital expenditure is being drastically restricted because we believe that the services that have already been established will be able to provide for the needs of the development that is now taking place. Sir, what is the true position? The true position is that decentralization is a foregone conclusion as far as this side of the House is concerned. This side of the House believes that economically the Republic of South Africa must grow as rapidly as possible. We believe in a vital economy that can furnish the State with sufficient revenue with a view to its gigantic development plans in the years ahead.</p>

<p>Today I want to concentrate on one section within the framework of the policy of the National Party, i.e. the development of the relative growth points.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon member for Hillbrow that this is a growth point of a decentralized area bordering on the homeland. I want to refer to the conduct of the hon. member for Hillbrow last Thursday and to that of the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens and the hon. member for Port Natal. I say unequivocally today that the hon. member for Port Natal is plainly opposed to group areas. With reference to this hon. member&#x2019;s speech last Friday, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition must say whether his party still believes in group areas. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central expressed an idea that I never thought would be allowed by the official Opposition. He said the hon. the Minister should allow more Bantu into the Port Elizabeth area so that in bargaining with the Coloureds, with respect to salaries and wages, they would have the whip-hand to keep the Coloureds&#x2019; salaries and wages in check. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central knows nothing whatsoever about labour legislation. Bargaining takes place on a productivity basis. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central, however, lodges a plea for the Department of Planning to allow more Bantu, thereby to keep the Coloureds&#x2019; wage demands in check. This <span class="col_8307-8308" refersTo="page_1108"/>hon. Opposition can use the same machinery when they come into power, i.e. they can use Bantu labour against the White worker in South Africa. I am convinced that their whole basic approach is one of economic integration and the exploitation of the workers of South Africa.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. BODENSTEIN</person>:</from>

<p>As far as the group areas are concerned, I am coming along today with tangible proof, and for the first time in many years I am proudly using my own constituency as an example. Rustenburg is one of the growth points, and in that connection I want to pay tribute to the hon. the Minister, his secretary and the department. If one were to look at the physical planning of this border industry area and take note of the purposefulness and farsightedness with which the democratic set-up of this industrial area has been planned, the physical planning and co-ordination between this department, the Department of Transport, the South African Railways and the Department of Bantu Administration, one would find it to be a model example. This industrial area borders on a Bantu township. There are no transport problems. It is linked to the broad framework of group areas and is connected to the town by way of an access road. Sections of railway are already being built. What is nice is that in the Budget an amount of no less than R1,7 million is being loaned this year to the local authority at an interest rate that is so reasonable that it can serve as an encouragement to any local authority to tackle similar projects with daring. What is the position? The local authority has been activated by this relevant department to the extent that certain services are being underaken by the local authority itself to bring about a saving. The hon. Opposition has no contact with the platteland of the Republic of South Africa any longer, the &#x201C;deep platteland&#x201D; as their secretary calls it. They were deeply perturbed about the restrictions affecting the platinum mine, when the workers had to leave for the cities. They were happy in the platteland atmosphere because careful and precise care is taken there of educational facilities and all kinds of social facilities that are essential to a happy community. The concept of backward areas no longer exists today. They are completely out of tune with the rural frame of mind. I courteously want to ask the hon. the Minister a question. This development is going to be a gigantic success; there is no question about that. It is going to be a great development; that industrial area is going to be one of the biggest industrial areas and is largely going to contribute to the economic viability of our country. The economic development in the Rustenburg growth point will be a powerful support for our industrial development. Since at this stage, throughout the Republic, we are dealing with environmental pollution due to mistakes or due to rapid development in the past, since we are faced with air pollution, environmental pollution and all the accompanying problems in the metropolitan areas, I courteously want to ask the hon. the Minister for the closest co-operation with the relevant industrialists who will be transferring to Rustenburg and erecting their buildings there, for this evil to be prevented. I want to ask for timely planning to combat air pollution and environmental pollution. I want to ask that work be done along these lines because Rustenburg&#x2019;s natural scenery cannot be surpassed. I want a happy community there that can fully accept the challenge of the future and make a success of it. I want to conclude by making a serious though urgent appeal to the official Opposition to stop sowing suspicion against the decentralization of industries. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Rustenburg has spoken about the application of the Physical Planning Act. He knows why we oppose that Act. We did not oppose the principle of the Act, but we opposed certain of its provisions and particularly we opposed the manner in which we knew the Government would apply it. I want to say that our opposition has been completely justified by the manner in which this Government has in fact applied that Act. I want to ask ffie hon. member for Rustenburg and his Minister why the Government does not want to create, growth points within the Bantu areas. What are they afraid of? Why do they not want to listen to the advice which has so often been given to them by this side of the House? Let us develop those growth points inside the Bantu areas and let us forget and get away from the ideological idea of developing only in border areas.</p>

<p><span class="col_8309-8310" refersTo="page_1109"/>I am sure that hon. members have heard enough about this from other members on this side of the House during the debate on Friday. Therefore I want to come back to the point where the hon. the Minister left off on Friday afternoon. He was dealing with the question of the proclamation of Stockville Valley, which falls within my constituency. I want to say that I welcome the statement which was made by the Minister on Friday. I want to congratulate him at least on having been honest, which is something we cannot always say about replies that come from that side of the House.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>No, it is not a question of manners, and I say that with all respect to the hon. the Minister of Sport and Recreation. He even went so far as to say that perhaps in the past their planning has been on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. He went on to say, &#x201C;We are now moving in the direction where we hope to lay down guide lines for the future&#x201D;. This is why we congratulate him on that, but I want to ask him particularly to reconsider the question regarding Stockville. He has indicated that he did not know, and that he was not aware of, the true facts when this proclamation was made. He has indicated that he still does not know all the facts as far as Stockville is concerned. This is so particularly when we look at the replies to the questions which were asked of the hon. the Minister by the hon. member for Pinetown on 23rd May. He cannot even tell us how many people there are and what they are producing approximately. When the Minister replied he said that there were approximately 200 families, but I want to say that there are 400 families and not 200. The Minister shrugs his shoulders. This is the point. When the hon. member for Pinetown asked him further where he is going to resettle these people, he said that it was not his baby, but who plans these areas for people? Surely, when the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s board considers the zoning of an area, it considers what it is going to do with the people who are resident there at the time. As was pointed out by my hon. friend from Pinetown, by interjection while the Minister was speaking, there are no Coloureds in Stockville today. The Minister has been ill-advised, or the department has, when he said that Stockville is the logical extension of the Mariannhill area. I want to say that it is a dead-end and the hon. the Minister in his own explanation expained that this was a dead-end and that this runs up against this vast kranz which is on the edge of a White area. The logical extension of the Mariannhill area is up the valley and not into the Stockville valley, which is a deadend. It is therefore entirely unnecessary for him to move these people, and he still cannot tell us where he is going to move them. Is he making provision for alternative farmland for every one of those people? When I tackled the hon. the Minister and the members of his board about this before, he always replied blindly that alternative farmland was made available for farmers who were displaced. But today I want to ask him especially: Where will alternative farmland be made available for these people? We asked him if he knew how much produce was produced there. He does not know. What sort of planning is this that he does not even know what is being produced in an area when he removes the people from it? That valley produces 80 per cent of the fresh flowers which are sold in Durban&#x2019;s Indian Market; it produces 20 per cent of the vegetables and 20 per cent of the fruit which are sold in the Indian Market in Durban. We have a completely viable community there. However, he says that he was not aware of all the facts when he signed the proclamation.</p>

<p>I want to appeal to him today: Will he please make himself aware of all the facts? He did intimate that he might even pay a visit to Stockville. I appeal to him to reconsider the position when he returns to Pretoria. I ask him in all seriousness and in all kindness to personally pay a visit to Stockville valley, and to undertake to meet the hon. member for Pinetown and myself who share that particular area and <span class="col_8311-8312" refersTo="page_1110"/>reconsider the whole question of Stockville. I do not believe that he will be setting a precedent by doing it, particularly if he deproclaims it, because, as I have mentioned before, this is something which happens quite regularly, notwithstanding the statement he has made that this only happens under exceptional circumstances. I believe that exceptional circumstances do exist as far as Stockville is concerned, the most important of which being the fact that he has been misled by his board.</p>

<p>Above all, I want to urge the hon. the Minister that he should make this visit soon, early. This must be done soon to remove the uncertainty which exists over those Indian people who are resident there today. These are Indian people who, on their own initiative, collected R10 000 which was subsidized by the Government through the Department of Indian Affairs, and established their own school. They did this with the R10 000 which they collected. This is a community which has put its roots down and which has settled, but they are now merely being torn up and moved nobody knows where.</p>

<p>I must draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to a statement made by his colleague, the hon. the Minister of Community Development, which appeared in a newspaper on Saturday under the headlines: &#x201C;Stockville reprieve for Indians&#x201D;. The hon. the Minister of Community Development said that he would shelve the resettlement scheme for the time being. This is not enough for these people and I think that the comment of Mr. Rajab, with whom I do not always agree I admit, is valid in this case. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That docs not help us much. We have already been under the fear of eviction since 1966. We need to know one way or the other. Do we go or do we stay, and if we go, will the Government give us farming land somewhere else?</block>

<p>These are the questions which I believe the hon. the Minister must answer now. He owes it to the people of Stockville.</p>

<p>I mentioned the question of deproclamation of group areas. Once again I should like to draw the attention of both these hon. Ministers who are here&#x2014;I am very glad that they are here&#x2014;to a Press statement that they issued on 3rd February, 1971. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The statement purported to be made by Mr. Webber is devoid of all truth and does not in any way reflect Government policy.</block>

<p>What was the statement that I had made? The statement which I had made was that these communities were going to be moved and that no Indians or Coloureds living even in proclaimed group areas were certain that they would be left there.</p>

<p>I made the statement because I was aware of all the areas which had been deproclaimed and reproclaimed. When I pointed out to the hon. the Minister of Planning last year that 51 had already been deproclaimed, he queried my figures, but I based my figures on answers to questions which he and his department had supplied in this House. I have subsequently put other questions and I find now that not only 51, but 63 proclaimed group areas and portions of group areas have subsequently been deproclaimed, 12 in the last two years. I sincerely hope that there were exceptional circumstances which prevailed at the time justifying the deproclamation of those areas. What do we find in the report of the department? We find that on 30th June, 1971, there were still 17 more group areas being investigated, as to whether or not they should be deproclaimed. I wonder if the hon. the Minister can tell us what exceptional circumstances exist to justify the investigation of a further 17 after 63 have already been deproclaimed, and if he will also tell us for which groups those 17 areas have been proclaimed.

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District, who has just resumed his seat, said that the Minister had now reached a &#x201C;dead-end&#x201D;. I want to tell him that no one is closer to a &#x201C;dead-end&#x201D; than the United Party. Even their <i>Sunday Times</i> states that they have reached a &#x201C;dead-end&#x201D; because as far as their policy is concerned they disagree within their own ranks about what they want and what they do not want. In this debate Opposition speakers mentioned that they are opposed to the Physical Planning Act, a measure <span class="col_8313-8314" refersTo="page_1111"/>controlling the over-concentration of industries and the over-concentration of the various population groups. They also intimated their opposition to the Group Areas Act, an Act that regulates the residential areas for the various population groups. In addition they intimated that they are opposed to the Industrial Conciliation Act, an Act protecting the White workers and the non-White workers. This attests to shortsightedness because of the materialism these people advocate and their integrationist desires. We know this is a short-term policy. <i>Inter alia,</i> they also say that these Acts have not succeeded in their objects. I just want to assure hon. members opposite that this is nothing but wishful thinking.</p>

<p>The question now is what the Opposition is offering and how they are going to solve these questions in a multi-national country like South Africa. In other countries of the world decentralization is the correct thing. In countries with a homogeneous population decentralization is in order. However, when it comes to South Africa, where we have a heterogeneous population, this is not the case; according to the Opposition it is wrong.</p>

<p>One of the most important production factors is probably the labour used in the production process. The United Party says the Bantu must be able to sell his labour on the best market. I now want to know from them, if that is so, how they are going to handle influx control. In South Africa attention must increasingly be focused on the influx of the Black man to the White cities. This influx can only be counteracted by factories being shifted to and established at site positions between the places of residences of the White entrepreneurs and those of the Black labourers. This meeting ground of common interests must be kept, as far as possible, outside the centre of the Black cities. The reasons for that are obvious. We can mention reasons, such as the distribution of production factors, which are essential, and transport facilities through metropolitan areas to facilitate the transport of Bantu labourers, eliminate points of friction, restrict the presence of Bantu in White cities and to prevent overconcentration of the population. We have in mind traffic problems as well as transport problems. We are thinking of the provision of facilities for Whites in White cities in order to eliminate the problems.</p>

<p>In the valley area to the west of the Apies River we are saddled today with a serious problem in regard to industrial establishment in Pretoria. Section No. 317JR of the farm Sandfontein, which covers 352 ha, was already zoned for industrial purposes in the forties by the Hercules Town Council and was proclaimed in 1960, before the commencement of the Physical Planning Act. The circumstances and position of Sandfontein with respect to Pretoria has changed completely since the Hercules Town Council zoned that area for industrial establishment. This area is situated only five miles from the centre of Pretoria and is equal in area to Rosslyn, if not larger. In 1965 the authorities decided to extend the industrial site at Rosslyn. Let me furnish a few figures from <i>Die Transvaler</i> of 19th May, 1972, to illustrate how Sandfontein will look if we allow industrial establishment there (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">By the end of 1970 the total investment in Rosslyn passed the R63 million mark. At that stage 7 239 Bantu workers were employed there, and they constituted 76 per cent of Rosslyn&#x2019;s total labour force. Today there are 86 factory units in Rosslyn employing more than 11 500 Bantu workers.</block>

<p>Sir, I am mentioning these figures to draw a comparison between the development at Rosslyn and the possible development at Sandfontein. If it were not for this policy I wonder where the 11 500 Bantu with their families would have lived. This would have meant 75 500 more Black people in Pretoria, if we take it that there are five members to each family. Now I want to advocate very seriously to the hon. the Minister that if it is at all possible, serious attention should be given to the Sandfontein industrial area with a view to finding another way out. But if this appears to be impossible one will have to impose very strict control. I want to advocate that care be taken that no industry that does not strictly fall within the White/ Bantu labour relationship, be established there&#x2014;if it is impossible to find another way out with respect to that land. Industries dependent on intensive Bantu labour can definitely not be allowed there.</p>

<p>Then there are many other reasons why industries cannot be established west of the Apies River, <i>inter alia,</i> air pollution. Since the area lies between two series of ridges, <span class="col_8315-8316" refersTo="page_1112"/>the smog is forced downwards. What is more, that land would be very suitable for housing purposes for our lower and middle income groups. My plea is therefore that the Minister should please consider this matter very seriously.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I hope the hon. member for Hercules will excuse me if I do not follow his line of argument; he dealt with local problems. I should like to direct my remarks to the hon. the Minister in his capacity as Minister of Statistics, because I believe that there is very considerable room for improvement in the statistical services which his department renders to South Africa. In saying that, I should like to say that I believe that the shortcomings in our statistical services are probably due mainly to a shortage of staff in the Department of Statistics. I am in no way critical of the efforts of the existing staff, because I believe that they apply themselves to their tasks in a most diligent and skilful manner.</p>

<p>I should like to suggest to the hon. the Minister that it is the delay in the publication of statistics rather than the variety or the content of the statistics themselves that is the main shortcoming as far as our statistical services are concerned, but I do regard this shortcoming as being a very serious one indeed. Statistics are necessarily an historical record of events that have already taken place, but the more historical they become and the more out of date they are, the less value do they have for the people who use them, whereas conversely, the more up to date and the more contemporary our statistics are, the more their value is enhanced for planning, for organizing and for decision-making. I regard up-to-date statistics as being absolutely vital when it comes to making rational decisions on economic and financial matters.</p>

<p>As an indication of what I mean by saying that our statistics are not as up-to-date as I would like to see them, I should like to refer to one of the main publications of the Department of Statistics, namely its Bulletin, which is published once a quarter, and look at a few statistics of the more important indicators published in that bulletin. Published more or less at the same time, also quarterly, is the South African Reserve Bank Quarterly Bulletin which contains many of the same series of statistics, so that one is able to compare the relative &#x201C;up-to-dateness&#x201D; of the statistics of the Department of Statistics with those produced by another of our main sources, namely the Reserve Bank. Let us take the figure of employment in private manufacturing industry. The latest figure available to us in the March Quarterly Bulletin of Statistics is for September, 1971, whereas the Reserve Bank was able to publish a figure, within a week or two of the publication of this figure, which was two months more recent, namely the figures for November, 1971. In regard to imports and exports, the latest figure available in the Bulletin of Statistics is for July, 1971. The Reserve Bank publishes the figures for January, 1972. In other words, the figures in the latter publication refer to a period six months later. These are figures which are, after all, available in the <i>Government Gazette</i> some six weeks after the end of the month to which they refer. Then I come to the value of retail trade. This is a very important indicator of consumer spending. The latest figure available is for August, 1971, whereas the Reserve Bank can give us the figures for October, 1971. In the case of the figures regarding motor trade sales the latest figure available is again for August, 1971; the Reserve Bank publishes the figure for January, 1972, and I may say that this is a figure which is available within a few days after the end of each month, when they are published by the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers. In the case of the index of Stock Exchange shares, the share prices, the latest figure available, believe it or not, is for July, 1971. Yet this is a figure which is published daily by most newspapers, and hourly by some. Finally we have the figure relating to the consumer price index. The latest figure available to us in this Bulletin is for November, 1971, whereas the Reserve Bank has been able to publish a figure two months more recent. Generally speaking, that is the picture in the case of all the statistics. I must repeat that speed is of the essence in statistics, if they are to be valuable. I should like to suggest to the hon. the Minister that he considers bringing the statistics up to date by, for a time, publishing only the latest statistics, and allowing the intervening period to go blank until he has the resources and the staff, or whatever is necessary, to bring the information relating to those intervening months up to date.</p>

<p>I should also like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he is encouraging the statistical council, which is provided for in the Statistics Act, to play its full part. I believe that the statistical council can be a very useful <span class="col_8317-8318" refersTo="page_1113"/>body, providing a useful link between the private sector and Government departments and his Department of Statistics, and advising the Department of Statistics of the requirements not only of the private sector but also of the Government authorities. To be useful, it must function continuously. What did we find last year? We found that the statistical council was not even in being for most of 1971. Its members retired automatically at the end of November, 1970, and no new members were appointed until the latter half of 1971, so that, in effect, the council was not functioning at all for most of last year. I hope, Sir, that the hon. the Minister is not relegating the statistical council to an unimportant role, because I do believe that in the improvement of our statistical services, that council can play a very useful part, and as I have indicated, I believe that there is ample room for such improvement in those services.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. C. VAN WYK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in a few words I want to deal with the Opposition on the basis of the Physical Planning Act. As a result of the pleas lodged during the past week by Mr. Harry Oppenheimer and Mr. Harry Schwartz for better facilities for the urban Bantu, yesterday&#x2019;s <i>Sunday Times</i> clinched the matter by reporting:</p>

<block name="quote">The urban Africans are not going back to the homelands; they are here to stay.</block>

<p>Sir, that is no new standpoint. We are familiar with that standpoint, but I should like to know how the Opposition contemplates planning for one integrated labour force of 20 million people. They have not yet told us that, and it is time they did so. On few occasions do the Opposition&#x2019;s sins catch up with them as easily and do they become as enmeshed in their own snares as in the case of planning. Whether one talks to them about the separation of areas or about the establishment of industries, about manpower, labour arrangements or about economic planning, one is talking over their heads, for the simple reason that they ignore one basic fact of life, i.e. that there are no two peoples that are alike. This deprives them of the ability to distinguish; it deprives them of their understanding of, not to mention appreciation for, that which is one&#x2019;s own. Take the Physical Planning Act, an Act which in South Africa&#x2019;s circumstances is the proper instrument, not only for orderly planning, but also to allow for justice and fairness to all national groups. There is no other Act about which so many ugly remarks have been made as about this Physical Planning Act. It has been presented as an Act allegedly placing dictatorial powers in the hands of the Minister; as an Act allegedly based on Draconian principles and ruinous ideological foundations. It has even been said of this Act that in its use we are adopting a &#x201C;suicide course&#x201D;. I am sure that if I were to ask them today whether they are in favour of the decentralization of industries, border industries and aspects of that kind, they would reply in the words of the <i>Cape Argus</i> that wrote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If it were not for the Government&#x2019;s intention of using the proposed legislaiton to further the implementation of apartheid, a revised Bill for the decentralization of industries would have served a useful purpose.</block>

<p>In other words, they are ostensibly in favour of the decentralization of industries, of border industries, but, in heaven&#x2019;s name, this simply must not promote separate development. When they are opposed to separate development it goes without saying that they are also opposed to the decentralization of industries, whatever they may say. I want to state that the reason why they overlook so may things is because they have a consuming hunger for money and comfort. In fact, Sir, that is the driving force behind their struggle to keep the Bantu in South Africa; that is the driving force behind their philosophy of one integrated nation of 20 million people, a philosophy for which there is no justification whatsoever.</p>

<p>Sir, I think it is fitting, for the sake of the record, to go back a little and catch up a few threads by quoting from the report of the Social and Economic Planning Council, a body instituted by that side of the House, people of their own choice, with instructions to investigate the evils of the overconcentration of industries and the accompanying over-concentration of populations. I am referring to the ninth report of that council that deals, in particular, with &#x201C;The Native Reserves and their place in the economy of the Union of South Africa&#x201D;. Paragraph 256, which is regarded as so important that it is printed in large black type, reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_8319-8320" refersTo="page_1114"/>Because the need for industrial development is so great and because the responsibility must rest with the State to initiate such development in the Reserves &#x2026;</block>

<p>And please note, Sir, &#x201C;the responsibility must rest with the State&#x201D;, not with the private sector&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the council recommends that the Government should explore the possibilities of assisting in the establishment of a number of selected industries catering for the more immediate needs of the Natives in or near the Native areas.</block>

<p>Where can one find a more express plea and unconditional recommendation for the decentralization of industries? The population pressure on the metropolitan areas must be relieved and this must in fact be done by means of decentralization. The report then continues and even mentions the names of places where industries must be established, and after the report has pointed out that it would be a mistake if steps are not taken immediately and without delay, it states further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Only then can we prevent the expansion of our cities beyond what is in each instance the feasible limit and promote the urbanization of Natives in or near the Native areas.</block>

<p>And then we have this significant sentence&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It would promote the desirable object of bringing the place of work nearer to the place of residence.</block>

<p>Sir, there sits the Opposition, caught in their own snares, and now condemning this Physical Planning Act with pious faces, an Act which is merely precisely and thoroughly implementing the recommendations of their own people.</p>

<p>Sir, one asks oneself: Why did they not implement all the recommendations of that council? Because it was not in South Africa&#x2019;s interests? No, Sir, they did not do so because it does not accord with their own egotistical philosophy. For the sake of appearances, and as consolation, they did in fact institute land control&#x2014;that is all, but of course that was not enough to handle this problem, and that is why this Government came along, took the bull by the horns, and also instituted control over the establishment of new industries and the development of existing ones. Now the Opposition comes along and incites the industries by telling the industrialists they will be forced to shift and that they will then be deprived of their freedom. That is the biggest nonsense in the world. We all know this Act has nothing to do with that, that it only relates to the establishment of new industries and the development of existing ones. I want to emphasize&#x2014;and I do so with the utmost appreciation for the gigantic part that industries have played in the development of our economy&#x2014;that South Africa deos not serve the industries, the industries serve South Africa. It is their task to help create wealth by producing goods; to provide job opportunities for a growing population; to develop commerce. But that is not all. It is also their task to serve the fatherland. In fact, the supreme right is that of the people whom everyone serves, the right to lay claim to order, security and prosperity; and for this, Sir, the people look to the Government. Therefore it is clear, in the Government&#x2019;s view, that they can grant the industries all the freedoms except one, and that is to excuse themselves or dissociate themselves from this task and to develop along lines that are not in the interests of the fatherland. Economic considerations are, of course, of the utmost importance in the establishment of industries, but of equal importance is that social considerations should be taken into account, particularly in a country like South Africa with its large diversity of national groups. The decentralization of industries does hold financial implications for the entrepreneur, but we must not lose sight of the fact that the continued concentration of industries not only has far-reaching financial consequences for the general public and Government bodies, in the sense that it requires tremendous expenditure on housing and public services, but that at the same time it also has far-reaching social consequences. In addition to the good reasons for decentralization there also exists, as far as South Africa is concerned, an additional and particularly compelling reason for doing this, i.e. to ensure our survival. Sir, if we take into account that South Africa is confronted by the most vicious forces in the world, that it is confronted by the demand of meeting the individual needs of the greatest number of different population groups one could possibly have in the world &#x2026; [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to speak about another aspect of <span class="col_8321-8322" refersTo="page_1115"/>planning, and that is the combating of pollution and the protection of the lovely environment in which we live. The hon. the Minister of Planning has stated very clearly in the past that he and his department regard themselves as being responsible for the co-ordination of all steps to protect our environment and combat pollution. The protection of the environment is a great and widely branching field, with pollution increasing at a continually accelerated pace in conjunction with the population explosion. Every day we see and read about appalling examples of pollution. Our golden beaches are polluted with sticky oil, thousands upon thousands of seabirds, particularly our special Cape Pengiuns, are dying of suffocation, while large numbers of fish are dying in our rivers. The latter aspect is a symptom of rivers which are poisoned and which then, devoid of life, eventually die themselves. Examples of such dying rivers are the Jukskei, Umgeni, Umkomaas, Tugela and several others. In the CSIR&#x2019;s 1971 report, mention is made of the excellent work of our scientists, <i>inter alia,</i> the work being done by the air pollution group under their head, Mr. D. C. Halliday, and by the National Institute for Water Research, under their director, Dr. G. J. Stander. They are hard at work to lay down adapted modern standards. We should like to congratulate them on the excellent work they have already done.</p>

<p>In the latest reports about the activities of the Department of Planning, two or three examples are mentioned, in a few brief sentences, of activities and co-ordination. In the first place there is the liaison with the Committee for Oceanic Matters, the Subsidiary Committee on Pollution and the Subsidiary Committee for the Occurrence and Combating of Noise. That is all there is in that whole report about the combating of pollution. We should like to know more about the co-ordination, action and liaison by the Department of Planning in this connection. In replies to questions the hon. the Prime Minister entrusted the responsibility for certain types of pollution to various departments. Thus the combating of noise has, for example, been allocated to the Department of Labour and the Department of Transport that deals with trains and jet aircraft. But what about military aircraft, motorbikes, the traffic on our roads and the stamping out of noise that is constantly taking place in our industries? A national code must be laid down for implementation by various bodies in the field, which will include every sector, from motorists to industrialists.</p>

<p>The responsibility for smoke and pollution the Prime Minister entrusted to the Department of Transport and Health. I should like to know who is responsible for factory smoke and gases. The Department of Water Affairs is responsible for sewerage and effluent. But who is responsible for industrial effluent? Impure water even comes into the country from mountain catchment areas from neighbouring states. This water is already badly polluted by organic nitrogen compounds, probably because of the densely populated rural areas with their large numbers of animals. The combating of pollution of this kind can become an international matter.</p>

<p>Oil pollution at sea is specifically the responsibility of the Department of Economic Affairs. This is more administrative in nature, and in actual fact the department has few executive powers. In my opinion this could more profitably belong to the Department of Transport, which has ships at its disposal to sail out and combat pollution at sea. The responsibility for the rubbish and the mess that defaces our country&#x2019;s natural scenery, for example mineral bottles, beer cans and plastic bottles, has not been allocated to any Government department. It is probably regarded as being the responsibility of the provincial and municipal departments. The consumer is already being held responsible for pollution to a certain extent, and fines are being imposed.</p>

<p>I also believe that the manufacturer and the distributor&#x2014;in other words, those people who make the profits out of these indestructible metal and plastic containers &#x2014;ought to be held responsible for the return of the containers or their repurchase. They must encourage and finance the collection of the containers. With the help of legislation it can be stipulated that they should ask for a deposit which they then repay upon return of the containers. We should also like to see someone being given the responsibility for the derelict motor cars that have been lying next to our national roads for years, and even beyond the fences on private property. The original owners of such cars, their insurance companies, or even their estates should be held responsible for their removal. <span class="col_8323-8324" refersTo="page_1116"/>There are many other examples of pollution and environmental disruption for which departmental responsibility has not clearly been allocated.</p>

<p>In the first place we, and the country as a whole, feel that ordered combating and co-ordination to cover this entire field is absolutely essential. Secondly, there must be definitely delegated responsibility that is well co-ordinated. Thirdly, one would like to see the establishment of an inspectorate to reprimand the offenders of the established standards. Fourthly&#x2014;and this is the most important of all&#x2014;in order to manage all this, there will have to be a comprehensive national plan focussed in legislation. Many overseas countries specifically have such legislation, consolidated legislation for the combating of pollution and the protection of the environment. <i>Inter alia,</i> the Act ought to require every Government department to make a close study, and table a report, in connection with every project that is tackled. They must make a close study, and table the report, in connection with the effect the project would have on the ecology of the environment. Such a compulsory ecological report is particularly necessary for such large projects and schemes as are now being tackled. I am just thinking of the Richards Bay scheme.</p>

<p>We know that the CSIR is already engaged in one facet of such a study involving the effect that fluorine could possibly have on the Richards Bay harbour. We are thinking, for example, that a unique lagoon will be affected by the whole Sishen-Saldanha Bay scheme. At Saldanha there are ideal facilities for pleasure resorts, for boat trips, for nature conservation, etc. One wonders what effect such a harbour with its ships and its oil pollution will have on such a lagoon. I expect the natural fish and shells, which are present there, will die and disappear. Consequently the birds will also die. Beside the beaches of the lagoon, at Langebaan. there is a nature conservation area, which will also be affected by such a large scheme. We should like to see planning take place in such a way that oil from these ships is kent away from the lagoon, if this is at all possible.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. S. F. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I find it possible to agree with most of the hon. member&#x2019;s arguments for combating pollution. I shall therefore not react to them.</p>

<p>I should like to call attention to the development potential of the Western Transvaal, which is my part of the country. It is a beautiful part of the country, and a part of the country which is also represented by the hon. member for Lichtenburg, the hon. member for Wolmaransstad and the hon. member for Christiana. The English-speaking people refer to &#x201C;the Western Transvaal proper&#x201D;. I want to do this since I sometimes get the feeling that this part of our country is not always appreciated or assessed correctly. It is not always put in the correct perspective, within the framework of our greater planning programme. I am grateful for the fact that the draftsmen of the White Paper on the Riekert Report have wrested the North Western Transvaal from the Kalahari stigma which unjustly attached to it for many years. Amongst the specially selected growth points they mentioned important towns earmarked for priorities in regard to border industry establishment and development. They mentioned Brits, Rustenburg and also Zeerust. In the Northern Cape, Mafeking was mentioned. Of these towns only Zeerust is situated in the Western Transvaal proper. This has to a certain extent placed this area in the limelight, and I am grateful that this is the case and has been mentioned in that report.</p>

<p>What I want to emphasize, however, is that I think too much attention and emphasis are still and have remained focussed for too long a time more on the &#x201C;North&#x201D; than on the &#x201C;Western&#x201D; part of the concept &#x201C;North Western&#x201D;. On page 10 of the annual report of the Department of Planning it is stated that a great deal of consideration has to be given to the matter and that a growth points committee has been constituted from a large number of departments, a committee which has to give consideration to those particular places which are to be selected for being included in a priority list. This committee is to give consideration to and decide on the selection of the priorities in respect of which the preparatory work for industrial establishment is to be undertaken with State aid and State loans to local authorities, etc. I am grateful for the fact that Zeerust appears in this priority list. I trust that its potential will soon be investigated thoroughly and that development will also take place there so as to afford this part of the Western Transvaal the necessary <span class="col_8325-8326" refersTo="page_1117"/>opportunity for developing and bringing about new life and growth in that area.</p>

<p>I want to make the point that both the growth points committee and the decentralization board should in their deliberations &#x2014;a great deal of emphasis is placed in this report on &#x201C;deliberations&#x201D;, on what has to be done and the direction in which development has to take place&#x2014;give more urgent attention to places situated farther away from our major industrial complexes and metropolitan areas. This applies to industrial establishment in particular. I have mentioned Zeerust, but this principle does not only apply to Zeerust. In a broad sense it applies to all planning and establishment of border industry areas and decentralization. Regard should be had to the ominous population concentration in and near to the metropolitan complexes.</p>

<p>The hinterland of the Tswanas should be seen in perspective with development on the borders of their homeland. The Tswana homeland has its hinterland in the Western Transvaal and the Northern Cape. The Tswana people are naturally moving closer and closer to the development taking place in the peri-urban areas, for in that way they are coming closer to their employment. However, this is giving rise to large concentrations of non-Whites in a semi-circle west of Pretoria and the Wit-watersrand complex, but especially northwest of Pretoria.</p>

<p>Rosslyn, Brits and Rustenburg are effective places, and one does not begrudge them the development there, especially at Rustenburg, which is situated a little farther away from Pretoria. However, if we look at and analyse the matter more closely, it becomes apparent&#x2014;as has been proved statistically all over the world, namely that more than half of the population of the world live in cities with populations of more than one million people&#x2014;that there has also been, according to the 1970 census, a tremendous increase in South Africa&#x2019;s White urban population. As it is 86.8 per cent of our White population are living in cities and towns. Four cities alone&#x2014;I could have mentioned numbers, but I do not have the time&#x2014;comprise 46,7 per cent of our White population.</p>

<p>Now, it is interesting to note that the towns which are growing and developing at the fastest rate are in fact those ones which are situated close to or within a reasonably narrow radius of our metropolitan areas. The White population of 56 of the 70 towns in the Free State have decreased by 80 per cent. Therefore the populations of distant towns are decreasing. For that reason our planners will have to plan, act, and deliberate in a positive manner in order to meet all the complex problems associated with increasing population density, also in these new developments which are taking place close to our metropolitan areas. The more development there is in our cities and in our larger peri-urban towns, the greater the flow of Whites to them will be.</p>

<p>The increasing influx of Whites also attracts the Bantu. The Bantu are also drawn in, sucked in and brought closer, for the Bantu have a tendency towards going there. If they cannot be absorbed in the major cities, they will concentrate themselves as close to them as possible, around the cities. This is a natural tendency among the Bantu. For that reason it is imperative that exhaustive and far-sighted consideration be given to this ring of development which is springing up so close to our cosmopolitan areas. No matter how interesting, acceptable and effective our urban areas may be. we must focus our eyes as far as possible away from those peri-urban and metropolitan areas. It is extremely important that the decentralization of industries and the establishment of border industry growth points be located as near as possible to the heartlands of our ethnic Bantu areas.</p>

<p>One merely has to take a look at the map of our country and the location of our Bantu homelands to determine where the areas are where an infrastructure already exists to a certain extent and where it may be stimulated and developed in order that we may have a suction to force them away from the urban areas. Of course, in speaking about the Western Transvaal, I am also thinking of Zeerust &#x2014;it is the capital city of my constituency &#x2014;as one of the favourable places. It may be insignificant and small, but it is situated strategically in relation to Botswana and has high potential. In the Riekert Report I miss the indication of more growth points that may be established in the Western Transvaal. It would seem as though we are concentrating on the Eastern Transvaal. the Northern Transvaal and on the more central parts of the Transvaal.</p>

<p>Ever since the earliest days, when the development of Rosslyn was merely being discussed, I have been making pleas and <span class="col_8327-8328" refersTo="page_1118"/>urging that if the State has to spend money in this regard, growth points should be established far away and as near as possible to the Bantu homelands. In regard to Rosslyn I was frequently involved in arguments with our planners. Now, I know that the Opposition and industrialists have many objections to border industries being established farther away and that this does not suit their purposes, but it is essential. Just as is the case in European countries and elsewhere, we shall come up against large and mighty concentrations with the attendant influx of Bantu if we do not follow this advice. The Opposition has repeatedly told us that Bantu should be attracted to existing industrial areas on a family basis in order to meet the labour needs. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I know that the hon. member will not expect me to follow him in his line of thought. I wish him the best of luck in the development of that part of the country he is pleading for. I immediately want to come to another matter which was touched on by the hon. member for Benoni. I want to deal with it from this angle: The hon. the Minister will remember the private member&#x2019;s motion I had the privilege of moving earlier this session. Questions were recently put to the hon. the Prime Minister to try to find out where the central authority was, not so much in regard to planning, but in regard to the combating of pollution in its various forms. Pollution today, with our industrial development, is taking a number of new forms and it is becoming all the more lethal in the effect it is having on our environment. Our environment is being attacked now from new angles, almost with every month that passes as a result of our industrial development.</p>

<p>I now come to the reply I received from the hon. the Prime Minister. Here we come to the point that I tried to make at the beginning of the session with my private member&#x2019;s motion. We find that no fewer than nine Cabinet Ministers are involved in dealing with some aspect of pollution as it may affect their particular portfolio. This does not show a keen appreciation of the problems facing South Africa in die degradation of our environment. I now know what I did not know at that time, namely that the hon. the Minister has been commissioned to act as the co-ordinating agent, the co-ordinating Minister, for all these other Ministers. This throws the door wide open to no less than nine departments of State in respect of which the Minister in charge of that portfolio is brought within the ambit of the activities of the hon. the Minister of Planning, who has to co-ordinate all those activities. So I would like to commence by asking the Minister at once: What actually has been done to co-ordinate the activities of those different Ministers in respect of the prevention and combating of pollution, each in his own environment, each within the four corners of his own portfolio? I want to point out that prevention in this matter is infinitely better than combating the trouble after it has occurred; so that this hon. Minister, the Minister of Planning, who is charged with the responsibility of co-ordinating all those efforts with a view to the prevention of pollution&#x2014;as the hon. the Prime Minister told me&#x2014;has this problem on his shoulders. So I put the question to him specifically: Will he tell his Committee just what has been done to co-ordinate the activities; will he give us the names of his colleagues in the Cabinet who have been brought into the co-ordinated clan? I think notice has been given of a bill which has been read a First Time today&#x2014;I have not seen it yet&#x2014;dealing with, for example, pollution at sea. That is an extremely important matter indeed. It is one of the most important. But, Sir, it is only one aspect. I believe tonight the evening papers are already carrying a story of ten thousand crayfish that have been killed in the open sea water at St. Helena Bay as a result&#x2014;they allege&#x2014;of industrial effluent into the open sea. This again points to the very feature which we have been trying to raise from this side of the House for so long, namely the fallacy of the idea that the ocean is a bottomless pit into which we can throw all the rubbish from our so-called &#x201C;civilization&#x201D;, all the effluence of our factories, and so forth, with impunity, because the ocean is so large that it will simply absorb all our refuse and digest it and in a short time there will be no sign of it. Nobody will know that it was there; it will just have disappeared and the ocean will go rolling on, pure and clean and waiting for visitors, tourists and other people to come and swim in and for the fish to swim in and multiply. In fact, Sir, it is nothing of the kind. The whole world over are we being warned. As I said some time ago in this House, a very famous scientist from Holland, Prof. Roll, who is <span class="col_8329-8330" refersTo="page_1119"/>in charge of their inshore sea fisheries, gave us a short talk on the damage that Holland was suffering in its inshore waters because they did not timeously take heed of the fact that the ocean is limited in its capacity to take mankind&#x2019;s rubbish and effluence and to dispose of it satisfactorily without any detriment to the habitat. Whatever has happened to ten thousand crayfish&#x2014;if that indeed is the figure&#x2014;and from whatever cause the effluent may have come&#x2014;if indeed it is effluent which killed them&#x2014;this is only the beginning; but it is taking place in the ocean and it can proceed unless it is stopped. Here again I make the point that what we should be doing is to take steps to prevent it. It is so much more expensive to try to cure the trouble after the event. Vested interest is involved, big money and private people with great influence are involved and all sorts of troubles occur. We have the case of Iscor which, I believe&#x2014;I quoted the figures the other day&#x2014;is over the next ten years going to spend R10 million a year, a total of R100 million, to deal with effluent and effluvium which is polluting the atmosphere as a result of the fumes from their chimneys. They are prepared to spend R10 million per year for ten years to try to deal with it and this is of tremendous importance.</p>

<p>I come to this particular point of the need for co-ordination. I know now it is no good my saying to the hon. the Minister that I hope he will use his influence with the Prime Minister to have a Minister appointed for the protection of the environment, as so many other countries have had to do, because they have seen the need to deal with the matter in its early stages. We have just dealt this afternoon with another bill dealing with the question of the modification of the weather. Sir, do you know that the weather can be affected by atmospheric pollution coming from effluent which comes from aircraft and from industrial works such as the chimneys of various factories and so forth? They can so pollute the atmosphere that it changes the weather. This is one of the things we have in evidence before us. This is one of the aspects to which the hon. the Minister, through his two colleagues, could be applying his mind, to see what they can do to deal with a matter of this kind.</p>

<p>While on the subject, I want for a moment or two to deal with this matter of research; because I see that the hon. the Minister, also arising out of the reply I received from the hon. the Prime Minister, is the Minister in charge of all pure research in so far as the CSIR is concerned. I want to say that the information concerning that research should be made available, even to laymen. I am a layman, Sir, I am an ordinary farmer from the Bushveld. I do not understand these things. I talk only about what I can read. I read it and then I bring it out here in Parliament, and I hope I say it with sufficient emphasis for people to think I know what I am talking about. But then there are a lot of other Members of Parliament like that. The Minister is one of them. When the time comes, I hope he will tell us. If he does not have his own direct knowledge, let him tell us what he has been told by the Prime Minister or by his colleagues in respect of these other matters. But in regard to pure research, how woefully behind the times are we; because in every avenue of pure research that is examined and where pure research is allowed to go forward and adequate funds are made available, we have a shortage. We have so many of our own good scientists. I take my hat off to the South African scientist who is of average or above average proficiency and capacity, who stays in his own country. How many of our young South Africans who are brilliant young men have been lured away from our country because of big salaries, large emoluments and special fringe benefits that they are offered in other countries? I do not want to name the other countries. You, Sir, will be well aware of them. One after the other they leave our country and they go. How much more honour is there due to the young men who stay here for lesser emoluments and with less opportunity for research, men who are more restricted in their field of endeavour here in their own home country? But they stay here and they help us.</p>

<p>I want to deal particularly this afternoon for just a moment or two of the short time that is left to me, with the unfortunate position that has arisen where the geochemistry department here at the university has had to send back moon rocks to America because we do not have the money to provide for one more researcher to help the head of that department, who is world-renowned today. Countries the world over are trying to get this material and the United States will not give it to them because they do not have the men with the brains. We have the men with the <span class="col_8331-8332" refersTo="page_1120"/>brains, and we are falling short in providing the money and the opportunity for our men to exercise their gifts in regard to this question. We are faced now with having to send moon rocks back to America without being able to do research on it. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for South Coast as well as the hon. member for Benoni will forgive me if I do not follow them in their argument. They spoke about the question of pollution, but if I were now to plead for measures against pollution I would have to plead for the obliteration of the Opposition, and I would not like to do that; we grant them a languishing continued existence. It is worthy of note that under this Vote members of the Opposition have exclusively occupied themselves with the accusation that the Department of Planning is motivated by an ideology. But I want to accuse the Opposition of occupying themselves with a politically motivated argument in this regard. If I have been listening correctly, this party&#x2019;s concern is with the development of our urban complexes. For that reason I want to occupy myself, rather than being politically motivated, with an ideological question, namely the depopulation of the rural areas, for the rural areas have always been loyal to South Africa. Therefore I should like to plead for the development of the rural areas, with the potential offered by them to our population.</p>

<p>I should like to extend to the hon. the Minister, and also to the Secretariat of this department, my sincere thanks for the way in which they have been attending to the planning in the Republic. I may bear testimony to the fact that this department has also been displaying its vitality in the planning of the Cape Midlands, as well as that of the Eastern Cape. One notices that this department is engaged in objective planning which in fact affects every section of the population in the Republic. Therefore I have no hesitation in pleading with the hon. the Minister and the department for more attention to be given by us to the development of the rural areas, and more specifically to the Midlands, as well as to the Eastern Cape region. A special report which came into our hands, was the survey in respect of the Midlands and the Karoo areas, as drawn up by an auxiliary committee of the Planning Advisory Council. According to Part III of the report, on page 36, it is very conspicuous that during the 19th century the population in the Midlands increased at a slow rate; but during the 20th century the White population in those parts of the Republic showed a downward trend. There was a gradual downward trend in the numbers of the White population. This report, which I have just mentioned, attributes this to a lack of economic growth points in that area. In taking stock of the lack of economic growth points in that area, we may attribute this phenomenon in turn to a lack of water in that area. But with the coming of the Orange River project that need for water has been eliminated to a large extent.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. H. VAN DER SPUY</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, an old United Party policy which became rotten. It is an old United Party policy which took shape under National Party regime because the United Party has always been lacking in vitality. However the National Party as the governing party has always kept pace with the vitality of the Republic. In pleading for a development of the potential in the Midlands as well as the Eastern Cape region, I am thinking of the object this report has in view, namely the establishment of 9 000 additional farms under the Orange-Fish River project. In bearing in mind what it cost to develop those two valleys, the Fish and Sundays River valleys, I am thinking of an amount of R200 million, according to that report, and more specifically to R50 million in the case of the Sundays River, where the citrus industry is located.</p>

<p>In thinking of those possibilities, I want to plead with the hon. the Minister this afternoon for planning in regard to settling the aged. The settlement of the aged in our urban complexes creates major problems, not only in regard to housing for those people, but also in regard to the atmosphere in which the aged have to pass the rest of their days. When I think of the excellent climatic and other factors in the Midlands and the Eastern Cape regions and of what it means to our aged to pass the rest of their days in the tranquility and clean air of those areas, I want to plead for planning in regard to the settlement of the aged in our rural areas.</p>

<p>But I am not only pleading for the aged from our urban complexes; I am also <span class="col_8333-8334" refersTo="page_1121"/>pleading for the youth of our nation. It has been proved over and again that the rural areas can in fact offer the youth of our nation that healthy, educational atmosphere. Therefore I plead for the establishment of better educational centres in our rural areas for the education of the sons and the daughters of the nation of the Republic.</p>

<p>I am also thinking of the economic development, of the establishment of growth points in that area, more specifically the area under the Orange River project. I am thinking of a growth point in the Fish River Valley, where we already have the symptoms of a new vitality which is taking root there. I am also thinking of the Sundays River Valley, where, to a certain extent, there is already a growth point, which is waiting for further development. I am also retain the initiative here as far as the afforestation of that area, for according to reports at our disposal the Republic is facing a shortage of industrial timber. Those extensive areas both on the Zuurberg and along the coast-line in that area, lend themselves to beautiful afforestation which may really meet a major need in the Republic. It is a pity that the various needs in that area falls under several departments. It is for that very reason that the Department of Planning is of such vital importance: the department sees to the overall planning, and it is essential that the department should also retain the initiative here as far as the planning of that area is concerned. This includes the Departments of Transport, Water Affairs. Forestry, Tourism and Social Welfare and Pensions; all of these are departments which can contribute a small share, but I believe that the Department of Planning can do real justice to that largely unexploited part of the Republic.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Somerset East will probably forgive me if I do not follow him in his argument. There is another matter I still want to raise with the Minister this afternoon. I should first like to tell the hon. member for Middelburg&#x2014;I am sorry that he is not present at the moment&#x2014;that I found his speech interesting, especially certain observations which he made and to which hon. members quite loudly said: &#x201C;Hear, hear!&#x201D; That was then he referred to everything that had to be sacrificed by the industries to the State in order to fit in with the Physical Planning Act. He said the industries were in the service of the State, and that was why hon. members said: &#x201C;Hear, hear!&#x201D; I find this strange, for these are not the sentiments of a democrat; these are the sentiments which one can find in the works of Karl Marx, Engels, Trotski and those people.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. M. STEPHENS</person>:</from>

<p>But has the hon. member read those works? These are the sentiments that are to be found in them. The democratic view is that planning should only be undertaken on an economic basis, and not on an ideological basis. It is tantamount to heading for fascism and an authoritarian state if it is said that everybody is in the service of the State, that everything done by the State is correct, and that everything done by the people must be in the service of the State. [Interjections.] Sir, hon. members are welcome to differ, but I am telling them that these are the views of the authoritarian states in the world. The democrat is the person who says that planning is only done for economic reasons.</p>

<p>Sir, one of the problems of this department is that there is no overall planning on a full scale for South Africa as such. There is no fundamental planning. The planning that is done is on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, as in fact the hon. the Minister said here the other day. We find that planning bodies throughout the country are proliferating at the moment, both in the private sector and in the public sector. We find that there are planning bodies in every department. There are planning bodies wherever one looks, and there is no proper overall co-ordination among the various planning bodies, which exist in every possible sphere one can think of. It is essential that there should be co-ordination, for the only hope for the meaningful continued existence of the democracy in this country is total social and economic planning, but then planning should be indicative and incentive and not dictatorial, as we so often find with this department.</p>

<p>Sir, there is a specific matter which I should like to raise with the hon. the Minister this afternoon, and this is a matter which specifically relates to my constituency. It is a matter which I took up with the hon. the Minister previously through correspondence, but this matter is assuming such grave proportions at present that I feel obliged to bring it to his notice here in this House today, especially in view of the <span class="col_8335-8336" refersTo="page_1122"/>further developments that have taken place there. In the first instance, I should like to outline to the hon. the Minister the conditions prevailing there today. It is an area which is commonly known as Honeydew. Actually it comprises various smallholdings under various names, but jointly they are known as Honeydew. It is an area which falls under the peri-urban areas board, i.e. not within any municipal area. The area has been divided into various smallholdings which have been zoned for agricultural purposes only, but this area is surrounded by certain portions of the farm Wilgespruit and the farm Panorama, on which a certain company has had enormous sand-pits for many years. Sir, this is a tremendous problem to the people living on the smallholdings, because they are almost completely surrounded by sand-pits and have almost become an island. In the first instance, these sand-pits are of course extremely unsightly; in the second instance, there is a tremendous amount of pollution. These sand-pits are huge holes of fantastic dimensions. As I have already said, they are unsightly and are the cause of a tremendous amount of dust in this rural area. In addition, there is a tremendous amount of noise all the time, for this installation operates 24 hours a day. There is a continuous drone, day and night, throughout that rural area. What aggravates the position, is the fact that there are compounds in and an influx of non-Whites into that area, who are not being controlled properly. Compounds are being built everywhere, and these present a tremendous problem to the people living there, so much so that some of them have already threatened&#x2014;I hope this will not happen&#x2014;to shoot the people there. This is how the people in this area feel about the matter at the moment. I would be glad to hear from the hon. the Minister whether his department has any control over the position there and whether his department has granted permission to these people to exploit those sand-pits. If this is not the case, I should like to plead with the hon the Minister to have the position investigated so as to see whether his department can take any measures in this regard, for there are not only sand-pits in this area; extensions are being made to these sandpits. There is an area, which used to be open veld, where they are also engaged in excavations at the moment, and that will aggravate the whole problem one hundred per cent. Sir, one can understand the people in this area being terribly dissatisfied. Sand has now been excavated from the old site for the past 15 years already, and these extensions to the sand-pits are aggravating the problem tremendously. It is a case of adding insult to injury. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to liaise with the municipalities in this regard. On the southern side this area borders on the municipal area of Roodepoort, and on the eastern and northern sides it borders on the municipal area of Randburg. These municipal border areas are residential areas. In other words, there is no industrial area in the vicinity. The sand-pits are situated in the middle of a residential area, which will always remain a residential area. I do not think there is any possibility of this area becoming an industrial area. I may also mention that at the same place where this company has its sand works, prefabricated concrete walls or panels are being made. Actually, there is a factory for the manufacture of these panels on that site. Of course, this is another thorn in the flesh of the people living there, since their smallholdings were zoned as an agricultural area and they themselves may therefore not establish any industry there. Sir, I have tried to give you an idea of the problems these people have, and I want to plead with the hon. the Minister to have this matter investigated so as to see whether there is something he can do in this regard. If they had to obtain permission from his department, then it goes without saying that he has control, and then I shall be pleased if the hon. the Minister would investigate the matter once again, and I want to plead with him not to grant permission for any additional extensions to these sand-pits. Even if the Minister cannot do anything in regard to the sand-pits, I want to appeal to him to give attention to the other aspects I mentioned here, namely the noise and the dust pollution taking place there on a tremendous scale.

<p>Sir, I notice the hon. member is wearing a green tie with a little key on it. They say it is a key to unlock the future with. Sir, I want to say to you that the future of that party is so obscure that they will not even find the keyhole. But, Sir, I do not want to waste my time on what that hon. member has said. I want to associate myself with the plea the hon. member for Moorreesburg made here yesterday. The hon. member asked the Minister to lend greater force to the effectiveness of regional development associations. Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister also said in the course of the debate that he welcomed local opinion with a view to future planning in South Africa. Last year, on 26th and 27th October, we held a large joint regional congress at which 12 regional development associations were represented by almost 500 delegates. These 12 regional development associations met to consider what creative work could be undertaken in an area almost two thirds the size of South Africa. The people who attended this congress were imbued with the will to contribute, through their ideas, zeal and work, towards the creative work that has to be done for the future. Under the slogan &#x201C;Our world awakes&#x201D; this great and unique congress pleaded with one voice: Provide, in the future planning of South Africa, a dynamic new line of development, a line of development extending from a west coast harbour at Saldanha Bay, through Namaqualand, the North-Western Cape, lower Orange, Sishen, Kuruman, Reivilo, Vryburg, through the Western Transvaal into the heart of the industrial complex of South Africa, the Rand. All that has to be done to establish this line of development is, after the completion of the Sishen/Saldanha railway line, to link up Sishen via Kuruman and Reivilo with Pudimoe by means of a railway line 180 km long. There you have, Mr. Chairman, a new alternative train route from the Rand to a west coast harbour and Cape Town, a new train route which may become the lifeline of a dynamic new line of development winding through the regional areas endowed with enormous wealth and the potential to contribute vastly to the development of South Africa. When one considers the anticipated population explosion it is obvious that a north-south railway line cannot rely indefinitely on a single track service alone. Instead of the ultimate doubling of the Johannesburg / Karoo / Cape railway line of 5 129 km, this railway line can fulfil this function over a total Saldanha / Johannesburg distance of 1 458 km. The advantages of such an alternative main line running through South Africa&#x2019;s secondary mineral areas is invaluable. Experts suggest that the present population of 21,4 million will double itself by the year 1996. In other words, during the following 24 years it will be the task of the National Party Government to make provision in its planning for almost one million people per year; to create space where they can live, work and play. Since there is at present a great tendency towards urbanization and since we accept that this tendency will increase all along, since facilities and space for motor vehicle and other traffic in our urban complexes constitute a troublesome problem for our urban authorities at present, since pollution is becoming a major problem in our urban complexes, since the question of space in urban complexes has already become a problem, and since the same applies to space for housing, playing grounds and educational facilities we plead today, Mr. Chairman, with the Government and particularly the Department of Planning to provide, in its national plan of development, for the establishment of a dynamic line of development. We have to plan even at this early stage for the establishment of the necessary infrastructures so that provision can be made for the millions of people for whom accommodation will have to be provided.</p>

<p>In these regional areas we have an abundance of space, raw materials, water and other facilities. In these regional areas we have the people who are prepared to make their contribution to open up this fine part of our country to accommodate here the millions of people for whom provision has to be made. We have no &#x201C;Madam Roses&#x201D; on our side, but we envisage a major port at Saldanha Bay in the future. We envisage the development of the exploitation of the mineral wealth of Namaqualand, the North-Western Cape <span class="col_8339-8340" refersTo="page_1124"/>and the lower Orange. We envisage enormous developments in the Sishen/Hotazel/ Postmasburg area where South Africa&#x2019;s major iron-ore and manganese production are going to be. We envisage the fourth Iscor at Sishen, particularly when we bear in mind that the transport cost of iron-ore in 1971 from Sishen to Vanderbijlpark accounted for 72 per cent of the total production cost per ton of iron-ore. We also envisage immense developments at Kuruman as a border industrial area since it is situated at the southern tip of the Tswana homeland. Kuruman has enormously rich blue asbestos and limestone deposits and could play an important role in the development of asbestos cement products. It could play a tremendously important role in the large scale building operations which are going to take place in South Africa in future. We also envisage the benefits this will entail for our neighbouring states, Botswana and Rhodesia, which may be drawn into this line of development. They could be linked up with such a west coast port. South-West Africa could also be drawn into this line. The present 5 000 truckloads of slaughter-stock which come from South-West Africa every year could be brought nearer to the Rand markets by 250 km. This will result in a saving in the transport cost and in this way the animals will arrive at the markets at least two days earlier. We also envisage that the labour of the Coloured population could be used at the south end of this line of development. The Tswana people could offer their labour in the northern areas and could at least spend the week-ends in their homeland.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to what was said by the hon. member for Marico. He said that the effect of the Riekert report was that the Western Transvaal was rid of the Kalahari stigma. For this he is grateful, but I want to tell the hon. member for Marico today that when he considers the plan we have in front of us, we can say to the Western Transvaal, &#x201C;Stick to the Kalahari and we shall make you famous&#x201D;. I say this because if this rail link from Sishen to Pudimoe is built, there would be three alternative routes from that point to the Rand complex. One of the routes will be from Pudimoe via Vryburg, Mafeking and Zeerust. The hon. member for Marico has already furnished us with a detailed description of developments at those places and we should like to support him on that score. The other rail link will run via Schweizer-Reneke, Sannieshof and Lich-tenburg to the Rand. And the third rail link will be via Fourteen Streams, Klerksdorp and those parts of the world. This is an alternative route created from the Rand, and it could be exploited to the benefit of the whole of South Africa. Large developments could take place along this line and this would be in the interest of the whole of South Africa.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. D. DEACON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Kuruman will forgive me if I do not follow up on his speech. We all like to dream dreams on our constituencies; I myself do it at times and I do not wish to disturb his.</p>

<p>I want to deal with a matter which may appear on face value as a parochial one, but which I regard as one of national importance. I regard it as of national importance because it involvas a major tidal river in the Eastern Province and one of our greatest tourist attractions in South Africa. Many members of this House will have visited the Bushman&#x2019;s River mouth and Kenton-on-Sea. They would have seen the complex of twin rivers that we have there. The hon. Minister will remember that I had a question on the Order Paper on 25th April in connection with the implementation of the recommendations regarding the Bushman&#x2019;s River. That was with particular reference to paragraph 2.7.2.6. of the report of the subsidiary committee of the advisory council of the hon. Prime Minister on the investigation of river mouths, lagoons and vleis. That paragraph reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Where new bridges are built over this river, care shall be taken that the bridges are so designed that fillings are not used, but that water may flow freely under the bridges and thus prevent the type of silting problem that now occurs. Channels under the existing bridges should be cleared.</block>

<p>The hon. Minister then replied to me that the execution of the recommendations as contained in the report is the responsibility of other bodies. In pursuing the recommendations, he said, &#x201C;the Department of Planning is however giving the necessary attention to the matter by means of discussion with the Provincial Administration and the Department of Water Affairs&#x201D;. I am raising this matter once again because it is exceptionally serious. I have in my hand a report which I have only received <span class="col_8341-8342" refersTo="page_1125"/>today and I shall make it available to the hon. the Minister. The report was drawn up by Mr. Farquharson of the Albany Museum in Grahamstown. He has taken careful measurements of the Bushman&#x2019;s River and he has found that the flow through the bottle-neck bridge is something like 2 300 cu. ft. per second at peak tidal flows. The river in fact was dammed at its deepest point and pylons were put through the dam wall and when the bridge was completed, they could not remove the dam wall completely. This is now being squeezed down and further measurements were taken. I should like to quote from the report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In order to assess the restrictive effect of the bridge, some measurements were taken on the 21st June, two days after the highest springtide. A level was set up on the East bank and by sighting through the bridge readings were taken of the up-stream and down-stream water surfaces. A mean difference of 1,64 inches (42 mm) was obtained on an incoming tide. This particular tide was lower than expected and amounted to just over 50 inches (127 cm). Assuming the outgoing tide to have a similar displacement in levels, the bridges would have effectively reduced the flow by 6&#x00BD; per cent.</block>

<p>This disturbs the ecology of a river completely, and there are millions of tons of silt being deposited above the bridge every year. The river is being throttled and something drastic has to be done to increase the flow through that bridge. I ask the hon. the Minister especially whether he has already had discussions with the Provincial Administration and if he has not, if he will take this up as a matter of urgency and instruct the Provincial Administration who built that bridge on a wrong design to clear those channels as soon as possible. This is an amenity which serves people from every single province and from South-West Africa. Hundreds of families flock there annually to use this river. As these sand banks throttle the river, so outboard boating is becoming more dangerous. The channels become narrower and as more boats are coming there, we are heading for a terrifically dangerous situation on that river. Our fishing, of course, has fallen off completely. The fishing in that river used to be marvellous, but because this tidal flow has been disturbed, we are getting new types of weed growing there, which are increasing the silt and we have to do something aoout it urgently.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. B. SCHOEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as far as the pollution of our rivers and water resources are concerned, I am in full agreement with the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, and it is my intention to add a few supplementary comments on that matter. The first question I should like to put to the hon. the Minister, is whether the time has not arrived for very serious consideration to be given, in respect of our metropolitan areas, to dealing with our sewerage waste on a cooperative basis and, in fact, also on the basis of a long-term policy. It is a commonplace today that most of our rivers must receive a great deal of our human waste and sewage over and above other phosphates which they must also receive from industries. The result is that the nutrient matter in the water is frequently such that the balance is disturbed, which then affects the vegetation to the detriment of man and animal.</p>

<p>As far as the various smaller municipalities in the metropolitan areas are concerned, they often do not have the capital and financial means to build sewage farms in accordance with the requirements of modern times. The question that has occurred to me is whether the time has not arrived for this matter to be undertaken on the basis of a very broad scientific plan, especially with a view to a long-term policy.</p>

<p>Today the statement is commonly made by biologists that the disturbance of the balance of nature as a result of pollution holds danger for mankind. Man is an animal, just like any other animal, and fitted into this cycle of balance until his numbers increased so drastically that he was forced to disturb this balance as well. A study of the population increase shows that the world population of 5 million approximately 8 000 years ago, has increased to 3 700 million today. Over the past 40 years it has almost doubled itself, and by the year 2000, i.e. in less than 30 years&#x2019; time from now, it is expected that there will be 7 000 million. If this increase continues in an uncontrolled manner, it will once again double itself in the next 35 years after that. The result, especially in the concentrated areas, the metropolitan areas, has proved in recent times that problems are developing for mankind as such, especially as far as oxygen is concerned; in other words, <span class="col_8343-8344" refersTo="page_1126"/>that air pollution is developing. The American moon expeditions proved to us how important oxygen is to mankind. In this regard I want to read you a very friendly lecture on the toxic substances emitted by motor-cars. A fine example is being set by a number of Parliamentarians. Every morning 40 of them come to Cape Town in their own bus and in the evening they go home in the same bus, instead of travelling to and from the city in 40 separate motor-cars. Millions of tons of toxic substances in the form of carbon monoxide and lead, emitted by millions of motorcars, nitrogen oxide from chimneys and sulphur dioxide from factories are being pumped into the atmosphere today. In certain concentrations they are deadly, and it is already being predicted that in the year 1975 a major increase will occur in the death rate in California, to mention one example. If this position is not straightened out, it will become unbearable. As it is the position is so desperate that at times gymnastics at schools in Los Angeles have had to be called off as a result of the lack of pure air. For instance, in Tokyo, too, the position is such that police officials cannot remain on duty for longer than one or two hours at a time; then they first have to go into a special cabin on the pavement to breathe oxygen so that they may continue their work. This is already the position in some world cities. As far as we ourselves are concerned, it may be said that Johannesburg and Cape Town are far removed from these capital cities of the world. However, it is already being calculated today that on a windless day in a city like Johannesburg the toxic substances emitted by the exhaust pipes of motor cars and the chimneys of factories are equivalent to the smoke of 15 cigarettes per individual per day; if we take into account the considerable anticipated increase for the next 35 years, it seems to me as though we are not too far away from such a crisis as regards the health of our people, notwithstanding the fact that our people are thinly scattered over extensive landscapes in the Republic of South Africa. During the years 1949 to 1953 London was severely stricken with smog in the worst degree. During December, 1952, London&#x2019;s normal death rate of 300 more than trebled itself, and more than 4 000 deaths occurred as a result of smog. So I could go on pointing out instances of pollution in agriculture, as a result of the application of D.D.T., D.T.E., etc. I could point out their effects on birds, on certain mammals and on certain species of harmless insects which are being exterminated by them and which results in the balance in nature being disturbed. In addition, there is still the pollution of our fresh water by various detergents, etc. One also thinks of the pollution of our sea-water as a result of the discharge of sewer-pipes. In this regard we already have the phenomenon that fish are developing mouth sores, getting thinner and eventually dying within several radii of the discharge point of sewage installations. I think the time has arrived for us to give very serious attention to this problem. I have no doubt that the hon. the Minister has every sympathy with phenomena such as these. We just want to express the hope that as the financial position of our country improves, the Minister will do everything in his power so that a team service may be made available by our scientists and we may in good time, before it is too late, enter upon this extremely important field of the pollution of our air, water and agriculture in the interests of our future and the health of the inhabitants of South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by making the appeal once again that as far as our sewage installations in our metropolitan areas are concerned, it is high time that the undertaking of such projects be considered on a co-operative basis, so that there may be compliance with all the scientific requirements for purifying water to such an extent that it may subsequently be utilized again for human consumption, and that everything should not be pumped into our rivers, with the consequent pollution of our water, also in the dams of South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just sat down mentioned London and the problems they have there with smog and that kind of thing. It is one of the biggest problems one has in relation to this question of pollution, that where you start to clear up one pollution problem you may well find that you are creating another problem. In the last couple of years steps have been taken to clear up the river Thames, which flows past the mother of Parliaments, so that people can actually fish in this river. They find that because of this clearing up of the water and making it cleaner the sunlight can now penetrate deeper into the water. This in itself is creating a further problem because it is encouraging the growth of algae blooms, which again is becoming <span class="col_8345-8346" refersTo="page_1127"/>a threat to the fish life in the river. These things are so interlinked that it may well happen that while taking one step in the right direction, you are at the same time creating another problem. It is a matter on which we are all agreed that pollution and the effects it can have, have to receive the constant attention of the hon. the Minister and all the other departments under his guidance and in the planning and co-ordination of his department.</p>

<p>I wish to raise with the hon. the Minister the question of the Coloured area which has been declared in my constituency at Bishopstowe. In his speech on Friday afternoon, the hon. the Minister mentioned the fact that up until now there has been a great deal of <i>ad hoc</i> planning. I think that if ever there was a case where this <i>ad hoc</i> planning has come to light, it is in the planning of Coloured areas in Pietermaritzburg. We have the Coloured area of Woodlands there, which was planned a long while ago, before the department started to centralize the Coloured community round certain points in Pietermaritzburg. As a result of this process of centralization, it has now become necessary to declare a further extension of the Coloured area. Representations were made from the Coloured community, from the authorities in Pietermaritzburg, from my voters on both sides about the direction this expansion should take place. The department has made a decision. The decision it has come to is that a new Coloured area should be created separate from the existing area at Woodlands. This hon. Minister is also Minister of Coloured Affairs, and I think it is incumbent upon him to take very serious notice of the problems that are going to be created within the Coloured community in Pietermaritzburg, because you are now directing the whole development of that community in a new direction, in a new area. The whole tendency for development is going to be towards the new area, for the younger element in the population, while the new expenditure and development of amenities will also be directed to that area. The well-developed area of Woodlands is going to find itself lagging and dragging behind. The hon. the Minister may say that this is a matter for another department, namely the Department of Community Development, but he cannot get away from it that the planning of that area has come under his department.</p>

<p>There arises a further problem, a problem which relates to the area of White ground which is now being zoned for Coloured occupation. I want to ask the hon. the Minister if he will just tell me how the change-over is going to take place. He zoned the area K2 and K3 for Coloured occupation. It is adjacent to an area which is already in the possession of the municipality of Pietermaritzburg. The municipality tells me it is likely to take eight years before they come up to the boundary of the area which is at present under private White ownership. I think it is encumbent on the hon. the Minister to sort out in some way or other the purchase of that land in White hands; because he will thereby avoid two problems. The first problem is that private people, who may be Coloured people, may act for large financial interests and acquire this land in order to undertake all kinds of development. This is then going to complicate the problem of the City Council of Pietermaritzburg. Already my people are being told that they can sell now immediately to Coloured people. I think this is something the hon. the Minister should be aware of. Unless there is going to be an overall plan, unless it is frozen, so that planning has to take place from one end to the other, he may well find himself with a lot of hotch-potch planning going on there because of the fact that that ground is being made available for private purchase by private interests.</p>

<p>The second point I want to make is this: If it is going to take a number of years for that ground to come into use, the only way in which justice can be done to the present owners, is to value the ground now, today. When it is required and taken over, they should be paid today&#x2019;s valuation, plus a percentage of whatever the value of our money will have been decreased, so that when they have to move out of their areas, they can re-establish themselves with a realistic amount for the ground which they have lost. There is one woman who now, for the third time, has to move out of her home, because the area which she occupies has been zoned for another race group. I think it is out of common justice and nothing else that this action should be taken, to value the property as it is now, and when it is required and taken over, there be a bonus or whatever you would like to call it, paid out on the value of the ground.</p>

<p>Then I would like to come very briefly, in the time that is still available to me, to the question of the planning of the Tugela <span class="col_8347-8348" refersTo="page_1128"/>Basin, which I raised earlier this session in a private member&#x2019;s motion. The hon. members for Moorreesburg and Kuruman, and other members too on the other side, have come again with the same story, namely the question of regional planning. I must say that we are absolutely hundred per cent for it; but is it not possible that the regional planning can be taken just that one step further, as in Great Britain, where they are developing areas, new cities by forming a committee or board with executive power and access to funds, which enables them to take the steps, to make the money available for investment and look for industrialists. In this way something can be done in the Tugela Basin. I am referring to the question of the reticulation of purified water. Everyone of those areas today has a problem with the purification of water, but it is possible above the Spioenkop Dam to site one central purification works which would supply by gravity all the towns in the Tugela Basin. If there were an authority which had the money to spend whatever required for a purification works, you would be saving immense duplication. You would be saving all those other local authorities the problems and troubles they have today in the planning they have to do on a piecemeal scale, which could be done so much better in one shot at one central point. I really believe that in planning the regional areas in this country, we have to get to the point where you can give to local communities under the Department of Planning, the means to spend money for the development of those areas on a positive basis, to get the thing going. When we talk about planning, all of us here, the planning seems to go just so far, and then there is a hiatus. Nothing is actually done to take the next step of bringing in the industrialists, of going out to advertise and sell the area and bringing in the work-creating factors you want in every single area where you are going to develop. That hon. Minister&#x2019;s department does the planning. I accept that they have to do the overall siting of the development; but there is a factor which is lacking. I think in Great Britian they have that factor; they have the answer; they have the local board with the authority to spend money, subject to the Minister&#x2019;s permission and under very careful and cautious control. But they still have power to take action. I think this is what we need here very badly, indeed, where we have so many areas which are looking for development and which, in fact, are planned for development, but where we just do not seem to be able to get them going and off the ground.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF PLANNING</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Mooi River has asked me about Bishopstowe. The position is that at Pietermaritzburg the Woodlands Coloured township has been fully built up, so naturally we have to look for an extension. May I say that I do not know offhand when the Woodlands area was proclaimed a Coloured area, but at that time it was deemed sufficient. This shows once again that planning never really ends and that planning must be done on a longterm basis as far as possible. I realize and I concede that you can never plan for all time to come, but by bringing together all the people and all the agencies concerned, you can at least plan for what we can call the foreseeable future. Perhaps that has been one of the deficiencies of our planning set-up in the past, and I will deal with that point before I sit down. The fact of the matter is that Woodlands was fully built up, and the extension to Woodlands was duly considered. I think the hon. member knows that. For very good reasons we decided not to proclaim the extension of Woodlands as a Coloured group area. If we had only needed land for high-class Coloured housing, then we could have done so, because to bring the various services to that area would be very expensive. That is a fact that is conceded all round. But, Sir, we do not only need housing for Coloured people who are well-to-do. We also need sub-economic housing for more or less 45 per cent of the Coloured people, even at Pietermaritzburg.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I will deal with that later on. Naturally, because it was not possible to provide housing for all Coloured persons in what I call the Woodlands extension, we had to look elsewhere, and the only alternative was the Bishopstowe area. We investigated the matter; the group areas hearing was advertised and held, and many people argued the case there. The hon. the <span class="col_8349-8350" refersTo="page_1129"/>Prime Minister received quite a number of letters from that area. He forwarded those letters to me and we discussed them. We now have land available in that area that we can use for the well-to-do Coloured people, as well as for people who require municipal housing under the various housing schemes. My reply to the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District is that that area, which I have not visited myself, can be planned in such a way that we can provide high-class Coloured housing where it extends towards the European area. I personally have requested my colleague, the hon. the Minister of Community Development, to plan the K2 area, which will be developed first, in that way, and then we can have the other Coloured housing at the rear part of that area. I may say in passing that Mr. Howard Odell also wrote a letter to me in which he suggested exactly what I have told the Committee here.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Mooi River asked me what the position was of the people who are at present running the smallholdings at Bishopstowe. They can, of course, sell to a Coloured person, who now becomes a qualified person under the Group Areas Act.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>My officials will make a note of that. We can look into it. It is a question of finance. I would be in favour of acquiring the whole area at once. But it does not in any way hinder our planning; our planning will go on in any case, because everybody in that area now knows what the future of the area is going to be. May I also say to the hon. member for Mooi River that as soon as you proclaim a group area, all the properties in that proclaimed group area are valued as at the date of proclamation. Nobody will be penalized therefore by the fact that a particular area is proclaimed a group area. You can never get less than the valuation as at the date of proclamation. If higher prices are realized&#x2014;and that is so in ten cases out of ten&#x2014;then for a certain period, in terms of the amendment that we passed last year &#x2014;I am not sure whether it is three or five years&#x2014;the owner can retain any book profit over and above the valuation, but thereafter a percentage of the profit must be contributed to the Department of Community Development or to its Board. I am not quite sure how it really works. In any case, I have taken note of the sentiments of hon. members with regard to the Pietermaritzburg area, and since I am also Minister of Coloured Affairs, I will give this matter my close attention.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Randburg spoke with deep seriousness and conviction about pollution. I am going to deal with pollution in a moment, and I hope the hon. member will regard the comments I shall make at the time, as a reply to his speech.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Albany has spoken about the Bushman&#x2019;s River Mouth. Sir, here we have a very good example to show how easily the ecology can be disturbed. When the tide pushes into the river, you find that the river, the sandbanks and everything else behave in a certain way. But a bridge was needed, and a bridge was built there. If anybody had thought at the time that the bridge would have the effect which the hon. member for Albany has mentioned here, then perhaps the bridge would not have been built. The hon. member for South Coast wants an overriding department to look into all these things. Personally, I doubt very much whether you can foresee things like that happening. Before building the Richards Bay harbour, we constructed a model to see how it behaved over a period of time. More than that we cannot do. If we decide to build the Saldanha Bay harbour, we will first of all also construct a model of the harbour at one of our universities to see how that model behaves over a period of time. More than that I do not think we can do.</p>

<speech by="#deacon">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. D. DEACON</person>:</from>

<p>May I point out that the bridge was constructed in a most peculiar way. The river was, in fact, dammed with stone and rubble. The <span class="col_8351-8352" refersTo="page_1130"/>pylons were then put through the dam wall. When they completed the bridge, they tried to take the dam wall away, but they could not remove it all. This is our big complaint.</p>

<p>In any case, as the hon. member has told the House, there has been a report on that area and there is a paragraph or two in the report dealing with this very matter. My department is taking it up with the province. I am sorry that I cannot tell the hon. member more today than the information I have already given him in reply to his question. If any further information becomes available, I shall again communicate with the hon. member.</p>

<p>*Then the hon. member for Kuruman spoke about the enjoyable conference we held at Sishen last year. He also spoke about the development of his part of the world with reference to the proposed Sishen-Saldanha railway line. I can only say that if this undertaking were to be carried out, it would make a contribution to the more balanced development of our country. For that reason we shall probably all watch the course of events in this regard with great interest. Perhaps I may tell the hon. member for Hillbrow straightaway&#x2014; he asked me the other day to what extent my department had been involved in the planning of the Saldanha-Sishen project&#x2014; that the fact of the matter is that we served on the various committees, such as the officials&#x2019; committee and the Cabinet committee, but that we were not in charge of the matter in actual fact. We did not undertake the planning in the sense that we made an economic evaluation of the project. This is a matter which, in my opinion, falls more particularly under my colleague, the Minister of Economic Affairs, under whom Iscor falls. His department must do this especially in co-operation with the Railways and Iscor. However, as soon as such a project is decided upon, the Department of Planning steps in and brings all the planning bodies together so as to have the entire undertaking take place in an orderly way from a planning point of view, and so as to reconcile the various interests with one another.</p>

Furthermore, I want to say that in terms of the Physical Planning Act manufacturing activities in regard to that undertaking must, in any event, come to me if they want to employ Bantu there.

Then he and the Opposition on that side would probably not mind telling us whether they have an obsession in this regard, and what exactly that obsession is. The best example which the hon. member for Florida, who spoke fairly cuttingly about ideology or ideals, could quote of an ideological piece of legislation in my department, was the Physical Planning Act, according to his reasoning. In the same breath he appealed to me to use the Physical Planning Act in order to rectify what was bothering him in his constituency.</p>

<p>In any event, I shall examine the matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Somerset East spoke about the depopulation of the rural areas in the Eastern Cape and in the Midlands. He did so with deep understanding. I can tell the hon. member that I have much <span class="col_8353-8354" refersTo="page_1131"/>sympathy with him. I also come from the rural areas; I also come from a small place. The position is that there are several aspects to this matter. The depopulation of the rural areas, or let us rather say the urbanization of the people of the world, also of our country, is a phenomenon of our times for which there are many reasons and causes which I do not want to go into now. However, it is a fact of modern times and the modern economy with which we have to live; and not only the economy, but also other aspects are involved. To mention only one, in the years in which I was active in organized agriculture, development association, etc., I cannot remember one area in South Africa in which the people did not exert themselves to get tarred roads. Nowhere was there such a place. Everyone asked: &#x201C;Tarred roads, please! &#x201D; One of the biggest factors which contributed towards prejudicing the rural areas in the economic sense, was the tarred road and the motor car.</p>

<p>In our times we also have the phenomenon of smaller families. In the area in which my farm is situated, namely Prieska, I can mention one farm after the other to you where the previous generation of people &#x2014;this is my father&#x2019;s generation&#x2014;had six, seven or nine children a farm.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#member">

<p>Twelve.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I do not know of one farm in that area with less than six; nor do I know of any farm more than nine. Today there are two farms where there is only one child and a few where there are two children. This phenomenon occurs throughout the country. The largest number I know of, are four children. In other words, this is one of the reasons why the population of the rural areas has decreased. What is the result of this? The numbers attending school decrease. There are fewer teachers teaching in the towns. As a result of all the tarred roads, etc., the people sent their children to the big schools; this is the position. Consequently the bank handles fewer accounts and also employs fewer clerks. Therefore this is a process which never ends. We also find that the people buy only the essential things in the towns. They buy the better type of article further away in the bigger towns. We also find that the farmers have made this same mistake with their own cooperative societies, and that one merely has to write a letter to the co-operative societies in Port Elizabeth or wherever and they forward one a windmill, a galvanized iron dam and the fencing material for making camps. One no longer goes to the local shopkeeper. The State cannot stimulate development and industrial activity in every town. It is quite impossible. I feel that to a certain extent the remedy is in the hands of the State and I do not want to evade that responsibility. We are in fact giving attention to this matter and are trying to establish at least growth points or rather development points in the rural areas, depending on circumstances. Later I want to deal with that as well. To a certain extent the remedy is in the hands of the residents of those various towns. Let us beautify our towns. Let us keep the taxes as low as possible. Let us give them good sporting facilities. If a man accepts employment in the magistrate&#x2019;s office in such a town and there is a nice tennis court or tennis courts and a grass field on which he can play rugby, etc., then he goes back and tells the people: &#x201C;I enjoyed living in Jamestown,&#x201D; or in Cathcart, or wherever. I want to say only one thing before I proceed. If our people &#x2014;and I have already referred to this&#x2014;in the rural areas today spend all the money produced there, namely salaries, wages, wool, sheep for slaughter, mohair, or whatever, in those towns, hon. members would be surprised how the economy of those towns would revive.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for South Coast has again spoken on the subject of pollution of the environment. I shall speak on that later as I have something to say in that regard. What I have to say will answer some of the questions which he has raised. Then I shall also deal with the matter of co-ordination which he has spoken about. The hon. member has said that they on that side of the House, the Opposition, have been stressing this and that for so long. That may be correct, but we on this side of the House have also for a long time been fully aware of every challenge that modern times hold out to us. Nobody has the idea, as the hon. member has said that the ocean is a bottomless pit. Things have already come to a sad stage where the ocean has been used as a dumping place by many. In this sense it is not only a national but also an international problem. However I shall come back to that later on. There is only one thing I wish to comment on now. When he spoke about research, the hon. member said: &#x201C;How woefully behind the times are we.&#x201D; <span class="col_8355-8356" refersTo="page_1132"/>I suggest to the hon. member that that statement is completely untrue and unfounded. I, as Minister of Planning, have the CSIR under me and it is my experience that our scientists are of the best in the world.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>With respect, Mr. Chairman, you must allow me to correct the hon. the Minister. I have never said that we are woefully behind the times. I asked that more money should be made available for the geochemistry research at the universities seeing that the CSIR and all similar bodies came under his control. I pointed out how our young scientists were staying here in South Africa and also said how grateful we were that this was the case when so many were leaving to go overseas. However, I never said that we were behind the times in our research.</p>

<p>Yes, that is so. In regard to the moon rock, I do not know what the situation is. It was quite disturbing for me to read in the newspapers that the sample of moon rock was returned to the United States. I think it is a matter which we can go into. I shall certainly speak to the president of the CSIR, when next I see him, about this matter. I know that Parliament votes money for the CSIR and the CSIR on its turn makes various amounts of money available for our universities for research in various directions. I am not so sure whether they stipulate to which areas of research these funds must go. However, I think they do because they are the coordinating body in this regard. I can also say that my experience is that our scientists, and also the scientists of the CSIR, are very much sought after throughout the world; they are very highly regarded.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Marico spoke about the Western Transvaal, that beautiful part of the world. South Africa is an extensive country and its need is great. The State does not have unlimited amounts to spend, and I think that we in this House should never lose sight of the interest of our economy as a whole. I shall speak about the question of decentralization in a moment. The hon. member knows that his town is on the list of decentralization points &#x2026;</p>

<p>The hon. member says he is grateful for it. In fact, the hon. member pleaded&#x2014;so it seemed to me&#x2014;for a real development. In this regard he said we should go far away. That is true, but if one has to go far away, there are many places to which one could go. The further away one goes, the more expensive it becomes. The result is that it would not be so easy. However, I listened attentively to what the hon. member said and in a moment I shall say more about decentralization.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Benoni spoke about pollution. I took note of what he said. I shall come back to this subject in a moment.</p>

<p>In my opinion the hon. member for Winburg made a wellreasoned and responsible speech in which he advanced strong and sound arguments for the policy of decentralization.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I now come to the hon. member for Constantia. He said that there was room for considerable improvement in our statistical services. The hon. member has only made one point, and he was at pains to say that he was only making that one point, namely there were some delays with regard to the information which we collect and make available to the country. In my view this is a most important department. You cannot go forward in any modern State or economy unless you have up-to-date statistical information which tells you all the time where you are going and enables you to adjust your policies and your course according to what is required.</p>

<p>The hon. member has quoted from the quarterly buletin of statistics and has compared that bulletin with the quarterly bulletin of the Reserve Bank which is published a bit later, but, according to the hon. member, <span class="col_8357-8358" refersTo="page_1133"/>more or less at the same time. I want to say to the hon. member that apart from the quarterly bulletin we also publish a bulletin of short-term economic indicators. The hon. member mentioned a few subjects on which he feels we are lagging behind, e.g. exports and imports, consumer spending, sales of motor vehicles, the consumers&#x2019; price index and persons employed in industry. The position is, however, that these matters are dealt with in our monthly bulletin of short-term economic indicators. If the hon. member compares the figures in the monthly bulletin with those in the Reserve Bank&#x2019;s bulletin, he will notice that the Reserve Bank obtains its figures from us. Therefore we cannot be lagging behind, certainly not as far as our monthly bulletin is concerned.</p>

<p>I can only say, as far as the Statistical Council is concerned, that the little experience I have of it convinces me that this is a most fruitful body in the set-up of statistics and we value its contribution highly. It is so, as the hon. member pointed out, and I remember it too, that in 1971 the re-appointment of this council was held in abeyance for a few months. There were certain reasons for that, but apart from that, the council is now functioning normally and I can only say that we cannot do without it. It is an overall body which is of the great assistance to me as Minister and to the Secretary of the department.</p>

<p>*While dealing with the Department of Statistics, I should like to ask that you, Sir, must just allow me to say something here today in regard to Mr. Botha, who has been Secretary of the Department of Statistics since 1969. He became Secretary of Statistics in 1969 after the Bureau of Statistics had attained the higher status of Department of Statistics. Mr. Botha will retire from the Service at the end of the year. I should like to thank Mr. Botha for the services he rendered to the State during the time he was a civil servant and particularly during the time he was Secretary of Statistics. I should like to say here today that Mr. Botha has been of great value to me, as Minister, because of the willingness and the kindness he showed me. In every respect he has assisted me as well as he was able, and that was very well. I also know that Mr. Botha went out of his way to furnish members of this House, including members of the Opposition, with the best information whenever they required it. As Mr. Botha will retire at the end of the year we should like to convey to him our gratitude and wish him a pleasant retirement. I do not yet know who is going to succeed him; it will be announced, in the Press in due course.</p>

<p>I take it that the hon. member for Hillbrow is acquainted with the various publications which have already been published. A considerable amount of preliminary information has already been published. The first result was published on 26th September, 1970. After that we published a census booklet which showed the various population groups in every district in the country. That was published in February, 1971. Between 5th April, 1971 and 14th June, 31 statistical news reports were issued of the population according to ethnic units in residential areas in urban as well as rural areas in respect of major districts. In August a further 31 news reports were issued also containing information about White, Coloured and Asiatic families. These concerned their houses and other dwellings, respectively. We also issued quite a number of reports on a random test basis in respect of ages and educational qualifications. We also issued five reports on professions, trades, income, marital status and church denominations. This information will be published during this year. As far as the other information is concerned, 400 million replies were received from the census. This information has been codified and has already been fully recorded on magnetic tape. This information will be made public as it becomes available. I cannot tell the hon. member anything more at this stage. However, I am satisfied that comparable work in respect of the previous census took three years to complete, and this work has been completed within the first 18 months. There can be no doubt about this. We <span class="col_8359-8360" refersTo="page_1134"/>shall release any further deductions made from the census as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hercules apologized for not being able to be present here. I just want to tell him that the Stand-fontein industrial area has its problems. The fact of the matter is, however, that this area has been zoned as an industrial area years ago. People have bought industrial land there. However, it is also a fact that this Moot area is particularly suitable for residential extension and the problem of pollution will have to be considered very carefully there. However, we are preparing an overall plan for the whole of the Pretoria City Council area and we are in the process of drafting legislation, and it is possible that the hon. member will learn something from this. It is also possible that if industrial land is made available elsewhere, the industrialist who will have to move from the Sandfontein area may be told that he can obtain land elsewhere and asked whether he will be prepared to accept such land. However, I shall give careful consideration to the hon. member&#x2019;s request. He pleaded that the White/Bantu labour ratio should be very strictly maintained there and I am in a position to give him such an undertaking. If we approve any industries there, we will watch the pollution aspect very carefully because this area is situated on the western side of Pretoria and consequently an industry which will cause air pollution, and so forth, simply cannot be allowed there.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District asked me why the Government does not create growth points within the homelands, but I want to tell him that the Government has created growth points in the Bantu areas. Babalegi is one. Then there is Butterworth, Sitebe and others. There are already four growth points in the Bantu areas. In the same breath the hon. member asked me why we created only growth points in the border areas. The fact that the hon. member asked me why only growth points there, implies that he is in favour of growth points in the border areas.</p>

<p>I should very much like to say a few words on the subject of the environment. This is of course a problem with which the world has to contend today, one which is being experienced everywhere. There are various reasons for this. The basic reason for this problem today is the unparalleled population increase in the world. It was said here that the world population consists of 3 700 million people. It is increasing, so I have been informed&#x2014;at a rate of two million people per week. By the end of the century, therefore, the population will have doubled. Then we will have 7 500 million people in the world. If one then takes that theoretical projection&#x2014;I shall have to call it a &#x201C;theoretical projection&#x201D;&#x2014;to be a doubling, say, every 25 years, one is soon confronted by an alarming situation. These people have to be fed. Where must the food come from? Suppose one is able to work out a system according to which the food which is available is brought to the people, which is not the case today, then all the food in the world will, within the foreseeable future, be insufficient for all the people in the world. One will have to chop down forests where there are still forests standing today, one shall have to use open spaces to produce food, one shall have to use insecticides and sprays to protect the crops to produce food for all these people, and one will possibly have to set a limit to what the environment can carry, beyond which the environmental equilibrium will be disturbed completely.</p>

<p>A second basic cause of this problem is the fantastic technological development which has taken place in the world. All kinds of methods have been devised to tap and exploit all the resources of the earth. Methods have been devised to manufacture anything which may mankind wants in his factories, which are increasing hand over fist. Allied to this&#x2014;something we have already discussed&#x2014;is the large-scale urbanization which is taking place in the world. Then one finds that over-concentration causes pollution. It causes a lot of transport problems, and this major problem confronting the world today also manifests itself in a lot of there phenomena. We must look to our environment, to the quality of our environment, the habitat in which we are living, and it is now or never. There are of course certain aspects which are of an international nature, but I do not want to discuss these now. The same applies, to a certain extent, to atmospheric pollution. In June this year a major international conference on the environment is to be held in Stockholm. South Africa will also be represented there, and we hope to acquire a great deal of important information. Sir, we in South Africa are also, to a greater or lesser extent, experiencing these problems. Our land is becoming scarcer and the claims on land are increasing all the time. Take for example the urban complexes. Where must the people live; where must the people work; where must we situate our factories; what must be left as open spaces; where must people practise their sport; where must we produce our foodstuffs? The claims on the soil of South Africa are increasing by the day. We also have to deal with the problem of pollution. We are fully aware of it. We, too, already have pollution of our ocean, pollution of our atmosphere, and pollution of our rivers. Our scenic attractions and our beautiful plantlife are being threatened in many ways, and even getting rid of waste is already a problem today. But if all of us can give attention to this problem, if we can all cooperate&#x2014;the authorities, every organization in this country and every private individual&#x2014;then South Africa is still in the fortunate position that we are still able to save a great deal; we still have enough left to save. The Government is thoroughly aware of the need to conserve the environment and combat pollution. In addition we welcome the actions of many organizations which already exist in South Africa and which are paying special attention to making our population environment-conscious.</p>

<p>Sir, when we discussed the motion of the hon. member for South Coast here this year, I said that the Government was devoting attention to its machinery in this connection, and I am now able to inform the hon. member and the Committee that the Government has already established a Cabinet <span class="col_8363-8364" refersTo="page_1136"/>Committee on Environmental Conservation. This Cabinet Committee, which will be a permanent Cabinet Committee, will function under the chairmanship of the Minister of Planning, and on it will serve the Minister of Transport, the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Economic Affairs and the Minister of Water Affairs. As chairman of that committee, I shall do the work, and I shall, on behalf of the Committee, report and be accountable to the Cabinet and to Parliament. The work of this Cabinet Committee will be to maintain over-all supervision and to give attention to both the positive and the negative aspects of the environment, i.e. conservation and pollution. In addition its work will be to ensure co-ordination; to identify spheres of action and research and give attention to this, and to cope with problems experienced by any organization. Besides this Cabinet Committee on Environmental Conservation, a South African Committee on Environmental Conservation has been established. The chairman of this Committee will be the Secretary for Planning. and representatives of the Departments of Transport, Agricultural Technical Services, Labour, Bantu Administration, Mining. Health, Community Development, Industries. Forestry and Water Affairs will serve on it, together with representatives of all four provinces, and a representative of South-West Africa, and of the CSIR. This committee will work under and be directly responsible to the Cabinet Committee on Environmental Conservation. In practice, therefore, the Committee will be responsible to me as Minister of Planning. I should also like this Committee to submit regularly, as a matter of routine, their work to the Planning Advisory Council for discussion and comment. My department will supply the working staff for this Committee. This Committee is able to naminate subcommittees to investigate specific aspects of the conservation of or damage to the environment. Local town councils may be co-opted, and universities may be co-opted. Sir, I shall expect this committee to be very active and productive. The eyes and the hopes of many are fixed on it. We in South Africa, as I have said, are still in a fortunate position, but there is a great deal to be done, a great deal to conserve, to prevent and to restore. I shall expect the Committee to submit reports and make recommendations to me, regularly which I will then in turn submit to the Cabinet, and in regard to which I shall, on suitable occasions, report to Parliament. Sir, in this connection I just want to inform the Committee what they are doing in England. It was with great pleasure that I read this pamphlet. <i>The Human Environment: The British View,</i> published by the Department of Environment. In a foreword, Mr. Heath stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A detailed and pratical interest in the quality of the life we lead is central to the philosophy of this Government. We are conscious that alongside a desire for rising standards of living, there has grown up a fear that we might be destroying with one hand what we are creating with the other; that we might find we have only achieved rising material standards at the cost of producing a country about which, in terms of amenities, we were no longer enthusiastic.</block>

<p>Then they go on to state&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All species, including Man, are creatures of their environment, but Man alone has the power to transform the world he lives in for better or for worse. We have only one world to pollute. If this one is ruined, we have no other.</block>

<p>But what I actually wanted to quote is the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To that end, the world&#x2019;s first central Department of Environment, from the three former Ministeries of Transport, Housing and Local Government and Public Building and Work was established in 1970.</block>

<p>Yes, with its own Minister, under a single Secretary of State; it now includes the Departments of Transport, Housing and Local Government, Public Building and Works. The various other Ministeries are then mentioned, and the forms of pollution that they are dealing with: Agriculture. Fisheries and Food&#x2014; Control of Pesticides; Industry and Shipping&#x2014;Oil Pollution at Sea; Labour, with regard to employment in factories; Education and Science&#x2014;Research Councils and so on. Then it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">These departments retain their own special sectoral functions. When the Department <span class="col_8365-8366" refersTo="page_1137"/><span class="col_8365-8366" refersTo="page_1138"/>of Environment was created in November, 1970, it would have been neither sensible nor possible to bring together in one department everything to do with a subject so all-embracing as the environment.</block>

<p>*Then mention is made here of regional structure plans. These are all things on which we are also working. Then I just want to quote the following from page 41, where they give their summary&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have long since recognized that Central Government alone can determine national strategy and must retain a continuing oversight of surveys, of monitoring, pollution control and planning, but we have learned that, as far as possible, the actual work should be decentralized to local authorities and left to the man on the spot.</block>

<p>Apart from the fact that they call this department the Department of Evironment, and that this department also includes Transport and Community Development, they have precisely the same approach there as we in South Africa have. I hope I shall be able to convince the Committee in this respect.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Please, I hope you will.</p>

<p>*Mr. The Minister Chairman, I have said before, and I say again today, that except in name, the Department of Planning is already the Department of the Environment in any case, seen from the positive angle of the conservation of the environment and its quality. The conservation of the environment lies in the first place in good and sound planning. These people say the same thing. It lies in the first place in correct planning, i.e. how we should utilize the land, the soil and natural resources, where the people should live, work and find recreation, where the industries of different kinds should be located, taking into consideration atmospheric pollution, where the roads and feeder routes should run, where airports should be situated, and where open spaces should be left. All this links up with proper urban and countrywide planning.</p>

<p>In this regard I should like to say something further, for I think that this is of tremendous importance. I should like to say something about urban planning. Urban planning is being done by us today under our system of guide plan committees. The work of these guide plan committees is of a co-ordinating nature. We bring together all the people who work and plan in the city areas, and have functions to perform there, i.e. the local authority, the province and the various departments with their planning divisions and their consultants. We bring them together on this guide planning committee for that urban area. Then they sit down around a table, and between them make adjustments to one another&#x2019;s plans. Each one knows what the other is working on. We are trying to compile a master-plan, as I have already said, for up to and including the year 2000. They set about it in this way: They take a map and on it they fill in the existing developments; then they take another map and on it they fill in the planning which each of them foresees for the future. Then they reconcile these to one another until they eventually agree on a line of development as far as they can envisage, up to and including the year 2000. We then try to steer the existing development gradually in that direction, and adjust it accordingly. These guide plans which are prepared, as I have said, by these people, are subsequently released for general information. I should just like to say now that what we are doing here is not merely an idealistic endeavour, up in the clouds. We take into account present reality. We begin and build on the basis of the present reality to <span class="col_8367-8368" refersTo="page_1139"/>the overall ideal which we may have. We are not envisaging a static planning situation either. Planning is not a static matter. Planning is never final. It has to be adjusted and changed continually in the light of circumstances. As long as everyone gets together and everyone makes the adjustments together we can in this way go ahead in a very orderly way. I should also like to say that this overall guide planning is not detailed planning. It is merely a guide plan. The detailed planning I leave to the provinces and the local authorities.</p>

<p>This is now the machinery which is being created. These guide plans, when they have been provisionally drawn up, come to me. After that I send them to the Administrator, and I ask the Administrator what he thinks of them. We then publish it for general information and only then do I give my final approval. Such guide plans committees are already at work in most of our metropolitan areas. In the second place, we come to the detailed planning under the guide plans. This is done by the provinces and the local authorities, as I have already said. I should like to see them&#x2014;not to approve or to disapprove of them&#x2014;but to see whether they are in line with the overall guide plan. When we come to regional planning, I want to say that this is a task of my department in conjunction with the province. In some cases we tell the province to draw up that regional plan for us. I should like to approve it eventually. It is implemented by the province and the local authority. So I can proceed to national planning, but I want to conclude by saying that I think what we are working on here is something very good. If we are able to achieve success with this urban planning through our guide plan committees and the regional planning, I think we could have fewer snarl-ups in future than we have had in the past. We will then be getting away from <i>ad hoc</i> planning; then we will be bringing together everyone engaged in planning and we will be devising a joint pattern for the future.</p>

<p>Then, before I resume my seat, I should just like to say something in brief about the economic development programme and the decentralization programme. I have already said that the economic development programme is a task of my department. We must prepare it, but we are not laying down economic policy. We do not correct the course of the economy by means of financial, fiscal and monetary measures. That is the task of my colleague, the hon. the Minister of Finance. We take the different sectors, as they present themselves, and we bring everything together and indicate how the different sections of the economy should make their contributions if we want to achieve a specific growth rate. We have established that South Africa can and ought to achieve a growth rate of 5| per cent. If we achieve one which is less than that, we will have trouble, and if we achieve one which is more than that, we will also have trouble. Occasionally the hon. member for Hillbrow has asked why we cannot have a growth rate of 8 per cent and even more. We could probably achieve a growth rate of 8 per cent and more in this country, but then we would have to bring in 120 000 and more immigrants per annum. Otherwise we would not be able to do so.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>That is according to your opinion.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, we will not be able to do so, or else we will have to bring in the non-Whites on a very large scale, on an uncontrolled scale&#x2014;how I do not know&#x2014;to do all the work which has to be done. On the other hand we can grow at a rate of 5| per cent per annum on our present basis, without disturbing relations. In that process we are also able to eliminate unemployment among the other population groups. Therefore we have gone so far, and this is the work of my Department of Economic Planning and of myself, to say from time to time how we should operate in order to maintain that growth rate. I just want to say that we on this side of the House are thoroughly aware of the fact, the hon. member for Rustenburg also mentioned this, that South Africa should have a strong economy. We have been saying this for years and are working towards that end. There are so many things I could enumerate which are dependent on a strong economy, things which make it absolutely essential that our economy should be a strong one. We have also said that we want a policy of balanced development for our country. We realize that if all economic development and activities were to take place only in certain areas of our country we would in future be faced with social problems. We would have certain political problems, and we would also have economic problems. That is why it is the policy of this side of the House to see whether South Africa cannot <span class="col_8369-8370" refersTo="page_1140"/>develop in as balanced a way as possible throughout the whole of the Republic. Now, that is not so easy to achieve, but we can at least try to accomplish this. One of the ways in which we can do so is by means of our decentralization programme. The Government made a start with this in 1960. From time to time certain areas, which are border areas, were then designated where it was possible to do this. The Government tried to get development under way there. Subsequently it was also decided that this development could be moved to other areas, areas which were at a remove from the border areas. These areas were called decentralized areas. So the pattern of border and decentralized areas developed in time. I want to state today that the Government will adhere to this undertaking which it has given to these areas, i.e. the border and decentralized areas. In due course these areas came to be known in common parlance as growth points, and now we have had the Riekert White Paper. In this White Paper it was specially recommended that a Growth Point Committee be established to determine specifically in which areas the Government should make a co-ordinated, special attempt to promote and stimulate development. I repeat that the Government will carry out every undertaking, in so far as such an undertaking was given, in regard to the present areas which have developed since 1962 and are on the list. But as far as the new growth points are concerned, they will in future be specially selected areas or points where we will, with a co-ordinated, concentrated effort, try to set a particular kind of development in motion. Such growth points are for example the Rustenburg area, the Brits area, Ladysmith and Newcastle in Natal, and the East London/Berlin area, as well as those four areas in the Bantu homelands which I mentioned to the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District when I replied to his speech. I shall within the next few weeks issue a statement in which I shall deal with this matter in greater detail.</p>

<p>I come now to the Physical Planning Act. We have in this process tried to utilize the Act to promote this industrial decentralization. I said from the very first day, and before me the hon. the Minister of Finance said this as well&#x2014;the Government has said this throughout&#x2014;that we will not allow the present development in the metropolitan areas to be prejudiced, for they are the areas which contribute the most to the growth rate of our country. They are also the areas which will in future make the greatest contribution, and that is why I said this. I think the hon. member for Hillbrow was at the Wanderers&#x2019; Club the evening I repeated this statement before the industrialists of South Africa. That is why we have in fact adjusted the administration of the Physical Planning Act and we shall, as far as it is necessary, adjust it. But I should like to say here this evening that we will not do the one thing and omit to do the other. We do not know where the Opposition stands, but we have our machinery. We have a Cabinet Committee, secondly we have a Decentralization Council, and thirdly we have a Growth Point Committee. But in his speech on Friday the hon. member for Hillbrow said: &#x201C;You must scrap the lot.&#x201D;</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The two bodies, in each case, have specific, separate functions. They have their distinct functions which they fulfil. The one operates, for very good reasons, under the chairmanship of the Secretary for Planning, and the other, again for very good reasons, under the chairmanship of the Secretary for Industries. The one works with the industrialist and the other with the development of areas. This is the reason; this is the reply; and I cannot understand why hon. members on that side laughed about this just <span class="col_8371-8372" refersTo="page_1141"/>now. I now want to refer to one specific area, namely the Eastern Cape. I am referring to the area from Queenstown via Stutterheim, King William&#x2019;s Town, Berlin down to East London. I still say that we should make that part of our country strong. We must develop that part, which is situated between two Bantu homelands, and make it very strong. We have stated how we are going to do this, and we are continually being criticized by the Opposition in this regard. We have said it, the country knows it, and we are already in the process of doing so. We are doing what we can in East London, and we are already at work in Berlin. When we have finished there we will give further attention to King William&#x2019;s Town and Queenstown. But I should very much like to know whether or not the Opposition wants to develop that area.</p>

<p>Well then, the Opposition wants to develop it, but the Opposition states that one can only have decentralization if it is economic. Now I want to put this question to any hon. member on the opposite side: What industrialist from Johannesburg will go and establish himself there? Let me hear what they say. What industrialist will move away from his market, where he can load up his goods outside his door and deliver them directly at the door of his client, where a person erecting a block of flats can telephone him and ask him whether he can deliver a hundred doors on Monday morning? That is economic. Those hon. members say that decentralization can only take place if it is economic decentralization. There is no such thing. There is no such thing anywhere in the world. How will Queenstown be able to establish the infrastructure there in an economic way at an interest rate of 8&#x00BD; per cent? How will Queenstown be able to do it? Where did East London&#x2019;s water come from? What is happening at Berlin? Ask that hon. member. How can this take place on an economic basis? But those people believe only in economic decentralization.</p>

<p>I think that I have with this replied to the question of our standpoint in regard to the economic development programme and in regard to the Physical Planning Act. The Opposition will simply have to take it or leave it. We have discussed these things many times, but we and they will differ over the Physical Planning Act. We shall apply it as circumstances teach us from time to time, but to us the Act will remain an instrument with which we can counteract overconcentration and with which we should like to accomplish a more balanced development in South Africa. With these few words I want to thank the Committee for the discussion on the Planning Vote.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it may be as well in starting our discussion on the Coloured Affairs Vote this year to make it quite clear that the Coloured people are bitterly disillusioned at the present time and that one finds this everywhere throughout South Africa. One of the reasons is that they do not know where they stand and we make a very grave mistake in thinking that the political differences between them outweigh those upon which they have a lot of common ground. Their grievances today form the basis of what cohesion exists between them. Broadly speaking, of course, the Federal Party, which tends to be more conservative &#x2014;it is described as more conservative than the Labour Party&#x2014;relies for most of its support upon the lower income groups, the working class folk, who normally are divorced from the whole business of politics. That does not mean that the Federal Party does not have many highly intelligent and perceptive leaders amongst them. But if I am not mistaken the Coloured intelligentsia representing a highly articulate and qualified section of the Coloured community largely support the Labour Party, and they tend to be more radical in their approach. However, let us not make any mistake; there is a very broad consensus between both parties. It was Mr. Tom Swartz himself. Chairman of the Coloured Representative Council and of the Executive Committee and head of the Federal Party, who said in a Press statement on April 19 this year, and I quote, &#x201C;that his party rejects all the negative discriminatory aspects of the Government&#x2019;s policy and will oppose them firmly&#x201D;. The tragedy is that the Government continues to place its main emphasis, in dealing with Coloured people, upon what it chooses to call the elimination of friction.</p>

<p>This, of course, is a major fiction; it is a myth, because by not entrusting the Coloured people, in spite of all the promises to them over the years, with even as much power as is currently being exercised by the Bantu people and the Indians, particularly in the field of local government, all the Government had done is to raise the degree of friction between the Coloured people and ourselves to wellnigh breaking point today. [Interjections.] Hon. members might be polite enough to let me make my speech. It is a major <span class="col_8375-8376" refersTo="page_1143"/>tragedy of South African politics that such an overwhelming vote of no confidence in our Coloured people and their leaders should have been made manifest at the very moment in our history when circumstances demand otherwise. Let the Government stand indicted, Sir, for there is no longer unlimited time&#x2014;of that I am convinced- in which to grasp the hand of friendship and to get these people working with us for the country&#x2019;s sake as well as for the sake of everybody in the country. Patronage and condescension, the old patriarchal approach, will no longer do. The younger generation of Coloured people are openly hostile today&#x2014;not so much towards the Whites as such, but to the whole establishment. They do not know us for a start. There are no longer normal channels of communication open to-day. I want to warn the Government and particularly this hon. Minister &#x2014;That if there should ever be a confrontation in this country between Black and White, in other words, a polarization of attitudes which is becoming increasingly apparent, not one single Coloured person in South Africa would stand with us. We live in a fool&#x2019;s paradise if we think otherwise.</p>

<p>Just what is this Government doing about giving the Coloured people the two main things they most need? One is a degree of meaningful power and the other is drawing them into the administrative process in order to help us run the country.</p>

<p>*Mr. Chairman, I should like to say something in regard to citizenship as far as our Coloured people are concerned. Full citizenship basically means the exercise of civil, political and social rights on a basis of equality by citizens of the country. It is an indisputable fact that the Coloured population does not enjoy full citizenship at all, in spite of the fact that they are citizens of the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I cannot understand why it is that this Government always equates citizenship with integration. That approach, it seems to me, is calculated to confuse the whole issue. I believe it is done on purpose, if you want to know the truth, Sir,</p>

<p>*Already there is a strong feeling of frustration and hate about the matter on the part of the intelligentsia among them. The hon. the Minister knows this. It is often suggested that parallel development allows self-determination. particularly within the framework of the Government&#x2019;s concept of multiracialism. But if the Government rejects a Coloured homeland, it is logical to accept, as our party accepts, that the Coloured population must share in the decisions taken by the Government, and that the Coloured Persons Representative Council should develop into an autonomous body with powers to take decisions concerning the Coloured community itself. Therefore it is essential that many more Coloured people be engaged on all levels and in statutory bodies which deal with matters concerning the well-being of their own people in particular. Only in this way political participation will achieve its aim as far as the Coloured people are concerned. The point I should like to make is that the Coloured community feels today that it has reached a position of stalemate, and that dangerous signs of frustration are discernible among its people. Those of us who are in close touch with members of the Coloured community are becoming more apprehensive about this every single day.</p>

<p>The late Dr. Verwoerd made a clear promise to the Coloured population when he addressed the Union Council of Coloured Affairs in December, 1961. He said&#x2014;and I quote (translation)&#x2014;</p>
