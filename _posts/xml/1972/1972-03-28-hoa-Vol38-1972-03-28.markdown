<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. S. F. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as a person who has over the years taken an intense interest in the expansion and the development of the mining industry, particularly when it intrudes into the sphere of agriculture, I should like to avail myself of this opportunity of congratulating the hon. the Minister and his department on this new and more realistic approach to the problems of agriculture when it is practised intensively and simultaneously in the same sphere as mining. In this Amendment Bill a glimmering through of a more sympathetic, more practical and more realistic approach on the part of the Department of Mines to the problems with which the agriculturist has to contend when mining operations take place on his property may be observed.</p>

<p>In particular I want to congratulate the landowners of South-West Africa on a few particularly accommodating amendments which are contained in this legislation in regard to their interests and bargaining rights. Initially the principal elements in the mining industry are always on the one hand the company or mine-owner, who can also be the prospector, and on the other hand the landowner who in the rural areas is usually a farmer. However, there is also a third element and that is the owner of the mineral rights. In South-West Africa that owner is exclusively the State. In South Africa it may be the State or any other <span class="col_4281-4282" refersTo="page_0603"/>person or body that acquired those rights lawfully. It is clear that an attempt is being made, through the amendments contained in this legislation, to look after the interests of all the parties in question in a more satisfactory way. Settlement possibilities are being established in that a procedure is being laid down in terms of which conflicting interests may be settled in a more satisfactory way. I think this is the intention of this legislation and the effect which it will have.</p>

<p>Inevitably we have found in the past that legislation was for the most part and almost exclusively established to further the interests of mining and to eliminate all obstacles which could have the effect of retarding the smooth functioning and practice of mining operations. That is why it is a glad day for us as farmers, who, with the expansion of the mining industry, have to cope with&#x2014;in the rural areas as well&#x2014; prospectors and mining interests who are acquiring more and more rights on our farms, to note that a change and a new approach is now discernible. What may be noted in regard to this legislation is that the hon. the Minister stated specifically, clearly and encouragingly in his Second Reading speech, that consultations were held in advance with the Agricultural Union of South-West Africa and that the draft Bill was submitted to them for their criticism and recommendations in order to protect agricultural interests. In the second place it seems as if a golden mean between the conflicting interests of farming and mining was earnestly sought in this Amendment Bill. If one reads through the legislation it is clear that an attempt is being made to protect the interests of all the parties concerned. In clause 1 we read how the interests of the mine-owner are being taken into account by the fact that he is being afforded more space on which to erect buildings such as administrative buildings, and so on. There is a whole series of accommodating provisions in this legislation in respect of the mine-owner or prospector in the first instance, but the amendments to which I want to refer and to which I want to draw attention, are those in regard to the surface owner, namely the farmer. This amendment is contained in clause 3, which now provides that no mining operations on ground which has been pegged off as a claim may commence before the directions of section 29 have been complied with. This means that this may not be done before the lawful permit granting such authority has been issued. What is significant in this regard is that that permit may not be issued before a written agreement has been drawn up between the mine-owner or the prospector and the landowner. In this agreement an agreement has to be reached in regard to the way in which that land may be entered upon in so far as it affects the interests of the landowner. This is important, for it is in that very sphere that the conflicts between the two parties occur. They usually clash when the property of the landowner is entered upon and when they both want to exercise their industry intensively on the same property situated between the four corner beacons of the same farm. If there are disputes, provision is being made in this clause, and it is being made clear, that that permit may not be issued before the landowner has been afforded an opportunity of submitting any objections which he may have in writing to the mining commissioner. This accommodation will certainly be an improvement for people in South-West Africa who are concerned with this matter. Then that section also binds the mine-owner so that he may not commence operations before that agreement has been finalized. In the agreement it has to be determined what amount is to be paid, how it is to be paid, how roads are to be laid out, where the Bantu, who will possibly be the employees, are to be settled, and also the many other practical factors which are essential when mining operations are carried out on a property. The last and particularly encouraging indication for me, i.e. the more realistic approach in respect of the conflicts on the contact levels of the agriculture and mining, is contained in clause 10. In terms of this clause the present settlement board&#x2014;previously it consisted of two officials, usually two mining officials who were appointed by the Minister, and the magistrate of the district&#x2014;is now being converted into a settlement board which will in future consist of the magistrate of the district, the Chief Inspector of Mines and the chief extension officer of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services of the specific district. This accommodation is definitely one which I do not find in the legislation applicable to South Africa. It indicates a far more balanced constitution of the settlement board. In the past many landowners had good reason to doubt the impartiality of the findings and the decisions given by the settlement board. I think that this conversion <span class="col_4283-4284" refersTo="page_0604"/>will to a large extent now eliminate the doubt which existed among persons who submitted their disputes to the board. This is also proof that a greater understanding is being displayed by the State in respect of the nature of the problem and conflicts. The agriculturalist who is appointed to that settlement board ought now to display greater understanding in regard to the specific problems with which the farmer, who has to exercise his farming practice intensively, has to cope with. I think that with the application of this Bill many points of friction will be eliminated for landowners in South-West Africa, and that this is also a precursor of amendments which will in future be effected in our legislation in South Africa, so that similar legislation will also be more satisfactory to our people in agriculture in South Africa when mining operations, which are developing and expanding to a tremendous extent, are experienced to an increasing extent in the rural areas.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am aware of the intense interest the hon. member for Marico takes in mining matters. I am also aware of the fact that from time to time he has problems in his own constituency, problems which for the most part we solved satisfactorily. Then, too, I want to say to the hon. member that we have appreciation for the way in which he supports my department and myself in coping with these problems and solving them satisfactorily. The hon. member will also permit me to say that taking into consideration the tremendous scope of mining activities in South Africa, the problems with which we are confronted are relatively minor ones. The second point I should like to mention to the hon. member is that this should not really be accepted, without further ado, as a new approach or a &#x201C;precursor&#x201D;, as the hon. member puts it, as far as the Republic is concerned. The hon. member must realize that the Mines and Works Act, as far as the Republic is concerned, was intensely revised only five years ago and that a tremendous amount of work was done in that respect. Then, too, the situation in the Republic is different to that in South-West Africa, As the hon. member knows this Bill relates only to South-West Africa. In South-West Africa. as the hon. member will also know, the right of prospecting and exploiting vests in the State, while in the Republic of South Africa the landowner still has a say in regard to his own land. The mineral rights may be vested in the possession of the landowner. I know where the problems arise. They arise for the most part where a farmer purchases land in regard to which the mineral rights are vested in another party. We must be very careful that we do not create in South Africa the same systems for the settlement of problems as we have introduced in South-West Africa, since we have a different situation in South-West Africa as far as vested rights are concerned.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. S. F. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>I do think that having an inspector of Agricultural Technical Services will be regarded as a very satisfactory arrangement in the case of such a settlement as well.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but let me make it very clear&#x2014;and I think the hon. member will admit that I am right&#x2014;that we have a great deal of sympathy for the farmer. We have recently and over the years gone a long way out of our way to take the interests of the farmer into consideration as much as possible. However, we also have a national duty not to handicap mining in South Africa unnecessarily. I have just risen to say to the hon. member that this should not necessarily be seen as a precursor to a similar procedure in the Republic as is being followed in South-West Africa. If we were to consider something in this regard we would have to and would want to follow the same procedure as is applicable in South-West Africa, i.e. to consult all the interested parties properly. This takes time and requires a great deal of energy. I want to ask the hon. member, since the legislation in question is only five years old, to leave it at that for the present. I think it works reasonably well. We will give the hon. member all the possible help we can in his own constituency.</p>

<p>Clause 1 :</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, before I move the amendment standing in <span class="col_4285-4286" refersTo="page_0605"/>my name on the Order Paper, I wish to ask the hon. the Minister for clarity in connection with the cyclamates. If I remember correctly, the Minister was not specific yesterday in his reply to the Second Reading debate. He indicated that cyclamates could be controlled under the definition of foodstuffs, but there is concern in certain manufacturing quarters in South Africa about the fact that cyclamates may in fact be controlled by this specific subsection. I wonder whether the Minister could indicate to the Committee whether, in the light of the information now available to him as far as cyclamates are concerned, there is any intention to limit or control their use as a sweetening agent in manufacture. I now move the amendment standing in my name, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 27, after &#x201C;to&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;or implanted in&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I think we will all agree that the definition of &#x201C;cosmetic&#x201D; as it stands now, is a comprehensive one. It reads:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Cosmetic&#x201D; means any article or substance intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled or sprayed on, or otherwise applied to the human body for purposes of cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness or improving or altering the appearance, and includes any part or ingredient of any such article or substance;</block>

<p>There were two aspects which I wished to raise with the hon. the Minister, but I understand that the second one is something which would impinge upon the rights of the medical profession. In terms of that information I do not wish to proceed with that aspect. I believe that the term &#x201C;implant&#x201D; could usefully be added to this definition of &#x201C;cosmetic&#x201D; to deal with the question which is causing a certain amount of concern in medical circles, namely the use of tattooing. During the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Vote last session I was asked by representatives of the medical profession to raise this matter. They had direct experience in which they claimed that the growing incidence of young people resorting to tattooing, could in later years produce psychological problems amongst these people. When they grow older and realize the difficulties encountered in removing the tattoo marks which they had made in their youth, it leads to problems. In his reply to the Vote the hon. the Minister did not comment on this question, and I would therefore like to ask him whether he feels that the clause as it stands, could deal with this matter if it became one of common incidence or whether he feels that by the addition of the word &#x201C;implant&#x201D; the particular case of tattooing would be covered and, if that is the position, whether he would accept the amendment moved by me.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#vosloo">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as I read this clause, I think that the word &#x201C;applied&#x201D; covers all methods of application, whether by implantation, painting on, orally or by whatever method. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister agrees, but to my mind the word &#x201C;applied&#x201D; covers the whole aspect, implantation as well. The hon. member also mentioned tattooing, but there are other types of implants covered by this term. The hon. member will be aware of the fact that many Indian women have tiny pearls or jewels implanted in their skin, <i>inter alia,</i> for the purpose of beautifying themselves. I do not know whether this will satisfy the hon. member. The hon. the Minister may reply to that aspect.</p>

<p>I want to refer once more to what I said during the Second Reading debate in regard to the definition of cosmetic. This definition still puzzles me. It was also quoted by the hon. member for Berea. I quote it once more&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Cosmetic&#x201D; means any article or substance intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled or sprayed on or otherwise applied to the human body for purposes of cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness or improving the appearance &#x2026;</block>

<p>But what rather worries me is, how do we see the human body&#x003F; Do we see the human body in its naked form&#x003F; If I read this correctly, we should also add clothing here. That is also for the purpose of beautifying; for improving one&#x2019;s appearance. We will find ourselves in trouble if we include clothing in this definition. What is our attitude as far as wigs are concerned&#x003F; This is also an agent, a substance or an article used for the purpose of making oneself look younger or beautifying oneself. I do not know whether all of us will benefit from it. I should like to see that we have complete clarity as far as the definition of cosmetics is concerned, whether, for example, it includes articles apart from essential articles one has to have for the sake of decency. I should like to hear the Minister&#x2019;s reply in this respect.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from><span class="col_4287-4288" refersTo="page_0606"/>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member referred to cyclamates. As he would know, &#x201C;cyclamates&#x201D; has already been withdrawn in pursuance of the advice of the World Health Organization.</p>

<p>Now I come to the second point in regard to the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment. I should like to point out to him that, if we widen the level so as to include the words he has composed here, I am afraid that he might, first of all, include certain actions which are not intended to be included in this measure. Secondly, we would land in the field of surgery and of plastic surgery. I should also like to remind the hon. member that section 83 (b) of the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Act&#x2014;I have a copy here and the hon. member can have a look at it&#x2014;does to a certain extent cover that particular matter. We are at the moment revising and rearranging that whole Act in my department, and perhaps we can give specific attention to this matter as it occurs in that particular Act.</p>

<p>The other point I would like to raise with the hon. member is that as far as tattoo ink is concerned, the legal advisers tell me that it is covered by clause 1 (iv). The words &#x201C;otherwise applied&#x201D; would cover the use of tattoo ink. I may just briefly quote the definition&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Cosmetic&#x201D; means any article or substance intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled or sprayed on or otherwise applied to the human body for purposes of cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness or improving or altering the appearance, and includes any part or ingredient of any such article or substance.</block>

<p>I am afraid I cannot accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment on the Order Paper. If I do so, I shall be transgressing on the field of surgery, as I have indicated. Furthermore, I should not like to do anything that would perhaps be in conflict with the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Act. As far as tattoo ink is concerned, which covers, I think, the point the hon. member raised, it is already covered in this particular definition.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Brentwood once again raised the question of the definition of &#x201C;cosmetic&#x201D; and he raised the very interesting question of clothing. I want to tell the hon. member that as the definition reads at present, there can be no doubt that clothing is not included. I think the hon. member will agree with me that none of these words contained in the definition can be construed as referring to clothing. The definition reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Cosmetic&#x201D; means any article or substance intended to be rubbed &#x2026;</block>

<p>I do not think we can rub on clothing&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; poured &#x2026;</block>

<p>Neither can it be poured&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; sprinkled or sprayed on &#x2026;</block>

<p>This we cannot do either&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; or otherwise applied to the human body &#x2026;</block>

<p>Neither do I think that, in view of the meaning of the word &#x201C;applied&#x201D; we can include clothing here. As far as that is concerned, I am therefore quite satisfied that the definition as it reads at present is the best we are able to frame. I may just add that, in drafting this Bill, we not only had at our disposal the experience since 1929, but the experience of other countries as well. The World Health Organization has been giving this matter its attention for quite a number of years now. As a matter of fact and as the hon. member knows, a special division of the World Health Organization undertakes the drafting of, for example, lists of substances which may or may not be used. As a matter of fact, my director of Industrial Medicine is at present visiting Geneva in order to study and collect information on matters pertaining to the World Health Organization which is of interest to us. I may also add that the standards laid down by the World Health Organization have been embodied in their <i>Codex alimentarius</i> and their specifications are acceptable to the European Common Market as well as far as they concern foodstuffs, etc. They also cover this field. The division we have here, viz., foodstuffs, cosmetics and disinfectants, has now been brought into line with the method used throughout the world. In other words, we are in a position to supplement our knowledge by making use of their experience, because we have full access to their knowledge. The knowledge we acquire is, of course, made available to them.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, is the hon. the Minister quite sure about the position of cyclamates&#x003F; The hon. the Minister said that as far as he knew the cyclamates had been withdrawn.

<p>May I give the hon. member the information I have just received&#x003F; I was under the impression that cyclamates had been withdrawn completely, but I am told that cyclamates are allowed in food for persons suffering from diabetes or similar diseases.

<speech by="#reinecke">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. REINECKE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause, particularly paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (1), is of the utmost importance to me as a consumer protection measure. According to these two paragraphs any person shall be guilty of an offence if he&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) publishes a false or misleading advertisement of any foodstuff, cosmetic or disinfectant; or</li>

<li>(b) for the purposes of sale &#x2026;</li></ol>

<p>This I find of importance&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; describes any foodstuff, cosmetic or disinfectant in a manner which is false or misleading as regards it origin or other properties &#x2026;</block>

<p>As far as I am concerned this is of very great importance because our consumer public is constantly subject to bombardment from advertisements relating to such cosmetics, foodstuffs, etc. I should like to mention a few examples. Here is a mail order firm catalogue which is distributed far and wide throughout the country and read by everyone. Here is an advertisement for people who are too fat&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You must get rid of it. Let us help you get rid of ugly, excess weight&#x2014; without any effort, without dieting or continuous exercise.</block>

<p>In round figures it just costs a good R25. The next one, from the same booklet, reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Are you too thin&#x003F;</block>

<p>Sir, here they say they know of a formula to increase one&#x2019;s weight in only a few days, and to increase it in just the right places. They continue&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This super nutriment is a genuine producer of calories with a controlled scientific action. It is completely safe for men, women and children. It is easily digested and has a pleasant taste.</block>

<p>It costs R4-80. With due respect to the Chair, Sir, here is another one for the loss&#x002D;of&#x002D;hair problem, the baldheads. [Interjections.] I also mention this with the utmost respect for the hon. member for Rosettenville here on my right. The advertisement reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">More and more men are going bald, but what is the cause&#x003F; The modern way of life, the strenuous demands made upon the body&#x2019;s reserves&#x003F; No one really knows, but one fact remains and that is that people are desperately seeking a preparation which will help them retain their precious hair.</block>

<p>This is followed by a section referring to the name of the herbs and then the advertisement continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_4291-4292" refersTo="page_0608"/>It contains natural herbs carefully selected and blended to perfection.</block>

<p>Sir, in a more serious vein, this advertisement of this mail order firm is directed in particular at the platteland reader who is very far from the city and who frequently experiences problems in obtaining information from doctors, etc. The Consumers Board has now conducted a survey into the extent of this matter, and it is alarming. Whether these so-called slimming preparations are foodstuffs, denutriments, cosmetics or disinfectants, I do not know, but the 1970 national survey amongst members of the reading public brought to light that 702 000 persons, or 29 per cent of those taking part in the survey, indicated that they intended to lose weight as a result of this kind of advertisement and not as a result of consultations with doctors. Thereafter the manufacturers of these slimming preparations swooped on this attractive market. Last year more than R178 000 was spent on advertisements for tablets, ointment, powders and mechanical apparatus, most of which lay claim to wonderful results, and I believe that this clause of the Bill will combat this aspect very efficiently. Sir, many of these preparations that obstensibly work wonders contain appetite suppressors, dehydration agents and laxatives. With respect to the latter it is estimated that about R200 000 is spent per year on advertisements. What makes the matter more problematic, and what makes this clause of the Bill, in my opinion, that much more valuable for consumer protection, is that some of these firms, from whose advertisements I have just quoted, simply ignore the requests that dissatisfied customers address to them. When dissatisfied clients ask for the repayment of their money because the preparation has had no effect, they simply do not get it back. In some cases the products so advertised are five times more expensive from these mail order firms than in shops where similar articles are freely available. Sir, numerous complaints are received about the uselessness of these cosmetics and disinfectants, etc., advertised in magazines. The remarkable cures or benefits of these products frequently exist only in the imaginations of these advertising copywriters. The financial losses suffered by individuals are perhaps insignificant, but one is concerned about the influence on the consumer corps as a whole and on their health. Sir, it would interest you to know that some of this massage cream advertised by these people was found on receipt to be nothing more than a bottle of ordinary petroleum jelly or Vaseline. I therefore think that the consumers of our country owe the Minister a great deal of thanks for having worded this relevant clause in the Bill so strongly, and I wish wholeheartedly that he will impose it with all possible force.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, arising out of what the hon. member for Pretoria District said, I want to state that clause 5 has much greater depth than one actually realizes. In fact, as I read clause 5 it crowns the work of the consumers board which the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs instituted. It is the result of the National Party&#x2019;s efforts&#x2014;and in fact the zeal of the hon. member for Pretoria District&#x2014;to look after the consumer in South Africa. With this action we are right in the forefront in protecting the consumer in the person of the housewife. It is important that we look after them, since our housewives spend a very large percentage of their incomes on these preparations. We must help them to use their discretion when they respond to advertisements. Therefore it is very necessary for the hon. the Minister to take precautions to prevent our women from being exploited. We want to congratulate him on this measure. It is a feather in the National Party&#x2019;s cap which must not go unnoticed. Sir, advertisements bring a completely new dimension to the fore in a people&#x2019;s culture. The advertiser thinks he has gauged the public&#x2019;s taste and he consequently responds to that with the article he then offers for sale. But I now feel that the United Party makes far too little use of our advertising and do not keep pace with our cultural life. They make far too little use of advertisements in well-known South African magazines, while if they did <span class="col_4293-4294" refersTo="page_0609"/>so it would prove of great benefit to them. I paged quickly through this and I think the youthful members on the other side ought to take notice of this. It is not a sin; we were all young once, after all. Therefore I want to refer them to this advertisement that states: &#x201C;Mother&#x2019;s milk in a tin S26 comes nearest to that.&#x201D; Then there is a very striking advertisement for the older ones about wrinkles. They say that wrinkles vanish within five minutes. Hon. members opposite could profitably look at some of these advertisements. As I have said, there are some members in the back benches there opposite who also sometimes feel that they cut a poor figure. Here there is also an advertisement in this connection : &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t lag behind.&#x201D; For every problem in the United Party there is a solution but, alas, I looked for an advertisement that would fit the hon. member for Simonstown. I turned the pages here in vain&#x2014;I could not find an effective advertisement of a fitting disinfectant.</p>

<p>I welcome the support we are obtaining for this specific clause, which has now been improved and adapted to modern conditions. Both the hon. members for Pretoria District and Bloemfontein West mentioned good examples here. Of course, not all of them are applicable to this Bill. I just want to draw hon. members attention to the fact that only foodstuffs, cosmetics and disinfectants are involved here. In other words, anything that does not classify under those three aspects, such as laxatives, for example, are not covered by this. Any medicine or remedy as well as advertisements are covered by the Drugs Control Act. Then I want to mention a second point. In the first place this is a matter of advertisements, and in that connection two aspects are involved, i.e. false and misleading advertisements. Numerous advertisements that appear are not false, of course, and are not misleading either. Numerous advertisements are possibly false or misleading, but to prove that is not quite so easy. The hon. member spoke here of slimming. Let me tell the hon. member, as far as slimming is concerned, that if it is a preparation that is administered and not a foodstuff or a cosmetic, we can do nothing about that. If it does fall under those two categories, or if it is an apparatus, as indicated at a later stage in the Act&#x2014;there are many pieces of slimming apparatus which are introduced in advertisements these days as ostensibly being able to furnish certain results that are never forthcoming. I just want to tell hon. members that if they know of such an apparatus that does furnish results, I should like to make use of it.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have difficulty in interpreting this clause. You get an advertisement, for instance, which says &#x201C;it is better with butter&#x201D;. Such an advertisement does not seem to be misleading. We may have another advertisement on the same page which says that &#x201C;it is better with margarine&#x201D;. These advertisements are therefore conflicting. How does one judge which is misleading and which is not&#x003F; Would this be in the category of &#x201C;misleading&#x201D; or would we rather think statements which are grossly misleading would be an offence&#x003F; It is going to be difficult to distinguish what is a genuine advertisement and what is not.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in so far as this clause is concerned, I want to point out that yesterday in the Second Reading debate, I raised an issue in connection with the deposit of R25 in respect of the possibility of re-analysis of a preparation which has been seized or taken over by an inspector. I indicated to the hon. the Minister that I felt that if this Bill is placed on the Statute Book as an Act and is to remain there as long as its predecessor did, the amount of R25 would be completely unrealistic with the continual change in the value of money. I suggested that consideration be given to the possibility of dealing with this aspect by regulation. I rise to ask the hon. the Minister whether he feels that it is possible to do this either here or in the Other Place if he feels my suggestion has merit.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I just want to say to the hon. member that I think it should remain as it is. I want to tell the hon. member why I say this. In the principal Act it is provided that the amount shall be &#x00A3;4, and now the amount is being changed to R25. This is approximately four times as much, in order to adjust it to the present situation. There is substance in the hon. member&#x2019;s argument that in the course of years, for example after a period of 40 years, the amount of R25 may be a small amount or perhaps too small an amount. However, there is much more to it than that consideration alone. This amount is paid by a member of the public who may perhaps feel aggrieved. The provision that he may also have an analysis or an examination made, is an additional right which did not exist in terms of the old Act. If he wants to have this done, he must pay this amount. I think the public is entitled to have it laid down in the Act and not to have it done arbitrarily by way of regulation, because a situation may arise that a regulation may stipulate an amount of R250. Since we are specifically protecting the rights of the public here, the right that they may have an analysis made if they feel aggrieved or uncertain, I think it should be laid down specifically in the Act. This, then, is also the reason why it was incorporated in the old Act and could not be laid down by way of regulation. In this case we have once again decided that it should be embodied in <span class="col_4297-4298" refersTo="page_0611"/>the Act and should not be laid down by way of regulation.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the Second Reading I drew the attention of the Minister to the fact that I was not satisfied with foodstuffs, particularly, being detained either in the care of the Department of Customs and Excise or in the hands of the consignee because they are suspect, unless these foodstuffs were suitably labelled as being suspect. I wonder whether the Minister has given any further thought to this.</p>

<p>I again want to urge him to have suspect foodstuffs suitably labelled. The label can of course be taken off if the foodstuffs are cleared and declared fit for human consumption. If these foodstuffs are left outside control in the warehouse whilst they are suspected of being unsuitable for human consumption they can be extremely dangerous. For that reason I ask that the containers of these foodstuffs should be suitably sealed and labelled as being suspect. Perhaps I should have given the Minister the opportunity of studying an amendment, but I wonder if he would not be so good as to consider my suggestion, and if he considers it necessary he could move an amendment in the Other Place.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as I indicated yesterday, not only the disposal but also the handling of these articles or substances is dealt with by the Secretary for Health. In the first place, the Secretary for Health will dispose of them in terms of regulations to be promulgated. In the second place, the inspector or the sampler will act under specific regulations. Those regulations as they exist today, will prescribe, <i>inter alia,</i> the labelling, etc., of the specific product or specific substance referred to. The only difference is that the Secretary will act under guarantee &#x2014;this means certain strict conditions&#x2014; which will be given by him and which will also be contained in regulations. The regulations may provide that under such circumstances the Secretary may order removal. In other words, we are meeting the Department of Customs and Excise in the sense that they may need the space. In the second place, we are meeting the person who is under suspicion but who has not yet been proved guilty, because he may remove his goods if he does not want to pay for them. In the third place, it may be a completely harmless product which can only be used if it is kept in cold storage. He has the cold storage facilities, because he would not have imported the product if he did not have the facilities for it. However, I want to give the hon. member the assurance that all the points about which he is concerned will be covered by way of guarantee and by way of regulation.</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to move the amendment standing in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To insert the following paragraph to follow paragraph (o) of subsection (1):</block>

<block name="quote">(p) prescribing the particulars which shall appear in any advertisement relating to any cosmetic, disinfectant or foodstuff.</block>

<p>My reason for putting forward this amendment is that, as far as I can see, it brings this particular Bill into line with the Drugs Control Act, No. 101 of 1965. When that Act was debated in this House, this particular section formed a part of the clause which dealt with the regulations under that Act, namely &#x201C;prescribing the particulars which shall appear in any advertisement relating to any cosmetic, disinfectant or foodstuff&#x201D;. I am aware that there is an omnibus clause under which it may be possible to deal with this particular aspect, but I think that there should be power laid down specifically in the Bill for the Minister to be able to promulgate regulations in this particular regard. I believe that the hon. members on the other side of the House, who have emphasized the importance of clause 5 of this Bill, the clause which deals with the control of advertisements, should agree with me in this respect. I am aware that it has been necessary to amend the Drug Control Act, partly perhaps in order to circumscribe the definition of &#x201C;advertisement&#x201D; in particular relation to medicines, but I think that the hon. the Minister and I are at one in this regard. We know that there are different groups and categories and that that amendment became necessary purely to make it quite clear what the intention was. <span class="col_4299-4300" refersTo="page_0612"/>I feel that a clause such as this, which is simple, and gives the Minister the power to promulgate these regulations, is very necessary. I hope, therefore, that the hon. the Minister will accept the resolution in the light of the explanation I have given.</p>

<p>Also in regard to this clause, I would like to ask the hon. the Minister if there is any particular reason why in paragraph (0 on page 21 &#x2026;</p>

<p>It will be noticed that each of the three items which form the main substance of this Bill, namely foodstuffs, cosmetics and disinfectant, are included.

<p>Mr. Chairman, personally I do not have any great problem in accepting this amendment, but I must be led here by the legal advisers. They tell me that this clause has to be read in conjunction with clause 5 (1). as the hon. member pointed out, namely the question of advertising. They tell me that that subsection has been drafted as wide as possible and they point out that any regulations which may be made will have a limiting effect on the provisions of the clause to which I have just referred. I would not like to have any limiting effect in law on clause 5 (1). That is as far as the legal side is concerned, and I must accept their judgment. There is a practical side to it too. In the experience of the department over the 42 years we have never had any reason at all to deal with this matter by way of regulation. I think this must be the answer to the hon. member why I cannot accept his amendment. I personally have no problem with the amendment of the hon. member, but I do not think it will be advisable to accept it in the light of what I have said in regard to the two points, namely the legal advice I have and the practical experience of the department over 42 years.</p>

<p>In regard to paragraph (<i>i</i>) (i) of clause 15 (1), the hon. member asked me why disinfectant has been left out. Quite frankly I do not know. I have only noticed it now myself; it has not been brought to my notice before. There may be a very good reason for it, but I undertake to look at this matter and if necessary to amend it in the Other Place.</p>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when the House adjourned last night I had spent some time dealing with certain aspects of this Bill in order to indicate to the hon. the Minister why I felt it was essential that a Bill of this nature should, before its Second Reading, go to a Select Committee, which should consider it, receive evidence and take into account the viewpoints of many persons who are interested in this subject. I think it is important to realize that the principle of this Bill is not essentially urban renewal <i>per se.</i> It is rather to bring to an end what the hon. the Minister regards as the perpetuation of blighted or decayed areas. We have always associated the words &#x201C;urban renewal&#x201D; or &#x201C;blighted areas&#x201D; with housing. Local authorities have spent a considerable time dealing with the subject. I know, for instance, that the Johannesburg City Council prepared a very important report in 1968. I know, too, that countries like Germany, France and Britain have had tremendous problems in dealing with the restoration of blighted areas. Nevertheless, one realizes that in our country where the demand for housing and general development is so important, there is not really enough money available to cope with the problems which face us in so many sectors. Therefore, the principle of this Bill is to take advantage of the capital which private initiative can provide for development and to give them the opportunity, where they have acquired almost the entire area designated for the purpose of redevelopment, and if it is felt worth while and in the interest of improving what is regarded as a decayed area or a blighted area, to improve it for the benefit of the community. But in doing that, it is necessary to provide safeguards in the sense that the question of urban renewal <i>per se</i> should not entirely be lost. A modern trend is to intersperse dwelling units with commercial buildings. When one thinks of dwelling units, one also thinks of some provision for the aged, so that they, too, can live near cities or take part in a big development scheme which includes a city complex. So, Sir. I feel that from many angles it is worth while to have this matter more fully considered.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of high-rise building. There is also the question of density which should be considered by these developers. Normally, one would leave them purely to the provisions of a town planning ordinance. As is quite natural, I suppose, a private investor will take advantage of every opportunity to obtain the biggest return for his money. Here we have a chance to give some privileges which the State only can afford to these people, to ensure that they play a part in benefiting the community. I do not think that I will continue to stress this matter any further.</p>

<p>I would like to conclude by saying that, as I said previously, this Bill in its general, broad principles should not, in my view, be tied to the Department of Community Development whose ramifications include the Group Areas Act as well as other aspects of land development, but more particularly the provision of housing for the community. I feel that if we can, by re-examining the whole matter, assist the private developer and at the same time assist the community in certain circumstances, we should obtain all the expert knowledge that we can and all the evidence that is possible and then see whether, from this examination, a statute can emerge which can provide for these matters and at the same time not be prejudicial to the ultimate purpose which is urban renewal in its truest sense, and the provision of housing for people in the many economic and sub-economic groups that we have in our country today. I therefore sincerely trust that the Minister <span class="col_4303-4304" refersTo="page_0614"/>will see his way clear to accepting this amendment, and that he will give us the opportunity for which we on this side of the House have been pleading.</p>

<speech by="#reyneke">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. P. A. REYNEKE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Jeppes has advocated repeatedly that the Bill should be referred to a Select Committee. Perhaps I may just mention to him that they were not the first among whom this idea originated. When we dealt with the Bill in our group meeting the idea was expressed there and a proposal made to the hon. the Minister that the measure should be referred to a Select Committee after the Second Reading. With the consent of the hon. the Minister I may also mention that he informed us at that stage already that he was in fact going to refer it to a Select Committee.</p>

<p>Quite a number of arguments were advanced by hon. members on the opposite side. I do not want to go into these specifically one after another now; but I shall refer to them during the course of my speech. However, I do want to say that as a person who has for the past 30 years been living on the Witwatersrand, I personally&#x2014;and I think so do the other inhabitants of the Witwatersrand&#x2014;welcome this amendment to the Community Development Act, because the greatest physical decay occurs in fact in our cities and our larger towns. If we look into the history of our towns and cities we find that the character of what were once elite residential areas has frequently changed completely. Tn some cases they have decayed to such an extent that they have become slum areas. In terms of the existing Act the Development Board, in conjunction with local authorities, has sufficient measures at its disposal to clear, replan and redevelop any slum conditions which already exist in an area. Provision is therefore made in the Act to undertake the renewal of a series of decayed areas with the existing powers. But that is precisely where the problem lies. The machinery exists to deal effectively with already decayed areas, but there are no measures to deal with an area in a city or a town which is beginning to show signs of physical decay or is in the process of decay. To my mind the most important section of the legislation is contained therein that since local authorities now have to accept primary responsibility for the prevention of decay in urban areas, since they have to guard against such areas falling into decay and since they also have to identify those areas, financial assistance is being given to them to enable them to take effective steps in this regard. We were also grateful to hear from the hon. the Minister that some of these local authorities were fully informed in regard to this proposed legislation, and that their reaction to it was very favourable. With the implementation of this legislation the greatest task is going to rest on the shoulders of our local authorities, for it will be they that will have to ensure that decayed conditions do not get worse, but that this is prevented through their taking timeous steps. Sir, how different would the appearance of some of our major cities and towns not have been today if only this amendment to the Act had come into operation a long time ago. They would have presented a different appearance today if it had been possible to take steps in time to prevent residential areas which were once elite areas from developing into slum areas. I think that we could probably mention many examples of this, but I think that one of the most striking examples is probably Doornfontein in Johannesburg. As an aficionado of our national game, rugby, it happens quite frequently during the rugby season that I have to walk through a residential area, which was once a good area, where we could enjoy our rugby in a pleasant spirit and atmosphere, but which has now decayed into an unpleasant neighbourhood. Sir, just as a medical practitioner believes that prevention of a disease is easier than cure. I believe that the same applies to the decay of residential areas. If we could eliminate the causes of the decay of those areas then the application of this Act would probably not be necessary, because there would then be very few of those areas which would need to be cleared. Therefore the whole solution to this problem of decay and clearance to my mind lies therein to succeed in eliminating the factors causing those areas to decay. Many causes of this decay in our cities and towns could probably be mentioned. We could probably mention numerous causes in areas which we know personally. But in my opinion the principal cause is that many of the old town-planning schemes have already become obsolete and out of date and that they have virtually become useless. As a result of population shifts and changes in the utilization of land the character of those areas have changed completely. The areas in which those population shifts occurred were in fact those areas where, in most <span class="col_4305-4306" refersTo="page_0615"/>cases, light industries intruded into the residential areas, with a resultant rapid decay of those areas. The establishment of light industries brings with it an increase in motorized traffic and an influx of Bantu labourers. These are all things which assist in accelerating the decay of those areas. Attendant upon this there are usually other factors such as the noise caused by industrial activities, atmospheric pollution and other unpleasant factors which contribute to the decay of those once popular residential areas. We have therefore found that some of those town-planning schemes have had to be revised and that residential areas have had to be rezoned as industrial areas. In many cases we are still able to prevent this creeping danger if we allow no change in the utilization of land in existing residential areas, no matter how innocent some of those light industries, which apply to be established there, may seem. Another important cause of decay is that many of the old town-planning schemes made no provision for social facilities such as parks, open spaces, parking spaces and other essential amenities for the community. The result is that those people prefer to move away to areas where there are at least open spaces, parks and other recreational facilities available for their children. Here I think we owe a vote of thanks to the hon. the Minister of Community Development who is envisaging positive steps to cope with these particular causes which lead to decay. We know that he announced the appointment of a select committee last year to investigate, <i>inter alia,</i> open spaces in controlled areas, so that provision may be made in every residential area for sufficient recreational facilities and open spaces. Another cause which in my opinion contributes to a large extent to decay is that although some of the town-planning schemes did in fact make provision for the zoning of sites for residential purposes, provision is also made for the possibility of changing the zoning for industrial or business purposes for example. One finds that sites which were previously zoned for residential purposes are subsequently zoned for industrial purposes. So, too, there are certain town-planning schemes which make provision for general zoning or, as we generally term it in the Transvaal, for indeterminate zoning. It is in fact that indeterminate zoning which is responsible for the fact that one finds residential sites, business sites and industrial sites in the same area. The result of this is that that area eventually decays. I am afraid that this is a process which is still going to continue in the years which he ahead. I want to refer here in particular to an area which makes provision for general or indeterminate zoning and ask the hon. the Minister to take steps to prevent light industries from being established in established residential areas, those very areas where people have the right to apply for a change of zoning. As Langenhoven aptly said: One swallow does not a summer make, but one blowfly can rot an ox. It is a fact that one single industry, no matter how innocent it may seem, may subsequently cause that entire area to decay, with the result that people move elsewhere. Sir, before the commencement of the Group Areas Act, the presence of different racial groups, particularly in poorer residential areas, was a general phenomenon. This intermingling of different racial groups contributed a great deal to the decay of those residential areas. These were usually areas where we found overcrowding and poor housing. The blame for this intermingling, Which led to decay, I want to a large extent to lay at the door of the United Party because they were the people who allowed this intermingling of different race groups on a large scale. But thanks to this National Party Government it was possible to a large extent to clear these slum conditions through the resettlement of the various race groups.</p>

<p>Then, too, it is a phenomenon that less than 20 per cent, I have been told, of the inhabitants of those decayed areas are the actual house-owners. As is typical of those people they are not the people who show a great interest in the appearance of the houses. They do not show as much interest as the owner of that same house would have done. Many of them are not interested in improvements to those houses having to be effected by the owners, because they fear that this would lead to an increase in the rentals.</p>

<p>In regard to the second part of the amendment of the Act, where assistance is given to private developers in acquiring certain properties, I want to say that I am not well versed in law, but upon reading through this legislation I wonder whether the Act does not already make provision for the powers which the hon. the Minister is now requesting. If we read section 15 (1) (a) we note therein that the particular areas which have to be cleared, the slum areas, are in fact defined in that subsection; and if we look at section 15 (1) (c), I read that <span class="col_4307-4308" refersTo="page_0616"/>the objects for which the board is established shall be, subject to the directions of the Minister&#x2014;and then subsection (c) follows&#x2014;&#x201C;to assist persons to acquire or hire immovable property in so far as in the opinion of the board may be necessary or expedient for the achievement of the objects mentioned in paragraphs (a) or (b)&#x201D;. If I look at paragraphs (a) and (b), it is in fact those affected properties and areas, where assistance in clearance may be provided, which are in a decayed condition. What I think this amounts to is that when reference is made of these &#x201C;persons&#x201D;, it surely cannot refer only to the development board. It cannot refer only to persons from the department. Surely it can also refer to private developers as well, as it is stated here, to &#x201C;assist persons to acquire&#x201D; that property. So, to my mind, the principle has already been laid down in the Act that the private developer may be assisted to acquire those properties, even through expropriation, as is now being defined in greater detail in this Act. In this section which is now being added here, the procedure which has to be followed in respect of those properties which have to be expropriated is being defined in greater detail, in order to make these available to the private developer for clearance and development.</p>

<p>To my mind the principle contained in the second part of the Bill remains the same as the principle already contained in the original Act. In the existing Act the development board has the right to acquire with a view to replanning and redevelopment, any property which falls within the urban renewal areas. Now we know that in most cases this is done through expropriation, and here we have the same principle now that that property may be acquired for development and replanning. Therefore properties are not obtained simply by expropriating them, but are obtained only with the knowledge and co-operation of the interested parties; and when I speak of interested parties, this includes the persons from whom the land was acquired. Those persons meet around a table and an acceptable agreement is reached. To my mind the same principle which is contained in the existing Act is contained herein as well, i.e. that this also applies in respect of compensation in regard to that property. The existing Act is very clear in that regard, for the provisions of the Act read that when a property is expropriated by the Development Board, the Board may pay the market value of the property, as at the date of expropriation. I am consequently satisfied that the owner is being compensated for his property on a reasonable and equitable basis, for over and above the land value, provision is being made that he may be compensated in respect of inconvenience and loss of goodwill.</p>

<p>The market value of land is a subject which may be discussed interminably. I think that most hon. members will agree from experience that when different assessors are consulted it will be found that their valuations will vary. The valuation of the one assessor may show a variation of thousands of rand in contrast to that of the next. It is also true that the valuation of properties may fluctuate within the space of a few months. Since the hon. the Minister has stated here that this may not exceed the market value, I wonder whether he is not perhaps correct there. One can find the situation where as soon as a person becomes aware that his property is going to be expropriated&#x2014;I am referring now to the persons who do not want to co-operate, who have no interest whatsoever in preventing the decay of that area and do not care what that area will ultimately look like&#x2014;he will try out all kinds of ploys and dodges to push up the value of that property. It is only natural that when the idea is expressed, and plans are submitted to the effect that a certain area is going to be developed, the market value will go up. Can that increased market value, however, be compared to the value of a property which was perhaps acquired a month or two or even six months prior to that&#x003F;</p>

<p>Another principle which in my opinion has already been laid down in the existing Act and is simply being defined further in this legislation is that the right and the opportunity is being granted to the owner in that area in question, who has to be expropriated, to undertake the developments himself, and he shall not be deprived of that right. It is only in the case of persons who do not want to co-operate that this will be done. Consequently this is only done in the case where the community may be prejudiced as a result, or where it is in the interests of the community that an owner be deprived of that right. Nor do I believe that a person who in any way, by whatever means, wants in that way to allow the community to be prejudiced, was in reality an asset to such a community.</p>

<p><span class="col_4309-4310" refersTo="page_0617"/>On considering the legislation as a whole, I think that in all fairness and reasonableness towards the owners of nearby properties, it is the duty of the State to ensure that those properties which are in a condition of decay shall be cleared and that redevelopment and replanning shall take place.</p>

<p>In conclusion I think it is fitting, since an amendment is being made to the existing Act, to congratulate and thank the Government&#x2014;here I want to mention specifically the hon. the Minister of Community Development&#x2014;not only for the positive assistance in combating decay and with the clearance of decayed areas, but also for what has already been achieved in this respect. If I may, I just want to mention that this department has already, since it took upon itself the task of clearance and renewal in 1964, spent approximately R115 million during the past eight years. This is truly an achievement.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, listening to the hon. member for Boksburg and his remarks on this Bill, we on this side of the House are more convinced than ever that this Bill should be referred to a Select Committee. He has made some very valuable points and while listening to him one realized that there are various aspects of this Bill which need to be examined. That is why I support the motion introduced by the hon. member for Green Point, namely that this Bill be referred to a Select Committee before its Second Reading. I understood the hon. member who has just sat down to say that it is to be done after the Second Reading. I think it would be more advantageous if it were done before the Second Reading. We would then have a very much better Bill than we have at the moment. We have been talking about the question of urban renewal since 1964 but for some reason or other we have never been able to get urban renewal off the ground prior to this Minister&#x2019;s taking office. This Minister has had great difficulty in getting urban renewal off the ground. He has had great difficulty in getting things moving. We know what happened to the guinea pig of urban renewal, namely District Six. We know that the property in that area was frozen in 1964. That is some eight years ago. Hon. members know that time marches on. At that stage the Minister appointed a committee to go into the whole question of District Six and the surrounding areas. In 1965 he appointed a committee known as Corda&#x2014; the Committee of Inquiry into the Rehabilitation of Depressed Areas. They submitted a report to the hon. the Minister. In that report they outlined some eight areas adjacent to District Six which could be used for development. The hon. the Minister then appointed a planning committee to go into the planning of this area. As we know, this is an area which has been declared White and it is going to become a White suburb. We know what happened then. Since then we have hastened slowly. The Minister has been up against great difficulties. In answer to a question asked by a colleague of mine we learnt that since 1964 the hon. the Minister has only been able to demolish some 355 properties, whilst there are some 6 063 properties still waiting to be demolished. Furthermore there are some 33 980 people, Coloured people, who have still to be moved, only 9 936 having been moved so far. Therefore one visualizes the terrific problems which face the Minister. If the progress is going to continue at the same pace, nothing is going to happen to District Six within the next 20 years, 25 years, or maybe longer. He is facing great problems in rehousing the group that he is moving, the Coloureds, in other areas. Notwithstanding that, even if he were moving Whites he would have the same problems, because he would have to rehouse them.</p>

<p>I was particularly pleased that the hon. the Minister commented some time ago on his intention to assist the decaying areas. It is also mentioned in clause 1 of this Bill. The area adjacent to District Six&#x2014;which is in my constituency and some parts of which have not been zoned and in respect of which it has not been decided whether they are to be White or Black&#x2014;is an area which is unfortunately decaying. In terms of clause 1, the hon. the Minister plans to assist financially in this direction. However, the people in the meantime are uncertain as to what is going to happen there. We are, for example, planning halls for schools, but we are discouraged from doing anything because we do not know what is going to happen in this area as there has been no planning for the particular area adjacent to District Six. We have had the same difficulty with regard to our hospitals. The net result is that properties have gone into decay. These properties will take quite a lot to repair. To the owners&#x2014;some are merely tenants&#x2014;it becomes uneconomical to repair these properties because there is <span class="col_4311-4312" refersTo="page_0618"/>the two-edged sword of rent control. A lot of properties have been let at very low rentals and the owners are finding that they do not get a sufficient return on their money. Accordingly they have not invested money in keeping their properties in the condition in which they should have been kept. So, when the hon. the Minister mentioned as stated in clause I of this Bill that he wants to prevent this decay and try to rehabilitate these areas, I think this is a step in the right direction. On reading this Bill, I think that the Minister and the Government realize that they have bitten off more than they can chew with regard to their idea of urban renewal. I do not think they realized the gigantic task they were facing when they took on urban renewal. We think of District Six and Doornfontein; yet we have such areas all over the country. They probably exist in Natal, in Durban, and I know they exist in Port Elizabeth. There is hardly a large city in this country of ours where the hon. the Minister is not faced with this problem. He is anxious, as we are, to do something about it. He would like to see this problem lifted right off the ground by means of urban renewal and he would like to do something about it.</p>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. When one thinks of urban renewal, one thinks of large blocks of flats, but that is not the case. If one looks at the history of urban renewal of other countries in the world, one finds that houses in a particular area have been rehabilitated. A certain number have had to be demolished because they were too far gone. Parks have also been created. This creation of large blocks of flats and multi-storeyed buildings, etc., I would say does not form the background of urban renewal. We have left this too long. It should probably have been done years ago. So I am pleased to hear that the hon. the Minister is going to do something about it now.</p>

<p>As I have said, the hon. the Minister is very anxious to get this off the ground. I would like the hon. the Minister, when he replies, to tell us how it is going to be done, since the local authorities just do not have the cash required. Whether the local authority is the right vehicle to handle this, I do not know. Equally, I do not know whether his own department or whether the various housing authorities that we have should not be the vehicle to be used. I suppose that the local authority could handle it, but they have a lot of hay on their fork. Perhaps he could use some other vehicle which property owners could approach to have their properties evaluated in order to determine whether they can be saved. When one sees what is happening in Mowbray and certain other areas one can see what can be done with these old houses. In Newlands, for example, old houses are renovated to what is called Chelsea dwellings.</p>

<p>In my constituency in the Observatory area where properties are deteriorating one finds that a number of people have bought properties there, have renovated them and it is remarkable to see what can be done with these old houses. These properties are not all slum and I have seen areas where properties have been purchased by the Department of Community development and demolished as being unsafe and that houses right next to them are still standing where those houses are in the same condition as the ones demolished. These houses can stand much more than examiners think. The older houses in Woodstock, for example, were built after the Boer War or just before and after the First World War. They were all of the semi-detached type of home and were well built. Money is, however, now required to renovate them and the Government cannot afford to have these areas go down.</p>

<p>There is not sufficient time to build up the areas and neither is there sufficient money to do it. Something has to be done and the Government must work out some form of finance and show some interest in these areas. I do not think that the owners of properties want the Government to acquire their properties. The man in the small house would like some financial assistance. The Minister might say that they should go to their building societies, but we know full well that the building societies are reluctant to lend money for certain types of houses. The rates of interest at any event are so high that the whole proposition becomes completely uneconomical as far as owners are concerned. Ordinary working people stay in most of these houses and they cannot afford these large outlays of cash every month.</p>

<p>It just does not happen. A second principle in this Bill is in connection with the developer. Some time ago the hon. the Minister said that he had been approached by certain people in this regard. I think he is on the right track, but he can get into a lot of trouble. There are various aspects of using the developer which the Minister has in mind and I think the hon. the Minister will be surprised if this Bill goes to a Select Committee, with the reaction he will get from property owners and property developers throughout this country. I do not think that anybody who wants to develop proerties is a philanthropist. Let us face it, he is not there just to hand out money, unless he is a philanthropist. He is a businessman who will try to make money. Not far from this building a large development scheme is planned. I have a newspaper report in regard to this plan here. The buildings on this plan look like a lot of inverted washboards to me and I am not very taken with the type of building they are going to put up. I do not think that they are aesthetically very suitable, but this is only by the way. Newspaper reports like this upset a lot of people. For instance, the following is stated in this newspaper report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When the Community Development Bill becomes law a Cape Town businessman intends to expropriate a few holdout properties to expedite a R25 million city residential and urban renewal project near the parliamentary complex.</block>

<p>He cannot do it even if this Bill is accepted exactly as it is.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>The public does not know that, and what has been the result&#x003F; Agents have been negotiating with property owners to purchase certain properties at market value prices in this area, namely on the basis of a willing seller and a willing buyer. The agents broke off their negotiations in view of the introduction of this Bill. As a result of the prospective building of this complex, valuations in this area have gone down. The owners of properties have found it difficult to sell their properties, because buyers say that they are going to expropriate and that they are not interested. These people are suffering financially as a result of this business. Whether rightly or wrongly, people are upset. There are many properties in this area where this complex is going to be built which are valuable, and which are properties that can be rehabilitated. They are not in slums. Unfortunately there are a lot of slum properties as well. One would like to see them go, but at the same time, these people will still have to be rehoused. But there are a lot of properties that could be retained. I refer hon. members to clause 1 in this regard. I have no objection to an area being developed, but one does not like to see people being exploited and taken advantage of. There are no two ways about it; this is the impression created here. I have been approached by quite a number of people. They are disturbed and upset about it. Some people who know nothing about the scheme have been told point blank: &#x201C;You are going anyway; we are going to expropriate your property.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Tell me, how can that be if it is laid down in the Bill that a developer must possess at least 85 per cent of the property&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister does not understand. Very few of the public have read this Bill. I think some of the developers have not read it. But it has the propaganda effect that people, without reading the Bill, think that the Minister will be able to expropriate their property. I can quote another instance. A very substantial property near Muizenberg which consists of quite a number of plots was originally acquired by our local authority here, ostensibly at that time for an economic housing scheme. Nothing happened. Another company wanted to develop <span class="col_4315-4316" refersTo="page_0620"/>a marina and the local authority disposed of the property. The original owners only got a fraction of the value of that property because it was expropriated at its rateable value. That is what can happen even with a local authority. The same can happen here. We must not forget that while all these negotiations are going on, properties are deteriorating in value. When it comes to the final deal, they will find that they will have to be satisfied with a fraction of the value because nobody will be interested in buying other than the Government or the person who wishes to expropriate.</p>

<p>I come to another aspect in this particular Bill. If we accept the fact that the properties are going to be purchased, then certain people will have to be rehoused. In order to make it a financial success, one cannot wait 20 years to develop a property, either here or anywhere else. The Government are faced with the obligation to provide suitable accommodation for the people affected. One cannot just say to people: &#x201C;Well, I have purchased your property; here is three months&#x2019; notice. Out you go.&#x201D; That is not good enough; that is something the public will not accept. The Government will say it is not their job to find houses for them, but it is. Morally, the Government cannot get away from that particular responsibility. After doing the survey for any redevelopment scheme they wish to undertake, they must face the fact that a certain number of houses have to be found for those displaced people. What is more, is that the wage and income group of those people who have to be taken into consideration. In this particular area the wage and income group is very low. I am sure that the people who are living there at the present moment will not be able to afford these luxury wash-board flats that are going to be built. So the Government are faced with that position. They may say that it is the owner&#x2019;s job to do it. The owner will just wash his hands of it. It happens from time to time that where people purchase houses, before you can say &#x201C;Jack Robinson&#x201D;, the occupier gets three months&#x2019; notice, and out he goes. In this particular Bill the new section 45A (3) provides that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The developer may after the expiry of three months from the date on which the said notice is published in the <i>Gazette,</i> take possession of land of which the ownership vests in him under subsection (1) (a).</block>

<p>So the present Bill provides that the owner can take possession of the property after three months. The Minister must keep in mind that if this development is going to take place, the present occupiers of the property must be housed. We just cannot wash our hands of that. In the same respect the hon. the Minister is faced with District Six where he has to find alternative housing for the people affected there, the Coloureds, in this case. He must see to it that the same is not going to happen in the case of all these other urban development schemes. As I said at the beginning, he could save a tremendous amount of this property and a lot of these buildings if he would only act now and start this loan scheme, by means of which people can save their decaying buildings.</p>

<p>I think that idea is sound. But we would like to hear from the hon. the Minister how we go about it and start the scheme. It is like the setting off of an atomic bomb. How do we trigger it off&#x003F; That is the problem. The Minister must tell us today what he intends doing. It is a serious matter. If one goes to District Six and adjacent areas, which are not very far from here, one sees the deterioration of property due to the fact that people do not know what is going to happen. I am referring to the Minister&#x2019;s own property. If he goes along De Waal Drive he will see it on the lefthand side. The hon. the Minister owns all the property on the lefthand side where quite a lot of people are housed. There is property that is actually owned by the Government, the Department of Community Development, and it is deteriorating. A little bit of money needs to be spent there.</p>

Those houses could stand for years, but a lot of money will have to be spent on them. There are a number of other similar properties.

<speech by="#prinsloo">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. P. PRINSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to say at the outset that I welcome the envisaged legislation. In the first place, extended powers are being given to the Development Board, so that it may spend money in areas where it was not previous1 allowed to do so. In other words, it is a minor extension of the powers of the Development Board in that respect.</p>

<p>The other amendments, I think, are as important, if not more important, for they provide for the greater streamlining of the legislation of the Department of Community Development. Amendments ensure that matters in regard to arbitration are brought into line with provisions already contained in the Development Act. It has already been found in practice that the procedures which are followed work very well. There is a minor amendment in respect of townships to facilitate registration at the Deeds Registry. It also brings the Community Development Act into line with the Expropriation Act, and makes provision for compensation and the subsequent registration at the Deeds Registry. It prescribes what procedure should be followed. Hon. members in this House are sometimes very concerned about the question that procedures are not laid down. Well, here the procedures which can subsequently be followed are being laid down.</p>

<p>The matter in regard to which there was quite a lot of argument yesterday and today is the envisaged new paragraph (hA) of section 15 (2) in clause 1 (b), which deals with the question of slum areas and the acquisition of land by a private developer. Here I must cross swords in one respect with the hon. members for Green Point, Jeppes and Salt River, for they question the competence of the Department of Community Development and in particular the Development Board. If they question the competence of the Development Board, then they also question the ability of the hon. the Minister and the Department to give effect to such a provision as this. We have learnt from past events, particularly when the Group Areas Act was mentioned in this House. When the Group Areas Act came into operation there was no Community Development Act. Local authorities and other local authorities of lesser extent than municipalities were afforded the opportunity of developing group areas, and they scarcely did or were able to do this. The Department also experienced the difficulty that certain local authorities did not see their way clear to implementing legislation and Government policy. Other local authorities were quite openly hostile to the implementation of this policy and of the provisions of the Group Areas Act. Eventually a solution had to be found, and then the Community Development Act came into operation, in section 2 of which provision is made for the establishment of a Community Development Board. This Board, as has just been indicated, was established because local authorities let the State and the public down. They let them down badly, so much so that the displeasure of several population groups was incurred. This happened because the Group Areas Act was not implemented. The Community Development Act makes provision for all the categories in regard to which the Development Board has to take steps. Section 15 in particular embodies all the objects and the general powers of the Board. To be able to give effect to these objects and general powers, a vigilant eye has to be kept on the position at all times to see whether the necessary provision is contained in the Act, and if that provision is not there, it has to be amplified from time to time, for the Department from the outset experienced many growing pains in regard to the implementation of the laws of the country and State policy. There should be no possibility of their being handicapped, therefore, by minor matters which crop up along the way. The principle that legislation in this regard should be introduced from time to time to enable the Development Board and the Department of Community Development in particular to fulfil their functions properly is therefore not a new one. The question now is whether it is so necessary. I indicated, in respect of one section, that it is absolutely necessary. I now want to indicate as well that, in respect of a new paragraph (hA) of section 15 (2) which is inserted by clause 1, legislation of this nature is extremely necessary, and also important, as far as the retention of aesthetic <span class="col_4319-4320" refersTo="page_0622"/>values in our township and urban development is concerned. I know that this proposed paragraph is a little new but so is the National Party. So is the Department which co-operates with it. They are always prepared to suggest something which is not only thought-provoking, but which also ensures that a greater interest is displayed in what the State is envisaging with this legislation. I mentioned the question of the assertion that other organizations will apparently be better able than the Development Board to implement this legislation. I have already sketched the background, and I want to sketch it further, Sir, by telling you that if one considers the picture presented by decayed areas, by slum areas in this country, then it really makes one feel afraid that if things continue in this way, the entire country may subsequently fall into decay. When the vultures have flown away they leave behind a pitiful scene of carnage. No one is there to care for the victims, and for that reason legislation is necessary. I have already mentioned that it is the United Party-orientated city councils which in most cases were responsible for legislation having to be introduced in order to create a Community Development Board. I am now going to indicate why the Department of Community Development is the proper organization to give effect to this legislation, whether it is passed in its present form or whether further powers are granted on the recommendation of a Select Committee. In several of these decayed areas operations have been in progress for a considerable period already to ensure that they do not decay further. What is the position in Durban&#x003F; Hon. members know who controls Durban.</p>

<p>Block AK and Block G near the racecourse and railway station are most certainly decayed areas which require the most urgent attention. The same applies to Brickfield Hoosen, the Cato Manor Ridge area, the Ridge Area Extension, the Wiggins Estate, the Umkumbaan&#x2014;and hon. members who represent Natal will know where these places are and will be able to form a mental picture of the decayed conditions prevailing there&#x2014;Bonella, Bellair, Glenmore West, a portion of Sherwood and the Titron Road area. If such a large area of a city has been allowed to fall into decay, then it is time to call a halt and to ensure that there is machinery to prevent further decay and further &#x201C;slummification&#x201D; (<i>verslumming</i>)<i>,</i> if there is such a word, in future. If this is not prevented then I foresee Durban&#x2019;s fate being an even greater mess than it is at the present as far as those areas are concerned.</p>

<p>What is the position in Johannesburg&#x003F; The hon. member for Jeppes will know what I am talking about when I mention a few of these areas. He will know what the conditions are in Jeppes, Fairview and Troyeville, and how necessary it is and was for the Department and the Community Development Board to take steps there. We think of the dilapidated slum area in Pageview. We think of the poor areas of Vrededorp, we think of Newclare, Fordsburg and Albertville. All these places are situated in the heart of Johannesburg, a United Party-controlled city council. Why are these areas being allowed to decay to such an extent, under their very eyes&#x003F; Why should it be left to the Department and the Development Board to ensure that steps are taken to make a garden township of a little place like Albertville, which had decayed completely&#x003F; That is what is happening there. We can go to the outskirts of Johannesburg. I know this is not the responsibility of Johannesburg, in all fairness to them, but there are places like Ennersdale and Finetown. If care is not taken of those areas in time, they will also decay, and the Coloureds who are at present living there and who have every right to want to live there, will have the right to point an accusing finger at this Board and at the Health Board, at the Department and at other organizations, and say that nothing is being done for them to save their areas, as well as the neighbouring White areas for the future.</p>

<p>Let us return to Cape Town. I think you also know who controls Cape Town. Here you have District Six, to which the hon. member for Salt River referred, where the owners of many of the places are also the type of owners to whom the hon. member for Boksburg referred. Here, under our very eyes, these areas fell into decay so that the Department had to intervene to save what could be saved and to create a better future for this city and its people. We also have Goodwood Acres on the other side, and a little bit further away we have Firgrove. Then there is also an area like Elsies River, and one shudders every time one flies over and gets a birds-eye view of that area.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is no United Party City Council there, but the negative attitude of the United Party City Council sometimes penetrates to the other areas, if they are near enough to that influence. Then we can consider Port Elizabeth, South End, the best-situated area in Port Elizabeth, but this decayed so completely that the Department and the Development Board had to step in. And we can say thank you to the city council for eventually having begun to co-operate with the State Committee to save that area, where the unsatisfactory conditions had to continue until recently, until the department could take over control. Now we take a place in the part of the world the hon. member for East London City hails from, North End. Where can one hope to find a more critical condition than the one at North End&#x003F; But what I will always hold against that city council is this, since the hon. member there is talking about a United Party-controlled city council : When the Department of Community Development wanted to step in to help with the clearance of North End and to help with the proper planning of group areas, they were shown the door and the city council actually behaved antagonistically towards them, as was also done by several other city councils which I can mention. There you now have the decayed conditions which this department has to clear up. There are others as well, and now the hon. member will again ask whether one has a United Party-controlled city council there. Let us take Stellenbosch, the Merriman Avenue area. This is not a United Party-controlled city council, but there one has a body which is co-operating, and very soon you will be able to go and see what a garden township is, and what can be achieved when there is cooperation and proper planning and the implementation of policy. So I can take you back to the Transvaal, to Pretoria, the Good Hope area and the Asiatic bazaar area, about which hon. members may perhaps have something to say. But I want to say: All credit to the City Council of Pretoria which is the only city council which was prepared to accept delegated powers under the Group Areas Act and co-operate in implementing the laws of the country and in implementing group areas; and where they have struck snags, they have felt free to come to the Minister and the department and ask for the necessary amendments to help them, and that hon. Minister and that department was prepared to accommodate them and to ensure that things went off in such a way that they would not be implicated when things became too difficult.</p>

<p>I am just returning for a moment to the Witwatersrand, to Germiston West and Georgetown. There were terrible areas, but go there now and see what those areas look like after replanning. You may say that this is an ugly picture and then you ask who the correct bodies are to do this. Then I say, &#x201C;The proof of the pudding lies in the eating thereof&#x201D;. What the Department of Community Development and the Development Board have already done is sufficient proof that they have the experience and the ability and the vision, and you and I see to it in this House that they get the funds so that they can continue with this great work of saving those areas which are doomed to destruction if steps are not taken quickly enough. Sir, if hon. members think that the Development Board and the Department are not competent, I can prove the opposite to you, quoting chapter and verse. I do not know of any department which is better equipped to do this work. There you have the Department of Community Development with two strong arms, stronger than yours and mine: On the one hand the National Housing Commission and on the other the Community Development Board, each with a wealth of experience, with a monopoly of wisdom which they can use to your benefit and mine and the benefit of the country, and each with so much vision that they can see what the future holds, and will see to it that they do not let this country down when it comes to the implementation of legislation and of national policy. In that department we have its officials, and we know their ability. Certain hon. members question the Development Board which is involved in this matter, but I say to you that you need not do so. The chairman is a man of the greatest ability and integrity, a man who can give and take guidance and a man who ensures that everything is carried out promptly and correctly; and he is supported by men of absolute competence to do this work entrusted to them. If you think that there may perhaps be weak members on the Board, I can tell you that there are none. A former deputy chairman is at present Deputy Controller and Auditor General. That is the type of people who serve and have served on that board, <span class="col_4323-4324" refersTo="page_0624"/>and I think that they are equal to this task. That is why, because I support and welcome this legislation in general, I want to give my support to the hon. the Minister and his department. He is a good Minister, he is the right man in the right place. That is why I support the legislation and I also support the idea that this proposed section (hA) should be subjected to a closer scrutiny, a section which, although other people may perhaps say something else, perhaps does not go far enough; perhaps even further provision ought to be made so that the energies and financial capacity of all who want to do so can be harnessed to assist in this great task of remedying urban decay and clearing slums, and this the department and the Development Board can do&#x2014;the National Party Government will see to that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Innesdal chose this debate, the debate on this Bill&#x2014;which has nothing to do with the broad issues of town planning&#x2014;to criticize in a very serious way a number of the cities and towns of South Africa in respect of certain aspects of their planning. I would place on record that several of the members on his side supported the derogatory comments that he made. There were &#x201C;hear-hears&#x201D; in respect of most of his comments. Now, I say this, that I believe that the towns and cities which have been criticized this afternoon by the hon. member for Innesdal are entitled to know from the hon. the Minister of Community Development whether or not he supports those derogatory comments.

I am well acquainted with the position in Durban, and I have heard the hon. the Minister on a previous occasion complimenting the city council of Durban for the way it has handled its town planning, and I challenge the hon. the Minister of Community Development to deny that he has complimented the City of Durban.</p>

<p>Having said this, I want to return to the Bill. As the last speaker on this side of the House, I want to sum up the attitude of the United Party&#x2019;s opposition to this Bill. We have serious objections and reservations to several important aspects of this Bill. We cannot, therefore, support this Bill in its Second Reading. It has been suggested by speakers on that side of the House that the Nationalist Caucus, or certainly some members of the Nationalist Caucus, also had reservations when this Bill was dealt with by the Nationalist community development group and recommended to the hon. the Minister that he should refer this Bill to a Select Committee after Second Reading. I want to make it clear that we, on this side of the House, cannot support that proposal either. We believe that to refer this Bill after Second Reading, would be to adopt as principles important matters arising from these amendments &#x2026;</p>

<p>The hon. member for Boksburg said that the Nationalist <span class="col_4325-4326" refersTo="page_0625"/>group asked the hon. the Minister to refer this Bill to a Select Committee after Second Reading. We, as I say, are not prepared to support this because it would have the effect of accepting as principles features of this Bill with which we do not agree and which we would wish to debate in detail in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>We are not the only persons who have objections to and reservations about this Bill. Since notice of its introduction has been given, property owners who feel that they may be prejudiced by the Bill have indicated their objections in the Press and to members of Parliament and, I am sure, also to the hon. the Minister of Community Development. The South African Property Owners&#x2019; association has indicated its objection to it and, I would point out that their objection is couched in very strong language. Having regard to the fact that they are not only a very responsible body but also a body which represents a large number of the property owners and developers in South Africa, the language they use is of significance. They say that their Association is totally against this new legislation and, furthermore, that they are against it in its entirety. I may add though that they have qualified this tone of theirs, this attitude, by suggesting a possible alternative which could be acceptable. If this Bill were to be referred to a Select Committee then this is one of the alternatives which could be considered. There is no doubt whatsoever that this Bill is a further erosion into the rights of individuals, particularly the rights of property owners. Property owners in the older parts of the big cities of South Africa have reason to fear the consequences if this Bill is passed in its present form. I would like to refer briefly to certain aspects of this Bill in order to demonstrate to this House that the provisions of the Bill constitute far-reaching erosion into the rights of individual property owners. In fact, I would go so far as to say that I wonder whether the extent of the erosion appears in any other similar legislation in Western countries. I would point out &#x2026;</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it is similar.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>I would be interested to hear from the hon. the Minister what the position is. I would like to point out to the hon. the Minister that in terms of clause 1 (b) he is being empowered to designate an area to be developed in furtherance of a slum clearance scheme or the clearance of decayed conditions by a private person. No opportunity is given to the owners of property within the proposed designated area to state their objections to anyone or to put forward reasons why the area should not be designated for the purposes of the legislation. This, I submit, is a serious erosion into the rights of owners of properties. A second serious erosion appears in clause 5, which inserts the proposed new section 45A. The effect of this new section is that immediately upon the publication in the <i>Gazette</i> of the designation of a particular area for the purposes of development by a private developer in terms of this Bill, the remaining properties over and above the 85 per cent automatically fall to the ownership of the private developer. They automatically become owned by the private developer. That, I submit, is a very far-reaching proposal. The proposed new section 45A reads&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Upon the date on which the notice under paragraph (hA) of section 15 (2) is published in the <i>Gazette</i>&#x2014;</li></ol>

<block name="quote">(a) the ownership of any land in the area designated which is not registered in the name of the developer &#x2026;</block>

<block name="quote">shall vest in the developer.</block>

<p>No right either to object or to suggest any alternative development proposal is given to the property owners who fall in this category. The only provision made in the section is that they shall be entitled to compensation and that, if they cannot reach agreement as to the amount of compensation, this shall go to arbitration. They have a right, therefore, in regard to compensation but they have no right to retain or protect their property. In fact, not only do they have no right, but they have no say whatsoever.</p>

<p>These are undoubtedly far-reaching erosions on the rights of individuals. Perhaps at this stage I should make it clear what the attitude of this side of the House is in regard to certain of the principles involved in this Bill. We believe that the power and the right to expropriate properties for urban renewal and slum clearance should be allowed under certain conditions, which we would like to debate in a Select Committee. <span class="col_4327-4328" refersTo="page_0626"/> We do not believe that the way in which it is proposed to achieve this object in this Bill, is the ideal solution and we would like to make certain suggestions in this regard. In particular we believe that it should not be related at all to the private developer. When I say &#x201C;we do not believe&#x201D;, I mean we think there may be better ways. I do not want to put the matter more strongly than that in case the hon. the Minister agrees to the proposal to refer the matter to a Select Committee. We therefore do not wish to commit ourselves in advance, but we believe that the powers presently existing under town planning ordinances go very far in the sphere of redevelopment. It may be that they do not go far enough in some provinces. It is suggested that in the Transvaal, for example, they do not go far enough. If that is the case, this is a matter which can be examined by a Select Committee, namely whether the existing legislative powers both under Acts of Parliament and under town planning ordinances are insufficient for the purpose which everyone wants to achieve, i.e. urban renewal of slum areas. If the Select Committee were to find that in some case the powers are inadequate, we would suggest that the proper body which should be entrusted with the additional powers required, should not be the Community Development Board, but the local authorities and the provincial administrations.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point has already referred to the speech of Mr. Conradie. I do not wish to quote the passage again, but I merely want to say that we support the point of view expressed in the passage read out by the hon. member for Green Point. I wish to make it quite clear that we are not prepared to give any power of expropriation under any circumstances to a private developer. I know that the Bill does not ask for that, but I merely want to emphasize that we would not be prepared to see that happen. So far as the concept of private developers assisting in urban renewal is concerned, we support such a proposition. We believe that private developers should be encouraged to play a bigger role in urban renewal projects. These urban renewal projects very often involve a great deal of money and a great deal of know-how and skill. Certain private developers possess just that. They also have facilities for obtaining the required amount of money for purposes of this nature. I do not wish in saying this to derogate from the Community development Board. In many respects the board carries out its work well. I am now referring specifically to urban renewal and the provision of housing for certain purposes. I do not, as I say, wish to derogate from the work done by the Community Development Board but I believe that their function ought to be related more to the provision of individual housing rather than to projects of this type which not only involves housing, but may involve the renewal of business areas.</p>

<p>I believe I have only five minutes left, but before I sit down want to make one point which I regard as being important. Certain of the speakers on the Government side have aired the reservations and criticisms which they have towards the Bill in its present form. The hon. member for Germiston stated that his side of the House accepts, two principles. The first is the need to bring in the private developer and I have said that we also accept that principle. The second principle is that the private individual must not be sacrificed to the large developer and that we must protect his rights. That is a fine sentiment, but the Bill certainly does not make any provision for this. Once the particular area has been designated and once the private developer has acquired the 85 per cent required under the Bill, the balance automatically falls under his ownership and there is no protection whatsoever for the individual. The hon. member for Boksburg suggested that it may be desirable in certain circumstances for a right to be given to the owner to develop himself in a renewal area if he is able to and has the capital to do so. Here again, this is a fine sentiment, but it does not appear in the Bill. In fact, the provisions of the Bill are entirely contrary to it. There is no right whatsoever given to that minority group to say that they do not want to part with their properties and that they are prepared to redevelop. We accept that in a developed community occasions may arise where the interests of the community must take precedence so far as property rights over the rights of the individual property owner are concerned. The more communities that are developed the more it may be necessary to transgress these rights. We therefore do not oppose this legislation simply because it is an encroachment upon the individual rights of property owners, but we do believe that one must be very careful with legislation of this sort to achieve a reasonable balance which will, on the one hand, not <span class="col_4329-4330" refersTo="page_0627"/>jeopardize the interests of the community and on the other hand not transgress the rights of individual owners beyond what is essential to achieve in the community interest. For all these reasons we think that the only satisfactory way to deal with this Bill is to refer it to a Select Committee before Second Reading, before the acceptance of any specific principle so that the whole matter can be properly investigated and witnesses be heard, who may be in a position to suggest a satisfactory and a reasonable compromise between the conflicting interests that I have stated. We would therefore urge the hon. the Minister to accept the proposal of the hon. member for Green Point and refer this Bill to a Select Committee before Second Reading.</p>

<p>He then said that by doing that, and by giving those people the right to get hold of certain properties, we inflict, as he expressed it, a terrific erosion of the rights of property owners. What erosion of their rights are there&#x003F; There is no erosion of the rights of property owners. When a city renewal scheme is planned it can be done either by a local authority, by a provincial administration, or by the Community Development Board. Whichever party is going to undertake that city renewal scheme, that party must eventually get hold of all the land in that particular area. The local authority has the right of expropriation and so has the provincial administrations and the Community Development Board. All we are saying in this Bill is that where we are now going to introduce the private developer to do city renewal schemes as well, we are going to give him that right to eventually get hold of all the land, because one cannot talk about a city renewal scheme and leave out some of the land in the area where a particular city renewal scheme is necessary.

<p>That point has been made by the hon. member for Green Point. There is no reason why it should not be done. What the hon. member for Musgrave does not take into consideration is that before a private developer can start on his scheme, he must have a fully worked out scheme which has been agreed to by the local authority. The scheme must be approved of also by the Administrator, by the Community Development Board and by the Minister. Such a scheme will be a properly worked out scheme the same as if it was done by any of the other authorities which can do that at the moment. Where is the erosion of rights then&#x003F; I am going to agree to the amendment of the hon. member for Green Point and I will tell hon. members why. I am going to agree because this is to a certain extent a new principle which is being brought into our legislation, the principle where property is taken away from one private owner and given to another private owner. But that private owner is protected. We all agree on the principle that the private developer must be involved for reasons advanced by the hon. members for Musgrave and Green Point, but also for the very important reason that we just do not have the money to undertake all the renewal schemes in the country. City renewal is a very expensive process. If one can introduce private developers to assist in city renewal schemes, one is doing this country a very big favour. But I agree that there are many ways in which it can be done. I do not say the ways laid down in this Bill are complete and the final answer. I have very little doubt but that this Bill will come back from the Select Committee not much different <span class="col_4331-4332" refersTo="page_0628"/>from what it is today. But SAPOA and other property owners are very interested in this matter. I have discussed it with them and explained it to them. After we had had a full discussion, there were not very many objections from their side. But I am willing to accept the amendment.</p>

But the public interest is completely protected in this Bill. At the risk of repeating myself, I want to say that the parties concerned objected to the Bill because that scheme cannot be undertaken by private developers unless it has been completely agreed to by the local authority, the provincial administration and the Development Board. Therefore I cannot see any objection to the principle of this Bill; but, as I say, I am quite willing to refer it to a Select Committee to hear the views of the different developers.</p>

<p>Well, my information is that it was in 1966. But since that time we have appointed a State committee which has been co-operating with the local authority. A great part of District Six has been demolished. The main reason why we are slow in the reconstruction of District Six is that we have to provide alternative housing for the Coloured people living there. Where are we going to get that alternative housing for the Coloured people in District Six&#x003F; We cannot obtain that housing until such time as Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain is developed. The City Council is only now starting on the development of Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain. I certainly hope they will be able to do it in the next two or three years. Once Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain is developed, the progress in District Six will be faster. The hon. member said the position would be the same and that we would not reach anything for another 20 to 25 years. But that is ridiculous. We have demolished every single part of District Six in respect of which we could provide alternative housing to the Coloured people of that area. The only reason why it is going slowly is because we do not have alternative housing at the moment, and because we have to wait for the development of Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain. But we have made a great deal of progress in other city renewal schemes. I refer to Newclare and Jeppes in Johannesburg and in South End in Port Elizabeth, which is now being completely demolished. We are now in the process of rebuilding it. At Riverside in Durban and several other areas, the Development Board is busy with city renewal schemes. Where we have appointed State committees they are in the process of carrying out the city renewal schemes. So, District Six was quite definitely not an experiment. As a matter of fact, District Six is one of the last.</p>

There is the danger in South Africa&#x2014;and that idea exists in local authorities, and I almost want to say that it exists in the Department of Community Development to a certain extent, although we are trying to get away from it now&#x2014; that buildings which can still be renovated, are simply being demolished. We should not continually think of demolishing buildings. If a building can be renovated in any way, we should do so; we should not demolish that building and erect a new building <span class="col_4333-4334" refersTo="page_0629"/>in its place. I fully agree with the hon. member; the more buildings one demolishes, the more expensive it becomes to replace those buildings, the longer it takes to rebuild them and the more it costs. Therefore I fully agree with the hon. member, but I want to say to him that we are doing a great deal in the direction of the renovation of old buildings. Here in Cape Town, for example, old Malay buildings which are more than 100 years old, are being renovated. The new buildings are free of rent control, and consequently we are encouraging the renovation of old buildings to a very large extent.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Boksburg spoke about the danger of the intrusion of small industries into areas which are partially residential. I agree with him that in the past that was a very unfortunate development. It happened in Boksburg; it happened on the whole of the Witwatersrand, in Pretoria and in Johannesburg. This is one of the reasons why the Development Board is so insistent now on the question of urban renewal so that we may eliminate that type of development in future.</p>

<p>We would do both; we would develop part of the area ourselves and sell part to private enterprise. The plan for District Six has already been completed and we are now calling for tenders. Private enterprise can tender to develop a particular block or to develop, say, two blocks. Where tenders are not accepted, the Community Development Board will develop the area itself. But I think that in the end private enterprise will develop the whole area. They will, of course, have to develop it in accordance with the scheme.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Boksburg spoke about the separation of the race groups. Sir, there is not the slightest doubt that one of the main reasons for urban decay in the past was in fact mixed residential areas. There is not the slightest doubt about that. I am not at all so terribly reticent about what the hon. member for Innesdale said here; he was perfectly correct. I spoke very frankly to the various city councils that did not want to give assistance. I spoke very frankly to the City Council of Johannesburg about certain separations they would not allow. We simply told them that if they did not allow it, we would do it ourselves. We did so here in Cape Town. There was a time when the City Council of Cape Town did not want to co-operate in regard to the clearing up of District Six, and we simply told them that if they did not want to do so, we would do it ourselves, which we in fact did. Today I am grateful for being able to say that we have the cooperation of all the large municipalities in the country.</p>

This is in fact the reason why I agree with the hon. member for Green Point that we should refer the Bill to a Select Committee before its Second Reading. At the same time, I want to say that I am very confident that the Bill will not be greatly amended when it comes back from a Select Committee, but if we refer the Bill to a Select Committee, we shall at least have the satisfaction that the interested parties such as SAPOA and the development companies, the local authorities, Mr. Conradie and the provincial administrations will have had the opportunity of expressing their misgivings.

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>As hon. members know I recently appointed a representative committee to thoroughly investigate certain aspects of the Rents Act, 1950, and if necessary propose amending legislation. The Committee is already hard at work, and although it is a very difficult and extensive field the Committee must cover, it is expected that it will issue its report this year still.</p>

<p>I therefore did not intend to propose any amendments to the Rents Act, 1950, during this session with the object that any amendments that may appear to be necessary can be handled with the Committee&#x2019;s inquiry has been concluded and their proposals accepted.</p>

<p>However, a matter of urgency has now cropped up that compels me to submit this Bill to you. I shall explain. Section 9 (3) of the Rents Act, 1950, provides that a rent board can issue an authorization to increase rent retrospective to the date on which the lessor&#x2019;s application for permission to increase the rent was transmitted to the lessee.</p>

<p>A case cropped up recently that clearly indicates that this provision embodies the possibility of tremendous hardships being created for the lessees.</p>

<p>The Rent Board, at the request of the lessor, fixed the rent of a block of flats in August 1968 and increased that rent, again at the request of the lessor, in February 1969. The lessor was not satisfied with this, however, and applied to Rent Control Board for a revision. The lessor was not satisfied with the Rent Control Board&#x2019;s decision either and consequently had recourse to the courts. The courts referred the matter back to the Rent Control Board. Again the lessor was not satisfied with the Rent Control Board&#x2019;s decision and again applied <span class="col_4337-4338" refersTo="page_0631"/>to the courts to have the Rent Control Board&#x2019;s decision set aside. The court&#x2019;s finding was that it was compelled to refer the matter back to the Rent Control Board, which it subsequently did on 27th September, 1971. The Rent Control Board thereupon fixed the rent on 26th November, 1971 and decided that the increase, as fixed by it, was operative as of 1st January, 1969. The lessees must therefore pay the arrears covering the period from 1st January, 1969 to 26th November, 1971. I have briefly indicated the course of an application for higher rent to indicate how it can happen that a lessee finds himself in a position where he is liable for a considerable amount of rent in arrears. The rent involved was increased by about R20 per month, and in the case of a flat, for example, where the previous rent was R47-78 per month and from 1st January, 1969, was R68-51 per month, the rent in arrears amounts to no less than R725-55. This will undoubtedly entail great hardship for those involved.</p>

<p>It could be argued, it is true, that as prescribed in the Act the lessees obtained notice of the application for an increase of the rent and that they should therefore have been prepared for that and have made provision for the increase. In practice, however, a lessee simply does not, under such circumstances, set aside money for the requested increase. It is therefore my considered opinion that the provision contained in section 9 (3) of the Act can result in too much hardship since the retrospective period is unlimited. A limit must therefore be set.</p>

<p>An authorization to increase rent ought not to exceed six months in its retrospective effect. A lessee ought to be able to afford a rent increase that has accumulated over six months, but when the increase is owing over a longer period than six months, it can create too much hardship. That is why clause 1 (1) of the Bill is being submitted to you.</p>

<p>As you will notice clause 1 (2) provides that the abovementioned amendment is applicable from 1st January. 1969 to cover the case I have just mentioned. The intention here is simply that most recent instances, where too much hardship occurred in that respect, can also benefit from the amendment.</p>

<p>I am going to move in the Committee Stage that clause 2 be omitted.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>When listening to the hon. the Minister relating the tale of this particular case before the Rent Board in Johannesburg I was reminded of the advice given to me very early in life as an articled clerk by an experienced lawyer, who said to me that the resources of the law are infinite. It seems that the position is such that it is possible for a landlord to go backwards and forwards to the court and similarly it would be possible for a tenant who desires so to do, to delay an increase for an interminable period by going backwards and forwards to the court. Sir, we welcome this measure and will support it, particularly in view of the fact that there is a commission sitting at the present moment to investigate the workings of the Rents Act, but I want to make two points to the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>The first is that if delays up to six months do occur, it does seems that even as a temporary measure the hon. the Minister should consider appointing more boards to deal with rent applications. I do not think that we have that delay in the Cape Peninsula, but I understand that it does occur in other parts of the country. I think if the hon. the Minister, pending the outcome of this commission of inquiry into the Rents Act, could at least appoint some additional rent boards where they are necessary to speed up this work in regard to the determination of rents, it will be a good thing. It will cut both ways. It is a hardship on the tenant to have to pay even six months&#x2019; arrears. One can imagine a R20 increase in rental from R80 to R100 and the tenant finding that he is obliged to pay R120 plus a month&#x2019;s rental, R200, in one payment. At the same time it would be wrong to deprive landlords of their just rental to which they are entitled because of action taken by the tenants to delay and defer the determination of rentals. But these are problems of administration which we hope will be cleared up when we have a new look at the Rents Act. But as an interim measure I do hope that the hon. the Minister will give attention to this.</p>

<p>I am also very pleased with the notice which has been given by the hon. the Minister to negative clause 2 of the Bill in the Committee Stage. Might I say, when I look at the Bill now, that having regard to the requests which came from this side for clause 1 and the requests which came for the determination of clause 2, the Minister will forgive me if I say that the <span class="col_4339-4340" refersTo="page_0632"/>paternity of this Bill rests on this side of the House, but we concede the maternity to the hon. the Minister.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kotz&#x00E9;">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>I am glad the hon. member for Green Point supports the legislation. It is a fact that rent control in this country has come to stay; like the proverbial poor, it will always be with us. As long as the demand for houses exceeds the supply, we shall have to be content with this. New shortcomings are also continually coming to light in the legislation. New points of friction develop and amendments are continually necessary. This is therefore one of the Acts on the Statute Book that must regularly be amended. This year we thought, as the hon. the Minister said, that we would not have an amendment owing to the fact that he appointed a committee to review the entire legislation, but now the necessity has nevertheless arisen for the Act to be amended to a lesser extent. I want to point out that even as we are now amending the Act, with the period being restricted to six months, it can still impose a considerable burden on the lessees. The more luxurious the flats the greater the amounts involved, and it could in fact happen that a person must pay rent in arrears for a period of six months, which will make things very difficult for him. Here we saw the case of an amount accumulating to the tune of R755. In the less luxurious flats provision is being made for people with smaller incomes, but relatively they feel the pinch just as much because it is as difficult for them to advance a smaller amount that has to be repayed. Usually these requests for rent increases take quite a long time to be dealt with and we must accept that in very few cases will the time taken be less than six months. As far as I am concerned, I am almost inclined to ask the Minister whether in the Other Place he will not give further consideration to the matter and make further concessions. I see no reason why the date on which the rent is fixed, the date on which a final decision on appeal is given, should not be the date on which the rent comes into force. If I institute a claim for money, I must wait until the court gives its decision; it makes no difference how long I have to wait. Only from that day onwards can I obtain my money. I think it ought to apply here as well so that the rent comes into force on the date on which the decision is given on the appeal that was instituted. If that is the case I think everyone will be satisfied I specifically want to ask the Minister that applications for the decrease of rent ought not to be made retrospective over a period exceeding six months either; in other words, in cases where lessors must repay money to the lessees, this must not be retrospectively operative beyond a six months&#x2019; period either.</p>

<p>Then I also want to refer to clause 2. The Minister intimated that he is going to withdraw the clause in the Committee Stage. I think the clause does nevertheless have some merit that we must not overlook. I just wonder whether we cannot suggest that he has another look at it. The proposed amendment now provides that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">the said deposit, which shall be invested with the building society or, if the lessor is a limited liability company, in trust for the lessee with any other financial institution approved by the rent board &#x2026;</block>

<p>I think there is objection to the fact that the Rent Board must approve the institution. If the amendment were to be passed in its present form, the Rent Board would be placed under an intolerable burden. They would simply not be able to keep abreast of all the decisions to be given. I think there is merit in the proposal and therefore I want to ask whether we should not replace the words &#x201C;in trust for the lessee&#x201D; with &#x201C;a financial institution approved by the Registrar of Banks and Financial Institutions&#x201D;. I think that a clause with such an amendment can be passed. In such a case the amendment can serve a good purpose. I just wanted to bring these few remarks to the Minister&#x2019;s attention. I want to add that it is a good thing the Act is now being amended, because in its present form it can place a tremendous burden on certain lessees if the rent can be recovered in the respect of a period longer than six months. I mention this with the specific idea that when the Committee comes along with its proposals and when the Rents Act comes under review for amendment at a later stage, we must give thought to making the date of the final decision the date on which the rent comes into force.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before repaying to the hon. member for Parow, as the bench-mate of the hon. member for Orange Grove who unfortunately cannot be here, I feel it incumbent on me to claim <span class="col_4341-4342" refersTo="page_0633"/>his proud paternity of this measure, a measure which perhaps is not as famous in his family as T.V., but nevertheless due to the representations which he has made. I am sure the hon. member for Orange Grove would want me on his behalf to thank the hon. the Minister for giving maternity to this measure.</p>

<p>Returning to the hon. member for Parow, I must say that it is not often that I find myself in agreement with him. We on this side of the House accept the Bill because, as stated by the hon. member for Green Point, there is a commission sitting and the whole Act will have to be taken in review. We are not arguing about it now and we accept clause 1 as it stands. But like the hon. member for Parow, I too recognize and have come across cases over and over again where a delay due to appeals has meant hardship for people. This is the case because no matter how much you warn them, no matter how much the estate agent suggests to them that they put aside the increase every month, some people still suffer hardship. For a person earning, say, R38 per month in old-age pension, another R1 or another R1-50 is a major factor in his or her housekeeping or bookkeeping. It can mean the difference between existing or not being able to make ends meet. So the temptation is to hope and wait. When eventually the date suddenly comes along that person in terms of this legislation, could have to pay back for six months whatever increase there might be. On the sort of building a pensioner would occupy, this would normally not be more than perhaps R10 to R15. However, that is half of the monthly income of a pensioner. So, even with this limitation, it can still be a hardship. We can accept the view of the hon. member for Parow that increases take effect from the date on which they are finalized, but this could mean a hardship for the landlord. That would in fact militate against his right to appeal, which is his right and which he should be entitled to enjoy. If, by appealing, he would lose the increase for the <i>interim,</i> he may find it better not to appeal. That would be interfering with a genuine right of a landlord. Therefore, when the final amendments come along, we may perhaps think along the lines that, once the local Rent Board has decided, that rent shall be effective. Normally the local Rent Board&#x2014;I cannot speak for the Cape, but I know the position in Durban&#x2014;meets and settles a case within six to eight weeks. This means that there is seldom a delay of more than one or two months for which arrear rental must be paid. The time between the notice to the tenant and the decision of the local Rent Board usually means at the most two months&#x2019; arrears. If the person had to pay from that date, it would be much easier on subsequent appeals to meet the difference between the Board&#x2019;s decision and the appeal than it would be to meet the whole increase. If there is to be a repayment, it is far easier for a company, a firm of standing, to repay an amount to the tenant. I think perhaps the hon. the Minister may think along these lines when it comes to the final amendments to this Act which will be necessary. In the meantime I think six months gives some protection; it is certainly better than it is now.</p>

<p>Yes, it can take three years and, once one gets into the clutches of the legal fraternity, it is amazing how long a case can take and how much it is going to cost one before one gets out of it. Sir, this is an improvement, but I do not think that it is the final answer, and I hope that perhaps we can think along the lines of some other solution.</p>

<p>In regard to clause 2, the withdrawal of which we welcome, I am afraid I cannot agree with the hon. member for Parow. The principle should be that money, which comes from housing, should go to a building society where it can be used for providing funds for further building and the provision of accommodation. That is the basic principle. This money is a deposit tenants are paying, and it is only reasonable that that money should be used to provide housing. Now we have the technical problem that a limited liability company or other company cannot invest in a building society. I see no reason why one should therefore say that because of this, money should now go into any other financial institution. The money might have been put into Sidarel! Then just think what would have happened to the tenants&#x2019; money.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I realize that the hon. member wants a limitation, but <span class="col_4343-4344" refersTo="page_0634"/>I think that the building society principle should be retained. It may be possible in some other way&#x2014;for example by saying: &#x201C;Notwithstanding any other law &#x2026;&#x2014;of ensuring that these deposits can in fact be devoted to the purpose of housing. Under the circumstances it is probably best that this clause should be withdrawn at this stage and we welcome the fact that the hon. the Minister will move the deletion of it. In the meantime the one-clause Bill will go forward until such time as the commission, who have my deepest sympathy, are able to submit their report. It is going to take more than the wisdom of a Solomon to find a solution to this problem. I have said before, and I repeat, that every one who knows something about the Rents Act must have sympathy for the commission. Something must be done, improvements must be made, but in the present circumstances the approach in this Bill, which is to give protection to the tenant, must remain the approach of Parliament. Parliament is the guardian of the underprivileged, the people who require and need our protection. It is not our task to protect those who can look after themselves, but there is a need to protect those who cannot look after themselves. I hope that it will not be too long before we have the report, that it will not be another Press Commission for whose report we had to wait 14 years, but a report which we shall have before us as soon as the commission is able to complete its work. I hope that then, once again, we shall be able to cooperate with the hon. the Minister in passing further amendments which may become necessary. We support the measure.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The trouble is, as it was brought to our notice&#x2014;I think it was the hon. member for Parktown who brought this matter to our notice&#x2014;that if clause 2 were accepted, the building societies could lose a great deal of money. Some of these private companies invest money with the building societies in the names of their directors, and if this clause were accepted, the building societies could lose a great deal of money. I want to tell the hon. member that we are considering whether it will not be possible for us to achieve what we want to achieve by these means, by amending to the Building Societies Act instead. It is therefore not a case of our seeking to do away with that principle, i.e. that these deposits must be made; we just want to prevent the danger of building societies losing money in favour of other companies.</p>

<p>I also want to thank the hon. member for Durban Point for having mentioned the name of the hon. member for Orange Grove. I forgot to mention it in my introductory speech. However, it is true that the case which gave rise to this legislation, was brought to my notice by the hon. member for Orange Grove. When he had brought it to my notice, it was very obvious to me that we would have to straighten out that state of affairs as soon as possible.</p>

<p>I have some sympathy with the hon. member for Parow in regard to his suggestion that the increase in the rent should be effective as from the day on which it is determined. However, the hon. member for Durban Point also took up a very legitimate standpoint in that regard, namely his standpoint in regard to a person applying for an increase in the rent on a certain date. After the lapse of two, three or four months, or whatever the case may be, the Rent Board determines that he may get an increase. Surely, there can be no doubt that he is entitled to getting that increase as from the date on which he applied for it, provided that he does not prolong the period too much by lodging appeal after appeal. However, one does not want to deprive him of his right to appeal. The hon. member is perfectly correct in saying that if one were to provide that the rent should be increased as from the day on which the decision is given, such a person would find it quite difficult to appeal, for then he would defer the date on which he could get the additional rent.</p>

<p>As regards the question put by the hon. member for Parow, namely whether the same thing would apply in the case of a reduction in the rent, the answer is in the <span class="col_4345-4346" refersTo="page_0635"/>affirmative&#x2014;it applies in that case as well. I must honestly say that we merely decided on six months in an attempt to retain the balance. However, all these things will be dealt with in detail by this commission of inquiry into the Rents Act, and I hope that once they have completed their task, we shall be able to come to this House with a more scientific measure. In the meantime I must thank the hon. member for Green Point and his side of the House for their support of this legislation.</p>

<p>The Professional Engineers Act, 1968 (Act 81 of 1968), authorizes the establishment of the South African Council for Professional Engineers, an autonomous statutory body authorized to carry out certain functions in connection with the ordering of the engineering profession. In the implementation of this function certain shortcomings have been discovered that can only be supplemented by suitably amending the Act. There are also amendments of a purely administrative nature.</p>

<p>The amendments are taking place on the recommendation of the South African Council for Professional Engineers and aim at substituting the word &#x201C;elektriese&#x201D; for the word &#x201C;elektrotegniese&#x201D; in the Afrikaans text; changing the name of the Professional Engineers&#x2019; Joint Council; appointing certain alternate members of the Council; appointing professional engineers who are not members of the said Council as members of committees of the said Council; extending the functions of advisory committees; altering the prerequisites for registration as an engineer or an engineer in training; the reporting by courts of law and other legal forums of <i>prima facie</i> improper and disgraceful behaviour on the part of a professional engineer or an engineer in training to the South African Council for Professional Engineers; extending thepower to make regulations; and providing for incidental matters.</p>

<p>The amendments are of a simple nature and do not affect any of the fundamental principles laid down by the Principal Act.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House support this measure. It is a measure which amends an Act which deals with a particular professional body, the professional engineers. We understand from certain members of that council that the amendments which are being introduced have the support of the council and were in fact requested by the council. That being the case, and as the amendments do not in any way prejudice the rights of the general public, we consider that the requests of the professional engineers should be acceded to and the Bill supported. Just in passing I would like to mention that I believe that the provision, which is being introduced in clause 8&#x2014;the amendment to section 22 of the Principal Act&#x2014;which makes it compulsory for courts of law to report to the council improper or disgraceful conduct which may appear <i>prima facie</i> in the course of court proceedings, is a sound provision. There are occasions when improper conduct on the part of a professional person is dealt with in a court of law and may not necessarily be brought to the attention of the council concerned. A provision making it compulsory for a court of law to draw to the attention of the council such conduct is, I believe, a sound proposal. I do not wish to refer to the other amendments in detail, because, as I have said, they have been requested by the Professional Engineers&#x2019; Council as necessary amendments to make the Principle Act work more satisfactorily. That being the case, we support the Bill.</p>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_public_works">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_4347-4348" refersTo="page_0636"/>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>In 1971 the Cabinet appointed a committee and instructed it to investigate and report urgently on the role and function which Church Square should fulfil in the lives of inhabitants of Pretoria as an historical and geographical centre of the administrative capital, and to determine in what way this set-up would affect the proposed development of State-owned and other sites bordering thereon and in the immediate vicinity thereof. On 7th September, 1971, the Committee&#x2019;s recommendations were considered and accepted in principle by the Cabinet.</p>

<p>In order to afford the responsible bodies and persons the opportunity of carrying into effect the instructions of the Government in this regard, it is necessary that the future development of the entire area bounded by Andries Street to the East, Pretorius Street to the South, Bosman Street to the West and Vermeulen Street to the North, be subjected to control. The existing legislation, <i>inter alia,</i> the Community Development Act, 1966, as amended, does not make provision for such an arrangement, and consequently it is necessary to pass special legislation for this purpose.</p>

<p>In terms of the present town-planning regulations, as defined in Pretoria Town Planning Scheme No. 1 of 1944, usable floor area of buildings bordering on Church Square is restricted to six times the surface area of the site. In addition to that, a general height restriction of 30 metres (100 feet) applies, but if the owner is prepared to reduce the circumference of his building so as to release a proportionally larger area of the site, he may obtain special permission to build higher on condition that he does not exceed the floor area restriction. Separately the surface areas of the individual sites in the area belonging to private owners, are not large enough for buildings of unusual heights to be erected on them.</p>

<p>Consequently, the proposed measures of control do not curtail any existing rights which the private owners of the sites concerned have at present.</p>

<p>The buildings surrounding Church Square have a delicate architectural balance which emphasizes the history of the capital city and this balance could be disturbed if high buildings were to be erected near or around Church Square. For this reason, too, it was decided to erect the tower blocks which the Transvaal Provincial Administration and the Department of Public Works intended erecting close to the square, further to the west, away from Church Square. These tower blocks will be identical on the outside, which a height of at least 150 metres (500 feet) and will be erected, suitably set back, behind the buildings of the National Bank and the old Netherlands Bank on both sides of Church Street so that they will not detract from the character of Church Square. Since these bank buildings, the old Raadsaal and the Palace of Justice emphasize the historical nature and significance of Church Square, they are being retained. The rest of the old buildings on the western side will be demolished, i.e. the original Old Mutual building, the old Mint building, the present Post Office buildings, the Caf&#x00E9; Riche, the old Law Chambers and the Capital Theatre&#x2014;on the one hand because they have no particular historical value and on the other hand because architecturally, their aesthetic and intrinsic value is so slight that it does not justify their retention.</p>

<p>The above-mentioned tower blocks will accentuate Church Square&#x2019;s importance. Apart from the fact that modern buildings have already gone up on and around Church Square, this type of development on the State-owned sites concerned, if implemented with taste, will bring out the historical buildings in clearer relief.</p>

<p>The foregoing serves to give a general picture of the future development of Church Square, Pretoria. Then, too, it is necessary to emphasize that the role of the City Council of Pretoria is not being reduced. In its task relating to Church Square it will be assisted by the Capital Planning Committee and its Committee on Aesthetic Matters, and will advise the Minister on the development of the square and adjoining sites. Although the final authority is vested in the Minister, he will be guided by the City Council.</p>

<p>The Bill therefore envisages control of the development of Church Square, Pretoria, and the sites bordering thereon and in the immediate vicinity thereof. It is intended that no construction work or demolition of any nature may take place in the area without the Minister of Public Works having given his written permission in that regard. This particular aspect will be elucidated further when I subsequently deal with the clauses of the Bill.</p>

<p><span class="col_4349-4350" refersTo="page_0637"/>In my opinion the best way of dealing with this Bill would be to deal separately with the various clauses.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 1 :</p>

<p>Definition of Minister (Minister of Public Works), Secretary (Secretary for Public Works) and City Council (City Council of Pretoria).</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 2 (1):</p>

<p>From the date on which this Act comes into operation a prohibition is imposed on the development of Church Square and adjoining sites. In addition, no change is allowed to any building, structure or site without the approval of the Minister.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 2 (2):</p>

<p>The Minister may in his discretion withhold or grant his approval, and if he grants it, he may impose such conditions as he may deem fit.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 2 (4) :</p>

<p>The Minister grants or withholds his approval only after he has obtained and considered the advice of the City Council. In terms of clause 6 applications are submitted to the Secretary for Public Works who obtains the advice of the City Council and then submits the matter to the Minister.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 3 (1):</p>

<p>The penalties are also aimed at curbing the continued disregarding of the Act.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 3 (2):</p>

<p>A magistrate&#x2019;s court has jurisdiction to impose any punishment prescribed in subsection (1).</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 4:</p>

<p>No compensation is payable to any person as a result of the withholding of any approval referred to in clause 2 (1). As has been mentioned, there is no real curtailment of the existing rights of the owners of the sites concerned.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 5 (1) <i>and</i> (2):</p>

<p>Regulate the cancellation of all servitudes registered under Crown Grant No. 1103 and 1905 against the unrestricted use or development of Church Square. The servitudes provide&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) that no buildings, statues or memorials of any nature are to be erected and that no improvements to the property are to be effected without the State President having given his approval to this; and</li>

<li>(b) that a drive-way 79 feet wide around the Square should be maintained for use by the public.</li></ol>

<p><i>Clause</i> 6:</p>

<p>This clause is intended to regulate the procedures arising from the legislation.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 7 :</p>

<p>The Act is applicable to the State as well.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 8:</p>

<p>The short title of the Act is the Church Square, Pretoria, Development Act, 1972.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when this Bill was debated in the Other Place, the hon. the Minister made certain statements which he has repeated this afternoon and which I want to examine right at the outset of my remarks in regard to this particular Bill. The hon. the Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Then, too, it is necessary to emphasize that the role of the City Council of Pretoria is not being reduced. In its task relating to Church Square it will be supported by the Capital Planning Committee and its Committee on Aesthetic Matters, and will provide the Minister with advice on the development of the Square and adjoining sites.</block>

<p>One would believe, in listening to that statement, that the council is to retain its rights; that its rights are not being reduced, but when we look at the first provision of this Bill, in clause 2, after the definition clause, we read this&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) No alteration may be effected to the planning &#x2026;</li>

<li>(b) No building or other structure on any site, or portion thereof, situated within the area described in Schedule B to this Act, may be erected, extended, architecturally adapted or demolished without the prior written approval of the Minister having been obtained.</li>

</ol>

<p><span class="col_4351-4352" refersTo="page_0638"/>That written approval has to be given, it is true, after he has obtained and considered the advice of the council, but, Sir, it is specious for the hon. the Minister to suggest that the council&#x2019;s powers are not being lessened when he himself has the right to decide what should be done. The hon. the Minister made these statements in the Other Place and the matter was debated on 28th February of this year, but since then there have been some interesting expressions of opinion by the people of Pretoria regarding this particular legislation. I want to refer, first of all, to a leading article which appeared in <i>Die Transvaler</i> on 4th March, 1972, that is to say, after the Second Reading debate in the Other Place had been concluded and had been reported in the Press. <i>Die Transvaler,</i> in dealing with the happenings in Brakpan and in the Johannesburg municipal elections, went on to say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Daar was talle sekond&#x00EA;re oorwegings wat by kiesers &#x2019;n rol gespeel het om teen die Nasionale Party te stem of om van die stembus weg te bly.</block>

<p>The leading article then goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die kiesers raak skielik daarvan bewus dat hulle nie regstreeks geraadpleeg is nie, byvoorbeeld oor die planne vir die nuwe Kerkplein of oor die ingrypende omwenteling wat die Departement van Gemeenskapsbou in Pretoria-Sentraal beoog, en hulle vra hulself af waarom hulle stadsraadslede &#x2026;</block>

<p>And they blame these city councillors&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; nie die saak dringend aangevoer het nie. Daar is talle ander oorwegings wat daarop neerkom dat die kieser onverbid-delik eis dat hy geken word in sake wat hom en sy kinders regstreeks sal raak. Daarvan moet terde&#x00EB; kennis geneem word. Hoewel die Nasionale Party net in enkele sentrums aan die verkiesing deelgeneem het, is daar nogtans gevaartekens merkbaar in ander sentrums, byvoorbeeld in Pretoria, waaraan onmiddellike aandag geskenk moet word.</block>

<p>That is the warning from Pretoria itself about this type of legislation which has come before us this afternoon. Sir, let me go further. In <i>Hoofstad</i> of 9th March, 1972, there appeared an article which was headed, &#x201C;Mevrou Verwoerd Gesels&#x201D;, and this is what this honourable lady has to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Maar&#x2014;en dit is &#x2019;n groot maar&#x201D;&#x2014;hoe gaan die pragtige ou Raadsaal, die Paleis van Justisie en die ander geboue lyk wanneer daardie twee monsters van 500 voet langs hulle in die lug in toring&#x003F;</block>

<p>These are buildings which have been approved by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Planning Committee. This is the view of Mrs. Verwoerd. She goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die oorgrote meerderheid voel magteloos en loop gevaar om onverskillig te berus in die onvermydelike. Dit mag nie. Daar is voorsiening dat die Regering nie kan optree sonder raadpleging met die Stadsraad nie, maar die Stadsraad is tog nie die publiek nie en die publiek bly stom as daar nie &#x2019;n middel gevind word om hulle stem te laat hoor nie.</block>

<p>Sir, that is just what is happening in this. Bill by taking out of the hands of the local authority, by taking out of the hands of the provincial authority, the power to control a portion of the administrative capital of our country.</p>

<p>This, unfortunately, seems to me to be a matter which the Minister and the Government do not appreciate. It is the resentment of the ordinary people. They want to be able to talk to those whom they have elected, who are closest to them, their own kith and kin, in the city of Pretoria, who have been elected to the city council to represent them on that council. Sir, the council is emasculated. They can give advice, but their advice need not necessarily be followed. One understands this when one reads what has happened since the debate in the Other Place and what has been published since that debate. Then one can understand what happened in Brakpan, and one can understand the anxiety neurosis which has developed already in regard to Oudtshoorn. [Interjections.] Of course the history of the planning of our administrative capital city has not been a very happy history. It has led to harsh words and estrangement in high places. In fact, I might even say that the planning of Pretoria has now attained for itself a judicial record in the courts of this country. There is no reason why we must go on this basis just because there has been this estrangement between the hon. the Minister and certain officials of that particular city. I am sure that a <i>rapprochement</i> is not impossible between the hon. the Minister and the persons concerned in Pretoria.</p>

<p><span class="col_4353-4354" refersTo="page_0639"/>But let us look at the Bill itself, this Bill which is regarded as being so innocuous by the hon. the Minister. I have indicated that in clause 2 the Minister shall have it in his power to control what shall be built, what may be expended, and even his artistic powers will be called upon to determine the architectural development of Church Square and its environs, and he will be able to say what can he adapted and what can be demolished. If one goes further, the Minister may in his discretion withhold or grant his approval, and if he grants it he may impose conditions as to height, architectural finish, styles of architecture or any other matter which in his opinion is relevant. Any provision of the town planning scheme applicable in Pretoria is of nought in so far as the Minister is concerned. He can ignore every provision of it. One goes further and finds that the Minister is even able to put the Pretoria City Council to terms. If they are asked to comment on any matter they are given that mythical period of time, 90 days, in which they may reply, and if they do not reply in 90 days, the Minister may ignore them.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>The Bill goes further. One finds in clause 4 that when the Minister in his omnipotence decides what should be done architecturally, and what can be done to adapt any building, no matter what the consequences are, there is no compensation whatsoever payable to any person who is affected by reason of anything the Minister has done. Then one can go on further to say that even the servitudes enshrined in the title deeds can be ignored. I am glad to see the hon. the Minister of Justice is here. He must realize how sacred are servitudes enshrined in title deeds. But even those servitudes which are against the unrestricted use and development of Church Square are cancelled. Then one sees finally that any application to obtain the approval referred to in clause 2, shall be referred to the Secretary in the form prescribed by the Minister from time to time and shall be accompanied by such documents as are required by the Minister. The city council is not even recognized as the authority <i>a quo.</i> These applications for alterations to buildings or the approval of building plans, are now to go direct to the Minister; he is in charge of the whole of Church Square and its environs.</p>

<p>The hon. Minister was very fortunate in that respect, although he consulted the city council before he introduced this Bill in the Other Place, which was two or three days before the election of the new councillors in Pretoria took place. Perhaps they were more concerned therefore with other matters, matters of personal interest, when this was introduced in the Other Place. The reacton in the Press of the Transvaal, such as the reaction in <i>Hoofstad</i> and <i>Die Transvaler,</i> shows that there is a deep-seated anxiety amongst the people in Prtoria as to what is being done and why these powers should be taken. We believe that this is wrong and that these matters are essentially matters for the local inhabitants to decide upon. This is one occasion when we from the Cape would be able to say : &#x201C;Let Pretoria decide what should be done; this is in Pretoria and we in the Cape will decide on what should be done in Cape Town.&#x201D; We want to say we support this view. Let the citizens and the voters of Pretoria decide upon these matters and not the Minister. We have made our position clear and I need not elaborate upon it. We are against any diminution of the rights of local authorities and of the provincial administration in regard to matters of town planning, town planning schemes, town development and the general interest which directly affects the inhabitants of a local area. For that reason we cannot support this Bill and therefore I move:</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, one is amazed at the conduct of the United Party. When one expects them to oppose legislation, as I expected them to do this week with respect to the South African Indian Council Bill, they have a string of speakers in support of the matter.

<p>The hon. member for Green Point claimed here that the Pretoria City Council&#x2019;s <span class="col_4355-4356" refersTo="page_0640"/>powers are being curtailed in this Bill and being taken completely out of its hands in respect of the development of Church Square. The hon. member quoted here an article from one of the Transvaal newspapers that only referred to this matter in passing. He quoted one letter here which actually, in the broad sense, defends the standpoint I want to advance today. I thought that today the hon. member would come along with piles of letters and with additional examples attesting to opposition to this legislation.

<p>I am sorry, Mr. Speaker. I want to say that there are five member of the Pretoria City Council living in my constituency. Two of those members are also members of the executive committee of the Pretoria City Council. One of those members is the deputy mayor of the city. This legislation was already introduced in the Other Place at the end of last month. The hon. member said that the members of the City Council were very busy with a municipal election and that perhaps they could not give the necessary attention to this matter. From the time that legislation came up for consideration initially to the present moment, not one of those five very prominent members of the Pretoria City Council has lodged any objections with me, as their representative in this House. I want to go further and state that in fact I did not have a single objection from anyone in Pretoria in connection with this legislation. This measure, in my opinion, actually has no political implications. Why the hon. members of the Opposition now want to oppose it to such an extent. I do not know. All I can think of is that they want to make political capital out of the matter.</p>

<p>Church Square with the Kruger statue is the pride of every inhabitant of Pretoria. Church Square is closely linked up with the history of the city. It is very closely linked up with the history of the old South African Republic, of the Transvaal after the Anglo-Boer War up to 1910, of the Union of South Africa and of the Republic of South Africa. Church Square bore witness to great events, milestones in South African history. Throughout the years it has been a very important meeting place. Let me put it this way : Church Square bore witness to the joy and the sorrow of a people, its victories and its defeats, its heights in glory, but also its depths of humiliation. I can mention many examples from history to illustrate what I mean by this. But I shall mention only two. I shall just mention here an event during the Anglo-Boer War when the Transvaal Vierkleur was struck there for the last time and disappeared in the political context. But on the other hand I mention the event on 31st May, 1961&#x2014;the investiture of the State President&#x2014;when tens of thousands of enthusiastic supporters of the Republic, and others who voted against becoming a Republic, gathered on that occasion on Church Square. Church Square is woven into the existence of our people; it is woven into the continued existence of our people. It is closely linked to the development, the advancement and the progress of our people. It accommodates the statue of a Paul Kruger, a statue that previously occupied various positions until it found its permanent place of rest on Church Square. I believe it is also intended that that statue will retain its rightful place there.</p>

<p>Around this square there are historic buildings. There is the old Raadsaal, the Palace of Justice, buildings dating from the days of the South African Republic. Architectonically and otherwise they may in modern eyes not have the same appearance as the up-to-date steel and concrete structures with their neutral character. Some of these modern buildings tower into the sky near Church Square, but these old structures I am speaking about have a character of their own; an architectonic beauty <span class="col_4357-4358" refersTo="page_0641"/>that grips one after all. In addition, they are sturdily built with foundation stones of slate in some cases.</p>

<p>But in addition to the aforementioned buildings there are also other historic buildings which, together with those mentioned, contribute towards giving the Square a particular character. It is with these buildings, which have a special character and where a particular atmosphere is created that the Kruger statue also fits in. Every Pretorian, every Transvaler, and I believe every inhabitant of the Republic, wants to retain the best of the past, and this applies to the buildings as well. They would like to see that as many as possible of the buildings round the square are preserved and that Church Square chiefly retains its existing cultural-historic character. If changes must take place, these must be carried out with great deliberation and discretion. That is definitely the wish and desire generally. Apart from the fact that Church Square falls under the care and jurisdiction of the Pretoria City Council, it is in a broader sense the property of the entire people. It is a national asset as such. It is in the light of this fact, in the light of this truth, that the Cabinet realized how important it is to preserve Church Square. That is why the Cabinet instituted a Committee in 1971 with instructions to institute an urgent inquiry into and report on the function that Church Square must fulfil as a geographic and historic centre-point. It also had to be determined how the development of building sites and buildings, even those that are State property and that adjoin Church Square or are situated in its immediate vicinity, will affect the square. That is indeed how I interpret the terms of reference of the Church Square committee.</p>

<p>This Church Square committee worked out a new scheme for the replanning of Church Square. They also recommended legislation with this broad aim : control over the development of Church Square and the stands adjoining and in the immediate vicinity of Church Square. As a result it is the intention that no razing of buildings may take place, and that no new buildings may be erected without the Minister of Public Works having granted his written approval. Sir, that is what the hon. members of the Opposition are objecting to as such.</p>

<p>The plans initially submitted for the development of Church Square did not meet with much approval. There were various organizations and bodies, who for many years have been interested in the development of Pretorial in general, who objected. I am thinking, for example, of the Old Pretoria Association and the Simon van der Stel Foundation. Objections were also forthcoming from the Academy of Arts and Science and a number of Rapportryer corps. The Cabinet saw these objections in a serious light. That is why they also asked this committee to submit a new scheme. This Church Square Committee consists of persons of very great eminence. Some of them can definitely be regarded as authorities on the matter they are handling. I am thinking here, for example, of the Director of Architectural Services of the Department of Public Works, i.e. Mr. Badnitz, a person I know personally and for whom I have very great esteem. Then there is also Mr. Hans Botha and Mr. A. C. Doherty, well-known architects in Pretoria; and Mr. J. D. P. Burger, Director of Works of the Transvaal Provincial Administration. They are all outstanding people, with special knowledge in their field. At the request of the Cabinet this Committee worked out and submitted a new detailed scheme, i.e. a model for the entire Church Square. Each of these organizations I mentioned, which initially objected, very throughly examined the model, the proposal, the plan and conveyed their satisfaction with the new scheme.</p>

<p>Now we come to the Pretoria City Council. The Pretoria City Council made no objections to this legislation either, and I challenge hon. members on the other side to refute my statement. Mr. H. Rode, town clerk of Pretoria, also has a seat on the Church Square Committee. I believe this committee will continue to exist to advise the Minister about the redesign and redevelopment of Church Square. The Cabinet decided that the Pretoria City Council should administer the redevelopment of Church Square, since the City Council has the right of possession as far as Church Square is concerned, and the right of possession remains vested in the City Council. The Government will also carry the costs involved in the redevelopment. The Minister will have the final say and this is, in fact, true in connection with all development that will take place on and around Church Square, and the City Council has agreed that this should be left to the Minister. The various bodies and organizations that can possibly be affected by the further development <span class="col_4359-4360" refersTo="page_0642"/>of Church Square, the razing of or improvement to existing buildings, the erection of new buildings, etc., will have the opportunity to submit their objections to the Minister when a difference of opinion crops up. There must, after all, be a body or an organization that ultimately has to decide. Now it is the Minister that will decide on this matter. He will finally decide after consultation with the Pretoria City Council. We are aware that the City Council expressed its approval of the legislation and what it entails. The city council only proposed one amendment, i.e. in respect of clause 2 (4), i.e. that the period be extended to 90 days instead of 60 days. I state this for the information of the hon. member for Green Point. The hon. member referred offensively to the 90 days, but this amendment was actually introduced after the City Council asked for it. The period was then extended from 60 days to 90 days.</p>

<p>I emphasize that I received no protest in this connection and therefore, as a member of this House and a Pretorian, I am also very glad about this legislation before us today.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, since I have been in this House we have often had to listen to the hon. member for Koedoespoort, and I have often wondered how wrong one could be, but I have never heard him as wrong as he was this afternoon at the start of his speech. There is a current saying, namely &#x201C;How wrong can a man be&#x003F;&#x201D;. The hon. member for Koedoespoort referred to certain legislation that he had expected us to oppose, and much to his surprise he found that we supported it. This afternoon he expected us to support this legislation and he is very surprised to find that we have very strong feelings against it and that we in fact are opposing it. This just goes to show how wrong a man can be, especially when he can, out of his own mouth, be convicted of having been so wrong in the last couple of weeks in this House. [Interjections.] I hear an interjection about &#x201C;politiek&#x201D; from behind me. The hon. member for Koedoespoort also said that there is no political implication in this measure and that that was why he did not believe that we would oppose it. He believed that we would support it because there was no politics to be made out of this at all. I accept that. Of course there is no politics to be made out of it. But must we only oppose measures when there is politics to be made out of it&#x003F; Is that the policy of the other side of the House, namely that they will only debate measures when they can make politics out of it&#x003F; That is the whole point. There is no politics to be made out of this, but we, the Opposition, feel that it is our duty to register our strongest protest at the powers which the hon. the Minister is now asking to be passed over to him in terms of this Bill. We are doing this not because it is Church Square in Pretoria. It could be a square in Cape Town. Bloemfontein or Pietermaritzburg. It is a question of principle and not politics.</p>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Over the past few weeks there has been much debate, both in this House and outside, about our economic position and prospects. Some have painted a gloomy picture of our economic future; others with more faith and, I believe, more reason, have taken a more optimistic view. All are agreed, however, that prosperity and growth will not be attained without effort; hard work and good judgment will be required from the Government, from our economic leaders, and indeed from all members of the community. The Government is determined to make its contribution, and this Budget is designed to give direction and impetus to the national drive for a more prosperous South Africa.</p>

<p>As is customary, I shall start with a review of our present economic situation. This matter has already been extensively discussed in recent debates, and since I should like to devote a little more time to an evaluation of the problems facing our economy and the measures required to solve them, I shall follow the precept of Polonius in Shakespeare&#x2019;s &#x201C;Hamlet&#x201D; where he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,</block>

<block name="quote">And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,</block>

<block name="quote">I will be brief.&#x201D;</block>

<p><i>General Economic Conditions</i></p>

<p>The growth rate of the gross domestic product in 1971, after allowing for price changes, was approximately 4 per cent. This relatively low rate (for South Africa) is due principally to a slight decline in mining production (chiefly gold and platinum) and to a relatively small increase of 3 per cent in manufacturing production. It would appear that there was an actual decline in manufacturing production per man-hour between December, 1970 and November, 1971. Agricultural production and transport services, on the other hand, increased more rapidly than in 1970. Activity in the construction industry tended to level off during 1971, but wholesale and retail trade recovered substantially from its relatively low level at the beginning of the year.</p>

<p>On the expenditure side, the anti-inflationary measures of the authorities succeeded in reducing the real rate of increase in gross domestic expenditure from 9 per cent in 1970 to about 4 per cent in 1971&#x2014; that is, to a rate comparable to that of the gross domestic product.</p>

<p>Private consumption expenditure rose slowly during the first half but more rapidly during the second half of 1971; the real rate of increase over the year was about 4&#x00BD; per cent.</p>

<p>Salary and wage increases were largely responsible for an increase of 20 per cent in current expenditure by general government during 1971. If the effect of price increases, including salary and wage adjustments, is excluded, the increase was about 9&#x00BD; per cent.</p>

<p>Fixed investment rose by 15 per cent in 1971 as against 19 per cent in 1970. It is encouraging to note, however, that there was a substantial increase&#x2014;no less than 34 per cent&#x2014;in fixed investment by private manufacturing industry. This item has now shown a marked improvement in two successive years, and it is estimated that the capital assets of the private manufacturing sector, measured in constant prices, increased by 10 per cent in the two-year period 1970-&#x2019;71. There were also large increases in capital investment by the provincial administrations and the South African Railways.</p>

<p>Investment in inventories was still large in 1971, though slightly less than in 1970. Savings continued to fall short of investment requirements and the ratio of gross domestic saving to gross domestic product declined from nearly 24 per cent in 1969 to 22 per cent in 1971.</p>

<p>The slower rate of growth in the economy led to an easing of the tight labour situation; employment increased more slowly and there was a slight rise in registered unemployment&#x2014;which still remains, however, at a very low level. Despite this <span class="col_4365-4366" refersTo="page_0645"/>easier trend, average salaries and wages of non-agricultural workers were more than 10 per cent higher during the first nine months of 1971 than during the corresponding period of 1970.</p>

<p>Recent trends in prices have been discussed at length in this House, but for the record I shall mention that the index of consumer prices over the year 1971 was 5,7 per cent higher than the corresponding figure for 1970, and that this relatively high rate of increase was largely due to increases in indirect taxes and certain State-administered prices during the early part of 1971. In the fourth quarter of 1971 there were also some increases in the prices of imported goods as a result of upward adjustments in the exchange rates of some of our trading partners. Wholesale prices of imported goods rose, in fact, by 5,8 per cent in 1971 as compared with 3 per cent in 1970.</p>

<p>The latest available figures show that, over the period September, 1971, to January, 1972, the seasonally adjusted consumer price index increased at an annual rate of 5,2 per cent.</p>

<p><i>Balance of Payments</i></p>

<p>During 1971 the South African economy was strongly influenced by the balance of payments, which in its turn was much affected by external events, in particular the uncertainty regarding exchange rates which persisted during most of the year and which became acute in the months preceding the general realignment of currencies in December.</p>

<p>As a result of the anti-inflationary measures of the authorities and the consequent slower growth of consumption, imports increased more slowly during the first three quarters of 1971 than in the previous year. Exports showed only a limited improvement, rising by 4 per cent over their 1970 level. The net result was that the balance of payments on current account showed a gradual but steady improvement during the first three quarters of 1971. Since the inflow of foreign capital remained at a high level no special additional measures appeared at that time to be called for in order to rectify the balance of payments.</p>

<p>The accentuation of exchange rate uncertainty after August, 1971, however, significantly changed the situation. Fears of a depreciation in the rand along with the United States dollar gave rise to an increase in imports, a diminution in the inflow of capital, accelerated payments for imports and delays in payment for exports, resulting in a rapid fall in the gold and foreign exchange reserves from R645 million at the end of August to R570 million at the end of November. In these circumstances the Government was forced in November to intensify import restrictions. On 21st December, after the general realignment of major currencies had been announced, the rand was devalued by approximately 12,28 per cent to a new parity equivalent to R28-50 per fine ounce of gold.</p>

<p>The reasons for the devaluation have been explained many times and here it will be sufficient to sum them up very briefly as follows&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) the need to give an additional measure of protection and stimulus to South African secondary industry, particularly in view of the unused productive capacity and the easier labour situation which developed during 1971;</li>

<li>(2) the desirability of placing our export trade in a stronger position to compete on world markets, especially in view of the prospective entry of Britain into the European Economic Community;</li>

<li>(3) the necessity of giving an added stimulus to the gold-mining industry;</li>

<li>(4) the desirability of giving a general boost to the economy in order to achieve a rapid rate of economic growth; and</li>

<li>(5) above all, the need to achieve a substantial and lasting improvement in the balance of payments on current account.</li></ol>

<p>Over the year 1971 as a whole merchandise imports reached the record level of R2 888 million, and the deficit in the balance of payments on current account amounted to no less than R1 005 million. There was a substantial inflow of capital &#x2014;R564 million to the private sector and R199 million to the central Government and banking sector, a total of R763 million&#x2014;so that the gold and foreign exchange <span class="col_4367-4368" refersTo="page_0646"/>reserves declined over the year, as a result of balance of payments transactions, by R242 million. If account is taken of the second allocation of Special Drawing Rights (R15 million), the profit of R2 million on the revaluation of the Swiss franc in May, 1971, and the profit of R69 million consequent upon the realignment of currencies in December, the reserves actually declined over the year by only R156 million to a level of R651 million.</p>

<p>Since devaluation the balance of payments appears to have performed moderately well, though the statistical evidence is not yet conclusive. On the one hand, the total gold and foreign exchange reserves (excluding the new allocation of Special Drawing Rights) declined in January by R21 million&#x2014;the latest available figure. The gold and foreign exchange reserves held by the Reserve Bank, on the other hand, rose from R375 million on 17th December to R539 million on 17th March. Of this increase of R164 million, an amount of R55 million was accounted for by the revaluation of the Reserve Bank&#x2019;s foreign reserves following upon the devaluation of the rand, and R28 million by a new allocation of Special Drawing Rights, leaving a balance of R81 million due to balance of payments transactions. This compares with a fall of R103 million in the period from the end of September to 17th December, 1971. While the improvement was doubtless due in part to capital inflows and a reversal of leads and lags in payments for imports and exports, it is significant that imports declined from a seasonally adjusted annual rate of R2 933 million in December to R2 792 million in January and R2 675 million in February. Import control will, of course, also have influenced these figures.</p>

<p><i>Monetary and Banking Conditions</i></p>

<p>The quantity of money and near-money increased during 1971 at a slower rate than the gross domestic product at current prices, so that the ratio between these two quantities declined from 30,8 per cent in 1970 to 29,7 per cent in 1971. Substantial increases in bank credit to the Government and private sectors were offset to a considerable extent by the deficit in the balance of payments. The increase in bank credit to the private sector was, however, largely the result of increased cash credits extended by the Land Bank for the financing of crops. Apart from a relaxation of 2 per cent in respect of credit for agricultural purposes, the credit ceilings were, in general, strictly applied during 1971. During January 1972 the seasonally adjusted quantity of money and nearmoney declined by R13 million.</p>

<p>Short-term interest rates fluctuated appreciably over the year 1971 but showed a general upward trend. The capital markets remained tight and, although the increase in the rate of interest on long-term Government stocks to 8&#x00BD; per cent per annum (as announced in my previous Budget) enabled the Government to achieve a fair measure of success in its local borrowing operations, it was still unable to obtain all the funds it required from non-bank sources. Since the end of 1971 conditions in the capital market appear to have improved and the Government loan issued last January was more successful than had been expected. In part, however, this must be ascribed to the stricter conditions imposed last year on insurance companies and pension funds regarding minimum holdings of government stocks and other prescribed investments.</p>

<p>While building societies experienced a generally satisfactory inflow of funds during 1971, there was a marked decline in this inflow in January and February 1972. Moreover, the margin between the average interest cost of funds for the societies and the average interest earned on mortgage loans seems to have narrowed to a level which cannot easily be maintained.</p>

<p><i>Economic Prospects and Policy.</i></p>

<p>In the economic situation which I have briefly described, the principal aims of government policy are clear.</p>

<ol>

<li>(i) <i>Improvement in the balance of payments.</i></li>

</ol>

<block name="quote">Since external factors were mainly responsible for the situation which developed towards the end of last year and which forced the Government to intensify import restrictions and later to devalue the rand, first priority must be given to the improvement of the balance of payments, in particular the reduction of the large deficit on current account, and the rebuilding of our external reserves to a safer level.</block>

<ol>

<li><span class="col_4369-4370" refersTo="page_0647"/>(ii) <i>More rapid rate of growth.</i></li>

</ol>

<block name="quote">While the rate of growth of the gross domestic product (in real terms) during 1971 was not low by international standards, it is the aim of Government policy to increase this rate of growth to the highest level compatible with our available resources and productive capacity and with the first objective which I mentioned. Naturally, this objective must be pursued within the particular social and economic structure of the South African community.</block>

<ol>

<li>(iii) <i>Curbing of inflation.</i></li>

</ol>

<block name="quote">It is still a major aim of policy to curb inflation, and this objective is doubly important if we are to reap the benefits of devaluation, since undue price and cost increases would impair our competitive position in domestic and foreign markets.</block>

<p>In present circumstances and in the short run, there is inevitably some conflict between these objectives&#x2014;for example, between maximum growth on the one hand, and price stability and balance of payments equilibrium on the other. It is therefore necessary to achieve a balance in the application of the various measures required to achieve these aims.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there are various positive factors which should be of material assistance in our task.</p>

<p>The first is that we have been blessed with a favourable agricultural season, so that production in many branches of farming, both for the local market and for export, should reach high levels this year. This is indeed a cause for thankfulness.</p>

<p>Secondly, there has already been an improvement in the markets for some of our export products, particularly agricultural and mining products. If, as many expect, economic growth in Europe and North America should accelerate, this improvement should continue. It is not always realized how adversely the Republic&#x2019;s export trade was affected in 1971 by lower prices in world markets, and how much this contributed to the deterioration in our balance of payments. Declines were registered in the world prices of iron ore, platinum, nickel, copper, wool, coal, diamonds and several other products so that the South African exporter must have felt with Shakespeare that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;When sorrows come, they come not single spies</block>

<block name="quote">But in battalions.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Now, and of course especially since devaluation, the situation for many of these export products looks distinctly more promising.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the high price of gold on the private market which has now persisted for several weeks is obviously of benefit to the whole economy. It is impossible to predict whether the price will remain at the present level, but the continuance of at least a moderate and steadily increasing premium on the official price seems probable.</p>

<p>Fourthly, the productive capacity of manufacturing industry has been considerably expanded in the past two years, and some portion of this capacity is still underutilized. Moreover, the labour position is definitely easier than it was a year or two ago. It should, therefore, be possible with existing resources to expand production quite appreciably without undue inflationary effects.</p>

<p>A fifth positive factor is that the heavy Government expenditure on infrastructure services during the past few years will enable these services to cope with some expansion of production with reasonable adequacy.</p>

<p>I should also like to question the widelyheld view that the advantages gained by devaluation are necessarily short lived and must be exploited with all possible speed before they disappear. In fact, the advantages disappear only if price increases in South Africa are greater than those of our trading partners. It is therefore of the utmost importance that the expected more rapid growth in the economy should not be stimulated to such an extent as to cause unnecessary pressure on our labour and capital resources. A balanced programme of action is necessary, not a hasty, reckless dash for growth at any cost.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the time has come to implement such a co-ordinated programme of action without delay. As Brutus said in Shakespeare&#x2019;s &#x201C;Julius Caesar&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_4371-4372" refersTo="page_0648"/>&#x201C;There is a tide in the affairs of men,</block> 

<block name="quote">Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;</block>

<block name="quote">Omitted, all the voyage of their life</block>

<block name="quote">Is bound in shallows and in miseries.&#x201D;</block>

<p><i>Programme of Action</i></p>

<ol>

<li>(1) <i>Fiscal policy.</i></li>

</ol>

<p>The first element in this programme is fiscal action. Details will have to wait until later in this Budget Speech, but broadly it is clear that we must aim at substantially reducing the rate of increase in State expenditure, especially on services which do not contribute directly to the economic infrastructure, and at financing expenditure as far as possible from non-inflationary sources. Furthermore, the tax system must be revised so as to remove unnecessary obstacles to growth and to promote production and export wherever possible.</p>

<ol>

<li>(2) <i>Credit and monetary policy.</i></li>

</ol>

<p>Monetary and credit policy is also of great importance. The Governor of the Reserve Bank announced earlier today that the banks will be allowed to exceed the ceiling figures applicable to their discounts and advances by 5 per cent, and those applicable to their investments by 10 per cent, in order to permit a somewhat greater volume of credit for production and export purposes. In this connection I should like to express the hope that sympathetic consideration be given by the banks to credit for the beneficiation of base minerals, a sphere in which our export prospects appear particularly promising.</p>

<p>As the Governor explained, the relaxation of credit control is likely to give rise to keener competition among banking institutions for deposits, which might tend to counteract any tendency towards an easing in the genera] level of interest rates which may develop in the coming months. Such competition might furthermore force the building societies to increase their lending rates on mortgage bonds. It has therefore been deemed advisable to prescribe maximum interest rates payable by banks and building societies on deposits and building society shares. These maximum rates, as announced by the Governor, will take effect tomorrow.</p>

<p>If interest rate control is to operate effectively, however, it must also be applied to certain other types of financial transactions which are similar to, or directly in competition with, deposits with banks and building societies. As from tomorrow, therefore, the rate of interest payable on participation bond schemes may not exceed 8&#x00BD; per cent per annum. The same maximum rate of interest will apply to loans or deposits received by persons or companies (other than banks and building societies) who act as financial intermediaries, i.e. who lend the money so received to members of the public. This includes debentures issued by subsidiaries of banks. The necessary regulations will be gazetted today. The maximum rates will not affect existing loan or deposit contracts until they expire, but will apply to all new contracts concluded as from tomorrow.</p>

<p>The controls are not designed to force down interest rates to unrealistic levels. If the balance of payments improves and the inflow of foreign capital continues, it is quite possible that internal liquidity will increase to such an extent that interest rates will tend to decline&#x2014;a softer tendency has already been noted in the capital market. The authorities will therefore review the position from time to time.</p>

<p>Among the institutions which should benefit substantially from these controls are the building societies. The societies have already received exceptionally favourable treatment from the authorities in many ways, and I trust that they will find it possible to fulfil adequately their function of assisting the ordinary man to build or acquire a house. While I am aware of the limitations imposed upon the societies in respect of the granting of large mortgage loans, I wish to appeal to them to devote a greater proportion of their funds to more modest housing for the ordinary man and less to luxury housing for the well-to-do. The Technical Committee on Banks and Building Societies will give further attention to this and other matters affecting the position of the societies in our financial structure.</p>

<p>The same Committee is also considering changes in our credit control methods with a view to the eventual replacement of the credit ceiling by other measures. This study is, however, not yet completed.</p>

<p>Another aspect of credit policy which <span class="col_4373-4374" refersTo="page_0649"/>requires attention is the exchange control restriction on foreign borrowing by private firms. The complete lifting of this control cannot yet be contemplated since this would tend to neutralize the internal control of credit, but the Reserve Bank will continue its recent policy of adopting a somewhat more lenient attitude on a selective basis, towards applications for foreign borrowing for important industrial or mining development. This policy should not only make a significant contribution to the development of the industries concerned, but should also strengthen the balance of payments, relieve the pressure on the domestic capital market and so exert a downward pressure on interest rates.</p>

<ol>

<li>(3) <i>Promotion of saving.</i></li>

</ol>

<p>Greater saving is essential if we are to combat inflation effectively and finance the expansion of our economy, and further attention has been given to the channels of saving provided by the State. Measures to streamline the Post Office Savings Bank and make it more attractive to investors must await the computerization of the Savings Bank, which should be completed next year. As regards National Savings Certificates, certain important simplifications and improvements will be introduced. A new series will be issued on 1st August, 1972, carrying a rate of interest of 7,4 per cent per annum if held to maturity, i.e. for five years. Interest will be free of income tax up to a maximum investment in this series of R15 000 per person, irrespective of any other holdings of tax-free investments. Certificates of a value up to R10 may be freely bought and repaid at post offices without the completion of any forms; in other words, these will be bearer certificates and not registered in the name of the depositor. The higher denominations of certificates will, however, as at present, be registered in the name of the holder. Further details will be announced in due course. I feel sure that these investments will prove a convenient and attractive form of investment, especially for the salary&#x2013; and wageearner.</p>

<p>As a further incentive to saving, the Government has decided to launch a home-owners&#x2019; saving scheme. The scheme is designed to encourage middle- and lower-income groups to save so as to acquire a house for their own occupation, and the Government will help by contributing 2 per cent interest on such savings annually. All persons who earn not more than R5 000 per annum will be able to join the scheme by opening a special State-assisted home-owners&#x2019; savings account with a building society. Savings in such an account can accumulate up to R4 000, and will bear interest at the current building society rate (at present 6&#x00BD; per cent) <i>plus</i> 2 per cent payable by the State. The interest will be tax-free. The savings may be withdrawn at any time after 18 months for the erection or purchase of a dwelling, but withdrawals for any other purpose will entail loss of the subsidy. The value of the dwelling erected or purchased, including the cost of the site, may not exceed R16 000 and the building society loan may not exceed R12 000. Details of the scheme will be announced by my colleague, the Minister of Community Development. I am convinced that this scheme will not only encourage saving but will be of real assistance to our young people in acquiring a home. It should also strengthen the position of the building societies and place them in a better position to resist upward pressure on their lending rates.</p>

<ol>

<li>(4) <i>Labour policy.</i></li>

</ol>

<p>Although the labour position has eased, skilled labour remains a scarce factor and, if the economy should resume a rapid rate of growth, shortages of labour may again appear. This problem therefore requires continued attention.</p>

<p>To a large extent the improvement of productivity is a task for private enterprise. Productivity can be increased by the private sector through the full utilization of the opportunities already created by the Government. For example, the Industrial Conciliation Act was amended to provide for a levy on employers in a particular industry out of which compensation could be paid to those firms which train labour; this amendment was designed to encourage the training of labour by the private sector itself, and is effectively used in certain industries such as the engineering, building and clothing industries. Much greater use can, however, still be made of this scheme. Productivity can also be increased by the further use of those recommendations of the Geyser Committee which were accepted by the Government and announced in the White Paper on the Decentralization of Industries. Much can be achieved, as the Railways Administration has shown, where the employers&#x2019; organizations can obtain the <span class="col_4375-4376" refersTo="page_0650"/>co-operation of the trade unions for the reclassification of work categories so as to permit of the more effective use of both skilled and unskilled workers.</p>

<p>Within our basic social structure the Government&#x2019;s attitude towards labour problems remains flexible. In present circumstances, for example, a concession may be justified where additional Bantu labour is required to permit greater use of unutilized productive capacity. The authorities will, therefore, be prepared to consider allowing industry in the Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging and other urban areas to employ additional Bantu labour in order to work multiple shifts, even where the ratio of Bantu to White labour exceeds 2,5 to 1. Naturally this concession can only be granted on a selective basis (particularly for export industries) and with due regard to factors such as the availability of housing and transport, but nevertheless it can make a significant contribution to the better use of productive capacity.</p>

<p>The authorities will furthermore be prepared to allow a company or group of companies which wishes to move one or more of its activities to the decentralized areas, to retain its total quota of Bantu labour in the White metropolitan areas. This concession should encourage the creation of new job opportunities for Bantu in the Bantu or border areas.</p>

<p>I wish to emphasize that the Government is always prepared to consider adjustments of labour policy within the basic framework of our society, in order to promote efficiency and productivity. The rigidity of our labour laws is, in fact, often exaggerated. Work reservation, for example, is in certain cases essential for the protection of the White or Coloured worker and the preservation of industrial peace, but it is applied with great flexibility and exemptions are granted where justified. The Government has done and will do its part, but private enterprise must also make its contribution to increased productivity. It can do much, for example, by the in-service training of Bantu labour as well as by the fuller use of the facilities which I have mentioned.</p>

<p>Immigration is another field where the State and the private sector can work together to increase our productive labour force. Although the number of immigrants entering the country tended to decline during the earlier part of last year, there was a noticeable increase during the last quarter of 1971, probably on account of less favourable economic conditions in European countries. Judging by the number of applications received this year, this trend is continuing. The prospects for 1972 thus appear favourable and, as in the past, continued efforts will be made&#x2014;without, however, sacrificing principles or standards&#x2014;to extract the maximum benefit for the Republic from this situation in order to strengthen further our skilled labour force.</p>

<ol>

<li>(5) <i>Wage policy.</i></li>

</ol>

<p>In order to make the best use of devaluation, it is of the greatest importance that cost increases should be kept to a minimum, and in this regard the Government is confident that, as in the past, organized labour will exercise moderation and responsibility in wage negotiations. It should be borne in mind that, in the past five years, total real wages and salaries have increased at an average annual rate of 7 per cent, whereas the real net operating surplus (i.e. mainly profits) of all sectors excluding agriculture increased over the same period at an average rate of only 2 per cent per annum. Average wages and salaries have certainly risen more rapidly than consumer prices, while total remuneration of employees, expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product, has increased from 56 per cent in 1967 to about 62 per cent in 1971.</p>

<p>It should not be assumed that steep price increases are inevitable in the coming months and consequently justify sharp increases in wages and salaries. Careful estimates have shown that the devaluation of the rand should not in itself involve an increase of more than 2.7 per cent in the consumer price index&#x2014;1,3 per cent directly as a result of a rise in the prices of imported consumer goods and 1,4 per cent indirectly in consequence of the higher cost of production goods. This makes no allowance for a possible increase in the domestic price of goods which are also exported at world prices, but the influence of this factor is likely to be small in the aggregate.</p>

<p>Taking into account also its anti-inflationary and price control policies, therefore, the Government feels that moderation in wage demands is fully justified in the national interest and in the long-term interest of the workers themselves. Increases in wages without a corresponding increase in productivity must strengthen the upward pressure on costs and prices to the detriment <span class="col_4377-4378" refersTo="page_0651"/>of the community as a whole and without lasting benefit to the wage-earners.</p>

<ol>

<li>(6) <i>Price control.</i></li>

</ol>

<p>The extension of price control after the intensification of import restrictions and the devaluation of the rand helped to protect the public against excessive price increases not justified by increased costs flowing from these events. The indefinite continuation of the additional price control measures would, however, be harmful to the economy and would tend to restrain production, while it would involve a heavy administrative burden for the State and the private sector.</p>

<p>When, therefore, devaluation has exerted its full once-for-all effect on prices, the Government will give consideration to the replacement of these price control measures by a system of continuing consultation with organized commerce and industry, with the object of preventing unjustified price increases.</p>

<ol>

<li>(7) <i>Import control.</i></li>

</ol>

<p>Although the intensification of import control last November was designed to relieve the pressure on the balance of payments and was not intended as a permanent instrument of protection for local industry, the Government has already stated that South African industrialists will not be left unprotected against foreign competition. Adequate protection is essential to promote confidence and growth in the economy.</p>

<p>The customs tariff must remain the principal instrument of protection, and my colleague the Minister of Economic Affairs has already announced measures to grant adequate protection by this means in the changed international environment which has been created during the past year or two. In those cases where the Government&#x2019;s commitments under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade prevent it from extending effective tariff protection to industry, import restrictions will have to be retained until such time as the Government can succeed in obtaining the necessary freedom under the GATT to carry out its policy.</p>

<p>As regards the intensified restrictions imposed on 25th November, the Government is giving consideration to possible relaxations which can be introduced when the current balance of payments shows a significant improvement. These import control relaxations will, however, be carried out in such a way as not to cause disruption to local industry.</p>

<ol>

<li>(8) <i>Export promotion.</i></li>

</ol>

<p>It is of paramount importance that our exports should be increased. Here again this is primarily a matter for the private sector, but the Government will do all in its power to assist. The whole question of South Africa&#x2019;s export trade is at present being considered by a Commission of Inquiry under the Chairmanship of Professor H. J. J. Reynders, and this Commission has recently submitted an interim report containing certain urgent recommendations for the promotion of exports. The recommendations relate to tax concessions, which I shall deal with later, and export financing, which is still receiving attention. I can say here, however, that in all its policies the Government will give the utmost consideration to the encouragement of exports.</p>

<ol>

<li>(9) <i>Credit restrictions on the sale of motor-cars.</i></li>

</ol>

<p>The motor-car industry has been going through a difficult period, with sales at a comparatively low level just at the time when considerable investments in connection with the programme for local manufacture had been made. I believe that some relaxation in the credit restrictions on the sale of passenger motor-cars is justified and will assist this important industry to recover its prosperity. The minimum down payment on such sales will therefore be reduced from 40 per cent to 33 1/3 per cent, with immediate effect. This applies only to passenger cars and not to commercial vehicles.</p>

<ol>

<li>(10) <i>Relaxation of Building Control.</i></li>

</ol>

<p>Building control was instituted in order to channel as much building activity as possible into the erection of dwellings and flats. The position has now changed and the housing position can be satisfactorily dealt with without such control. In order to give greater freedom to the industry, the Government has decided to suspend building control. From the end of this month, therefore, it will no longer be necessary to submit applications for building permits to the Department of Community Development.</p>

<p>The plan of action which I have outlined is designed as a balanced programme to <span class="col_4379-4380" refersTo="page_0652"/>promote the three major aims which I mentioned earlier, namely, improvement of the balance of payments, more rapid economic growth, and price stability. Not everyone will agree with the emphasis placed on the different measures, and indeed the programme is capable of adaptation in the light of experience. I believe, however, that if we proceed on these lines, we shall reap the maximum benefit from, and minimize the adverse effects of, the devaluation of the rand. We shall then have cause to say, with the Duke in Shakespeare&#x2019;s &#x201C;As You Like It&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Sweet are the uses of adversity,</block>

<block name="quote">Which like the toad, ugly and venomous,</block>

<block name="quote">Wears yet a precious jewel in his head.&#x201D;</block>

<p><i>The Financial Year</i> 1971-&#x2019;72</p>

<p>I turn now to the State&#x2019;s accounts and I deal first with the financial year which is now drawing to a close.</p>

<p>Inland Revenue receipts for the year are expected to amount to R1 682,8 million, which is close to the original estimate. Receipts from customs, excise and sales duties will, however probably show a shortfall of R60 million, and are now estimated at R760,4 million. This is principally due to lower receipts in respect of import duties and of excise duty on liquor and motorcars, arising from consumer resistance to the higher duties imposed last year and from the general cooling down of the economy. Expenditure, on the other hand, is expected to amount to R2 520 million, or R32 million above the original estimate, chiefly as a result of higher expenditure on food subsidies (R7 million), the subsidy on fertilizer (R5 million), soil conservation and pest control (R9 million), contributions to pension and provident funds (R6 million), and additional provision for the Coloured Representative Council (R6 million).</p>

<p>In my previous Budget Speech I provided for the transfer of an amount of R39.1 million from Revenue to Loan Account. This is no longer necessary and steps will be taken to cancel the transfer. If account is also taken of the opening balance of R72.5 million, the Revenue Account should show a small deficit of R4,3 million at the close of this financial year.</p>

<p>On Loan Account, expenditure is estimated at R875 million, or R14,6 million more than the original figure, due principally to increased provision for telecommunications, public works and the Community Development Fund. As I mentioned earlier, however, our domestic issues of Government stock have been more successful than anticipated and the Loan Account should end the year with a surplus of R26,1 million.</p>

<p>I propose that the usual contribution of R5 million be made to the Loan Fund for the Promotion of Economic Co-operation, and that on this occasion the payment be made from the surplus on Loan Account, leaving a balance of R21,1 million in the Account.</p>

<p>On Revenue and Loan Accounts combined, there is therefore a net surplus of R16,8 million.</p>

<p>On the South-West Africa Account, both revenue and expenditure are expected to be slightly below the original estimate and the Account will end the year with a deficit of approximately R14,7 million, which will have to be met from Revenue Account.</p>

<p><i>The Financial Year</i> 1972-&#x2019;73</p>

<p><i>Expenditure</i></p>

<p>The Estimates of Expenditure from Revenue and Loan Account together provide for a sum of R3 545,4 million, which is R197,2 million or 5,9 per cent above the corresponding figure for 1971-&#x2019;72. In my earlier remarks I said that we must aim at substantially reducing the rate of increase in State expenditure, and clearly we have succeeded in this objective. This success was, however, only achieved at the cost of great sacrifices by my colleagues, and I wish to pay tribute to their loyal co-operation in this endeavour.</p>

<p><i>Revenue Account</i></p>

<p>The printed estimates which I shall lay upon the Table make provision for expenditure of R2 745,5 million on Revenue Account, which is R225.5 million or 9 per cent above the revised estimates for the current year. The increase would have been substantially lower were it not for a number of items which are virtually unavoidable, such as the subsidy on Bantu passenger transport, interest and management charges on public debt, payments to neighbouring countries under the Customs Union Agreement, payments to farmers under the stock reduction scheme, food subsidies, subsidies to Universities, provision for the Coloured Persons Representative Council, <span class="col_4381-4382" refersTo="page_0653"/>and pensions&#x2014;increases in respect of these services account for R93 million. There is also a substantial increase of R51 million under the Bantu Administration and Development Vote, but this is partly due to the fact that certain services previously performed by the Bantu Trust with funds provided under Loan and Bantu Education Accounts are now entrusted to the recently established governments of the Bantu areas which obtain funds from the Revenue Vote.</p>

<p>Provincial subsidies under the formula introduced last year show an increase of R63 million or 8,8 per cent above the revised estimate for 1971-&#x2019;72.</p>

<p><i>Social Pensions</i></p>

<p>Although I have had to turn a deaf ear to nearly all requests for increased expenditure, I think that an exception must be made in the case of social pensions. As was said by Portia in Shakespeare&#x2019;s &#x201C;Merchant of Venice&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;The quality of mercy is not strain&#x2019;d; It droppeth as the gentle rain from Heaven.</block>

<block name="quote">Upon the place beneath.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Our means are limited, but we must do what we can for the aged and others who, through circumstances, are facing financial hardship.</p>

<p>I propose that the basic social pensions and allowances for White persons be increased by R3 per month. Settlers&#x2019; allowances will be adjusted accordingly.</p>

<p>The war veterans&#x2019; pension consists of a basic old age pension plus an amount of R8 per month for war service. The latter amount has remained unchanged for many years and I think an increase to R10 is justified. War veterans will thus receive a total increase of R5 per month.</p>

<p>For war pensioners, I propose an increase in the bonus payable by 7&#x00BD; per cent, i.e. to 25 per cent.</p>

<p>I also feel that beneficiaries under the Children&#x2019;s Act are entitled to some relief in respect of their schoolgoing children. It has accordingly been decided to increase the additional social benefits specially payable in respect of such children by R1 per month per child.</p>

<p>Furthermore, a thorough investigation into the whole question of maintenance grants payable under the Children&#x2019;s Act would appear to be appropriate at this stage. The Government has accordingly decided to have the whole matter of the payment of such grants to all the population groups properly investigated, with particular reference to the possible abuse of this grant in respect of illegitimate children. The necessary arrangements in this connection are at present being made.</p>

<p>In order to simplify administration it is further proposed to introduce a uniform consolidated scale for the calculation of income and assets in the application of the means test to all pensioners. Details will be announced by the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions. In general, the changes will be of considerable benefit to those pensioners who do not at present receive the maximum pension, while a number of persons previously excluded by the means test will now qualify for a pension. For example, a person with an income of R984 can now qualify for the minimum pension. &#x201C;Free&#x201D; assets not taken into account for determining the pension are increased from R4 800 to R9 800.</p>

<p>It is furthermore proposed to increase the <i>per capita</i> allowance to children&#x2019;s homes and foster parents by R5 per month.</p>

<p>These concessions make it necessary to increase the minimum pensions payable to civil and railway pensioners by R6 per month for married and R3 per month for unmarried persons.</p>

<p>Similar concessions, at the applicable scales, are proposed for non-White pensioners.</p>

<p>In order to give the Department time to make the necessary arrangements, all these concessions will take effect from 1st October, 1972.</p>

<p><i>Chronically Sick Aged</i></p>

<p>The Department of Social Welfare and Pensions at present grants special additional subsidies to institutions for the aged in respect of chronically sick and infirm aged persons in their care. These subsidies are, however, inadequate to cover the additional cost involved and it is proposed to increase the subsidy in respect of chronically sick aged by R20 per person per month and for infirm aged (who do not require quite so much attention) by R5 per month. These increases will take effect from 1st April, 1972.</p>

<p><span class="col_4383-4384" refersTo="page_0654"/><i>Pneumoconiosis Pensions</i></p>

<p>Several increases in pension benefits payable under the pneumoconiosis legislation have been granted in recent years. Widows of deceased mine-workers received an increase last year. The Government has nevertheless decided to grant a further increase this year, with effect from 1st October, 1972, to all mineworkers and widows entitled to monthly pensions. Details will be announced later by the Minister of Mines.</p>

<p><i>Mentally Retarded Children</i></p>

<p>I think that an increase is justified in the allowance paid by the Department of Health in respect of mentally retarded children in day centres, and I propose an increase of 75 cents per child per school day, i.e. to R1 instead of the present allowance of 25 cents. This will take effect from 1st April, 1972.</p>

<p>The total cost to the Exchequer in 1972-&#x2019;73 of all these social concessions is estimated at R12 million.</p>

<p><i>Contribution to Civil Service Medical Benefit Association</i></p>

<p>Membership of this Association is now a condition of service and the Government contributes to the Association at the rate of R1,50 for every R1 subscription paid. In view of increasing medical costs it is likely that the Association will shortly have to increase its subscriptions and provision for an additional contribution by the State will then be necessary. The cost in 1972-&#x2019;73 will be R1,3 million.</p>

<p>Total expenditure on Revenue Account, including all the concessions which I have mentioned, will amount to R2 758,8 million.</p>

<p><i>Revenue,</i> 1972-&#x2019;73</p>

<p>It is always a difficult task to estimate revenue, and this year the task is exceptionally difficult because of the many uncertainties involved. Indeed, I wish that the Treasury had at its disposal the services of the witches in Shakespeare&#x2019;s &#x201C;Macbeth,&#x201D; who could&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;&#x2026; look into the seeds of time And say which grain will grow and which will not.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Customs revenue is almost certain to be below the level of the current year because of lower imports. Revenue from excise duties fell considerably short of expectations in 1971-&#x2019;72 because of lower sales of excisable goods, but experience has shown that consumer resistance to increased duties and higher prices tends to wear off after a time, and the expected revival of economic activity should also help to increase sales and revenue. After a detailed study of each item I estimate the revenue from customs, excise and sales duties at R760,7 million, which is approximately the same as the revised estimate for the current year.</p>

<p>Inland revenue is equally difficult to estimate. Premium gold sales should increase the receipts from gold mining taxation, but to some extent this will be counteracted by increased costs and by a reduction in the grade of ore mined. If economic activity shows the expected revival, the incomes of companies and self-employed persons as well as of employees may increase appreciably, but income tax revenue from the first two categories need not rise proportionately; this is because provisional tax payments can be based on the income of the previous year and the additional tax liability need only be met on assessment, which will in very many cases only be made in the following year. Taking all these factors into account, and perhaps erring slightly on the conservative side, I estimate the receipts from Inland Revenue at R1 800,9 million, or 7 per cent above the revised estimate for 1971-&#x2019;72.</p>

<p>Until a few years ago the revenue from transfer duty was credited to Revenue Account. In 1966, however, in order to strengthen the Loan Account, it was decided to transfer the proceeds of this duty to that Account. There is no compelling reason for this to he continued and, in view of the present need of the Revenue Account, I propose that transfer duty be restored to the latter account. The estimated revenue from this source in 1972-&#x2019;73 is R45 million.</p>

<p>The total revenue from customs, excise and sales duties and inland revenue (including transfer duty) is then R2 606,6 million, as against the estimated expenditure of R2 758,8 million. After making provision for the deficit on Revenue Account for 1971-&#x2019;72 (R4,3 million) and the amounts required to meet the deficits on the South-West Africa Account for 1971-&#x2019;72 and 1972-73 (R14,7 million and R22,4 million respectively), there is therefore a shortfall of R193,6 million.</p>

<p><span class="col_4385-4386" refersTo="page_0655"/><i>Loan Account,</i> 1972-&#x2019;73</p>

<p>The printed estimates show the estimated expenditure on Loan Account as R799,9 million, which is R75,l million or 8,6 per cent <i>less</i> than the revised estimates for the current year. This remarkable achievement required almost heroic sacrifices by my colleagues, some of whom must have been moved to exclaim with Mark Antony in Shakespeare&#x2019;s &#x201C;Julius Caesar&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;This was the most unkindest cut of all.&#x201D;</block>

<p>No doubt they would have preferred me to say, with Antonio in &#x201C;The Merchant of Venice&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;My purse, my person, my extremist means,</block>

<block name="quote">Lie all unlock&#x2019;d to your occasions.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Notable reductions have been made in the Votes Water Affairs (R9,6 million) and Community Development (R11,6 million). The provision for Bantu Administration and Development has been reduced by no less than R47,7 million, but to some extent this is offset by greater provision on Revenue Account, as I explained earlier.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I have tried, as far as resources permit, to make adequate provision for essential infra-structure services. For the Railways Administration, for instance, an increase of R14 million has been allowed. It would also be short-sighted to cut back too much on the programme of industrial decentralization, which is so important for our future economic and social development and which is now acquiring considerable momentum; an increase of R13,5 million has been provided for this purpose.</p>

<p>In addition, provision is required for the repayment or amortization of foreign loans to an amount of R109,3 million, and of internal loans and sundry items amounting to R487,0 million. The latter amount includes R30 million for the repayment of the loan levy first imposed seven years ago. By law this levy must be refunded not later than 28th February, 1973, and I have decided that the date of refund (including tax-free interest at 5 per cent per annum) will be 31st January, 1973.</p>

<p>In order to simplify administration and to remove a source of irritation, I propose further that the levy paid by certain categories of taxpayers will also be repaid, with interest, during the 1972-&#x2019;73 financial year. The categories are&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) women who marry,</li>

<li>(b) persons who leave the country permanently, and</li>

<li>(c) persons&#x2014;usually those who are aged or are in ill health&#x2014;whose financial position has so altered that they will not in the near future again be liable for normal tax.</li>

</ol>

<p>In future, the last assessment issued to women who marry or to persons who leave the country permanently, will also not include the loan levy.</p>

<p>The additional amount required for such repayments is estimated at R1,5 million.</p>

<p>I have also reconsidered the position of the Land Bank, for which R15 million is provided in the printed Estimates. Because of a slight improvement in the position of the Loan Account since the Estimates were drawn up, and because I am fully aware of the vital role played by the Land Bank in our farming industry, I have decided to increase the provision to R18 million, of which R8 million is for the erection of bulk storage capacity by co-operative societies and R10 million for normal loans to farmers&#x2014;the latter amount being provided at the special interest rate of 2 per cent per annum.</p>

<p>The total amount needed for the Loan Account is therefore R1400,7 million.</p>

<p>It is estimated that the following amounts will be available:</p>

<p>With the prospect of greater liquidity in the economy and some easing of the local capital market, I feel that we can hope to raise slightly more by the issue of local stock than the net amount of R178 million raised in the current year. I put the figure at R180 million.</p>

<p>Foreign loans are also at present more readily available, though I have not yet <span class="col_4387-4388" refersTo="page_0656"/>found anyone like Antonio in &#x201C;The Merchant of Venice&#x201D;, of whom Shylock said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;He lends out money gratis, and brings down</block>

<block name="quote">The rate of usance here with us in Venice.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Although I do not wish to rely too heavily on external loans, I think we can reasonably budget for an amount of R180 million.</p>

<p>A total of R1 452,4 million is therefore available to meet the estimated requirement of R1 400,7 million. Further consideration will be given to the position after some tax changes have been announced. To complete the picture, however, I must first deal briefly with the South-West Africa Account.</p>

<p><i>South-West Africa Account,</i> 1972-&#x2019;73</p>

<p>Here again strict economy has been exercised and the estimated expenditure, R63,7 million is 3,5 per cent less than the revised figure for the current year. Receipts are estimated at R69 million, which is very close to the 1971-&#x2019;72 level. Approximately R27,7 million will, however, have to be transferred to the South-West Africa Administration, leaving only R41,3 million available for the Account. The shortfall of R22,4 million will, as already mentioned, have to be met from Revenue Account.</p>

<p>Our principal problem is clearly the Revenue Account, where we face a shortfall of R193.6 million. If I were to deal with this problem on a narrow fiscal basis, then I should have to tell the House, as Mark Antony told the Roman populace in Shakespeare&#x2019;s &#x201C;Julius Caesar&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.&#x201D;</block>

<p>I believe, however, that we must view this problem in the wider context of South Africa&#x2019;s economic position. While the objective of price stability makes it impossible, in the present budgetary situation, to contemplate any substantial reduction of taxation, the need for more rapid growth makes it equally impossible to impose considerable new burdens upon the community&#x2014;especially where the shortfall on our Revenue Account can be ascribed, in some measure, to fortuitous factors such as the sluggish response of company income tax receipts to increased economic activity.</p>

<p>We have in previous years prudently set aside a reserve in the form of the Stabilization Account, which now stands at R161,5 million. Before considering what use should be made of this nest-egg, I wish to propose some tax changes, and I shall first announce some adjustments and concessions which have become necessary.</p>

<p>In this connection I should mention that the Government has appointed a Standing Commission of Inquiry into Taxation Policy, on which the private sector is represented. The Commission&#x2019;s task is to keep the tax system under constant review and to advise the Government on desirable changes and adaptations. Some of the changes which I shall introduce today arise out of the recommendations of the Commission.</p>

<p><i>Dividends on Building Society Shares</i></p>

<p>The first change was, in fact, announced last August, namely the concession whereby dividends on building society shares will in future be treated for tax purposes as company dividends, so that only a portion of these dividends, varying with income, is subject to income tax. This concession will cost approximately R5 million per annum and has already been allowed for in my estimates of revenue.</p>

<p><i>Stamp Duty. Transfers of Marketable Securities</i></p>

<p>A stamp duty of 1 per cent is at present payable in respect of the registration of transfer of marketable securities where the securities are sold or disposed of otherwise than on the Stock Exchange. The Stamp Duties Act provides for an exemption where a security is transferred from a nominee to a principal or <i>vice versa</i> or from one nominee to another nominee. This exemption was originally intended as a concession in cases where registration of transfer was affected without a change of beneficial ownership. It has come to my attention that schemes have been worked out to circumvent, or attempt to circumvent the underlying intention of the exemption and, by the use of nominees, to transfer the ownership in securities without the necessity for a registration of transfer. A number of schemes of this nature, involving the avoidance of considerable amounts of stamp duty, have come to the attention of the Secretary for Inland Revenue. A bill will be introduced to state more clearly <span class="col_4389-4390" refersTo="page_0657"/>the circumstances in which the exemption will apply and to impose stamp duty in cases where the registration of transfer of securities is avoided by the use of nominees. It is not the intention to interfere with the normal operations of stockbrokers and banks who make use of nominee companies for the convenience of clients, without avoidance of duty.</p>

<p>It is proposed to exempt from stamp duty the registration of transfer of securities where transfers are effected in order to give effect to arbitrage transactions put through on the local market and the stock market of a foreign country. Such transactions are already exempt from marketable securities tax and the proposed stamp duty exemption will make the local market more attractive to arbitrageurs and so result in a greater flow of foreign exchange to this country. The exemption in respect of arbitrage will apply to registrations effected in respect of transactions concluded after today.</p>

<p>The proposed amendments to the Stamp Duties Act in regard to nominees are of a somewhat technical nature and will come into operation on a date still to be fixed. It is estimated that there will be an overall increase in stamp duty collections of about R0,5 million per annum.</p>

<p><i>Single Premium Insurance Policies</i></p>

<p>It has come to my notice that during 1969 insurance companies commenced marketing certain single premium insurance policies on such terms that they are in effect no more than ordinary fixed deposits. The generous provisions contained in the Income Tax Act in respect of traditional insurance policies are being exploited by means of these so called insurance policies, in order to grant tax-free benefits to a small group of wealthy taxpayers. Lately the movement has gained momentum and not only is large scale tax avoidance now taking place but funds, estimated to be in excess of R50 million, have been drained from other financial sectors, especially building societies.</p>

<p>Legislation will be introduced to plug the loophole in the Income Tax Act as from the current tax year. This should bring in some extra tax and should also restore balance in the financial sector. Those who wish to avoid paying tax should rather make use of the tax-free investments offered by the Government.</p>

<p><i>Investment Allowances</i></p>

<p>The present investment allowances expire on 30th June, 1973. Since it takes time to erect factory buildings and install machinery, and since it is important that fixed investment in manufacturing industry should continue to expand, the deadline will be extended for two years and the allowances will apply to machinery, plant and factory buildings brought into use up to 30th June, 1975.</p>

<p><i>Exporters&#x2019; Allowance</i></p>

<p>I have already referred to the Interim Report submitted by the Reynders Commission of Inquiry into the Export Trade. The Commission feels that much greater emphasis should be placed on export promotion, and that the opportunities created by the devaluation of the rand and the revaluation of certain other currencies make this the right time to increase the incentives to exporters, in order to enable them to entrench their positions in existing markets and to penetrate and conquer new markets. As an urgent interim measure, the Commission recommends that the exporters&#x2019; allowance be increased, that the definition of &#x201C;marketing development expenditure&#x201D; qualifying for the allowance be broadened, and that the scope of the scheme should be modified, e.g. to cover service establishments.</p>

<p>The subject is a complicated one and there are several aspects relating to the nature and scope of this tax incentive which seem to me to call for further study. I certainly agree with the urgency of promoting our export trade, however, and I therefore propose that the rate of allowance be increased as recommended by the Commission, that is, that the basic additional deduction in respect of allowable expenditure on the development of export markets be increased from 50 per cent to 75 per cent, and that this additional deduction be increased to 100 per cent where an increase in basic export turnover of 10 per cent or more is achieved. Furthermore, the basic turnover will be determined as the average of the three poorest export sales years during the preceding five years. The definition of allowable expenditure and the scope of the scheme must, however, stand over for further consideration.</p>

<p>I feel that the importance of this concession is not always fully understood by potential exporters. On the basis of the <span class="col_4391-4392" refersTo="page_0658"/>standard 40 per cent rate of company income tax, the concession means in effect that the State will now bear 70 per cent of allowable market development expenses, which include costs of marketing research, advertising expenses, costs of soliciting orders, participating in trade fairs, cost of providing free samples and technical information, cost of bringing prospective buyers to the Republic, tender and quotation preparation costs, and commissions or other remuneration in respect of export sales. If export turnover is increased by only 10 per cent, the State will in effect bear 80 per cent of these expenses. This should be a powerful incentive to a more aggressive selling effort in our export markets.</p>

<p>This concession is estimated to cost R9 million in a full year, but the loss in 1972-&#x2019;73 will be negligible.</p>

<p><i>Married Women</i></p>

<p>The present allowance of R500 deductible from the earnings of a married woman tapers off after the combined income of husband and wife exceeds R8 000, so that the professional woman or the woman who can command a fairly high salary has little incentive to go out to work. This militates against our objective of higher productivity and growth, and I therefore propose that the deduction of R500 should not taper off but should remain at R500 irrespective of income. The loss of revenue in 1972-&#x2019;73 is estimated at R300 000.</p>

<p><i>Sales Duty</i></p>

<p>Representations have been made to the Government that the present sales duty be replaced by a duty levied at the point of sale to the consumer or by a tax on retail turnover. The matter is complicated and is being studied by the Standing Commission of Inquiry on Taxation Policy, which is expected to report to the Government later in the year.</p>

<p>Meanwhile it has been found possible to make concessions in respect of certain sales duty goods. Soap and washing preparations are being exempted from the payment of sales duty. In the case of knitting machines for domestic purposes and domestic sewing machines the rate of sales duty is being reduced from 15 per cent to 10 per cent, whilst the sales duty on watches and clocks is being reduced from 30 per cent to 25 per cent.</p>

<p>As a result of the devaluation of the rand the prices of imported components used in the manufacture of motor vehicles have increased. These increases in prices resulted in increased values for sales duty purposes and in order to maintain the position which applied before devaluation, it was decided to increase the maximum value for sales duty purposes from R2 050 to R2 150 in respect of motor vehicles which are subject to a sales duty of 10 per cent.</p>

<p>These concessions will be implemented by means of a Government Notice which will be published to-morrow and will result in a loss of revenue of approximately R2,5 million.</p>

<p>It is trusted that importers and manufacturers will pass the benefit of these concessions on to the consumer public.</p>

<p>A considerable number of representations were received in respect of sales duty goods which are not only sold as such but are also used as intermediate material in the manufacture of other goods, especially where such final products are exported. This matter is being investigated by an interdepartmental committee in co-operation with representatives of commerce and industry.</p>

<p>Interim proposals which have been submitted include, <i>inter alia,</i> recommendations that certain intermediate sales duty goods in packings used mainly in industry, should be exempted from the payment of sales duty. These proposals, which have been accepted by me in principle, will not only result in the elimination of a considerable amount of administrative problems for industry but will also have the effect that manufacturers of the final products in which such sales duty goods are used as material, will be able to utilize this advantage and, it is hoped, also pass it on to the consumer. For the Republic&#x2019;s export effort this concession will naturally be of great importance as it will make the South African product more competitive.</p>

<p>A further concession, which has also been accepted in principle, is that where sales duty goods are exported by persons other than the manufacturers, the sales duty, subject to certain conditions, may be refunded to the exporter.</p>

<p>The concessions mentioned will be implemented as soon as possible by means of a Government Notice.</p>

<p>Representations have further been received <span class="col_4393-4394" refersTo="page_0659"/>that exemption from the payment of sales duty should be granted in respect of certain goods for use in registered old age homes and schools. Provided the necessary machinery therefor can be established, the representations will be favourably considered.</p>

<p>The loss of revenue as a result of these concessions will depend upon when they can be implemented, but should not exceed R2 million in 1972-73.</p>

<p>I come now to the more important changes which I wish to propose. The problem, it will be recalled, is that we have in prospect a large deficit on Revenue Account and a surplus (though a smaller one) on Loan Account.</p>

<p>Quite apart from this particular set of circumstances, the Standing Commission of Inquiry into Taxation has given some thought to the question of loan levies and has come to the general conclusion that they have little justification under normal conditions. Although they are in fact a compulsory investment bearing interest at 5 per cent tax-free, they are still generally regarded as little different from a tax. Furthermore, if they are used to finance expenditure of a continuing nature (rather than large temporary increases in expenditure) then a problem must always arise when the time comes for their repayment. They also give rise to administrative problems. The general view was that the levies should be phased out.</p>

<p>In these circumstances it seems necessary to place more emphasis on taxation and less on the loan levies, and I propose to do this in the following way:</p>

<p><i>Company Income Tax</i></p>

<p>At present there is a loan levy of 7&#x00BD; per cent on the income tax payable by companies. To convert this levy at one stroke to a tax surcharge would have too drastic an effect on company balance sheets, and I propose therefore that one-third of the present levy should be converted to a surcharge of 2&#x00BD; per cent on company income tax, leaving a loan levy of 5 per cent on tax. This applies to all companies except gold and diamond mining companies, where the position will remain unchanged.</p>

<p>The special loan levy of 7&#x00BD; per cent of the dividend receipts of companies is difficult to justify as a permanent measure and gives rise to anomalies and to administrative difficulties. I cannot afford to abolish it entirely this year, but I propose that the rate be reduced to 3 per cent.</p>

<p>The net result of all these changes in company taxation should be a gain of R14,5 million to the Revenue Account (through the 2&#x00BD; per cent surcharge on company tax) and a loss of R26,2 million to the Loan Account (through the reduction in loan levies). In terms of cash, therefore, companies as a whole should be considerably better off than during the current year.</p>

<p><i>Income Tax on Individuals</i></p>

<p>The high marginal rates of income tax and loan levy applicable to those in the higher income brackets have caused some dissatisfaction and undoubtedly have a detrimental effect on productivity and the incentive to work. It is imperative to remove barriers to productivity as far as possible and I agree that marginal rates are too high. It would, unfortunately, involve too great a cost to reduce marginal rates to the maximum level recommended by the Franzsen Commission, but at least we can make a start in that direction.</p>

<p>I propose, therefore, that the loan levy on individuals be abolished completely and replaced by a 10 per cent surcharge on income tax, i.e. in addition to the present surcharge.</p>

<p>The result will be that the maximum marginal rate will be reduced from 78 per cent to 72 per cent. There will be small increases in the take-home pay of salary&#x2013; and wage-earners who previously paid loan levy, while those who did not will not be affected.</p>

<p>At present taxpayers over the age of 65 and with a taxable income not exceeding R5 000 are not liable for loan levy. In order to ensure that no taxpayer will pay more in tax on a given income than he now pays in tax plus loan levy, the same exemption will apply to the new 10 per cent surcharge, except that the concession will be somewhat more generous and will apply to taxpayers over the age of <i>sixty</i> with incomes not exceeding R5 000.</p>

<p>If account is taken of the considerable amounts of loan levy which will be repaid to taxpayers on 31st January next, it is clear that, in cash terms, nearly all taxpayers should be better off than in the current year.</p>

<p>The net effect of these changes in individual income tax will be a gain of R46,1<span class="col_4395-4396" refersTo="page_0660"/>million to the Revenue Account and a loss of R77 million to the Loan Account.</p>

<p><i>Conclusion</i></p>

<p>The net additional revenue available for the Revenue Account from all the tax changes which I have mentioned should amount to R56,3 million, so that the shortfall on this Account is reduced from R193,6 million to R137,3 million. This can be met by a transfer of, say, R140 million from the Stabilization Account, leaving a balance of R2,7 million in the Revenue Account.</p>

<p>The changes in loan levy will, however, cause the receipts of the Loan Account to fall by R103,2 million, thus converting the surplus of R51,7 million in that Account into a deficit of R51,5 million. An amount of R21,5 million can be met from the Stabilization Account, and the balance by the issue of Treasury Bills.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the taxation proposals which I have presented are not the only, or even the most important, element in this Budget. The main features of this Budget, as I see them, may be summarized as follows :</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) The relaxation of credit restrictions in order to promote production and export.</li>

<li>(2) The promotion of saving, particularly through the new home-owners saving scheme.</li>

<li>(3) The flexible application of labour policy.</li>

<li>(4) The substantial curbing of the rate of growth of State expenditure.</li>

<li>(5) The increase in social pensions.</li>

<li>(6) The increased tax incentives for exporters.</li>

<li>(7) The reduction in the sales duty on certain items.</li>

<li>(8) The improvement in the cash position of companies through the reduction in the loan levy on dividends received.</li>

<li>(9) The abolition of loan levy on individuals and consequently (a) the reduction in the maximum marginal rate payable, and (b) the increase in the take-home pay of all those persons who formerly paid loan levy.</li>

</ol>

<p>Most of these measures should contribute directly to the attainment of one or more of the three objectives which I mentioned early in my speech, namely, the improvement of the balance of payments, the achievement of a more rapid rate of growth, and the curbing of inflation.</p>

<p>Basically, however, the achievement of these objectives depend not so much on the Government&#x2019;s action as on the efforts of the whole community&#x2014;the industrialists, the workers, the farmers, the merchants, the professional men, and, let me add, the housewives. The housewife can, by judicious buying, play a most important role in curbing inflation and keeping down the cost of living.</p>

<p>In the first Budget which I presented to this House five years ago, I suggested that our watchword should be &#x201C;Work and save&#x201D;. This is equally applicable today, for no nation ever grew rich and strong without hard work and thrift. In the circumstances of 1972, however, I think our watchword can be elaborated and broadened.</p>

<p>Work is of little avail unless it is wisely directed and organized so as to be as <i>productive</i> as possible. I have already referred to the apparent decline in productivity, i.e. in production per man-hour, in manufacturing industry during 1971. This is a disturbing trend. The Productivity Advisory Council and the National Productivity Institute of the Bureau of Standards have done and are doing very useful work in this field, but it is primarily the task of private enterprise&#x2014;both employers and employees&#x2014;to increase efficiency. Higher productivity benefits all concerned and is essential for our economic progress.</p>

<p>Thrift, on the other hand, is of little avail unless the savings are wisely invested. The State does its best to protect the investor, particularly the small saver who puts his money in banks, building societies, insurance companies or pension funds, or of course with the Government itself through <span class="col_4399-4400" refersTo="page_0662"/>the Post Office Savings Bank or National Savings Certificates. The State cannot, however, guarantee the safety of <i>all</i> investments, and it is a wise rule to remember that an unusually high rate of return often involves a high risk.</p>

<p>In present circumstances, however, productive work and judicious saving are not enough. We need also dynamic enterprise to grasp the opportunities which lie before us, to develop our rich resources&#x2014;particularly our mineral resources&#x2014;and to open up new markets for our products. Some South Africans have already done this with great success, and others can do the same.</p>

<p>The Budget has not been easy to prepare, for it has been necessary to seek a delicate balance between growth and stability. Given reasonable immunity from externally-induced shocks, I believe that the budget proposals furnish a sound basis for stable growth.</p>

<p>We shall not necessarily see dramatic results in a matter of months, and we should not be disappointed if our three objectives cannot all be achieved immediately. Our economy is broadly based and resilient, however, and our policy measures can be adapted from time to time as conditions demand. With work, thrift and enterprise, the ultimate attainment of our goal is assured.</p>

<from><span class="col_4407-4408" refersTo="page_0666"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if brevity is the soul of wit, then this is a very funny Budget. I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister on a marathon performance. I think a detailed study of the Budget is going to show a lot of words, words, words. The hon. the Minister has become something of a Jack-in-the-box. He jumps from Revenue to Loan Account and from Loan Account to Revenue as if financial figures and financial policies mean nothing. Last year we had the problem of the Loan Account, so he robbed Revenue Account to take care of Loan Account. Now he has problems with his Revenue Account, so he is robbing the Loan Account to take care of the Revenue Account. What is worse, the hon. the Minister is taking an awful gamble, because between the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Transport, we have depleted all our reserves. Our Stabilization Account is practically nil; the hon. the Minister of Transport&#x2019;s Rates Equalization Fund is gone and all this is predicated on what hon. Ministers think is going to happen.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister, despite the picture he gave to the contrary, added his deficit to those of the hon. the Minister of Transport and the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. Sir, today we have completed a trilogy of the &#x201C;Year of the Deficits&#x201D;!&#x2014;the sad story of three unwise men. These deficits were not intended by these Ministers, Mr. Speaker. In fact, they planned for exactly the opposite; they planned for surpluses. The hon. the Minister of Transport budgeted for a small deficit, it is true, of R6,9 million, but he managed to achieve a deficit of R38,9 million. The hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs budgeted for a modest surplus of R2,5 million; he managed to achieve a deficit of R29,5 million. The hon. the Minister of Finance outshone his colleagues both in estimates and in deficits. He budgeted for a surplus on Revenue Account of R39,l million and he managed to achieve&#x2014;I have had to work this out very quickly because I did not have the figures&#x2014;a deficit of something of the order of R91,5 million. It is no good the hon. the Minister coming to us and saying: &#x201C;I have taken R72,5 million of my opening balance; I have a deficit of R14,7 million on the South-West Africa account and I will end up with a deficit of R4,3 million&#x201D;, and then working around with figures in the Loan Account to give an impression that he has a surplus. In fact, he has a deficit on Revenue Account of at least R90 million.</p>

<p>We are not surprised at these deficits; we have been expecting them, because they merely mirror the economic conditions that exist in South Africa today. They also mirror the deficit in the ability of this Cabinet to get a job done properly. The Cabinet did not realize that the economy was on a downward trend. We have warned them often enough but what effect did our warnings have&#x003F; The hon. the Minister of Finance called us every name possible, Jeremiahs, Prophets of Doom, exaggerated depressionists, and many others. Now the hon. the Minister has changed his tune. Now he has suddenly discovered that this is the most difficult period our economy has ever gone through; now he is a worried man. If he had had the interests of the country at heart and if he had had the remotest idea of what has been going on over the past few years, we would not have had the position we did have during the last year or two, and he would have got down to solving some of these problems that are always with us.</p>

<p>The Government has now decided on a wide range of changes in many areas. I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister. It is not often that I do so, but I want to do so today because at long last he has taken the advice which has been showered upon him year after year. [Interjections.]. Mr. Speaker, I have learnt that when my hon. friends opposite laugh, it is when they are most embarrassed; let any single member on that side of the House, when he enters this debate, show me one single thing the hon. the Minister has done this afternoon, which is beneficial, and which has not been offered from this side of the House, from industry, from commerce and from every knowledgeable economist in the country. [Interjections]. Now that is a challenge. We shall wait for the answer.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has reduced the increase in his overall capital expenditure on Revenue and Loan Account to 5,9 per cent. I use his figures and not my own calculations, which differ considerably. This figure compares with a figure last year of plus or minus 20 per cent. I find this very strange indeed. After all, we have in the past demanded year after year from the hon. the Minister that he should cut his expenditure. What has his reply been&#x003F; His reply, chorused by every other member of the Cabinet, was:&#x201C;It is impossible to do <span class="col_4409-4410" refersTo="page_0667"/>so; you tell us where we can cut expenditure.&#x201D;</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>You could never tell us.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>We told you it could be done; you said it could not be done. This year, however, the hon. the Minister has managed to cut the increase in his expenditure from 20 per cent to 5,9 per cent. This is very interesting; the hon. the Minister is starting to do his homework at last. He is beginning to see what can be done if you really give your attention to the job you are supposed to perform.</p>

<p>On Revenue Account he has cut his increase in expenditure to 9 per cent. We agree with this, Sir. For years we have been saying that he must cut his expenditure. On Loan Account he has performed a minor miracle in a major disaster. He has reduced his loan expenditure by 7 per cent&#x2014;the Minister makes it 8,6 per cent. We accept this, Sir, under the present circumstances, but we accept it for two reasons: The first reason is that it has always been our policy that Government expenditure must be cut. We accept it for a very important second reason because the hon. the Minister has learnt a very important lesson the hard way. If you look at the Loan Estimates, you will find that there are two major cutbacks which have resulted in the R60 million cut which the Minister has achieved. One is an amount of R23 million in respect of miscellaneous services&#x2014;I do not know what they are, because we do not have the details&#x2014;and the other is a cut in the grant-in-aid to the Bantu Trust Fund of R47 million. The hon. the Minister says this is partially adjusted by the Revenue Account but the adjustment, as he knows, is negligible. So we have had a drop from R86 million to R38 million this year, a drop of some 55 per cent, in respect of the grant to the South African Bantu Trust Account.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>No, there is plenty more. Sir, I can understand the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s agitation. [Interjections.] The hon. the Minister has at last learnt one of the economic lessons of life, that you can dream whatever dreams you like and you can base your policies on idealistic philosophies; but you cannot bend the economy to suit your own purposes. And so he has had to cut back sharply on his contributions to the homelands. Soon he is going to take the next step: He is going to ask for White capital in the homelands without this nonsense of an agency basis; I call it short-term investment. If this huge drop in the contribution to the South African Bantu Trust means anything, Sir&#x2014;it is 5 per cent of the entire Vote&#x2014;it should mean this to the hon. the Minister, that it is the industrial strength and the prosperity of our industries in the metropolitan areas on which the future policies of any Government have got to be based if they are to have any chance of success, and that our basic task is to see that we have expansion and prosperity and progress in the metropolitan areas as fast as we can, and that any Government that does not accept this principle, is doomed to failure.</p>

<p>Mr.Speaker, there is much in this Budget that requires examination. But I still do not believe that we have had the blueprint from the hon. the Minister that we hoped for, because once again we have had no clarity on the question of labour. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own words are so vague and embarrassing that they are really meaningless, and there is a much more important problem. Mr. Speaker: For whom does the hon. the Minister speak&#x003F; Does he speak for himself; does he speak for half his Cabinet, or does he speak for his whole Cabinet&#x003F; You will remember what happened last year, Sir. The hon. the Minister last year dealt with certain aspects of the Government&#x2019;s policy, particularly in the relation to the expansion of industries in the metropolitan areas, and he held out hope for the urban industries. But what happened&#x003F; The hon. the Minister of Social Welfare repudiated the hon. the Minister of Finance before his words were cold, and he was immediately joined by the hon. the Minister of Labour, and what he said in the Other Place a day or two ago does not give us any confidence in what the Minister of Finance said today. And, Sir, what did the hon. the Prime Minister do&#x003F; He confused the issue further by sitting on the fence and saying nothing. If we are going to see the new policies which the hon. the Minister enunciated today, really being put into effect, we have got to know that the Cabinet is speaking with one voice. I want to let the matter rest here.</p>

<heading>SPEAKER&#x2019;S STATEMENT ON NATURE OF SUPPLEMENTARY QUESTION PUT BY MR. J. W. E. WILEY, M.P.</heading>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>In connection with my statement yesterday on a supplementary question put to the Prime Minister by the hon. member for Simonstown, I have to inform the House that I have given further consideration to the matter. The question put by the hon. member was as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Speaker, arising out of the Minister&#x2019;s reply, may I ask the Prime Minister if any Minister, Deputy Minister or member is involved in this matter&#x003F;</block>

<p>&#x2020;Subsequently there were negotiations to give the member an opportunity to make a statement in the House. After he had been reprimanded by the Chair, the hon. member made the following brief statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Speaker, this afternoon I asked a supplementary question. With respect to you, I made no reflection on any member of this House.</block>

<p>I thereupon indicated that I did not accept those words and that I would take the matter further. In this connection I wish to refer to the 18th edition of May&#x2019;s Parliamentary Practice (page 324) where it is stated : &#x201C;It is not in order in a question to reflect on the character or conduct of those persons whose conduct may only be challenged on a substantive motion.&#x201D;</p>

<p>*I have afforded the hon. member the opportunity to reflect on the matter and to appreciate the possible consequences of his conduct. I now give him the opportunity&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) unconditionally to withdraw the insinuation against Ministers (including Ministers who are members of the Senate), Deputy Ministers and members, contained in the question, and to apologize; and</li>

<li>(b) to apologize to the Speaker and to this House for abusing his privileges as a member of this House.</li></ol>

I would now like to make it clear beyond all doubt that I made no reflection, nor did I intend making a reflection, on the honour or integrity of any member of either House nor of Parliament itself.

<heading>RAND WATER BOARD STATUTES (PRIVATE) ACT AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_water_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Firstly I just want to point out that although the expression &#x201C;private&#x201D; still appears in the title of this Act, it is really a public Act, and not a private Act, as a result of the amendments introduced in 1964. The Rand Water Board, however, desires that the expression &#x201C;private&#x201D; be retained for historical and sentimental reasons.</p>

<p>For the following reasons, in particular, it is essential that the Rand Water Board Statutes (Private) Act, 1950, be amended&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) The Board&#x2019;s power to finance capital works from current revenue is limited to the amounts it can annually allocate to the Betterment Fund. As the Act reads at present, such moneys can be invested in the Board&#x2019;s stock, but the interest on that cannot accrue to the Fund. Owing to the increasing demands being made on both local and overseas capital sources, the Board must also be able to pay in the interest and profits on such stock to the Betterment Fund and thereby to establish <span class="col_4415-4416" refersTo="page_0670"/>an accumulative capital development fund, as in the case of Escom.</li>

<li>(2) Although the Board and virtually all its consumers have switched over to the metric system, the Board is compelled by its Act to calculate its rates for water supplied per 1 000 gallons (or the metric equivalent) instead of per kilolitre or cubic meter, which is the convenient and accepted unit for that purpose in terms of the metric system.</li>

<li>(3) For administrative purposes it is necessary for the Board to transfer certain functions to committees and officials. As the Act reads at present there is some doubt about whether the Board is empowered to appoint an executive committee consisting of Board members and officials or even to delegate to such a committee the increment of minor costs, debt or liability.</li></ol>

<p>The concomitant draft Bill approved by the Water Board on 22nd October, 1971, contains proposed amendments to bring about the essential adjustments mentioned above. At the same time other amendments are also being proposed to correct obsolete provisions and to improve administrative procedures. The various amendments envisaging essential changes, and particulars in connection with the effect these will have, are briefly explained below.</p>

<p>Clause 2 amends section 7 to delete the provision that the State President may grant leave of absence to the chairman. This is an obsolete provision. Clauses 3 and 4 amend section 22 to enable the Board to appoint committees of Board members and/or officers and to delegate powers to such committees or to officers. For the performance of normal functions delegation is unavoidable and desirable. Hon. members will understand that with an enormous organization such as the Rand Water Board, the staff of which is continually expanding, as are its activities, it is absolutely essential that it be able to streamline its own machinery. Clause 6 amends section 25 to also empower the board to implement the provisions of the Expropriation Act, 1965. The Board is already empowered to expropriate property in terms of the &#x201C;Municipalities Powers of Expropriation Ordinance, 1903&#x201D; but owing to the long-windedness of the procedure prescribed in the Ordinance, it is regarded as desirable that in urgent cases the Board should be able to make use of the procedure in the Expropriation Act. Section 2 of the Expropriation Amendment Act, 1971 (Act No. 53 of 1971), does make provision for expropriation being carried out in the public interest on behalf of a juristic person who is himself not entitled to make use of the Expropriation Act, 1965. The provisions under the Expropriation Amendment Act, 1971, however, also require Parliamentary approval for expropriation and can therefore not apply in urgent cases.</p>

<p>Clause 7 amends section 32 to increase from R100 to R200 the maximum penalty the Board may impose for any breach of its by-laws. This is merely being done because the amount was fixed many years ago and to be able to impose a more realistic penalty for a serious breach. Clause 8 amends section 33 to increase the costs, debt or liability a committee or an official of the Board may incur under delegated powers. The section is otherwise being amended to place above all doubt that such powers can, in fact, be delegated by the Board. For the normal daily functions it is necessary that the power to incur smaller costs, etc., be delegated to the executive committee and senior officials. At the moment this is not the case, and this creates many administrative difficulties.</p>

<p>Clause 9 amends section 37 to provide that moneys annually allocated to the betterment fund must be invested in Rand Water Board stock and that the interest and profits must also be paid into the fund. In that way the Board will be able to establish a really accumulative fund that can be applied more efficiently to finance essential capital works, particularly in times when there is a scarcity of capital. In terms of section 35 the Board cannot allocate more than one-tenth of its revenue to the betterment fund annually. This restriction is not being changed.</p>

<p>Clause 10 amends section 43 to enable the Board to again sell its own stock which it purchases for its funds. This is in accordance with the custom in other investment undertakings, such as the municipalities and Escom. The marketability of the Board&#x2019;s stock will hereby also be increased.</p>

<p>Clause 11 actually refers only to the metric system I explained at the beginning of my speech.</p>

<p>Clause 12 amends section 48 merely to transfer, from the 15th to the 21st day of <span class="col_4417-4418" refersTo="page_0671"/>the month, the payment of accounts for water supplied to consumers. This section is therefore only being amended with a view to administrative convenience. It will facilitate the reading of meters and the furnishing of accounts.</p>

<p>Clause 13 amends section 49 to delete the requirement that the rates for water supplied must be calculated according to a specific quantitative water unit. The quantitative unit must in any case be determined with due regard to prevailing custom and the needs of consumers. At present the convenient and accepted unit is a kilolitre or cubic metre and not 1 000 gallons (or the metric equivalent) as the Act requires at present.</p>

<p>Clause 14 is being inserted to introduce an amendment in accordance with the Mining Rights Act and the Atomic Energy Act. It is a purely administrative amendment.</p>

<p>Clause 15 amends section 62 with respect to the raising of loan moneys by ways other than the issuing of stock, for example by overseas loans as well. In the case of stock the Act expressly prescribes what steps can be taken against the Board where it neglects to pay interest on it or neglects to pay back the principal. The amendments are only intended to state above all doubt that the same provisions are also applicable where the Board neglects to make such payments and repayments in respect of other loans. After study of the strict requirements of overseas banking institutions, this amendment is essential.</p>

<p>Clause 16 amends section 64 to increase the amount that may be borrowed from a bank by way of overdraft, without the sanction of the State President, from R100 000 to R5 million. Authorization for an overdraft amount of up to R5 million has already been granted by the State President, but as the Act reads at present it is still necessary from time to time to obtain the State President&#x2019;s sanction for the payment of increased interest rates on all overdrafts above R100 000 as the official bank rate, and therefore also the commercial bank rate, is increased. The amendment merely envisages simplified administration.</p>

<p>Clause 17&#x2019;s purpose is merely to make provision for the metric system.</p>

<p>Clause 18 amends section 76 and repeals the Fifth Schedule to provide that the instrument of transfer shall be a document separate from the stock certificate and that transfer cannot take place on the authority of an endorsement of a stock certificate. This is in accordance with the present requirements of the Stock Exchange. This is consequently also an administrative requirement.</p>

<p>Clause 21 amends section 78 to extend the period during which the Board&#x2019;s nominal register and stock transfer registers may be closed from 15 to 30 days. This will facilitate administrative procedures and is in accordance with the present-day custom of the Stock Exchange.</p>

<p>Clause 22 again merely brings to issue the metric system. In various clauses adjustments are being made with respect to the metric system.</p>

<p>Clause 23 amends section 97 to express in decimal currency the minimum amount for which a bill may be issued and to empower the Board to issue bills to the bearer. The Board is already empowered to issue certificates in respect of loans to the bearer and this amendment is only intended to align bill issues accordingly. It is not envisaged that many investors will require such bills, but it will enable the Board to provide for the needs of such investors.</p>

<p>Clauses 28 and 32 amend sections 128 and 138 respectively to increase, from R100 to R400, the maximum penalty a court may impose for the illegal use or appropriation of water the Board is entitled to or for malicious damage to or interference with the Board&#x2019;s works. The amendment is being proposed to align the amount more specifically with present monetary value and the period of imprisonment which is determined.</p>

<p>The remaining clauses contain no essential amendments, except that they express imperial units in metric unit terms and sterling currency in decimal currency terms and replace references to repealed legislation by references to new applicable legislation.</p>

<p>As hon. members can see, this legislation is actually an overhauling of the Statutes of the Rand Water Board, which were established by the Rand Water Board itself and have been applicable throughout the years. Today I am doing this on my own behalf because I am the Minister responsible for it, but I also have the privilege today of proposing this on behalf of the Rand Water Board.</p>

<p>I wonder if it is possible for only one member at a time to make a speech&#x003F; In that case I would like to be the one to make this speech.</p>

<p>The hon. Minister of Water Affairs has given a brief r&#x00E9;sum&#x00E9; of the Bill before us, a Bill consisting of some 37 clauses. I do not propose to detain the House long at this Second Reading. Some of the clauses of this Bill can perhaps be discussed in a little bit more detail and more appropriately in the Committee Stage. In dealing with this Bill I want to say something in general. The hon. Minister said just now that this is a Bill dealing with a particular institution, viz., the Rand Water Board. The Rand Water Board and many of its instruments are being brought up to date in its work and in its functioning by means of this Bill which is before us. That is perfectly true and I may say in general that when one looks at the manner in which it performs its functions, the services which it renders, the extraordinary critical position in which it is placed in regard to the development of the Witwatersrand, and the way in which it has discharged its responsibilities and its duties, it can have a Bill before this House which will be viewed and which will be regarded with a great deal of sympathy. It will certainly be regarded with a great deal of sympathy by this side of the House. What is demanded of an institution placed as this one is, as I have said, at the centre of the development of the Witwatersrand&#x003F; We expect that it shall be capable of looking ahead, capable of providing an adequate water supply, that it shall be supplied at a reasonable cost, that its financial affairs should be soberly and judiciously administered and that in so far as its powers are concerned it shall not exercise those powers capriciously or in an unwise manner which will be to the detriment of other people; it may be the little man who comes in conflict with a vast organization which has very strong financial resources. In all those respects we can say of the Rand Water Board that it discharges its duties very well indeed. In this Bill its powers have been extended a little bit, but they have not been extended any further than we have been able to go with the general law in regard to water affairs; if anything it has come along now a little later than some of the provisions that we have put into amending ordinances for our own Water Act. As regards financial measures, I may say to the hon. the Minister that I asked one of our financial people, in whose judgment I repose the greatest confidence, to have a look at the financial provisions as set out in this Bill. He could find no fault with them whatsoever. He was perfectly satisfied. As a man who knows little about finance and is never the possessor of any himself, may I say that I had to rely upon the opinion of another hon. member to advise me in regard to the financial provisions of this particular Bill.</p>

<p>As I have said, there are certain powers that are being taken. One point I do want to dwell on&#x2014;I am going to be very brief &#x2014;is the question of the further powers in regard to pollution. There is special provision made in clause 35 for the penalty for those who may be guilty of pollution to be raised from &#x00A3;20 to R400. I draw particular attention to that for two reasons. The first is that throughout the Bill provision is being made for metric figures to be used for distances and for the present system of rands and cents instead of the old pounds, shillings and pennies. The change-over has been made right throughout. In this particular clause, had it been merely a change from pounds to rand, it would have been a matter of R40, but, Sir, the penalty is R400 for pollution in terms of the conditions which are set down here. We on this side of the House accept that. We say that, if anything, they may still be erring on the lenient side towards people who may be guilty of polluting the water supplies which are dealt with by the Rand Water Board.</p>

<p>Let me finish on this note: I am informed that the finances are perhaps not exactly orthodox. However, where provisions have been made&#x2014;we will come to it in the Committee Stage&#x2014;so that the board can, for instance invest moneys in its own stock, we are satisfied that that will only be done in the case where the stock concerned was absolutely reliable at its face value, since there could be no question or shadow of doubt as to the value of that stock. That is rather an unusual provision in a Bill of this kind, but we are also willing to accept it without any question. Sir, from this side of the House I give this Bill my blessing and I hope that the Rand Water Board will find that in this measure it has an instrument which is going to assist it in its administration <span class="col_4421-4422" refersTo="page_0673"/>and strengthen it in the provision of pure water supplies for the Witwatersrand.</p>

<p>Clause 35 :</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to move amendments to the Bill or to raise the kind of objection which could embarrass the Minister in any way when dealing with this measure. I hope the Minister will appreciate that if in practice hereafter it is found that there are circumstances under modern industrial conditions and modern urban development which make the provisions of this section inadequate for the purpose of protecting the water supplies of the Rand Water Board, and he has to come back to Parliament with an amending Bill, we shall support him. We are not going to stand in the way when it comes to bringing up to date a measure which deals with an important matter of this kind. We shall not obstruct him if he has to amend this legislation to make it possible for the Rand Water Board to deal with new conditions which may arise as the result of urbanization and industrialization.</p>

<p>There is a clause in this Bill which we have already passed&#x2014;I was going to deal with it, although it is not really material&#x2014; dealing with the question of source material. The hon. the Minister knows about this. In terms of that clause the Commissioner of Mines has to give the Rand Water Board a statement every year, showing all the mines which are being mined in the area of supply. Amongst others, he has to indicate mines which are producing source material, namely material which can be used in the production of uranium or other substances related to it. This particular clause contains a limit in respect of the gathering ground for water for the supply of the Rand Water Board. It was five miles and it is now eight kilometres. I want to repeat that in practice that may be found to be inadequate, especially in the light of some of the new materials being used as the result of increasing urbanization and industrial development. Whether you call the distance five miles or eight kilometres, it is beside the point; it is the same distance. I am afraid I do not easily change miles into kilometres and kilometres back into miles, but I understand that eight kilometres is exactly the same distance as five miles. What I am concerned about is that if a person allows to collect or to be deposited in this area materials of such a character that they can pollute the water supply of the Rand Water Board in any way, he is exempted from the penal provisions of this clause if it takes place five miles away or further. I say therefore that the distance of five miles may be found to be inadequate. It is not always a matter of distance; it can be a matter of drainage. You can have a natural drainage system extending for miles and miles. All of us who are farmers know that. Material that is discharged nine or ten miles away can come down a natural water course during floods, and this is one of the things I particularly want to mention. During the past year we have had terrific downpours; there has been very heavy precipitation indeed in some areas; the Witwatersrand has had its share; and in such circumstances a distance of five miles from a source of the water for the Rand Water Board can be quite inadequate. I do not want to move an amendment in this regard. I simply put this point forward, and if I labour it, it is because the Rand Water Board cannot afford to have its water supplies polluted.</p>

<p>Do you know, Sir, that with all our modem legislation and all the vast sums we are spending on dams and that sort of thing, we have never yet found a simple and easy way of saving water at the consumer end. All we have been able to do is to use the time-honoured system of a water meter. We have, however, found no way of saving water. If a substantial part of the water supply on the Rand is polluted for any reason, particularly by one of these new pollutants resulting from increased industrialization, such as compound chemical elements, then the prodigal use of water which is indulged in so often at present by the public will be shown up at its worst. I labour the point, Sir, but I do so deliberately, because this can be an Achilles heel in the water supplies of the <span class="col_4423-4424" refersTo="page_0674"/>Rand Water Board. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will not hesitate to come back to the House if necessary so that we can give further consideration and possibly wider legislative powers to the Board to deal with any kind of pollution which may arise from any cause whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not intend to detain the Committee long. As you know, Sir, Parliament is usually associated in the public mind with debating battles, fiery speeches and controversial issues, but every so often it does happen that a minor Bill, such as this one before us, is introduced, and I sometimes feel that it is on such an occasion that one sees Parliament at its best. In this particular case, what could have amounted to an injustice arose in connection with rent paid by certain tenants in a certain block of flats, tenants who were good citizens, who had a good life in the service of their country behind them, many of them pensioners, who were going to suffer what could have been an injustice under the existing law. It so happens that this particular block of flats and these tenants are in my constituency. They themselves and I approached the hon. the Minister in this connection, and I think here we have a sign of what Parliament really can do when it comes to protecting the individual, the humblest individual in the country, against a possible injustice. In this particular case I must say that I was received by the hon. the Minister in a most friendly and cooperative way. He realized, too, that something had been done which was not the fault of the law-makers; it was one of the inevitable consequences which sometimes flow from the passing of legislation. The hon. the Minister decided that he would put the matter right, and it is a great privilege for me on this occasion&#x2014;it is one which may not arise many times&#x2014;to thank the hon. the Minister very much indeed for what he has done in this particular case to remove an injustice.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, yesterday when this debate was adjourned, we had just had an indication from the hon.</p>

<p>the Minister that he was prepared to convert the committee which advised him on the planning of Church Square, Pretoria, into a statutory body. He suggested that it should be a statutory body similar to that which controls the development of the Foreshore in Cape Town. I tried to point out to the hon. the Minister last night that there was a difference between the development of the Foreshore in Cape Town and what is planned by this Bill. I particularly want to draw his attention to section 5 of the Seashore Act, No. 21 of 1935, subsection (2) of which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister may cause any land in the sea or on the seashore to be reclaimed, and such reclaimed land shall be State-owned land.</block>

<p>Sir, here is the difference between the Foreshore here in Cape Town and Church Square in Pretoria. I am sorry to have to say to the hon. the Minister that we appreciate his gesture, but that we cannot accept it, because of this very difference; here you have virgin land reclaimed from the sea which vests in the Minister of Lands or the Minister of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure today, and there is a board for the development of that virgin land. But in this Bill we have a completely different principle altogether. The principle here is that the control of the development of that area is being taken away from the Pretoria City Council and placed wholly in the hands of this hon. Minister.</p>

<p>Sir, I wonder if that hon. member has read the Bill, because this is exactly what the Bill is all about, and I am sure that his own Minister will agree with me when I say that, so I cannot see how the hon. member can make that statement. As I say, Sir, the principle is different because control is being removed from the local authority, in this case the Pretoria City Council; it is not a question here of control over virgin land. Sir, the hon. the Minister said yesterday by way of interjection that the plan had been approved by the Pretoria City Council. I accept this; I believe that the plan has been accepted, but has the principle of this Bill been accepted by the Pretoria City Council&#x003F; This is the important matter.

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, with respect to the hon. member for Rissik, why do I say that&#x003F; Because that is exactly what is happening here. Let me refer the hon. the Minister to clause 2 (1), which says that with effect from the date on which this law comes into operation no alteration may be effected to the planning of Church Square and no building or other structure on any site or portion of a site detailed in Schedule B, which comprises six city blocks of Pretoria, may be erected without the prior written approval of the Minister. Then we come to subsection (2), which says that the Minister may, in his discretion, withhold or grant consent, and then we go on to the point which has been raised by my hon. friend the hon. member for Green Point, that the Minister must consult the City Council. We accept that he must consult the Pretoria City Council, but the Minister specifically says in the Bill that he does not have to take any notice whatsoever of what they say. He is not compelled to accept or even to consider their recommendations. Now the hon. member for Rissik asks why I say that the control is being taken away. The control is being taken away, and I believe that there is an even more iniquitous principle involved here. I am sure the hon. member for Rissik, who has had a legal training, understands what is meant by a servitude, particularly when it is granted in perpetuity to the public. Here we have in clause 5 that &#x201C;all servitudes registered under Crown grant are hereby cancelled&#x201D;. How can the hon. member say that this is not interfering with the Pretoria City Council&#x003F; What are these servitudes&#x003F; These servitudes are in favour of the public and the hon. the Minister is now taking those rights away from the public. In terms of these servitudes certain rights were given to the public. The one servitude was that a driveway 79 feet wide was to be maintained around the square for public use. Now the Minister wishes to cancel this servitude. Why&#x003F; He has not told us why. Is he prepared to give the public something else in compensation for it&#x003F; What is he going to do&#x003F; As we read the Bill, he is taking this away from the public. The other servitude which is registered against Church Square is that no buildings or statues or memorials or improvements shall be erected without the approval of the State President. But here we have a Bill before us today to cancel that servitude and to allow this Minister at his sole discretion to decide what shall be done. No longer is this vested in the State President as the curator and as the symbol, the person who represents the public of South Africa and not just the public of Pretoria. The important thing is that if we accept this principle now, not a single portion of South Africa will be inviolate. This Minister will then be able to extend his rights; he will be able to go into any city and town in the country and take over the control of their central portions and say to the people and to the city councils concerned that they will no longer have any say; that he will listen to what they have to say but that he will take no notice whatsoever of what they say. Sir, I believe this is a further manifestation of the megalomania of this Government. They cannot help but stick their sticky fingers into everything which is going on in this country. They sit there like a great big black spider with eight or more legs sticking out and a finger in everything that is going on. Nothing is sacred. Nothing can be left to any local authority or to the people; everything has to be controlled by Pretoria, by the Minister concerned. Whether this is empire building by the Ministers, I do not know. There is no need for me to go any further here except to ask the Minister what he is doing about the rights of the individual landowners.</p>

Property owners there pay almost one-third of the total rates paid by the people of Pretoria. This is not just peanuts; we are dealing with the commercial centre of a city which has now been planned. The Minister says he has got the plan and he is accepting it. But it has been planned in isolation.

<p>Here we have now had the spectacle of the hon. member and the hon. member for Green Point coming along and speaking as if they were speaking on behalf of the Pretoria City Council. Why should I listen to their objections now&#x003F; The Pretoria City Council was represented on the committee by which the Bill was drafted. The town clerk of Pretoria was a member of the committee by which this Bill was drafted. This Bill was submitted to the Pretoria City Council and the City Council only asked for one change to be made, and that was for the period in which they can give their opinions to he extended from 60 to 90 days, and that was granted. Am I now to go and consult every voter&#x003F; What nonsense. There is not a single member of Parliament from Pretoria who objects; there is not a single member of the Pretoria City Council who objects. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District is quite wrong in saying that the chairman of the management committee has issued a statement objecting to the Bill. That is not so. What actually happened here&#x003F; What happened was that the Post Office and the Provincial Administration wanted to erect two large tower blocks on Church Square. Objections were then raised against that plan by the Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns, by the Simon van der Stel Foundation, by the Genootskap van Ou Pretoriane and by certain branches of the Rapportryers. The Cabinet took cognizance of these and said that there was cause for re-investigation. The Cabinet then appointed a committee consisting of many distinguished people, under the chairmanship of Mr. Poole of the Department of Public Works. On that committee served Mr. Justice Murray, Mr. Rhoode, the town clerk of Pretoria, Mr. Metnitz, the chief architect of Public Works, and quite a few other architects, representatives of the Province, representatives of the city council and representatives of all who have to do with the development there, and they drew up a new plan. They heard evidence and that new plan was published and submitted to the city council and it was also submitted to all interested parties. A model was made of the new plan and everyone who had objected was asked to come and look at it and to give his opinion, and every one of those bodies agreed with it.</p>

<p>For the simple reason that the people who drew up that plan, which has now been approved by all the parties, are the people who are now going to control Church Square. You have to put the powers in someone&#x2019;s hands in the final instance, and those powers are being placed in the hands of the Minister. But it is that organization, that committee, which will really be in control. It is not an unusual thing for the Minister to be granted such control over local authorities. I have the same control over District Six. There is a government committee which acts in an advisory capacity, but I have the final say. The city council cannot have the final say in this matter. The Administrator now has the final say. The only difference is that the Minister will have the final say in this case, because this committee, under the chairmanship of the Deputy Secretary for Public Works, is the committee which controls the entire Church Square. This matter is as simple as that. The city council has no objection. <span class="col_4431-4432" refersTo="page_0678"/> No one has objections, except for these two members and the United Party. They had better decide for themselves what they are objecting to. They do not even know what it is all about.

<heading>EDUCATIONAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_national_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The implementation of the Educational Services Act, 1967 (Act No. 41 of 1967), has gradually brought to light that certain amendments are essential with a view to realizing the original objectives of the legislation. I should like to sketch in greater detail the aspects affected by the Bill.</p>

<p>The first amendment applies to students enrolling at the correspondence course division of the autonomous Witwatersrand College for Advanced Technical Education. These students must comply with specific obligations in respect of the submission of assignments, progress, zeal, conduct and <span class="col_4433-4434" refersTo="page_0679"/>other regulations issued by the college. It has also for years been the custom that a candidate receives exemption or recognition for a subject on the grounds of successfully having completed a corresponding or similar subject with another recognized examining body.</p>

<p>According to legal opinion obtained, the Act grants the Minister no authority, in respect of a national examination which is conducted, to refuse the enrolment of a candidate who has failed to submit the assignments and comply with other regulations of the college, or to grant a candidate exemption in respect of a course successfully completed with another examining body. It is, however, regarded as essential that provision be made to prohibit a candidate, who has not completed the assignments and complied with other prescribed requirements, from writing an examination. The necessary amendment of section 13 by clause 1 (a) and (b) of the Bill is therefore being proposed to invest the Minister with the required authority in the above connection.</p>

<p>With reference to clause 2, Mr. Speaker, I want to mention that in the regulations, as I shall be explaining in the discussion of clause 4, provision will now be made for someone, appointed in terms of this Act, to be compelled to become a member of a medical aid fund, It is consequently necessary to provide in section 28 that such a person, who contravenes a regulation of such a fund&#x2019;s constitution or neglects to comply with such a rule, shall be guilty of misconduct and that action can be taken against him. There is a similar provision in the Public Service Act, 1957, from which the wording in clause 2 has also been derived.</p>

<p>As far as clause 3 of the Bill is concerned, I want to mention that the present Act provides that the establishments of schools, i.e. the number of posts at schools, be determined as follows: In terms of section 16 (1) of the Act, at a State school the Minister determines the establishment according to a basis recommended by the Public Service Commission, and in terms of section 18 (1) (a) the Minister determines the establishment at a State-subsidized school.</p>

<p>The &#x201C;basis&#x201D; mentioned in the Act, and according to which the establishment of posts takes place, already exists. After an inquiry by a committee of experts, this was recommended by the Public Service Commission in respect of State schools and approved by the Minister.</p>

<p>In the case of State-subsidized schools the proposals are considered and approved by the Minister, if he agrees with them.</p>

<p>If sound reasons are given as to why there must be a deviation from the said basis as a result of changed circumstances, the same procedure, as sketched above, is followed.</p>

<p>Since the basis for the determination of posts is only approved after thorough investigation and careful consideration by the Minister, any subsequent action, i.e. the establishment of new posts, justified according to the approved basis, as well as the abolition of redundant posts, may with the utmost confidence be entrusted to the Secretary of the Department and other senior officers.</p>

<p>Consequently it is being proposed that the Act makes provision for the delegation of the powers contained in section 16 (1) and 18 (1) (a). The circumstances and the manner in which this takes place eliminates the possibility of irregularities as long as the establishment is determined according to a basis, and it has always been the intention with the transfer of the Minister&#x2019;s authority to determine an establishment. However, it has now been determined that his authority to determine the establishment at State-subsidized schools in terms of section 18 (1) (a), cannot be transferred subject to a basis unless that paragraph is amended to provide for the Minister&#x2019;s determining the establishment at a subsidized school according to a basis he determines. It is therefore also my intention to move such an amendment when the House considers the Bill in committee.</p>

<p>In the regulations made in terms of the Act it is provided that membership of the Civil Servants Medical Benefit Association is compulsory for officers and employees at State schools. When consideration was given to prescribing similar provisions in respect of officers and employees in the service of subsidized schools the legal advisers indicated that the Act does not grant the Minister the authority to issue regulations in connection with that matter in respect of someone employed at a subsidized school. In those circumstances it is regarded as necessary that section 43 (1) be amended by clause 4 so that the Minister will, in fact, obtain the authority to issue the necessary regulations.</p>

<p><span class="col_4435-4436" refersTo="page_0680"/>That, Mr. Speaker, is in short the content and purport of this measure.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the contents of this Bill are largely administrative. There is nothing contentious about it whatsoever.</p>

<p>As far as clause 1 (a) is concerned, we have no objection. I understand it to mean, as the hon. the Minister has said, that some degree of flexibility will now exist in regard to courses that may have been successfully completed by students or pupils in one institution; they may now legally be given credit for these courses by another educational institution under the Act. In fact, we welcome this proposal since it makes for greater flexibility. If my information is correct, really all that this clause is doing is making what has been done in the past retrospectively legal. This is the position as far as I can gather from the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech.</p>

<p>Clause 1 (b) deals with the conditions of enrolment and we are quite able to understand and to accept the motives behind it. It is true that the Minister already has the power to prescribe the academic conditions under which such institutions shall be run. We just have one query in regard to this clause. Does it in any way refer to ordinary schools&#x003F; Is there any possibility, for instance, that this Bill could be applied to an ordinary school&#x003F; If that were the case, we can see various complications arising therefrom. The question of the Minister&#x2019;s staff controlling education standards as such we find entirely reasonable, but the use of the word &#x201C;circumstances&#x201D; which the Minister may prescribe raises some doubt in my mind. Other than the maintenance of academic standards, what circumstances does the Minister have in mind&#x003F;</p>

<p>We have no objection in regard to clause 2, which deals mainly with penalties for misconduct. A new penalty is being added to the effect that teachers belonging to prescribed medical aid schemes have to abide by the regulations governing such schemes or else become subject to disciplinary action. I want to refer to clause 4, which amends section 43 (1) (jA) of the original Act, which also refers to medical aid schemes. In regard to this new proviso, I would like to ask the hon. the Minister whether there should not be an option left open for teachers under certain circumstances. Can we be quite sure that this provision is not mandatory&#x003F; I would like to ask the Minister what, for instance, will be the position of women teachers, where their husbands are already covered by a medical aid fund or whose husbands are already members of the Civil Service Medical Association&#x003F; This might create the problem that these couples may be obliged to pay twice, or does the word &#x201C;may&#x201D; in this clause leave the situation open&#x003F; I would like clarification on that point.</p>

<p>With regard to clause 3, we want to know why section 16 (1) and section 18 (1) (a) have been left out in the first place. It seems a little odd. As things stand, in terms of section 42 of the Act the governing body of a subsidized private school has the right to decide upon the appointment of the staff and the ratio of pupils to staff. With this proposed amendment and the Minister&#x2019;s delegating his powers to the Secretary or any person in the employment of the department or a governing body, does the Minister not anticipate that there might just be grounds for conflict in this regard&#x003F; I refer to possible conflict between a governing body of a private school, for instance, and the representatives of the Minister&#x2019;s department. Apart from this one query in regard to clause 3, we have no objection to it at all.</p>

<p>Subject to clarification by the Minister of the few points I have raised, we support the Second Reading of this Bill.</p>

<heading>AGE OF MAJORITY BILL</heading>

<p>(Second Reading)</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_4437-4438" refersTo="page_0681"/>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the Bill now before the House contains two principles. The first principle is in fact a re-affirmation of the existing legal position in this country regarding minors, namely that minors attain the age of majority when they reach the age of 21 years. It is at the age of 21 years that minors attain, amongst other things, full contractual capacity, the right to marry without parental option or consent. It is at this age that they are no longer subject to parental control and at which they are regarded by law as of full legal capacity.</p>

<p>In clause 1 of the Bill it is provided that all persons, males and females, attain the age of majority when they attain the age of 21 years. This is the position that obtained in the former colonies and republics, in each of which it was specifically enacted that the age of 21 years shall be the age of majority. In clause 9 of the Bill the repeal of these enactments is proposed. In passing I wish to mention that in some quarters it has been suggested that the age of majority should be the age of 18 years. Amongst people who have propagated this from time to time are prominent persons. I want to add, however, that this cannot be supported. The age of 21 years is the traditional age of majority and it has so been fixed by law in the Cape more than a century ago. The age of 21 years is also the age of majority in most Western countries. I doubt whether the majority of the people in South Africa would agree to the proposal that the age of majority should be lowered to the age of 18 years. How many parents would agree to this&#x003F;</p>

<p>*Mr. Speaker, the second principle embodied in this Bill is an interesting one, i.e. that persons who are 18 years and older may upon application be declared to be majors by the court. In order to elucidate this principle in the Bill, one may trace the legal history of <i>venia aetatis.</i> However, I am not going to do so. If hon. members want me to do so, I shall use the Committee Stage for that purpose.</p>

<p>Now, what is the legal position in South Africa&#x003F; The position in South Africa is that it was only in the province of the Orange Free State that the advancement of the age of majority was regulated by legislation passed by the former Republic of the Orange Free State. In terms of this legislation the applicant, who shall not be under the age of 18 years, shall lodge a petition with the State President, who shall then refer the petition to the Provincial Division of the Supreme Court in Bloemfontein for investigation and recommendation. Subsequent to that the State President shall grant or refuse the petition in accordance with the recommendation made by the court, i.e. the State President has no discretion in the matter. Since 1910 only 21 such petitions have been lodged and approved.</p>

<p>In the other three provinces the advancement of the age of majority is controlled by common law, in terms of which the power to grant or refuse any advancement of the age of majority is vested in the State President without the intervention of the courts. In this case, therefore, the State President does have a discretion.</p>

<p>Although a few of the older authorities were of the opinion that the power to grant an advancement of the age of majority was vested in the courts as well as the authorities, and that an applicant could turn to either of them, the majority of the authorities, past as well as present, are agreed that this power is vested in the Head of State.</p>

<p>I am not going to explain to you today, Sir, what the history in South Africa is in this regard. I have here an explanation of the position, but to save time, I am going to omit it. However, I am willing to deal with it at the Committee Stage if hon. members would like to hear it.</p>

<p>The two principles embodied in this Bill are (a) to regulate the advancement of the age of majority by way of legislation in all four provinces and South-West Africa, and (b) to entrust to the Supreme Court the power to authorize any advancement of the age of majority, and so to remove any existing doubts as to the body or person in whom this power is vested.</p>

<p>I should like to elucidate as follows the underlying reasons for this power being entrusted to the Supreme Court and not to the State President.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court is the supreme guardian of all minors, and in this capacity it sees to it that the interests of any minor are protected. The Supreme Court has the power to grant consent to marriage to a minor. In the light of the circumstances prevailing at present, the current procedure, as defined in the legislation of the former Republic of the Orange Free State, is a <span class="col_4439-4440" refersTo="page_0682"/>cumbrous one and imposes unnecessary work on officials. In any case, it does make provision for investigation by the Supreme Court. On close examination one finds that in terms of the Free State legislation the granting or refusal of an advancement of the age of majority is vested in the court, since the State President has to accept the recommendation made by the court; the State President does not have a discretion in the matter. It is not possible to eliminate the Supreme Court when the granting of an advancement of the age of majority is considered, since it is the proper authority for handling the necessary investigation. After all, the Supreme Court is the supreme guardian of all minors. Finally, this legislation will remove any doubts as to the body or person in whom the power to grant an advancement of the age of majority is vested&#x2014;the Head of State or the courts.</p>

<p>I want to make a few more observations on the procedure, but under the circumstances&#x2014;the shortage of time&#x2014;I am not going to do so now. However, I shall gladly do so at the Committee Stage if hon. members want to put questions in that regard.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the official Opposition will support the measure introduced by the hon. the Minister. I will similarly be brief in my remarks. I believe it is wise that we should have uniform legislation to replace the legislation enacted in the various colonies and the former Republics. It is interesting to note from the schedule that it is as long ago as 1829 that legislation was introduced in the Cape Colony specifying the age of majority as 71. We also believe and accept that this Bill is an understandable <i>sequitur</i> to the granting of the vote to eighteen-year-olds. We believe that this Bill goes in a direction which is appropriate for the 1970s and that we need no longer have ourselves hinged to legislation of over a century ago.</p>

<p>There are one or two matters that I want to mention in passing. I hope the hon. the Minister will be good enough to take them into consideration. We can deal with them more fully in the Committee Stage. Clause 7 of the Bill states that a person to whom a court order has been granted declaring him to be a major shall be deemed to have attained the age of majority for all purposes. We have some questions as to what effect this would have on, for instance, trusts or testamentary dispositions executed prior to the granting of the order and in which the testator or the trustee did not take the precaution of mentioning the age of 21, but merely said that certain inheritances would accrue at the age of majority. I think myself that the clause, as it is drawn, will not have retrospective effect, but I would like the hon. the Minister to have a look at this and perhaps we can then discuss it further in the Committee Stage. There is also the question of procedure, which the Minister has not touched upon and which I will also leave over for discussion at a later stage. Then, Sir, there is one other matter which comes to mind in looking at this legislation, and that is that it opens the way to income tax benefits for certain classes of persons. You will know, Sir, that at present the income of a minor is added to the income of the parent for the purpose of assessing income tax, and this sometimes considerably affects the rate of taxation payable by the parent. With a minor now being declared to be a major at the age of 18, it is possible for a man in business with two sons of 18 and 19 to introduce them into his business as directors and, by way of directors&#x2019; fees, to divide his income into three portions. His income will therefore be taxable in the hands of three persons at a much lower rate of aggregate taxation. This is one of the consequences that will flow from the passing of this Bill. There are other consequences as well that we can discuss further in the Committee Stage. We will support the Second Reading.</p>

<p>I move this in order that we may discuss the investigation by a senior officer of the <span class="col_4441-4442" refersTo="page_0683"/>South African Police of a statement about the Agliotti case alleged to have been made by Lt.-Col. D. A. Bester, Chief Deputy Commissioner of Police. Sir, this is a matter of grave importance to the country and I think also to the Police Force. It raises the question of the operation of the Police Force and whether any directions&#x2014;and, if so, what sort of directions&#x2014; are given to senior police officers entrusted with these important matters in the carrying out of their duty. Without a good explanation from the hon. the Minister&#x2014; and this is what we are hoping to get&#x2014; we have the impression that when the Police investigate matters which might be embarrassing to the Government, strange things seem to happen. Sir, the background of these investigations are well known to all of us. There was the Agliotti scandal, the mere mention of which &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I beg your pardon, Sir. Let me refer then to the words which appear in the motion&#x2014;the Agliotti case, the mere mention of which gives people the twitters, amounting almost to St. Vitus&#x2019; dance. This matter was the subject of a report laid on the Table of this House. Then there was a debate on the matter. The Police had been investigating this matter long before that report was laid on the Table of the House. Indeed, it would seem that they investigated this matter even before the commission of inquiry was set up. Then, Sir, we had an answer from the hon. the Minister of Police on 3rd March, to the effect that the investigations into the Agliotti case were not expected to be completed until June of this year, with no real explanation to this House or to the country as to how it was that these investigations could have taken so long and why they would take so long. Thereafter, we had the most extraordinary turn of events concerning this investigation, which happened in the offices of the <i>Natal Mercury</i> in Durban, a morning newspaper. What happened was that a person who was later identified but was not then immediately known and would not identify himself, went to the <i>Mercury</i> offices accompanied by another person and asked to see the crime reporter, one Mr. Gerrie Strauss. They wanted to question him. Sir, I think it is important to appreciate just what happened. Apparently a Brig. Prinsloo then talked to Mr. Strauss. The conversation went like this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Prinsloo: Who did you telephone and who did you speak to after you left us in the foyer&#x003F;</block>

<block name="quote">Strauss: I tried to get hold of my attorney.</block>

<block name="quote">Prinsloo : What did you want an attorney for&#x003F;</block>

<block name="quote">Strauss : I wanted to establish my legal rights.</block>

<block name="quote">Prinsloo : Why are you worried about your legal rights&#x003F; You haven&#x2019;t heard half of what I have to say yet &#x2026;</block>

<block name="quote">Strauss : I want to know my legal rights because people are put away for 180 days without trial.</block>

<block name="quote">Prinsloo : Do you think that this is what is going to happen to you&#x003F;</block>

<block name="quote">Strauss : I don&#x2019;t know what is going to happen to me. I am afraid, that&#x2019;s all &#x2026;</block>

<block name="quote">Prinsloo : There is nothing to be afraid of. All I want is a statement from you on what Gen. Bester told you about the Agliotti case.</block>

<block name="quote">Strauss : Gen. Bester has never at any time discussed the Agliotti case with me. The last time I saw him there were five other people present at the dinner at a friend&#x2019;s beach cottage, and at no time was I alone with Gen. Bester the whole evening. Nor was the case mentioned in my presence.</block>

<block name="quote">Prinsloo: Have you ever spoken to anyone about Gen. Bester giving you information about the Agliotti case&#x003F;</block>

<block name="quote">Strauss : No, I told you I know nothing about this.</block>

<block name="quote">Prinsloo: But we have evidence that you did say Gen. Bester gave you information about the case.</block>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_4443-4444" refersTo="page_0684"/>Strauss: What is your evidence&#x003F; Who is my accuser&#x003F;</block>

<block name="quote">Prinsloo : Look, all I am asking is for you to make a sworn statement in writing of what you have told me.</block>

<p>A little later on Strauss said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You say you have evidence of what you are alleging. Are you prepared to disclose the name of your informer&#x003F;</block>

<block name="quote">Prinsloo : No, I am not.</block>

<block name="quote">Strauss : I elect not to make a sworn, written statement.</block>

<p>After this Mr. Gerrie Strauss telephoned Gen. Bester in Pretoria, and I quote his version of the events, from the <i>Mercury</i> of last Friday&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the early afternoon I was able to contact Gen. Bester by telephone at Police headquarters in Pretoria and told him that two detectives, one named Prinsloo from Pretoria, had questioned me about an alleged interview I was supposed to have had with him, the General, in regard to the Agliotti affair. From a description of the man, Gen. Bester concluded that &#x201C;I am being investigated by a brigadier on my own staff&#x201D;. He was sure the man was Brig. Gert Prinsloo. Gen. Bester was furious. He thanked me for the information and said I would hear from him again.</block>

<p>Sir, it would appear from that that this was the first time the general knew about his investigation, and he was furious. Sir, surely this is not the way you treat your Deputy Commissioner. Because he is one of the longest serving policemen with the finest record; he is the Deputy Commissioner of Police and the Chief of the C.I.D. and in charge of the investigations into the Agliotti affair.</p>

<p>This is what apparently happened, and I find it unbelievable without some explanation. The Commissioner of Police has said in a Press statement that at some time while the investigations were in progress, General Bester was put in the picture, but apparently on the evidence available to us, not when they were started. I would have expected that what would normally be done was that the Commissioner would call his friend and colleague and say to him: &#x201C;Look, man, what is going on here&#x003F;&#x201D; And the Deputy Commissioner would have told him what is going on, and that could have been the end of the matter. [Interjections.] No one asked anything like this. No one ever mentioned this at all, but this is what one would have expected. If this is what happens, this sort of attitude is hardly calculated to engender confidence within the Police Force and hardly calculated to enhance the morale of the Force. In fact, I think the situation was perhaps summed up by a senior Police officer to the <i>Daily News</i> on that Friday that the story broke, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One senior officer said that reading between the lines it would appear that General Bester had been completely in the dark about this inquiry. &#x201C;If this can happen at the top, God help us down below. Is everybody going mad&#x003F;&#x201D;</block>

<p>But this is not the end of the story, because then General Joubert, the Commissioner of Police, telephoned, presumably having had a telephone call from Prinsloo. He telephoned Strauss, the reporter, and I will quote what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">About half an hour later I received a telephone call from the Commissioner of Police, General Joubert. He asked me why I had refused to make a sworn statement to Brigadier Prinsloo, and I replied that I had refused for several reasons: (1) Because the whole thing was so bloody ridiculous; (2) that the investigating officer did not identify himself as a brigadier and would not identify the person or persons who had made these allegations. General Joubert said : &#x201C;We all know the whole thing is ridiculous and a lot of nonsense and that is why we want a statement from you to clear the matter up once and for all.&#x201D;</block>

<p>What is wrong with that&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I will tell you what is wrong with that. If it was so ridiculous and if it was a lot of nonsense in the opinion of the Commissioner of Police, then even more so, <i>a fortiori,</i> one would have expected them to have gone to General Bester and to have said : &#x201C;Look, here is this thing which is a lot of nonsense and which is ridiculous, and what have you got to say about it&#x003F;&#x201D; But this is not what happened. The Commissioner of Police himself asked Strauss for a sworn statement. Why was it not enough, if it was a lot of nonsense and it was <span class="col_4445-4446" refersTo="page_0685"/>ridiculous, merely to take the word of General Danie Bester as an officer and a gentleman&#x003F; That is what one would have expected; but no, this did not happen. I must get on. Then one has this extraordinary thing. What was the statement which was of such importance that the Commissioner himself had to investigate it and there had to be sworn statements&#x003F; On the face of it I would have expected, as I said, the Commissioner to have been satisfied with the word of his deputy, but he wanted sworn statements&#x2014;not to satisfy him. He would have been satisfied, I believe, by the word of his deputy as an officer and a gentleman. But someone else wanted to be satisfied, and not him, General Joubert. That is the question that is here. The only other persons who could even presume to want more information would be the Minister of Police or the Prime Minister. They are the two other people who have the power to inquire into such a matter. What we want to know is what is this statement which caused such a furore and caused this extraordinary behaviour&#x003F; This statement must have been of great significance to someone, not necessarily of great significance to the Commissioner of Police, but of great significance to someone, so that he himself investigated it and that sworn statements are required. As far as the Commissioner was concerned it was ridiculous and a lot of nonsense.</p>

<p>Then, the Commissioner of Police said that this was a departmental matter. If that is so and only he was involved, surely he was the person who would accept the word of his deputy. Once he is satisfied by talking to him, that is the end of the matter as far as he is concerned, because this is a departmental matter and he is the person who decides; he is the boss of that department, and once he is satisfied that is the end of the matter. That makes one feel even more that he would not want a sworn statement, but someone in fact wanted this statement, and that someone, without some explanation, could only be the Minister of Police or the hon. the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>And then, suddenly far from becoming ridiculous and a lot of nonsense, this matter suddenly becomes a delicate one. The hon. the Minister has told us that the inquiry into the Agliotti case was a delicate one. In fact, I think he said it was a very delicate one. That was on 3rd March. Then the Commissioner of Police, in the course of all this, said the same thing. The hon. the Minister said this was a very delicate matter. Sir, what is delicate about this Agliotti case&#x003F; It is an ugly matter. It is the opposite of delicate, and in fact the report of the Commissioner indicated the presence of <i>mala fides</i> in that report. But this is now referred to as delicate. What has made the inquiry delicate&#x003F; It cannot be the fact of the matter. It must be the involvement of someone with some interest which has made this matter, which was described by the Commissioner as involving <i>mala fides,</i> delicate.</p>

<p>My time is expiring. I just want to ask one other thing. In the course of all this there suddenly appeared in the <i>Tribune</i> a statement by Mr. Gert Claassen, the former M.P.C. for Umlazi. Mr. Gert Claassen was apparently the person&#x2014;and this is how he comes into it&#x2014;who is referred to in that statement where the dinner party took place. Mr. Gert Claassen said that nothing happened at the dinner party; they did not talk about the Agliotti case, etc. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am flabbergasted that an old friend could have suffered as the result of a dinner party in my house. The Government will live to regret this, and I mean this as one who will die a Nationalist. Now the whole truth about the Agliotti business must come out.</block>

<p>Now, has that statement been investigated&#x003F; What does Mr. Gert Claassen mean by the whole truth having come out&#x003F; The implication is that the whole truth has not come out. [Interjections.] At this stage I will ask the hon. the Minister whether he will now give this House and the country an explanation of these extraordinary events.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Durban North probably thought he was going to drop a bombshell here this afternoon, but I can assure him that it was nothing but a damp squib. If this has to be a matter of public importance, I feel sorry for the Opposition that they have to try to come to this House with a matter of this kind. I can only say to the hon. member that if he thinks he is furthering the cause of the United Party by scratching around in the rubbish heap for gossipmongering stories like a political ferret and then wanting to conduct a major debate on it, he is making a very big mistake. [Interjections.] Why did the hon. member ask for this debate&#x003F; He received his normal <span class="col_4447-4448" refersTo="page_0686"/>publicity in the <i>Sunday Times</i> on Sunday with a lot of rubbish, where he asked questions and tried to make insinuations against the hon. the Minister of Police and the hon. the Prime Minister. After he had made those insinuations they became front-page news. The next day the Commissioner of Police made a full statement in the Press. He told the Press that this was a departmental inquiry. There are many departmental inquiries. One would have expected the hon. member for Durban North, if he reads his Press as faithfully as he reads his little Natal newspaper, to have known about this statement, and he would not then have requested this debate. But in spite of that he requested this debate after he had heard that a matter had been investigated. And let me now tell him why it is necessary to investigate statements which reach the ears of the Commissioner. It is necessary because we should like Gen. Bester&#x2019;s name to be cleared completely. If the Commissioner had gone to him, as the hon. member suggested and had said : &#x201C;Look here, Danie, did you say this&#x003F;&#x201D; and Danie had replied: &#x201C;No, my old friend, I did not say that&#x201D;, what would we have had then&#x003F; We would then have had one debate after another here and we would have been asked to appoint a judicial commission of inquiry. That is why the Commissioner acted correctly. [Interjections.] I just want to tell the hon. member that even the English-language Press stated by implication that the whole matter had been solved. Here it stands in the <i>Pretoria News:</i> &#x201C;Bester, U.P. wants debate.&#x201D; That newspaper states : &#x201C;He has been cleared.&#x201D; In other words, why does the United Party want a debate&#x003F; For no reason whatsoever.</p>

Let them make a great issue of it now. I want to say that they are only making fools of themselves. With this matter the hon. member for Durban North has made a complete fool of himself.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_police">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POLICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, from last Friday up to last night, while the newspapers were engaged in this controversy which has led to this debate this afternoon, I was, fortunately, not anywhere near here. I was far away on other official duties. Actually I am grateful for having been spared that. It seems to me that lately the hon. member for Durban North has become a puppet of the English newspapers. When they pull the string, he jumps about; he dances around according to the wishes and desires of the English newspapers.</p>

<p>If time permits, I shall come back to that later. In the first place, as I think it is my duty to do, I want to relate the full history of what happened. In the first place, a report was conveyed to the Commissioner of Police personally that Gen. Bester had allegedly made certain statements to a reporter of an English language newspaper in Natal. These statements which Gen. Bester had allegedly made, were to the effect that the Government wanted to impose certain restrictions on certain aspects of the inquiry into the Agliotti matter. In other words, what it amounted to was that the Police, because of action from the side of the Government, could not conduct their inquiry freely and in an unhampered way. Furthermore, according to the report conveyed to the Commissioner of Police, Gen. Bester had allegedly told the reporter that as a result of the interference of the Government in regard to the inquiry into the Agliotti case, he was going to retire before he was due to retire and that, after he had retired, he would make the full story and all information available to this reporter for publication. This, more or less, is the content of the statement allegedly made to the reporter by Gen. Bester. It goes without saying that the Commissioner of the South African Police, who is responsible, in the first place, not only for the inquiry into the Agliotti case, but also for every officer and member of the force serving under him, regarded the statement allegedly made by Gen. Bester in a very serious light. He regarded it as his duty to do something about it and to take action. For that reason he personally started investigating the case. Here I should like to emphasize very seriously what the hon. member for Prinshof said a moment ago; the only point which the hon. member for Durban North made, was that Gen. Joubert, as Commissioner of Police, should have approached Gen. Bester and asked him what he had said on that occasion. Sir, these things are United Party gossip; it is a wicked campaign <span class="col_4449-4450" refersTo="page_0687"/>in which they are participating. If Gen. Joubert had received the reply from Gen. Bester that he had not said something like that, do hon. members think the gossip would have stopped in Natal&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, there was no public inquiry. The only other point which the hon. member for Durban North made, was that an officer who was Gen. Bester&#x2019;s junior, had allegedly investigated the matter. The investigation which took place was conducted by the Commissioner of Police himself, under his supervision, but it is obvious that he cannot do everything himself. Therefore he asked one of his very responsible and senior officers to go to the person who had supplied the information about what Gen. Bester had allegedly said, in order to get a statement from him about the question whether Gen. Bester had said something like that and what he had in fact said.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to emphasize that in so far as Gen. Joubert did not conduct the investigation himself, it was conducted with him directly in charge; it was only in so far as he was unable to handle it himself that he appointed another responsible officer to go and take down a statement at a particular place. It was not regarded as a charge against Gen. Bester. In fact, according to what Gen. Joubert told me, he was convinced that there was no truth in such a statement; he is convinced that there was no interference in the Agliotti case from the side of the Government.</p>

<p>If an allegation such as this were true, the Commissioner of Police would have taken action and ensured that the investigation of the Agliotti case proceeded, regardless of who on earth would be affected by it. He would have done so had there been any truth in the statement. On the other hand, if there were no truth in such a statement, he would at least want to determine who the liar was. He would want to determine who the man was who had lied and who had implicated Gen. Bester&#x2019;s name in that way. Therefore it was essential for the Commissioner of Police to investigate what had happened here. It is probably still necessary and desirable to investigate the case further.</p>

<p>For these reasons, the Commissioner of Police sent Brig. Prinsloo to go and speak to the person to whom Gen. Bester had allegedly made certain statements. I want to emphasize here that the Commissioner of Police received no instruction whatsoever from me or from the Prime Minister regarding this action taken by him. He did so in his capacity as Commissioner of the South African Police. But I also want to say frankly that I approve of his every action. Had he asked me beforehand whether he were to have done this in the way in which he in fact did, I would have given him the necessary instruction to do so. Brig. Prinsloo then went to conduct an interview with the reporter referred to a moment ago. As the hon. member for Durban North rightly remarked a few moments ago, Brig. Prinsloo was hardly in conversation with the reporter when a telephone call came through to Gen. Bester in Pretoria. Gen. Bester went to the Commissioner&#x2019;s office when he heard that questions had been put to the reporter. Apparently Brig. Prinsloo was still in the office of the reporter. On that occasion the Commissioner of Police told Gen. Bester everything, including what he had allegedly said. Subsequently Gen. Bester made a full affidavit and denied that he had made these statements he had allegedly made. Brig. Prinsloo did not take a statement from the reporter. He himself made a signed affidavit which he sent by post to the Commissioner of Police. Similarly, the reporter denied that Gen. Bester had made these statements. [Interjections.]</p>
