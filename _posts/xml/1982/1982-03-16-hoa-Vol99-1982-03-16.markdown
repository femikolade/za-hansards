<heading>INTRODUCTION</heading>

<p>The unparalleled increase in the demand for Post Office services, especially telephone and telex services, has for the Department of Posts and Telecommunications been the outstanding feature of the recent growth phase in the country&#x2019;s economy. It has surpassed the best forecasts and provides proof that these infrastructural services have become an indispensable part of every-day life in the RSA.</p>

<p>The department is doing everything possible to meet this growing demand, but owing to the extent thereof, is being hampered in its efforts by drastic cost increases and in particular a shortage of technical staff. During the financial year now drawing to a close, good progress has nevertheless been made in all spheres of the department&#x2019;s services to the public.</p>

<p>Since assuming ministerial responsibility for the Department of Posts and Telecommunications, I have become deeply impressed by the enthusiasm, diligence and perseverance of the department&#x2019;s staff in tackling and implementing the enormous challenges of innovation in the performance of their duties. Despite their depleted ranks, one would have to go far to find a more loyal and willing corps of workers&#x2014;and this even under the most difficult circumstances, coupled at times with great provocation. I would like to <span class="col_2947-2948" refersTo="page_1498"/>pay tribute to them for the excellent manner in which they are maintaining and developing this important infrastructural service and can assure hon. members that the task is in good hands.</p>

<p>In the financial field, greater demands than ever were made on the department, mainly in satisfying the ever-increasing demand for services and in meeting cost increases on all fronts. The maintenance and extension of efficient postal and telecommunications services, require not only proper planning and able staff but also enormous amounts of money. Efficient communication services are not only indispensable for a sound economy, but essential for national security as well as the general well-being of all the inhabitants of our country. New technological developments cannot be ignored, but must continuously be investigated, tested and implemented if the means by which we render the services are to remain efficient and economic in the future. Not only is there an impressive increase in the demand for these infrastructural services, but also more and more insistence by our clients on the use of the most modern and efficient techniques, as these are cost-saving also to them and facilitate and speed up their activities.</p>

<p>A recent phenomenon on the financial front is an exceptionally large increase, of necessity, in capital expenditure needed to keep pace with the growing demand for services. I shall enlarge on this later, but should first like to give the House a survey of the various activities of the department during the present financial year and of what is planned for the coming financial year.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#telecommunications">

<heading>TELECOMMUNICATIONS</heading>

<p><i>Provision of telephone services</i></p>

<p>It is expected that approximately 270 000 additional telephones will be provided during the present financial year, which will bring the total number of telephones to approximately 3 203 000 at the end of March 1982. This represents an increase of 9,2%. Despite this high rate of provision, it is estimated that the number of waiting applicants will increase by about 49 000, or 34,7%, to 190 000 at the end of March this year. This is mainly due to the sustained increase in the demand for telephone services, particularly by business undertakings, users at new growth points and the non-White population groups.</p>

<p>The overseas telephone service and international subscriber dialling were extended further during the year. Since my budget speech in September 1981, subscriber dialling to Argentina, Brazil, Malawi and Singapore has also been introduced and the external telephone service is now available to 202 countries, South African subscribers can dial direct to 48 of these countries.</p>

<p>It is estimated that external telephone calls will increase by about 22% to some 7,2 million during this financial year as compared with the previous financial year. This contrasts sharply with allegations that the RSA is isolated or efforts to isolate it, and is in fact proof of the department&#x2019;s major share in the promotion of communication with the rest of the world.</p>

<p><i>Telephone exchange systems</i></p>

<p>It is expected that the capacity of the automatic telephone exchange system will be extended by approximately 164 000 lines during this financial year as a result of the replacement of a further 44 manual exchanges by automatic exchanges, the establishment of 20 new automatic exchanges and the extension of 133 existing automatic exchanges, while some 111 manual exchanges will also be extended by approximately 9 900 lines. The first two digital electronic telephone exchanges in the Republic were officially commissioned towards the end of 1981. The manufacturers will deliver a further 20 electronie exchanges in this financial year. The total capacity of these 22 exchanges is about 73 000 fines.</p>

<p>For the coming financial year it is planned to extend the capacity of automatic exchanges and manual exchanges by 177 500 and 14 500 fines respectively. The delivery of 46 electronic exchanges, with a total capacity of 145 500 lines, as well as four electronic trunk exchanges, is expected during 1982-&#x2019;83.</p>

<p>Questions are sometimes asked in uninformed circles as to whether the cost of these and other new technological developments I shall deal with shortly, is justified. I want to reply without hesitation that it is more than justified and even essential in terms of cost saving, improved efficiency, durability and high volume capability in the medium and long term.</p>

<p><span class="col_2949-2950" refersTo="page_1499"/><i>National trunk system</i></p>

<p>Continuous expansion of our trunk circuit network is necessary in order to cope with the ever-increasing growth in telecommunications traffic between the cities and towns of the country. The trunk network will be extended by some 2 500 additional circuits during this year, which will bring the total number of trunk circuits to almost 60 000 at the end of this month. For the coming financial year, the provision of 2 600 additional circuits is planned.</p>

<p><i>Quality of the telephone service</i></p>

<p>To promote the quality of the telephone service it is the intention to introduce a sophisticated microcomputer-controlled quality of service monitoring system through which the quality of test calls will be analysed. This system will ensure and facilitate efficient management and control of service quality and will counter problems that may arise from the unexpectedly high growth in traffic at a time of staff shortages.</p>

<p><i>Telex network</i></p>

<p>The number of telex services is expected to grow by 16% to the end of March 1982, which will bring the total number of services to approximately 24 800. On account of the phenomenal demand for these services, the number of waiting applicants will unavoidably also have increased to some 1 500.</p>

<p>The processor-controlled EDS type exchanges, installed in Johannesburg in 1979 and later also in Cape Town and Durban, have exceeded all expectations with regard to efficiency and reliability. This modern type of equipment was recently also used to extend the existing electro-mechanical international telex exchange in Johannesburg and will eventually replace it.</p>

<p>Telex facilities are now available to 194 countries, 100 of which can be dialled direct by subscribers in South Africa. A direct radiotelex service between South Africa and ships at sea was introduced experimentally during 1980 and is so successful that it has been decided to retain it on a permanent basis.</p>

<p>A second EDS exchange will be installed in Johannesburg during 1982, which will result in approximately 84% of all South African telex subscribers being served by processor-controlled electronic exchanges.</p>

<p><i>Teletex service</i></p>

<p>The new text communication service for business purposes known as Teletex, to which I referred in my budget speech last year, is intended for the transmission of business letters and similar documents up to 40 times faster than is possible with the existing telex service. High-quality printing is ensured by the system and in addition the processed text can be stored in a computer memory for re-use.</p>

<p>Teletex will form part of a highly sophisticated world-wide service of the future. It is expected that the Post Office will be in a position to provide the service during the first half of 1983.</p>

<p><i>Inland telegraph service</i></p>

<p>The gradual replacement of the old electro-mechanical type teleprinter used in the inland telex and gentex services by modern quieter semi-electronic models is receiving attention at present. Provisions has been made for the replacement of the teleprinters at a rate of 2 000 per year, which means that the process will take about 13 years to complete. Serviceable teleprinters of the old type will nevertheless be kept in working order for emergency purposes.</p>

<p><i>Data services</i></p>

<p>The ever-increasing demand for data services is continuing and nearly 7 200 additional services will be provided during this year, which represents a growth of 37,1%. By the end of the year, the number of data modems will in all probability have increased to 20 500.</p>

<p>Dial-up and leased-line data services have existed in South Africa since 1967. Switched data networks, specially designed for the transmission of data, have been set up in many countries, including South Africa. The South African network, known as SAPONET, was commissioned at the end of January 1979.</p>

<p><i>Packet switching of data traffic</i></p>

<p>A new facility has been available for data users of SAPONET since 1 February this year, namely a method for the transmission of data known as packet switching. This is the most advanced technique for data transmission presently in use and with the introduction <span class="col_2951-2952" refersTo="page_1500"/>of SAPONET the South African Post Office was one of the world leaders in the field of packet switching.</p>

<p>The main aim of packet switching is to provide data users with switching services at more economical tariffs than would otherwise have been possible, since packet switching uses a data switching network much more advantageously than the alternative circuit switching method that has thus far been in general use. The packet switching method has been in use for a number of months in South Africa for carrying some of the internal data traffic of the Post Office and in the process the staff have gained experience in the use and operation of the technique.</p>

<p>Packet switching is a method whereby the outgoing traffic of data users is divided into blocks or packets of uniform size, each of which is then &#x201C;addressed&#x201D; to the receiving data user and can be transmitted together with the packets of other users over one data channel. It has been established that a switching network of a given capacity can carry about five times more packet switched traffic than is the case with circuit switched traffic.</p>

<p>Connections on which the packet switching method can be used, can also be set up between separate data switching networks. In the case of SAPONET, it is planned to provide two international circuits provisionally, one to the United States of America and one to the United Kingdom. These circuits will also allow access to data switching networks in other countries. Provided nothing unforeseen occurs, the two circuits will be commissioned during September this year.</p>

<p><i>Video conference and telephone conference</i></p>

<p>The experimental video conference service between Cape Town and Pretoria was demonstrated to members of the Cabinet on 11 November 1981. Since then it has been put at the disposal of government departments and business undertakings for trial purposes free of charge. Almost without exception the reaction of the users has been favourable, both as regards the ease with which the service can be operated and the time and money saved. In view of the interest shown in this extremely useful service, it is hoped that it will be possible to introduce the first restricted regular service between a few large cities by the second half of 1982. For these restricted services, it is the intention to make use on a part-time basis of spare video channels leased by the Post Office to the SABC for television transmissions. As the demand for video conference facilities justifies it, attention will be given to the establishment of full-time channels and the extension of the service to more cities.</p>

<p>The telephone conference service has undergone its experimental phase successfully and is in daily use at present. Certain clients find the service extremely useful and make use of it on a regular basis. One client has booked his monthly conferences for a full year ahead.</p>

<p><i>Videotex</i> (BELTEL)</p>

<p>Interest is shown in all developed countries in the introduction of a videotex service. This service, which will be known as BELTEL in the RSA, makes use of a television set linked to the user&#x2019;s telephone line and fitted with an interfacing unit. With it all types of information such as timetables, weather reports, news etc. can be called up by a user on his television screen from a central computer. Eventually it will also be possible to use the service for transmitting and receiving messages, placing orders, requesting bank balances and so forth.</p>

<p>Orders have already been placed by the Post Office for the hardware and software for a restricted service which will be introduced experimentally and in which it is hoped that 80 business undertakings will participate. It is expected that the experimental system will be commissioned later this year and during the trial period of about 18 months the technical and operating problems will be studied thoroughly. Afterwards the market will be tested and if the service is well received and can be justified economically, it will be introduced as a fully-fledged public service.</p>

<p><i>Transmission</i></p>

<p>The trunk and junction network continues to expand very rapidly, especially the number of 30-channel digital pulse code modulation systems that are being installed to provide connections with the new digital exchanges. The number of systems on order <span class="col_2953-2954" refersTo="page_1501"/>has, for example, increased from 881 in 1981-&#x2019;82 to 2 627 for 1982-&#x2019;83.</p>

<p>Four 140 megabit optical fibre systems which provide 1 920 channels per system on two fibres have been ordered. These systems will be the first broad-band optical fibre systems to be used in the Republic. Optical fibre systems transmit signals by means of light impulses instead of electrical impulses and since they do not conduct electricity, they are eminently suitable for use in areas subject to a high incidence of lightning or where interference caused by electrical induction is experienced.</p>

<p>I can report that an experimental system 7 kilometres in length was installed in October last year between Krugersdorp and Witpoortjie, an area subject to severe electrical storms, and that it has withstood the first lightning season admirably.</p>

<p>Optical fibre systems hold great promise for the future, particularly since there have been positive indications lately that later on the initial high costs will drastically decrease. The cables handle easily, will need fewer intermediate repeaters than copper cables and will also consume less power.</p>

<p>Financial provision has been made in the budget for 1982-&#x2019;83 for the acquisition of the first intermediate-haul digital microwave system for use in the evaluation of this type of microwave system under local atmospheric conditions.</p>

<p><i>Private radio communication services</i></p>

<p>There were 210 331 private radio communication stations in operation on 31 March 1981 and it is expected that this number will stand at 250 000 at the end of the financial year; an increase of 18,9%.</p>

<p>The demand for radio sets operating in the citizen band is reaching saturation point, while the demand for all other types of private two-way radio communication services shows a sharp increase. The radio spectrum is limited and this high demand for private radio communication facilities has already led to the overloading of the spectrum, especially in the large urban complexes. It is important that the radio spectrum be utilized as effectively as possible and in order to achieve this, it has been decided to introduce communal radio repeater systems that will enable several users to share the same radio channel without interference to each other.</p>

<p>If all goes according to plan, the first of these systems will be brought into operation on the Witwatersrand during the first half of the 1982-&#x2019;83 financial year. The Post Office will control the repeater stations associated with the proposed system, but the supply of the radio equipment required by the public to participate in the scheme will continue to be left to the private sector.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#buildings">

<heading>BUILDINGS</heading>

<p>To keep pace with the demand for telecommunication services, the rate of providing buildings for that purpose had to be stepped up considerably. In a period of less than two years the programme for major building projects increased by 83%.</p>

<p>The dispensation under which the department acquired full control over its building works has been in force since first April 1980 and is paying good dividends. Lines of communication with planners and contractors are now short and direct and good progress can be made with the planning and completion of buildings to eliminate bottlenecks and counter interim cost increases. Moreover, an operating saving of approximately R250 000 per annum has been effected in consequence of this.</p>

<p>The first major building project planned and completed under this dispensation is a new post office building at Secunda which will be officially opened on 22 March 1982.</p>

<p>During this financial year 34 major building projects will be completed, while a further 48 will be in various stages of construction at the end of this month. It is expected that 72 major building projects will be completed during 1982-&#x2019;83 and the construction of approximately 185 projects will be commenced with. An amount of R60 million has been budgeted for in the new financial year for these purposes.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#postal_service">

<heading>POSTAL SERVICE</heading>

<p>There has also been a large increase in internal postal traffic over the past year. The increasing mail volumes have been taxing the existing mail sorting equipment installed in Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban and Pretoria to such an extent that extending the equipment in especially the first two centres has now become a matter of priority. In <span class="col_2955-2956" refersTo="page_1502"/>1981, as compared with 1980, the average daily number of postal articles posted in Johannesburg increased by 357 000 or 26,6%. In Pretoria, Durban and Cape Town the increases amounted to 5,7, 9,4 and 5,5% respectively.</p>

<p>Additional equipment to the value of R3 million is at present being installed in the Johannesburg post office, while it is expected that equipment valued at R1,5 million will be taken into use in Cape Town towards September this year. This equipment includes optical character reading equipment capable of reading typewritten and in some cases also handwritten addresses without the aid of coding staff. This sophisticated equipment heralds a new era in the concept of mechanical mail sorting for this country, but optimum use of the equipment will only be possible if the public&#x2014;and commerce and industry in particular&#x2014;give their full co-operation. On this occasion I should like to appeal to organized commerce and industry to give their wholehearted support when approached by the Post Office in this regard. In the past the department has always been able to rely on the co-operation of these organizations and I am sure that it can rely on that co-operation in the future too.</p>

<p>Up to the present only the so-called standardized mail, which comprises approximately 90% of the total volume of mail, could be handled and processed mechanically. Because of the considerable increase in postal articles to approximately 2 000 million per annum and the manpower shortage being experienced, the stage has been reached where the handling processes of non-standardized mail should also be mechanized at centres where the volumes justify such action. The purchase of sorting machines for non-standardized letters and similar mail is therefore contemplated for Cape Town and Johannesburg during the coming financial year.</p>

<p><i>New policy on special postage stamps</i></p>

<p>Hon. members will know that for many years, the Post Office has been issuing one or more special stamps annually to commemorate persons, bodies or events or to focus attention on some or other topical matter.</p>

<p>In recent years the number of requests for the issue of such postage stamps has increased to such an extent that the policy had to be reviewed. The point has been reached where it is no longer practicable to do justice to the large number of equally deserving claims, all coupled to specific dates, without disrupting the departmental machinery which has to cope with the issues.</p>

<p>Towards the end of last year the Government consequently decided that&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) except in the most exceptional cases, the issuing of special stamps to commemorate specific persons, bodies or events will be discontinued;</li>

<li>(b) no more than five series of special postage stamps will be issued annually, and that they will depict themes promoting the image of the Republic, such as tourist attractions, art, culture, nature conservation, development, sport and recreation, etc.;</li>

<li>(c) no more than four stamps depicting a specific theme will be issued in any series;</li>

<li>(d) suggestions for the issuing of special postage stamps depicting theme&#x2019;s would be welcomed, and that such suggestions should reach the Post Office not later than 31 December two years prior to the year of issue; and</li>

<li>(e) as in the past, new definitive postage stamps series will still be issued about every five years.</li>

</ol>

<p>I trust that the new policy will lead to greater orderliness and will be generally accepted.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#staff">

<heading>&#x2020;STAFF</heading>

<p>The inadequacy of the department&#x2019;s labour force has the greatest retarding effect on our programmes, and is indeed making special demands on Management. Despite the department&#x2019;s efforts to recruit its fair share of school-leavers and university graduates and to combat resignations by serving personnel, the staff position, seen against the increasing demands arising from the growth in Post Office activities, has deteriorated during the past year. The fact that the department has been able to cope with its <span class="col_2957-2958" refersTo="page_1503"/>ever-increasing activities successfully in spite of this, testifies to the productivity and dedication of the staff.</p>

<p>As hon. members know, large numbers of Post Office staff observe a six-day working week and work longer hours than the rest of the public sector, while thousands of them work overtime in the evenings and over weekends. I am also of the opinion that a little more appreciation and understanding of the foregoing facts on the part of the user of Post Office services, instead of unfair criticism, will contribute towards maintaining the morale of the staff.</p>

<p>In my budget speech last year I made mention of our plans to transfer functions to centres where labour is more readily available in order to afford relief in problem areas. Resulting from investigations in this regard, the Telegraph and Telephone Audit Branch of the Accounting Division was transferred from Pretoria to Port Elizabeth with effect from 1 January 1982. I can report that this project has been executed with great success and that no problems were experienced in recruiting in Port Elizabeth the necessary local staff for 80 posts. These posts are additional to 12 senior posts the incumbents of which have moved to Port Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Many years ago the department took the first step in the direction of decentralization of head office functions when the head office of the Post Office Savings Bank was located in Bloemfontein. This policy is being actively pursued and it was decided recently to decentralize the computer organization of the department by moving about half the computer functions of the head office of the Department to a computer centre in the Cape Peninsula area. This involves the erection of a suitable building which in the nature of things will take time, but according to present planning the centre will be put into operation by 1984-&#x2019;85 with a staff of approximately 65.</p>

<p>The preliminary work in connection with the transfer to the regional offices of the department of the extensive head office functions involved in the processing and checking of postmasters&#x2019; accounts, is also far advanced. This will result in approximately 75 posts being moved to Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban, Bloemfontein, Kimberley and Johannesburg in the next 2½ years and being filled with locally recruited staff.</p>

<p>The head office set-up of the proposed new TELEBANK, about which I shall have more to say later on, will also be established in Bloemfontein.</p>

<p>The department is still unable to recruit enough male clerks to meet its current and future needs. Fortunately, women for clerical work are readily available but the majority of them are married and cannot be transferred to the places where their services are needed most. The Clerical Division remains the main source of supply for the administrative ranks and unless there is a drastic and sustained improvement in the position with regard to male clerical staff, serious problems are foreseen in filling higher-graded and management posts in future. The department is conducting an in-depth investigation into ways and means of solving this problem.</p>

<p>On 31 March 1981 there were 1 203 vacancies for White postmen. The position is being met by utilizing the services of the other population groups in those posts for which Whites are not available. On the aforementioned date there were 2 520 non-White postmen in service.</p>

<p>During 1981 the department experienced difficulty in recruiting its full quota of school leavers for technical and technical auxiliary staff&#x2014;an aspect which is receiving close attention.</p>

<p><i>Overseas recruiting</i></p>

<p>Because of the dearth of trained manpower in this country, the department was obliged once again to turn to the overseas labour market and in a special recruiting drive succeeded in recruiting a fair number of professional, technical and technical auxiliary staff in the United Kingdom and Belgium. As a follow-up to this successful effort, an experienced staff officer has now been sent to London to speed up and round off the necessary formalities in close co-operation with the immigration office of the Department of Internal Affairs.</p>

<p><i>Staff utilization</i></p>

<p>The continuous expansion of the department&#x2019;s activities, especially in the field of telecommunications, naturally places higher demands on the available staff. It is essential <span class="col_2959-2960" refersTo="page_1504"/>that every worker be utilized to the maximum of his potential and the department places a high premium on training to ensure that the staff are adequately equipped for their tasks. Constant attention is also given to the better utilization of the available manpower, <i>inter alia</i> by&#x2014;</p>

<ul>

<li>— revising the allocation and grading of certain work where practicable to permit of its being performed effectively at the lowest possible level;</li>

<li>— making maximum use of women, even on work traditionally performed only by men;</li>

<li>— continuous work study investigations;</li>

<li>— manpower recovery; and</li>

<li>— study aid.</li>

</ul>

<p><i>Staff housing</i></p>

<p>Hon. members will recall that in the course of my budget speech last year I strongly emphasized the necessity for staff housing since housing had become one of the most pressing problems and the biggest single obstacle to obtaining staff in the rapidly developing areas of the country.</p>

<p>An amount of nearly R15,5 million will be spent on official housing during this financial year, while R16 million is being requested for 1982-&#x2019;83. This provision includes an amount required for the erection of 100 three-bedroom dwelling units in Soweto that will be commenced with later this year.</p>

<p>In addition, the department introduced an improved and simplified housing subsidy scheme with effect from 1 October 1981. The revised scheme was enthusiastically welcomed by staff who have their own homes.</p>

<p>The most important development in the field of staff housing, however, remains the successful new housing loan scheme for Post Office officials that came into full operation last year. An amount of R30 million has been included in the estimates for the coming financial year for this scheme.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#finances">

<heading>FINANCES</heading>

<p>I now come to the finances of the Post Office and, in addition to reporting on the course of our financial affairs during the financial year now drawing to a close and the expected position for the next financial year, I should like to deal with certain aspects of our general financial policy.</p>

<p><i>The 1981-&#x2019;82 financial year</i></p>

<p>Operating expenditure for the financial year that ends on 31 March this year is estimated at R1 208,8 million, which is some R21 million higher than the original appropriation. This increase is due to higher staff expenses, increased transport expenditure arising from increases in transport tariffs, higher costs of material, stores and services and higher interest payments. Capital expenditure is estimated at R574,5 million&#x2014;some R9,4 million more than the amount that was originally appropriated. This increase stems from additional provision for telecommunications services. Together with other appropriations, the total estimated expenditure for the financial year amounts to R1 832 million.</p>

<p>Revenue for 1981-&#x2019;82 is now estimated at R1 304,7 million, which is R22,7 million higher than previously expected. The higher revenue is mainly attributable to the greater use made of postal and telecommunications services and higher interest earned on shortterm investments arising from the increase in interest rates. After provision has been made for operating expenditure, loan redemption, the staff housing scheme and an increase of standard stock capital, an operating profit of R47,1 million is expected to be available for financing part of the capital expenditure. The remainder of the capital expenditure will be financed from the provision for depreciation and the higher replacement costs of assets that are included in operating expenditure and is available for appropriation on capital spending, and from money invested on call, savings services moneys and other loan funds.</p>

<p>It is estimated that in 1981-&#x2019;82 the ratio between loan funds and internal funds employed on financing capital expenditure will come to 63,7% from loan funds and 36,3% from internal sources, which is a reversal of the position in 1980-&#x2019;82 when it came to 39,3% from loan funds and 60,7% from internal funds. This turnabout is a clear indication of the dramatic increase in capital spending to which I shall refer again later.</p>

<p>The estimated expenditure for 1981-&#x2019;82 <span class="col_2961-2962" refersTo="page_1505"/>will exceed by R26,4 million or 1,5% the total amount of R1 805,6 million appropriated originally. The excess expenditure to be voted appears in a statement in the Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure for 1982-&#x2019;83 that are to be tabled.</p>

<p>The loss on the postal service and the public telegraph service for the current financial year is estimated at R85,1 million and R22 million respectively. In the previous financial year losses of R51.3 million and R13,7 million respectively were incurred on these services. I shall deal with this tendency in more detail later on.</p>

<p><i>The 1982-&#x2019;83 financial year</i></p>

<p>The revenue for 1982-&#x2019;83 is estimated at R1 716,2 million, which is 31,5% higher than that expected for the present financial year. Of the expected higher revenue, 19,4% is attributable to the increased tariffs which I announced earlier this year, while the remainder of the increase is due to the growth in the services rendered by the department to the public.</p>

<p>Operating expenditure is estimated at R1 475,5 million, which is 22% more than that expected for the present financial year. This increase arises mainly from&#x2014;</p>

<ul>

<li>— higher staff expenditure</li>

<li>— higher interest payments on investments in the Post Office&#x2019;s savings services</li>

<li>— normal growth in activities and expansion of the telecommunications network</li>

<li>— expected cost escalation on maintenance (buildings and telecommunications), as well as on services, materials and stores, and</li>

<li>— higher international payments in respect of the increase in traffic.</li>

</ul>

<p>Capital expenditure of R757 million is being budgeted for in 1982-&#x2019;83, which represents an increase of no less than 31,8% on the expected spending for the present financial year.</p>

<p>This large increase in the provision for capital expenditure is required in particular for additional exchanges and related extensions to cable networks, transmission and other equipment to meet the rapidly growing demand for telephone and other telecommunications services. It is further needed for, <i>inter alia,</i> expected cost escalation, higher expenditure on official housing, new and additional mail sorting equipment at the large centres and further expansion of the computer and computer systems.</p>

<p>The operating surplus that can be contributed towards capital expenditure in the coming financial year is estimated at R185,9 million, and it is expected that 50,6% of the capital expenditure will be financed from internal funds while 49,4% will come from loan funds.</p>

<p>In the five years from 1976-&#x2019;77 up to and including 1980-&#x2019;81, capital expenditure increased from R238,7 million to R405,3 million, that is to say by 14,2% per year on average over the past four years. Estimated capital expenditure for the present financial year, however, is 41,7% higher than that for 1980-&#x2019;81, while capital expenditure for 1982-&#x2019;83, as already mentioned, is expected to be 31,8% higher than that for the present financial year.</p>

<p>It is evident from our forward planning that the large physical size that the capital programme is now assuming will have to be maintained for at least a number of years in the future if we are to come at all close to meeting the growing demand for services. The financing of such programmes will require large sums of money. It should also be borne in mind that even if the new higher physical level of the programme should remain the same, higher amounts will be needed every year to cover continuous price increases. While we are hoping that the rate of price increases will decline, it is a fact that price escalation on telecommunications equipment and other elements comprising the major portion of our capital expansion programme was appreciably higher than the general rate of inflation during the past number of years.</p>

<p>The demands being made on our finances are now in fact becoming so large that we are compelled to review our financing policy and also to reduce to a more realistic level the cross-subsidization of unprofitable services by the more profitable services. I have already during previous budget debates pointed out the approaching need for this.</p>

<p><span class="col_2963-2964" refersTo="page_1506"/><i>Loss on the postal service and telegraph service</i></p>

<p>I should like to dwell for a moment on these losses. Our largest loss is being sustained on the postal service and it is expected that, despite the increase in tariffs that has been announced, this loss will still amount to R57,6 million in the next financial year.</p>

<p>For a number of years now it has been the aim of the department to reduce the loss on the postal service to 10% of the operating expenditure on the service. In February as well as in September 1981 I clearly spelt out the need for reducing this loss. More than 70% of the expenditure on the postal service consists of staff costs. Together with the other biggest cost element of the service, namely transport costs, these costs have in recent years been subject to sharp increases. The postal tariffs could simply not keep pace with these increases and the percentage loss during recent years has in fact kept on increasing. In 1975-&#x2019;76 the loss amounted to 14,5% while it is estimated at 36,7% for the present financial year. Despite the increase in postal tariffs on 1 April 1982, it is expected still to amount to 20,3% in the next financial year.</p>

<p>A loss is also being sustained by the department on the public telegram service; this loss, as I have mentioned, is estimated at R22 million for the present financial year. This amounts to no less than 51% of the operating expenditure on this highly labour intensive service, which is still being fully used only by the business sector and is being used less and less by the rest of the public. The main reason for the loss is once again labour costs, which comprise more than 75% of the operating costs of the service.</p>

<p>When I announced new tariffs on 5 January, I mentioned that an increase in the telegram tariffs was being looked into more fully and would be made known later. It has now been decided to increase the tariff with effect from 1 April by levying a handling charge of R1 on all telegrams except telegraphic money order telegrams. The tariff per word remains unchanged. Despite this increase, it is estimated that the loss on the telegram service will still amount to R17,3 million in 1982-&#x2019;83. For some considerable time now overseas postal administrations have been applying the principle of levying handling charges on telegrams.</p>

<p>It is obvious that in the light of the demands that have to be met, we cannot continue to carry losses of this magnitude.</p>

<p>I now come to our financing policy.</p>

<p><i>Financing and tariff policy</i></p>

<p>Like any business, the Post Office is run according to purely business principles. It must also pursue profitability, even though there is room for cross-subsidization of unprofitable services to a certain extent. However, it has no shareholders that insist on being paid their dividends. It therefore shares its profits with all its clients by way of bigger benefits in the form of more extensive and efficient services on the one hand and, on the other, the benefit of low tariffs for as long as possible.</p>

<p>A flexible approach is therefore needed, particularly during times of relatively high inflation, precisely to assist in combating that inflation. It so happens, however, that on the other hand it is precisely now, in the midst of high inflation, that the Post Office&#x2019;s clients require more efficient and more extensive services, thereby making exceptionally heavy demands on the department&#x2019;s capital programme.</p>

<p>In addition the Post Office itself, to no lesser extent than any other entrepreneur, is the victim of inflation and rising costs on all fronts. In circumstances like the present, therefore, an ideal compromise is what is really needed. This is something that is not always seen in proper perspective.</p>

<p>There are only two sources from which the Post Office can finance its continually growing capital expenditure, namely funds generated from its operations&#x2014;which naturally depend on its tariffs&#x2014;and loan funds.</p>

<p>Since 1972 the Post Office has followed the policy, as recommended by the Franzsen Committee on Post Office Financing and accepted by the Government, of adjusting its rates in such a manner that approximately 50% of its capital expenditure is defrayed from its own funds, i.e. the surplus of revenue over operating expenditure&#x2014;after provision has been made for loan redemption, a contribution towards staff housing and any essential increase in standard stock capital&#x2014; plus the provision for depreciation and higher replacement costs of assets, and the balance <span class="col_2965-2966" refersTo="page_1507"/>from loan funds, which include Savings Bank and National Savings Certificate moneys.</p>

<p>Because of several variable factors it is of course not always possible to adhere strictly to the norm of 50% self-financing. We have tried, however, to keep the variation to either side to below 10%. An average self-financing percentage of 48,7 was maintained between the years 1972-73 and 1980-&#x2019;81, but as already indicated, this percentage is estimated at 36,3 for 1981-&#x2019;82 and at 50,6 for the coming financial year&#x2014;a very low figure for a year in which tariff increases are introduced.</p>

<p>The desirable ratio that should be maintained between self-generated funds and loan funds in the financing of fixed capital assets is something that varies from industry to industry and which is dependent on several factors. There is however also a basic correlation between that ratio and the degree of development that has been attained by the country concerned. For example, in many overseas countries a stage of development has been reached where current additions to their telecommunications systems are no longer necessary on anything like the scale, proportionately, that is necessary in our case. Some of these countries are already financing their telecommunications capital programmes to the extent of 100% from funds generated by their operations. South Africa has not as yet reached such a stage, but I am nevertheless of the opinion that our level of development now justifies a higher percentage of self-financing than the 50% that has been our guideline since 1972.</p>

<p>Apart from the fact that under normal circumstances it can, in our opinion, no longer be justified to finance only 50% of our capital expenditure from internal sources, we have now entered a period of time in which the nature and cost of available loan funds are such that we should severely restrict their use, especially where they are not generated by local savings. Moreover, in contrast to the seventies, we have to contend at present with a relatively high inflation rate.</p>

<p><i>The Post Office&#x2019;s investment facilities</i></p>

<p>Until recently the Post Office Savings Bank has been a stable and relatively inexpensive source of the loan funds we required for capital expansion, benefiting both the Post Office and the users of its services. However, it would appear that in the present financial climate the Post Office Savings Bank has reached its optimum growth potential. An alternative investment facility more readily related to interest rates in the money market has, therefore, become an urgent necessity. To meet this need, and as I announced during the Post Office Part Appropriation budget last year, it has been decided to improve and modernize the Post Office Savings Bank service to the public. The new service, which will be known as TELEBANK, will make use of sophisticated terminals connected to a central computer and will allow the user to make withdrawals and deposits by means of a plastic card.</p>

<p>As TELEBANK differs to such a large extent from the existing system it will be developed in various phases. During the first phase approximately 90 of the largest post offices in the Republic will be included in the system. The electronic equipment for these offices is being installed at present and the service will be available during the second half of this year. Thereafter the improved facilities will be gradually extended.</p>

<p><i>Use of loans</i></p>

<p>The Post Office&#x2019;s investment facilities have always been popular with the ordinary or small investor and it is our aim, by improving the savings services, to continue to make it attractive and convenient for him to invest with the Post Office. However, particularly at this point in time, this source does not generate sufficient loan funds for the Post Office. For example, while it was estimated originally that in the current financial year the investments would grow by R240 million, the actual rate of increase up to the end of last month indicates that a growth in funds of not much more than R100 million can be expected.</p>

<p>The Post Office will therefore have to continue taking up loans in the future and on a larger scale, too, than in the past.</p>

<p>During a period of prolonged and high inflation as at present, interest rates are excessive and long-term loans unobtainable. At the moment the department therefore relies on short-term loans negotiated at high interest rates overseas. If loan financing of development programmes should be resorted to on a large scale, an unmanageable <span class="col_2967-2968" refersTo="page_1508"/>interest and redemption burden would be imposed on the department.</p>

<p><i>Tariff increases</i></p>

<p>Taking into account all the circumstances I have sketched, it is the intention in future to progressively finance a larger portion of our capital expenditure from internal funds and to limit as far as possible the use of loan funds which cannot be obtained through the department&#x2019;s savings services. At this stage, the department is not substituting a specific new guideline for the existing guideline of 50% self-financing and 50% loan financing, but it can no longer follow the old guideline and will try to achieve that financing ratio which is most suited to present-day circumstances as soon as possible.</p>

<p>I mentioned earlier that it was estimated that the tariff increases that will come into effect at the beginning of next month, will bring the self-financing portion of our capital expenditure to only 50,6%. It is obvious, therefore, that further tariff adjustments will have to be effected in the not too distant future.</p>

<p>I do not think it inappropriate at this stage to say with regard to tariff increases that when on 5 January I announced the increases that would become effective on 1 April, I did not, of course, expect the step to be popular and to be favourably received, even though there had been a long period of very reasonable tariffs in the midst of an ever-rising cost of living. We are all affected by the high cost of living and to react to further demands on one&#x2019;s pocket is only natural.</p>

<p>It would appear, however, that there are those who do not fully realize that the Post Office also has to contend with rising costs of labour, material, stores and services and that it requires and will continue to require hundreds of millions of rand to establish the necessary infrastructure for our country&#x2019;s growing needs in the postal and telecommunications field. The price of a daily newspaper increased from 2,5c in 1950 to 20c in 1982&#x2014;a rise of 700% over a period of 32 years. In comparison, the letter post tariff has since 1910 increased from 1c to 8c&#x2014;an increase of 700% over a period of 72 years. Similarly, the telephone unit charge increased from 2,5c in 1959 by only 140% to 6c in 1982, i.e. over a period of 23 years.</p>

<p>It is pleasing that there is nevertheless understanding on a wide front for this and the Post Office&#x2019;s praiseworthy role over the years in operating on extremely reasonable tariffs.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that over the past number of years the Post Office has succeeded, despite sharply increasing costs, in keeping tariff adjustments below the increase in the consumer price index. For example, the increase in the consumer price index from 1975 to the end of November 1981 was 114,8%, or 12,6% per annum, whereas the increase in Post Office rates, including the increases announced for 1 April 1982, amounts to about 50% or some 6% per annum.</p>

<p>The previous general adjustment of Post Office tariffs became effective on 1 February 1980 when tariffs were increased by an average of 13%.</p>

<p>The new Post Office rates that will come into effect on 1 April 1982 will still be cheaper than those of most foreign postal administrations. In this regard I may mention as an example that where our charge for an automatic telephone call of 3 minutes over a distance of 100 kilometres will now come to 36c, this charge is R1,17c in the United Kingdom, R1,36c in France and R1,45c in West Germany. Likewise, our inland postage rate on letters in the first mass step now becomes 8c as against 28c, 23c and 25c respectively in the three countries I mentioned.</p>

<p>*<i>Salary concessions</i></p>

<p>I wish to close with a word on the salary increases for Post Office personnel which, as I announced in the House on Friday, 12 February, come into effect on 1 April 1982. Particulars of the increases were made known to the staff last month through official channels.</p>

<p>It would have been gratifying to the Management of the department and to me to grant salary concessions to Post Office officials that would have brought their salaries into line with those received by workers in the private sector. This would, however, have required huge sums of money which just cannot be made available in the present economic climate.</p>

<p>In the preface to the Postmaster General&#x2019;s Annual Report for the 1980-&#x2019;81 financial <span class="col_2969-2970" refersTo="page_1509"/>year, he makes mention of the responsible and dignified manner in which Post Office officials, and the office-bearers who represent them in their staff associations, conduct themselves when they negotiate improved conditions of service&#x2014;even when their requests cannot be met at all or can only met in part. Their attitude is praiseworthy and I fully endorse the Postmaster General&#x2019;s views in this regard. With dedication and voluntarily they work longer hours per week than others and they are at least entitled to the appreciation of all.</p>

<speech by="#widman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. B. WIDMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, my immediate reaction to the budget is one of disappointment. Whilst we thank the hon. the Minister for the comprehensive review of the activities of the Post Office, whilst we commend him, the Postmaster-General and his staff for the advances made, particularly in the electronic field, to keep up with modern advancement, and whilst we welcome the increases in salary&#x2014;although we do not know precisely what the increases are&#x2014;I must nevertheless point out that the hon. the Minister has failed to revise and lower the exceptionally high increase in tariffs which he so suddenly announced on 5 January this year. On the contrary, I am shocked to learn today that a substantial handling charge of R1 per telegram is to be levied on top of all the other tariff increases. In addition, the hon. the Minister has now warned that further tariff increases are likely in the near future.</p>

<p>The announcement made by the hon. the Minister on 5 January caught the entire economy, commerce and industry, on the wrong foot. It was an announcement which cut right across the board of tariffs and averaged an increase of approximately 55%. The hon. the Minister took an extraordinary step meant to be resorted to only for extraordinary circumstances. Why? He has not explained it to us today. We had two budgets in 1981 and on both those occasions the hon. the Minister created the impression that everything in the garden was rosy, that the image of the Post Office was still one of efficiency, that it was well run and that it was a shining example for all the other Government departments. The step taken by the hon. the Minister in January outside Parliament has in my view tarnished this image of the Post Office and rendered debate in this House sterile. We are now left with the impression that either the hon. the Minister was withholding his intention to increase tariffs at that time, or else, if he was unaware of the need to increase tariffs, something drastic had suddenly gone so wrong that the hon. the Minister could not wait until the time of this budget. In that case one would have to conclude that he has lost financial control or lacked financial planning of his portfolio.</p>

<p>The economy is already rocking on its heels from a series of body blows from the Cabinet. General sales tax has been increased by 25%, rail tariffs by 12,5% and some Post Office tariffs by 55%. At the same time the gold price is very low, the value of the rand in terms of the dollar is at its lowest ever, our balance of payments are down by millions of rand, the economy is in a dive and the number of insolvencies is on the increase. Now on top of it all we have these inflationary measures.</p>

<p>A substantial amount of revenue from postal services is obtained from companies which are co-dependent upon the Post Office. They are in fact the trading partners of the Post Office. The increases to these people are so drastic that I fear the hon. the Minister will kill the goose that lays the golden eggs for him.</p>

<p>The total budget is increased by R455 million, that is by 24,7%. Revenue is increased by 31,5%. These are all substantial increases. It is noteworthy that as far as capital expenditure is concerned, there is an increase from R574 million to R757 million, which means an increase of R183 million, or 31,8%. This is a very substantial increase. Since capital is financed from revenue, I ask whether the hon. the Minister is not trying to extract too much revenue to finance capital expenditure, thus causing a big increase in the tariffs. The hon. the Minister has pointed out that the capital increase was 14,2% over a five-year period, and it rose to <span class="col_2971-2972" refersTo="page_1510"/>41,7% last year. Now there is a further 31,8% hike. The financing of revenue is shown as a reflection of this large capital expenditure. Last year the transfer of revenue to finance capital was 36,3%. This has now risen to 50,6%. No doubt we will have a lot to say about these things tomorrow and I accordingly now move&#x2014;</p>

<speech by="#geldenhuys">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. GELDENHUYS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the House adjourned yesterday afternoon, I was giving an outline of the existence of the chiropractic profession in South Africa. I tried to indicate that for the past 56 years the profession has been struggling to obtain statutory recognition in South Africa, a struggle which led to the establishment of many societies and even more representations to the Government. It was a struggle which eventually led to the profession attaining statutory status in terms of the 1967 Act, as well as to a goal directly set them by the then hon. Minister of Health, i.e. to get their house in order. This meant that the training and ethical standards of the profession had to be improved and that the undesirables had to be barred from the profession. It was expected that once it had got its house in order the profession could once again state its case, and this it has now done. The Chiropractors Act was amended in 1972 and 1976 to allow practitioners in South West Africa to register, and to provide for the registration as practitioners of persons entitled to do so by virtue of special circumstances, and in addition to make rules to control the ethical and professional standards of the profession. This was a further confirmation of the statutory status accorded the profession as far back as 1971.</p>

<p>It appears that some of the objections being raised against the admission of the chiropractic profession in South Africa, concern <i>inter alia</i> the training of chiropractors. If I have understood the hon. member for Pietersburg, correctly, he also objected because it appears that there is no training for these professional people in South Africa. I see that the hon. member is nodding. I do not believe that this is a very reasonable objection, as I am convinced that the hon. member, as a medical practitioner, has no objection to a colleague who underwent his training in England or America practising in South Africa. I see that the hon. member is again nodding assent. I know that the hon. member would agree with me when I tell him that it was only in the twenties&#x2014;I am not quite certain of my dates&#x2014;that it became possible to study medicine in South Africa and obtain a degree here. It would therefore have been equally unfair to argue before that time that as there were no training facilities in South Africa, the medical profession could not be accepted as a profession. A while ago, the chiropractic profession held talks with the hon. the Minister and senior officials of the Department of Health and Welfare. Members of the health group of the NP caucus were present as well. Dr. Kleynhans was present on that occasion too. Dr. Kleynhans is the head of a chiropractic training college in Australia. He happens to be a native of South Africa. Among other things, the training of chiropractors was discussed. I gather that the hon. member for Pietersburg was present as well. At more or less the same time, talks were held with the university authorities of the Rand Afrikaans University concerning the possible establishment of a course for the training of chiropractors in South Africa. Dr. Kleynhans from Australia participated in these <span class="col_2973-2974" refersTo="page_1511"/>talks. A comprehensive curriculum for training was submitted, and in reply to the submission, the vice-rector of RAU, Dr. Hauptfleisch, addressed a letter to Dr. Kleynhans the gist of which was that the proposed academic standards for the course were accepted and that the university would like to initiate the course, but that the profession first had to be under the control of a statutory body. Training cannot be provided before the profession has a permanent establishment in South Africa. I think it is reasonable and logical that this be accepted. One cannot expect a chair to be created at a university for a profession which has no future in this country.</p>

<p>Now the hon. member says that it should be under the guardianship or within the ranks of the Medical Council. I do not think that any of us would object to this, as it is probably the most practical and desirable step in this regard. However, it is not the chiropractors who refuse to be integrated with the Medical Council; it is the Medical Council which refuses to integrate the chiropractors. What point is there in leaving the situation as it is, when we have reached a stalemate? Who are we helping thereby? What are we achieving in the interests of the patients in South Africa? What are we going to achieve if we maintain the <i>status quo?</i> We are achieving nothing.</p>

<p>Stemming from this debate and the various opinions which have been expressed here, the question arises as to whether the issue here is not just one desire on the part of the Medical Council&#x2014;whether the Medical Council is not trying to side-step the issue in the sense that it is being intimated in speeches in this House that commissions of inquiry are desired and that more reasons must be given why these people should have a right to exist in the medical pattern or the health team of South Africa. Is the Medical Council not merely keen to prevent the chiropractic profession in South Africa from continuing to exist? [Interjections.] I am merely asking. [Interjections.] I am asking whether the Opposition is not trying to conceal the motive on the point of the Medical Council or the Medical Association of not wishing to allow chiropractic to survive as a profession in South Africa.</p>

<p>I am asking this question, and I will explain why I am asking it. In this legislation there is no provision which amends the existing Acts. There is nothing which amends the Acts of 1971, 1972 and 1976. All that is being done in terms of this legislation is to add a power which is specifically aimed at helping to rectify the shortcomings in the professions. The register is not disappearing. But chiropractic is still in danger of finding itself in a cul de sac in the future. Why, then is the PFP opposing this Bill? The chiropractors say that there is a crisis in the profession at present. According to them there were 167 registered practising chiropractors in 1976, whereas at present there are only 101. There is therefore a decrease, and they say that their register is closed and no further registrations may take place. Furthermore, they say that they have met the requirements which the Government laid down for them. They have tried to get their house in order. They have purged their members and drawn up rules which are to serve as their code of conduct and ethics. They even submitted their qualifications for qualified South African chiropractors to the HSRC, and the HSRC accepted them. I should like to ask the hon. member for Pietersburg whether he differs with bodies such as the HSRC.</p>

<p>I do not have the report before me now, but it is a fact that the HSRC has accepted it. Chiropractic as a profession will die out and be obliterated if the register is not opened, and meanwhile time is running out. One of the questions before this House today is whether we should allow this profession to die out in South Africa. I put this question to the hon. member for Parktown as well as to the hon. member for Pietersburg; should this profession die out in South Africa? How do they feel about it? For, if it is not to die out as a profession, the hon. member for Parktown should repeal his amendment and vote in favour of the legislation. If, on the other hand, he wishes the profession to die out, he should adopt delaying tactics and oppose all legislation in this regard, thereby delaying matters until it is too late. Therefore I come to the conclusion that the Opposition is interested <span class="col_2975-2976" refersTo="page_1512"/>in the downfall and the destruction of chiropractic in South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as we see the Bill before us, the important question is not whether chiropractors, homeopaths, herbalists, etc., should be allowed to operate. Legal provision for them to do that already exists. The Bill before us, however, deals with the question of how and within which parameters they should operate. That is the basis of the whole measure before us, as we see it.</p>

<p>Quite obviously, the hon. member for Parktown is determined to use this Bill, if at all possible, as a means to make life even more difficult for those who practise these professions. I notice that the hon. member for Parktown has left the House. It is unfortunate, Mr. Speaker, that the Medical and Dental Council of South Africa has not seen fit to accommodate the chiropractors under the main umbrella. I believe that if this had been done it would have been better for all concerned. What makes it more surprising to me as a layman, however, is the following, and I quote from a letter received from the Chiropractic Association of South Africa, which I take as authentic&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Until relatively recently medicine, in our opinion, has never shown a great deal of interest in manipulation as a therapeutic means. Even nowadays, according to our sources, not all orthopaedic surgeons are inclined towards manipulation. Then, when it is done, it is usually carried out under anaesthesia. Those physiotherapists and general practitioners who do make use of manipulation do so with the minimum of formal training, if any, in the technique. To the best of our knowledge there is in South Africa not even an association or other body of medical manipulative specialists.</block>

<p>I believe that this statement cannot be contradicted, not even by the S.A. Medical and Dental Council. The Chiropractic Association of South Africa has met repeatedly with the S.A. Medical and Dental Council in order to try to resolve their differences. This goes back over a period of some 12 years.</p>

<p>In 1981 two meetings were held. Further correspondence was entered into, but it appeared to be all in vain. A meeting, even under the auspices of the hon. the Minister of Health and Welfare, was held. Notwithstanding these meetings, however, the upshot was that in November 1981, in a Press release, the S.A. Medical and Dental Council rejected chiropractic on the basis of its being unscientific and not related to, nor part of the practise of medicine. This may well be so as far as the S.A. Medical and Dental Council is concerned, but may I, as the hon. member for Parktown, quote from the memorandum entitled &#x201C;The attitude of the medical profession to chiropractors&#x201D;? It is dated May 1979. I should like to quote firstly from page 8, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In Australia, the Australian Committee of Inquiry into Chiropractics described the reaction of patients under chiropractics care thus: &#x201C;Almost uniformly there was an extremely high level of satisfaction expressed with the care received and the improvement experienced as a result of the treatment.&#x201D;</block>

<p>This study indicated that approximately 50% of the patients seeking chiropractic care had previously consulted other medical practitioners or chiropractors. This quote from the Australian Committee of Inquiry is a statement of fact based on a scientific investigation by Prof. J. Weston, a professor of sociology <span class="col_2977-2978" refersTo="page_1513"/>at the University of Queensland, Australia, together with his team.</p>

<p>Should other scientific investigations challenge, modify or contradict such findings, it is quite normal, and frequently encountered in the field of science. What is required is not the arbitrary adoption of one or other extreme point of view merely to find support for one&#x2019;s own standpoint, but rather further better designed investigations in order to bring clarity to the issue.</p>

<p>I should now like to quote from the final paragraph of the summary in the same memorandum, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Modern chiropractice is not a healing art separate and distinct from legitimate medical and paramedical disciplines. It is not based on sound scientific and educational factors, and there is little evidence to suggest that it can make a contribution to the health service of South Africa, and in particular at primary health care level. There is nothing that the chiropractor can provide that cannot be more adequately provided for by the legitimate medical and paramedical services. The preservation of this form of thinly disguised quackery is a serious reflection on the standard of medical care which we profess to uphold in South Africa.</block>

<p>First of all, may I say that the words &#x201C;legitimate medical&#x201D; are accepted, but one must also accept at this moment in time that chiropractors are also legitimate by law. What is rather amazing, is that the author of this memorandum, in a radio programme in October last year said <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the chiropractors were to confine themselves to manipulative skills of the spine for strains, etc., then they would have a place.</block>

<p>Later on he stated in the same programme&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Chiropractors, instead of being a separate profession, should come into the health team as an auxiliary, such as the physiotherapist. Then they would be welcome.</block>

<p>It is remarkable that on the one hand he said that they are a bunch of quacks and on the other hand he says that they would be welcomed into the medical field on the terms and conditions under which the Medical Council would accept them. If I say say so, I find this type of argument pretty absurd, not to mention the number of general practitioners who actually refer their patients to chiropractors. This is an accepted fact, and I should like the hon. member for Parktown to deny this.</p>

<p>The fact is that we have recognized chiropractors giving a service, and not only giving a service, but also being patronized by a large section of the community. The Chiropractic Association of South Africa has done all within its power to reach consensus with the S.A. Medical Council, but as I have said previously, to no avail. It could well be that due to the pressure on the general practitioner in so far as the number of patients is concerned, which one must accept, he would not be able to give the best services, because when one has pressures one is not always able to give the best service. With that in mind, may I just quote from the statement made by Professors Kelner, Ball and Coulter in their book <i>Chiropractors: Do they help?,</i> pages 224 and 245. They say there&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Persons with health problems feel entitled to shop around for what they believe will be the most beneficial kind of care. Further, that traditional authority of the medical profession to define health and illness and to make the sole decision regarding the kind of health care that should be given, is being challenged by this change in the relationship between patients and health practitioners. Patients of chiropractors have traditionally ignored that part of the advice of their physicians regarding the use of chiropractic services. Today the authority of medicine to establish the norms of the public&#x2019;s health behaviour is under critical review.</block>

<p><span class="col_2979-2980" refersTo="page_1514"/>They go on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the age of the consumer a person who develops a health problem that does not respond well to medical care is more likely to take his illness or injury to a different kind of practitioner who may be able to help him with a different form of health care. As consumers begin to challenge the crisis-orientated, hospital-based, expensive health-care systems developed by medical science, chiropractic may more readily be seen as an acceptable alternative.</block>

<p>There can be no doubt that because of the general lack of interest by medicine in manipulation as a therapeutic tool, added to the general hostility shown by medicine to chiropractic, I think that the chiropractic profession has understandably experienced anxiety about the perpetuity of therapeutic principle. There can be no gainsaying that.</p>

<p>In so far as the proposal for a Select Committee is concerned, as suggested by the hon. member for Parktown, this in my opinion can be seen as a ploy just to frustrate the position of the chiropractor only further. If this measure were to be referred to a Select Committee it could result in another delay of some 12 to 18 months. And to what purpose? In my opinion, none whatsoever. I wonder if I may ask a question here. Rumour has it that the official Opposition are going to have a free vote in the Committee Stage. I wonder whether they would like to deny that.</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. G. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>For the reasons I give, I cannot support the request that this Bill be referred to a Select Committee.</p>

<p>I want now to refer to the statement made by the hon. member for Pietersburg as far as the American Medical Association and its case with the Chiropractic Association is concerned. I want to say here that I accept and support his argument that the chiropractors and the Medical Council should get together. While they are apart, the animosity between them continues to grow. However, I do want to say that while it is agreed that the American Medical Association and 12 defendants were found innocent of anti-trust charges brought against them by five chiropractors in the U.S. district court of Chicago, an appeal was lodged. I should just like to quote from an article that appeared in the <i>International Chiropractors Association Today</i> dated January 1982, volume 19, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Justice Department slaps American Medical Association for anti-competitive practices. The Department of Justice acting as attorney for the Federal Trade Commission has filed a brief in the United States Supreme Court that finds the American Medical Association guilty of imposing anti-competitive restrictions on advertising, solicitation and contract practices by physicians.</block>

<p>It goes on further to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As evidenced in the brief the Government has some extremely harsh things to say about the American Medical Association&#x2019;s attitude towards the anti-trust laws saying that the American Medical Association has a long history of illegal behaviour. The proceedings in the Supreme Court are an appeal from the Federal Trade Commission&#x2019;s findings that the American Medical Association and its State and Local Medical Society affiliates have engaged in a conspiracy to impose anti-competitive restrictions on medical physicians through the use of principles of medical ethics.</block>

<p>The report goes on to state&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Federal Trade Commission has found that the American Medical Association&#x2019;s action had created a very formidable impediment to competition in the delivery of health care services by physicians in the country. That barrier has served to deprive consumers of the free flow of information about the availability of health care services, to deter the offerings of innovative forms of health care and to stifle the rise of almost every type of health care delivery that could potentially pose a threat to the income of fee-for-service physicians in private practice. The costs to the public in terms of less expensive <span class="col_2981-2982" refersTo="page_1515"/>or even more improved forms of medical services are great.</block>

<p>I want to state once again that this refers to the American situation. I am not implying that it refers to the South African situation.</p>

<p>I believe that the chiropractors have done everything asked of them within the limits of the legislation afforded them. If they are now expected further to improve their standards and service to the public whilst at the same time affording them better protection then they require an expanded legislative base from which to work. I believe that the Bill before us will give them such a base and is a step in the right direction. Therefore, we shall be supporting the Bill.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I should like to enquire from the hon. the Minister whether or not he is in agreement that these practitioners should be allowed to issue certificates to patients to remain away from their normal duties. Perhaps the hon. the Minister would care to comment in that regard.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cunningham">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. CUNNINGHAM</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the Bill before us covers a whole series of associated professions but I should like to confine myself today to that of chiropractor. To begin with, however, I wish to state that there appears to be a misunderstanding on the part of certain hon. members. This Bill is not authorizing the associated professions to begin practising all of a sudden. That has been done, for some time by the various Acts already on our Statute Book. Nor does this legislation open the register. It is merely a combination of all the previous Acts with, in addition, a provision that these professions will in future fall under one board. I really cannot see what those hon. members&#x2019; problems are. Surely they agree that it would be far better for control to be exercised over these practitioners than to continue with the present situation, in terms of which there is no overall control. There must be control and if the medical council does not wish to implement it then there must simply be some other form of overall control, and that is what this Bill provides for. The fuss that is being made now reminds me of the little boy who does not want a sucker stick because the stick is missing, but who cries bitterly when it is given to someone else because he did not get it.</p>

<p>Nor can I support the amendment of the hon. member for Parktown. We have been saddled with this problem for the past 10 years now, and we shall be saddled with it for the next 10 years too, unless we do something positive about it now. Perhaps what the hon. member really wants is that we should wait for another 10 to 20 years, by which time there will in any event be no chiropractors left to practise. Actually, I can understand why the hon. member for Pietersburg and his colleagues support the amendment. They are scared to death of anything that smells of co-responsibility or healthy power-sharing. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>About 11 years ago the register for registration as chiropractor was closed, and it was indicated that they as a profession would first have to get their own house in order before any further consideration whatsoever could be given to reopening the register. In my opinion, the chiropractors acted very courageously when they as a profession accepted that legislation since they could in fact have been digging their own grave by doing so. Since that time, the rift which occurred between the medical profession and the chiropractors has widened to the extent that one wonders what has taken place and it has led to the present feeling of what one could in fact call open hostility.</p>

<p>Allow me to illustrate this briefly. I have before me a circular from the Medical Association of South Africa in which it is stated that the Bill is a matter of the utmost importance to the medical profession and for the future of medicine and health services in the RSA. Together with the circular there is an extract from the <i>S.A. Medical Journal</i> of 21 October 1978 in which the policy of the S.A. Medical and Dental Council is clearly outlined&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die uitvoerende komitee van die Federate Raad van die Mediese Vereniging het dit gevolglik goedgeag dat die aangehegte memorandum warrin die MVSA se standpunt met betrekking tot chiropraktisyns, homeopate en so meer uiteengesit word vir inligting aan u gestuur word.</block>

<p>Their standpoint follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die standpunt van die Suid-Afrikaanse Geneeskundige en Tandheelkundige Raad <span class="col_2983-2984" refersTo="page_1516"/>ten opsigte van chiropraktyk word deur die Mediese Vereniging van Suid-Afrika gesteun en is deeglik uiteengesit in &#x2019;n be-sluit wat tydens 1967 deur die raad aan-vaar is. Uittreksels uit die dele van laasge-noemde besluit wat vir die mediese beroep van belang is, word aangehaal. Reël 9 van die Etiese Reëls of reëls be-treffende gedrag waarvan die raad kennis kan neem, stel die standpunt van die raad ten opsigte van die verhouding tussen ge-neeshere of tandartse aan die een kant en chiropraktisyns aan die ander kant baie duidelik. Dit lui soos volg&#x2014;</block>

<block name="quote">Niemand wat &#x2019;n mediese praktisyn is, kan iemand as &#x2019;n assistent of <i>locum tenens</i> in diens neem wat nie as geneesheer of tandarts na gelang van die geval geregistreer is nie, of heimlik of anders saamwerk met iemand wat nie aldus geregistreer is nie, of met enige sodanige persoon in vennootskap tree of sodanige persoon as betaalde narkotiseur of as betaalde assistent by &#x2019;n operasie in diens neem nie, met &#x2019;n persoon konsulteer wat nie as geneesheer of tandarts geregistreer is of hom op enige manier help of bystaan in sy onwettige praktyk nie. In geval &#x2019;n praktisyn in &#x2019;n ernstige noodgeval ingeroep word om &#x2019;n ongere-gistreerde persoon te help, moet hy die geval onmiddellik aan die raad rapporteer.</block>

<p>It is very important that we should note this, because I shall come back to it later&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Volgens die letter van hierdie reël kan daar hoegenaamd geen twyfel daaroor bestaan dat &#x2019;n geneesheer of tandarts wat op enige manier met &#x2019;n chiropraktisyn saamwerk, aan oortreding van die reëls skuldig is nie. &#x2019;n Chiropraktisyn is nie &#x2019;n geregistreerde geneesheer nie en daarom is samewerking met hom volgens reel 9 verbode. Omrede van sy valse teoretiese basis en sy gebrekkige opleiding kan dit nie van hom verwag word om te diagnoseer nie. Sy handeling berus dus nie op &#x2019;n logiese diagnose nie en kan nie verwag word om te slaag nie. Die raad verwerp enige soort kompromis met die chiropraktyk omdat daar sulke diepgaande basiese verskille tussen die mediese wetenskap en die chiropraktyk bestaan. As die geneeskunde reg is, is die chiropraktyk verkeerd, of omgekeerd. Die twee kan nie saamwerk nie. Die raad beskou die chiropraktyk as &#x2019;n gevaar vir die publiek en is van mening dat volgens artikel 34 van die Wet op Geneeshere, Tandartse en Aptekers (Wet No. 13 van 1928) chiropraktisyns die wet oortree. Die raad sal dit nie duld dat geneeshere of tandartse op sy registers met chiropraktisyns saamwerk nie.</block>

<p>And the poor patient is in the midst of this situation. Tens of thousands of Whites have made use of this service over the years and are still making use of it. What is somewhat insulting, however, is the message of the medical profession to these tens of thousands of people who consult chiropractors. The medical profession states that a large percentage of those people should either consult a psychologist or forget about their aches and pains, and that they will then disappear. I quote further from the circular&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die sukses wat aan die chiropraktyk toegeskryf word, is meestal &#x2019;n skynbare sukses en berus daarop dat &#x2019;n groot persentasie van simptome &#x2019;n sielkundige oorsaak het of aan fisieke toestande toe te skryf is wat spontaan verbeter, mits hulle die nodige tyd gegee word. Die werklike suksesse wat hulle soms behaal berus op die bekende en erkende feit dat manipulasie soms wel sekere pynlike toestande verbeter.</block>

<p>I think it is somewhat insulting for the Medical Council to put it in this way, because many hon. members of this House also consult chiropractors. Be that as it may, however, I have no intention of slighting the medical profession. On the contrary, I am sincerely grateful to them for what they do. Personally I have never consulted a chiropractor, and that side of the House will probably say that I should be grateful for that. However, thousands of people consult chiropractors, and I cannot believe that they can all be wrong. These people are prepared to pay thousands of rands for treatment by chiropractors, and I think that those people ought to enjoy that benefit. We must not deprive them of that service in future years by refusing to co-operate with chiropractors or <span class="col_2985-2986" refersTo="page_1517"/>keeping the registers closed. Whether or not pain has a psychological origin or disappears of itself, the fact remains that the patient gains relief after treatment by the chiropractor.</p>

<p>In my opinion, chiropractors and other associated professions have a right to exist in this part of the world, just as they do in several other parts of the world. The chiropractors want to get their own house in order and are therefore in favour of this legislation.</p>

<p>There are one or two clauses of the Bill that should be elucidated for the sake of clarity. The first clause to which I refer is clause 32(1)(a) which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">a practitioner or student shall not&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(vi) pretend, or by any means whatsoever hold himself out, to be a medical practitioner, or make use of the title of medical practitioner or doctor or any other title or any name, description or symbol indicating, or calculated to lead persons to infer, that he holds the qualification of a medical practitioner.</li>

</ol>

<p>To me, the issue here is the use of the word &#x201C;doctor&#x201D; and the question is whether the practitioner may use the abbreviation &#x201C;Dr.&#x201D; on his letterheads or signboard. The title &#x201C;Dr.&#x201D; is not reserved for the medical profession. On the contrary, several of our colleagues in this House are fully entitled to lay claim to the title of doctor, even though they are not medical practitioners. The training of the majority of chiropractors&#x2014;and, I believe, of the other associated professions as well&#x2014;is such that it is equal to matric plus several years of further training. The doctor&#x2019;s degree in chiropractice is awarded to persons after they have completed their studies and sat successfully for examinations. Therefore they, too, are entitled to lay claim to the title of &#x201C;Dr.&#x201D; just as is anyone else who has studied for five or six years at an overseas university in whatever field. Persons who have studied at overseas universities in physical education, psychology or any other field, use that title. In my opinion the chiropractor is equally entitled to use the title of &#x201C;Dr.&#x201D; as long as he indicates that he is a doctor in the profession of chiropractice.</p>

<p>The second paragraph which may require elucidation is that providing that an intravenal blood sample may not be taken and that human blood may not be analysed. A subdivision of the training of chiropractors specifically involves laboratory diagnosis and this is specifically concerned with the fundamental interpretation and correlation of laboratory tests. The chiropractors are wholly in favour of such a restriction in the legislation, but rightly argue that it is often in their patient&#x2019;s interest that such tests be done. They would welcome co-operation with the medical profession, except that the South African Medical and Dental Council prohibits this in terms of rule 92. I think it is in the interest of the patient, too, that we seek a solution in this regard.</p>

<p>If something tangible is not done about the lot of the chiropractor, I fear the profession will die out. There is no doubt that they perform a service. The number of their patients alone attests to that. This legislation which now seeks to regulate and standardize that profession on an orderly basis could not have come at a more appropriate time. We look forward to further proposals from the envisaged board. We hope they may at some time in the future come forward with proposals which will once again pump the lifeblood back into this profession, so that members who have undergone the highest level of training may once again be afforded the opportunity to practise in the Republic.</p>

<p>The major argument that chiropractors supposedly diagnose wrongly could perhaps still have been accepted if hundreds of complaints had been received from medical practitioners about this group of practitioners. But this has never been adduced by the council as evidence to prove their contention of incorrect diagnosis. Perhaps there have been a few exceptions in this profession, certain practitioners who have indeed acted wrongfully. However, this also occurs among other medical practitioners. We need only recall the medical practitioner who was fined or goaled recently&#x2014;I cannot quite remember which&#x2014;due to the bleeding to death of a woman in labour. There are such cases. However, why should we try to make a rule on the basis of one exception? Just as the Medical Council disciplines and penalizes the medical practitioners who break the rules, the envisaged board will also deal with <span class="col_2987-2988" refersTo="page_1518"/>its practitioners if there are rules that are infringed.</p>

<p>We all know that there are still medical practitioners who, notwithstanding the prohibition, continue to maintain close links with chiropractors and others. Accordingly I wish to make an urgent appeal to the S.A. Medical and Dental Council to recognize the existence of this profession, as is done in several other parts of the world, and by so doing co-operate in the interests of all patients in this country. We can all only benefit if medical practitioners are allowed to liaise openly and on a professional basis with these practitioners in the future.</p>

<p>In my opinion the rift is so wide at the moment that the group of chiropractors will not in my opinion be interested&#x2014;they would in the past have been prepared to do so&#x2014;to link up with the S.A. Medical and Dental Council. In view of the animosity which has prevailed among the two and which still exists on the part of the Medical and Dental Council, they can only recognize at this stage that if they link up, they will be slowly strangled to death.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to deal firstly with the hon. member for South Coast. He had a complete failure of comprehension. [Interjections.] He asked what he obviously thought was $64 000 question of the Opposition: Do doctors send people to chiropractors? That is what he wanted answered by the official Opposition. Of course doctors send people to chiropractors. In fact, they say that as far as therapy is concerned, chiropractors can do very useful work. As far as therapy is concerned, however, masseurs can also do very useful work, but I do not think that anybody would suggest that a masseur was a professional person with professional training. A person with an infra-red lamp can probably do some therapeutic work, but he is not a professional with professional training.</p>

<p>May I just deal with what the hon. member for Stilfontein said. He advocates control over chiropractic and other related activities. So do we. Even now there is control under the law. He also advocates that chiropractors should be allowed to use the title of &#x201C;doctor&#x201D; if they have a number of years of training at one of the overseas universities where training is provided in chiropractics. I wonder whether any hon. member on that side of the House can tell us of one, just one, reputable university, say in the USA, where such courses are given.

<p>The real question is what we must do about this Bill. In his introduction the hon. the Minister said that the Medical Association&#x2019;s opinion, after the draft Bill was published in the <i>Government Gazette,</i> was that these activities should be controlled by the S.A. Medical and Dental Council. Then he pointed out that the Medical Council, having considered this matter, reached a strong and clear consensus that the practices of these people were not based on scientific grounds. The hon. member for Stilfontein says that the diagnoses of these people have the same value as that of doctors. He says sometimes doctors may be wrong and sometimes chiropractors may be wrong. I could hardly believe what I heard from the hon. member for Stilfontein. Do we in South Africa say that our doctors have scientific training, or not? Clearly, we believe that our doctors have scientific training. Clearly, that is what we propound and what we want. If our doctors say that these people have no scientific training, what are we to say? Must we say the doctors are lying, or that they do not know what they are talking about? Are we then to say that the chiropractors do have scientific training? I should like to hear from the hon. the Minister, when he replies to the debate, whether he says that chiropractors, herbalists, osteopaths and homeopaths have scientific training.</p>

<speech by="#pitman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. PITMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am asking the hon. the Minister a question. I shall tell him just now what it has to do with the Bill. I shall tell him what it has to do with the Bill but I should like an answer to that question. The name of the Bill, for a start, is &#x201C;Associated Health Service Professions Bill&#x201D;. I understand a profession to be something that at least has a basis in real learning. A profession in this sphere of activity, a profession in medicine, must at least be based on some scientific learning. That is implied in the very name of the Bill before we even get to the contents.</p>

<p>I should now like to address myself specifically to the hon. the Minister. When it considered the matter, the Medical Council said that these activities were not related to medical and other professions covered by the Act, largely because they were unscientific, and that it did not want to be associated&#x2014;the hon. the Minister said that in his speech&#x2014;or co-operate with these activities, &#x201C;with the so-called associated health professions&#x201D;, to quote the hon. the Minister and the Medical Council. As I say, it is clear that the Medical Council does not regard these practices as health professions. Hon. members on that side of the House have suggested that the Medical Council has some kind of mercenary interest in preventing these people from practising.</p>

<p>Let us, however, put the Medical Council and the Medical Association to one side and let us look at the commission of inquiry instituted by the Government into these activities. That commission of inquiry, finally instituted by the State President, on 19 October 1962 found in regard to chiropractics, firstly, that chiropractics was not a useful or necessary complement to the ordinary medical services.</p>

<speech by="#pitman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. PITMAN</person>:</from>

<p>That is the point I want to deal with later, and I am very glad the hon. member raised it. The commission of inquiry did, however, say that in the case where chiropractics was used for manipulated therapy, it was useful, but that it should be confined to that activity. Secondly, it pointed out that chiropractic held dangers to health, for two reasons. I am not propounding my theory now but that of the commission of inquiry. The first reason was that chiropractics lacked diagnostic knowledge or expertise in the field of diagnosis.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#vlok">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. J. VLOK</person>:</from>

<p>Just leave the chiropractors to the doctors, and confine yourself rather to things you know something about.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pitman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. PITMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I think the hon. member for Verwoerdburg probably should go to a chiropractor or probably it would be better for him to go to a herbalist. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The second reason given by the commission of inquiry for saying that the chiropractic profession held dangers to health was the general belief that all illness originated in the spinal factor. That is what chiropractors believe. They believe that bubonic plague, for instance, originates in the spinal factor.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#geldenhuys">

<p>Now you are talking nonsense.</p>

<speech by="#pitman">

</speech>

<speech by="#geldenhuys">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. GELDENHUYS</person>:</from>

<p>Did the commission refer to bubonic plague?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pitman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. PITMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Perhaps I ought to enlighten the hon. member by telling him that the commission found that according to chiropractors all ills arose out of the spinal factor.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#geldenhuys">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. GELDENHUYS</person>:</from>

<p>So you choose bubonic plague?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pitman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. PITMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Precisely, to illustrate the unscientific nature of the practice.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the commission of inquiry found that no statutory recognition ought to be given to chiropractics as a profession. It actually considered whether a conditional recognition ought not to be given to chiropractics, but eventually it came to the conclusion that such recognition should not be given because chiropractors had unequivocally expressed <span class="col_2991-2992" refersTo="page_1520"/>their opposition to any kind of limitation on their activities. That is how matters stood.</p>

<p>I now come to the point the hon. member for Stilfontein raised a few moments ago when he said &#x201C;That was 20 years ago.&#x201D; He is correct. That is how matters stood for 20 years, and now suddenly the hon. the Minister comes with this Bill. According to the S.A. Medical Association, in a letter that I have here, the hon. the Minister published this Bill without consulting or even giving notice to the S.A. Medical Council. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; daar nie eens met die S.A. Geneeskundige en Tandheelkundige Raad in hierdie verband geraadpleeg is of aan die raad kennis gegee is van die voomeme om sodanige wetsontwerp te publiseer nie.</block>

<p>So why does the hon. the Minister do this now?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#barnard">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. S. BARNARD</person>:</from>

<p>He is being manipulated.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pitman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. PITMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The Medical Association says that they find his behaviour strange and worrying, and they actually directed a letter in very strong terms to the Director-General of the Department of Health and Welfare, setting out their opposition to the Bill in detail. But the hon. the Minister simply went ahead in spite of this letter. Why? In that letter the Medical Association said that the description &#x201C;associated health service professions&#x201D; was unacceptable as it would be interpreted by people and by the other health professions as an indication that chiropractic, homeopathics, etc., were health professions, while in the association&#x2019;s opinion they are not. The association indicated that it was unacceptable to refer to them as professions. Why then does the hon. the Minister fly in the face of the medical profession? Does he have contempt for them like the hon. the Minister of Justice has for judges? The hon. the Minister said in his Second Reading speech that he had to control the conduct of practitioners. That was the reason he gave.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cunningham">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. CUNNINGHAM</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, on a point of order: Is the hon. member allowed to say: &#x201C;The hon. the Minister of Justice has contempt for judges&#x201D;?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pitman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. PITMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I withdraw it, Mr. Speaker. [Interjections.] The reason given by the hon. the Minister is that he has to control these people in their professions. I want to state that we have no objection to the hon. the Minister exercising control over them. We do indeed welcome that control. We support that control. The S.A. Medical and Dental Council also supports that control of these people. The question is, however, why they should be called health professions. The criticism of the S.A. Medical and Dental Council in this regard is completely and contemptuously disregarded.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>By a doctor of all people, you know.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pitman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. PITMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that is done by the hon. the Minister who is himself a medical doctor. This Bill is a vote of no confidence in the S.A. Medical and Dental Council. This Bill is a vote of no confidence in the S.A. Medical Association. As has been said in this debate there is no scientific training for these people in South Africa. There is also no professional training for them in South Africa. Why then give them the legal power in terms of this Bill to administer subcutaneous and intramuscular injections? Why should a herbalist have such power? That is trifling with South Africa&#x2019;s health services.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to make it very clear that we on this side of the House have no objections to people who have skill in spinal manipulation to practise such skill. We also have no objection to making a practice of it as a therapy, provided that those who do practise these skills refrain from claiming diagnostic expertise. We also welcome control over people who practise these skills. We have no objection to herbalists, osteopaths, homeopaths, etc., practising their skills. We welcome that and we welcome the control <span class="col_2993-2994" refersTo="page_1521"/>over them as well. We do not even object to people reading other people&#x2019;s palms in order to tell them what their health condition is. We do not even object to witch-doctors throwing their bones. They may practise their arts and they may be controlled. To make some of these people, however, part of South Africa&#x2019;s health department&#x2019;s professions is laughable.</p>

<p>Finally, we should like to know what has happened since the time of the commission of inquiry. What has happened since the S.A. Medical and Dental Council brought out their report? What has happened since the Medical Association of South Africa wrote their letter? What has happened to change the position? What new evidence has the hon. the Minister received? What new evidence has he obtained? What new facts has he obtained which caused him to put this Bill before the House? Why has he not told us what new facts he has and what new evidence he has obtained? He should have told us all these things in his Second Reading speech. The hon. the Minister owes a duty to the people of South Africa. It is his duty to play open cards with them. So far, however, he has not done so. Therefore we maintain that this Bill must go to a Select Committee.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#alant">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. ALANT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to support the Second Reading of this Bill. Like hon. members who have spoken before me, I too want to confine myself chiefly to remarks about chiropractic.</p>

<p>However, first of all I should like to react briefly to the hon. member for Pinetown. He challenged us to give the names of colleges where chiropractors are trained. I want to give him a good few names. In the first place there is the Los Angeles College of Chiropractors, in California. Then there is also the National College of Chiropractors, in Illinois, as well as the North Western College of Chiropractors, in St. Paul, the Texas Chiropractors College, in Pasadena, Texas. There are many more too. I have a very long list of names of such colleges.</p>

<p>As far as the scientific nature of the training is concerned, I just want to point out that in the USA&#x2014;and most of our people have been trained there&#x2014;two years of training at an approved university institution is required before entrance to a college for chiropractic is possible. The two years of training consists of two phases. Anatomy is studied in the first year, and 640 hours are devoted to this. A total of 320 hours are devoted to a study of physiology. 320 hours are also devoted to the study of chemistry, whilst pathology and bacteriology require 480 hours. Hygiene, sanitation and public health account for 80 hours of study. I just want to ask whether these are not scientific subjects. In phase two subjects like physical, clinical, laboratory and differential diagnosis are studied and gynaecology, paediatrics, etc. I just want to know whether these are not scientific subjects as well. According to my information they are. In any event the hon. member for Pinetown&#x2019;s argument was so weak that if I ever required legal aid, I would know who not to consult.</p>

<p>I want to say a few things about the history of chiropractic. The earliest references to manipulative therapy are to be found in rock art unearthed in the south of France, and that dates back to approximately the 17500 B.C. Chinese references to manipulation from about 2700 years B.C. are also on record. Greek papyrus that deals with this therapy, dates back to approximately 1500 years B.C. It is true that references to spinal manipulation disappeared during the Middle Ages, but during the Renaissance period this practice apparently began to flourish again.</p>

<p>Earlier in this debate mention was made of the fact that a certain Daniel David Palmer laid doen the foundation for modern chiropractic in 1895. Today there is a very general acceptance amongst the general public of the therapeutic value of this manipulative therapy.</p>

<p>For many years chiropractors have been attempting to be recognized and accepted as members of the established team rendering medical services. However, it is equally true that the organized medical profession in the Republic of South Africa is opposing this striving on grounds that at first sight appear to be logical and responsible. I repeat: On grounds that at first sight appear to be logical and responsible. The debate between the chiropractors and the organized medical profession is unfortunately accompanied by a great deal of emotion.</p>

<p>To begin with I want to express my very high respect and appreciation towards the <span class="col_2995-2996" refersTo="page_1522"/>medical profession, and nothing that I may raise further on in my speech, is aimed at detracting in any event from my respect for this profession.</p>

<p>Over a long period I have read a great deal about chiropractic. I have also obtained a newspaper cutting from a morning newspaper of 26 October 1981 which I feel briefly summarizes the essence of this debate. I quote from it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Onwetenskaplikheid is die term en rede wat deur die Mediese Raad as beswaar aangevoer word teen enige erkenning van die geassosieerde beroepe. Praktisyns in di&#x00E9; beroepe voel egter heel anders hieroor.</block>

<p>I now quote what was said by Dr. A. G. Till, the secretary of the Chiropractic Association of South Africa, according to this report, viz.&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ons verwerp die aantyging dat ons gesondheidsbeoefening t&#x00E9; onwetenskaplik is. Ons opleiding is wetenskaplik, ons navorsing is ook wetenskaplik en die bevindinge daarvan word in wetenskaptydskrifte en mediese joernale gepubliseer. Dit is sulke dinge wat die professie wetenskaplik maak. Die Mediese Raad se besluit om nie met die beroepe geassosieer te word nie, kan ook nie aanvaar word nie. In ander lande, soos Amerika, Nieu-Seeland, Kanada en Australië, is die kode van die mediese rade so gewysig dat dit voorsiening maak vir die aanverwante beroepe. Daar skort niks met ander lande se mediese rade nie. &#x201C;Hoekom wil die Suid-Afrikaanse Raad, wat op ander gebiede met hulle ooreenstem, nie ook op di&#x00E9; gebied toegee nie? Nog &#x2019;n ding wat krap, is dat prof. Guy de Klerk, die Voorsitter van die Mediese Vereniging, verlede week &#x2026;</block>

<p>That was in October last year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; in &#x2019;n radiopraatjie gesê het dat chiropraktisyns wel deur die mediese beroep erken word mits hulle bereid is om as aanvullende beroepe, soos byvoorbeeld fisioterapeute, in te skakel. Di&#x00E9; siening is teenstrydig. Aan die een kant sê hulle ons is onwetenskaplik en aan die ander kant is hulle bereid om di&#x00E9; wetenskaplikheid as &#x2019;n deel van die mediese span te erken.</block>

<p>Now it is true that I am a scientist myself and I should like to ask for hon. members&#x2019; attention in connection with certain ideas regarding the term &#x201C;scientific nature&#x201D; or &#x201C;unscientific nature&#x201D;. In the first instance I want to say with all due respect that no science or profession may claim the monopoly of trying to pass judgment on what is in fact scientific and what is not. If one delves into the history of any of our modern professions one will in fact find mistakes in the actions of the profession. One will also encounter faulty practices that were implemented in those professions over a number of years. It is true that a highly respected profession such as the medical profession has also undergone its development. I want to draw hon. members&#x2019; attention to the work of William Harvey. He published his famous textbook in 1628 and in it he revealed for the first time the true nature of the circulation of the blood and of the function of the heart as a pump. This had not been known previously. Should we then say that everyone who had been involved in the medical profession from the earliest time to that stage, had been unscientific? After all, they did as best as they possibly could. I also want to tell you that Louis Pasteur who lived from 1822 to 1895 proved for the first time that micro-organisms caused fermentation and disease. Before Louis Pasteur&#x2019;s time&#x2014;and this is known from writings&#x2014;it was the custom of doctors&#x2014;it was not forbidden&#x2014;to work on cadavers and immediately after that, without even disinfecting their hands because they did not know anything about disinfectants then, to attend women in labour and of course the mortality rate was extremely high. Can one hold this against the medical practice of today? Surely not.</p>

<p>In my opinion the scientific nature of a profession can be measured according to the profession&#x2019;s reaction and adjustments when new scientific facts come to light.</p>

<p>It is definitely true that in recent years incorrect practices were still carried out by chiropractors but I feel that modern chiropractic has been purged of those practices. Today it deals only with the manipulation of the spinal column.</p>

<p><span class="col_2997-2998" refersTo="page_1523"/>I should like to quote certain things from a report that was submitted to Parliament in New Zealand in 1979 by a commission of inquiry into chiropractic in New Zealand. This commission was appointed by His Excellency the Governor-General of New Zealand. I want to say at once that one must be careful not to quote selectively from reports. However, hon. members will concede that I will not be able to quote the entire report, but I want to try in all fairness&#x2014;because I am not involved, I am not a medical practitioner&#x2014;to make a contribution in this regard in the interest of the voters outside. In all fairness I want to say that I read through this report quickly, that I deliberated upon it at length and that I chose certain sections to give hon. members an indication of the findings of this specific commission.</p>

<p>I want to quote from &#x201C;Part I&#x2014;Introductory: Introduction and general conclusion&#x201D;. This is the first chapter. The first point that is made, is the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This report follows an extended inquiry which developed into probably the most comprehensive and detailed independent examination of chiropractic ever undertaken in any country.</block>

<p>[Interjections.] This was in 1979. I also want to quote the tenth point of the introduction. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">By the end of the inquiry we found ourselves irresistibly and with complete unanimity drawn to the conclusion that modern chiropractic is a soundly based and valuable branch of health care in a specialized area neglected by the medical profession.</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#geldenhuys">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. GELDENHUYS</person>:</from>

<p>Surely that proves that the hon. members opposite are wrong.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#alant">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. ALANT</person>:</from>

<p>I read further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If properly controlled, it is worthy of public confidence and support. Health and accident compensation benefits should be made available within the limit we defined and discussed for chiropractic treatment.</block>

<p>I also want to quote a few of the most important findings of the commission. The first general finding under the heading &#x201C;General&#x201D; to which I want to draw attention, is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Modern chiropractic is far from being an unscientific cult.</block>

<p>I quote one more of these&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Spinal therapy in the hands of a registered chiropractor is safe.</block>

<p>Furthermore, I also want to quote a few things from findings regarding the relationship between chiropractic and the medical profession. I quote from the section entitled &#x201C;Chiropractic and the Medical Profession&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the public interest and in the interests of patients there must be no impediment to full professional co-operation between chiropractors and medical practitioners.</block>

<p>We all accept this, I hope. Then&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The display of the title &#x201C;Doctor&#x201D; by a chiropractor who is not a registered medical practitioner should be strictly limited.</block>

<p>I think this finding is in agreement with the particular provision in the Bill.</p>

<p>Then, under the heading &#x201C;Professional Organization&#x201D;, the first finding that I want to quote is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Chiropractic Act, 1960 &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is an Act in New Zealand&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; should be administered by the Department of Health.</block>

<p>I read on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The disciplinary machinery and the disciplinary standards applicable to New Zealand chiropractors need thorough overhaul.</block>

<p>Therefore the commission says that the disciplinary machinery must be improved, but they do not find fault with the scientific basis of chiropractic. The Bill is in fact aimed as improving the disciplinary machinery. <span class="col_2999-3000" refersTo="page_1524"/>In this respect we are in line with the findings of this important commission in New Zealand.</p>

<p>The Bill contains no new principles. It is largely a consolidating measure, because five Acts are being replaced by means of the Bill, as well as a certain section of a sixth Act. Provision is being made in the Bill for a council with disciplinary powers. This is heading towards the improvement of the discipline, as I say, of this profession.</p>

<p>In this respect I find it a pity that we are still at the point where opening the register is not possible. I want to express the hope that it will soon be possible to open the register for these very useful people in society.</p>

<speech by="#veldman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. H. VELDMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to speak after the hon. member for Pretoria East. Before discussing a few matters regarding the Bill in general, I want to dwell on a few minor matters touched on by the hon. member for Pinetown. Apparently the hon. member does not understand what the Bill is about. Surely the issue here is not the training or method of diagnosis and all that this entails in respect of chiropractors and the other people we are now discussing. Surely what is at issue is the existence of a group of people pursuing a certain profession, and we must do something about them. This is all that is at issue, and nothing more. About this we must have absolute clarity. The hon. member feels that this is all very well &#x201C;but why call them health professions?&#x201D; He referred <i>inter alia</i> to masseurs and argued as if masseurs formed part of the group he did not consider very important and that he wanted to associate with chiropractors. I think if the hon. member goes into this matter he will find that masseurs are also included in &#x201C;health professions&#x201D; and are classed as a health profession under the auspices of the Medical Council. We must not overlook this point.</p>

<p>It is not unusual for new legislation or amending legislation to be in the pipeline for many years before being discussed in Parliament. The legislation at present before this House is a very good example of a thorny issue that is now receiving the attention of this House after the pros and cons have been very carefully weighed up. This legislation has received the attention of four different Ministers over the years, and on several occasions this matter has been discussed at length. At times one even had the feeling that there was an unwillingness to handle this hot patato. However, the point has been reached where the hon. the Minister felt that something had to be done about the affairs of these people who are pursuing a specific profession. Accordingly, in this legislation only the continued existence of these people as a profession is at issue and nothing more.</p>

<p>On the one hand we have the medical profession which, through its representative bodies, has a very clear standpoint regarding the professions under discussion. We have heard the standpoint of the medical profession repeatedly since the investigations undertaken in the sixties and again two years ago. The medical profession and its representative bodies have been building up the image of their profession over the years, and we in this House would be the last to seek to detract from it. We are proud of the way in which our medical practitioners carry out a demanding task and of the standard maintained by the medical profession in this country. If the standard of practice of the medical profession and the recognized associated professions is so high&#x2014;and this is in fact the case&#x2014;then it is understandable that they will jealously guard against anything being done to upset the <i>status quo.</i> This is the standpoint of the medical practitioners.</p>

<p>On the other hand there is Parliament that must pass laws to regulate matters; in this case, to regulate certain matters relating to these professions. Parliament must look after the interests of the interested parties, and I am convinced that the hon. the Minister, as executive officer, seeks to and in fact does look after the interests of everyone affected by his actions extremely well. The hon. the Minister frequently has to act in difficult and trying situations and he very often has an unenviable task.</p>

<p>Between the medical practitioners on the one hand and the lawmakers on the other we have a group of people who belong to a health profession. The hon. member for Pinetown would prefer the term health profession to be in quotes.</p>

<p>I now want to refer more specifically to the chiropractors, about whom I know more and with whom, what is more, I frequently had dealings when I was still in private practice. When we speak of this group of people, <span class="col_3001-3002" refersTo="page_1525"/>we are not speaking about thousands of people. We are speaking about a small group of people who, as has already been pointed out, have an important and very definite place in the health set-up. These people are visited every year by almost one million patients&#x2014;this is the most recent figure. We cannot therefore merely disregard these people. They do exist and every year they see almost one million patients. Accordingly, by means of this legislation we want to regulate those aspects of their profession that are not yet regulated. They have treated patients who can testify that they have been helped, and there is no doubt about this either. Probably there are failures&#x2014;in fact there may be many failures&#x2014; and we could probably say a great deal regarding their methods of examination and treatment and the success they achieve, etc., but the fact remains that there are people who are visited by an increasing number of patients who are afforded help and relief as a result of the treatment they receive. This is not, therefore, a group of people who have suddenly appeared on the scene as a result of legislation. These people have already gained a place among the medical professions through legislation passed by this Parliament prior to the seventies. We even speak of associated health professions. We therefore acknowledge that they participate, that their profession is an associated profession and that they therefore have a share in the duties carried out by the medical profession.</p>

<p>Are you serious?</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. H. VELDMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I prefer the term &#x201C;supplementary health profession&#x201D; to &#x201C;associated health profession&#x201D;, because I think this says more, but I shall not pursue this matter.</p>

<p>For many years we have been able to testify to the fact that these people made a very honest effort to gain statutory recognition, and whatever one&#x2019;s opinion of the profession may be, we can nevertheless say with conviction that we have a high regard for the way in which they have stated their case, where necessary, and the numbers of the profession can certainly be proud of their spokesmen. This we can confirm. The finding of the commission of enquiry in the days of a former Minister of Health, Dr. Hertzog, is history to which reference has repeatedly been made here. We also know that these findings of the commission were evaluated two years ago and that the Medical Association adopted a negative standpoint.</p>

<p>It is also history that in the &#x2019;seventies, representations were again made by the chiropractors in an effort to gain statutory recognition, and the direction issued to them by the then Minister was: Put your own house in order and then we shall discuss matters further. This House cannot therefore, hold it against those people, who were in that position, if they inferred from that that if they did what was expected of them, they could consider the freezing of the register to be a temporary measure only. After all, they then did what was expected of them. They only entered &#x201C;qualified&#x201D; members on their register. They also drew up a code of conduct to which members were to be subject and what is more, in the process the names of 70 so-called quacks were removed from their register. Now we have eventually summoned up enough courage to introduce this legislation. It is therefore necessary that we should state categorically, for each one of these professions to hear, that the only point at issue is the establishment of a statutory body, a board, that will control the practice of various professions as mentioned in the Bill. Nothing more is at issue. If, then, the next step is to compel the members of the disciplines under discussion to adopt, <i>inter alia,</i> medico-ethical acceptable basic training and practice, surely we cannot oppose this. With reference to what the hon. member for Pretoria East said, it is then also important that we see this as a process of development, similar to the process of development that the medical profession went through. We must therefore compel them, in this orderly fashion, to adopt medico-ethical, acceptable basic training and practise. Surely we shall then be achieving what we set out do do. This is in line with the generally acceptable policy of the Department of Health and Welfare and the Government that every possible acceptable health services profession must be incorporated in an all-encompassing service for the sake of the health of the people of this country.</p>

<p>I do not want to cross swords with my colleagues in the medical profession. It must <span class="col_3003-3004" refersTo="page_1526"/>be quite clear to the South African Medical Association that what is at issue here is the establishment of a statutory body that can only exercise control and impose disciplinary measures, and that what evolves from this as regards training, diagnosis and everything this entails, can still be discussed. In view of that I just want to ask, with all due respect, whether the standpoint of the S.A. Medical Association in respect of this Bill is not biased. I want to repeat that we in fact want to establish a statutory body to exercise control and regulate matters. In fact, we want to create a board which can take disciplinary action when regulations are infringed. We specifically want to ensure that a board will be established that will compel members to act within the specific parameters of their profession. Surely this is what we want and this is what we will get by means of this board. The board will eventually have to draw up training requirements. I believe that the board will be able to play a very important role and that it will look after the interests of its people whose position, rightly or wrongly, is being questioned in our health services set-up. We must also point out that requirements and regulations drawn up by such a board, will be considered by the hon. the Minister as they come to hand, in the interests of good service. The hon. the Minister can, at his discretion, go further and subject the rules and regulations and everything they entail, to further evaluation by having them tested by the HSRC or the Medical Research Council. I want to appeal to the medical profession and their representative bodies to reconsider this matter.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I just want to say that I feel that the aforementioned health professions should eventually all be administered by the S.A. Medical and Dental Council, together with a lengthy list of health professions, including, <i>inter alia,</i> chiropodists&#x2014;if the hon. member for Pinetown has in-growing toenails he can consult them&#x2014;opticians, masseurs, optometrists, blood transfusion technicians, etc. I feel that in the interests of medical services in this country all these professions must be regulated and must eventually all fall under a single body. The board which is to be established must also realize that it will have to see to it that members of the professions it represents will only achieve a fully-fledged place in the ranks of the medical health professions if they meet the high requirements that will be set. I believe that this will be the case. Some of these people were trained as chiropractors, but as a result of the legal provision of 1971 they are still not part of the service and may not practise. I believe that pressure exerted by them will probably increase and that their position may have to be reconsidered. The board that is to be established may possibly also be able to recommend that in exceptionally deserving cases such chiropractors be allowed to practise. We shall probably have to take this into account in the future, because these people are justified in saying that they considered the 1971 measure to be temporary.</p>

<p>I take pleasure in supporting the legislation.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH AND WELFARE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to reply to a very long and interesting debate. Very interesting aspects emerged, although some of them were completely irrelevant and had nothing to do with the legislation before us. On the hand there were contributions which were very well argued and properly prepared. It is very clear to me that some of the hon. members who participated in the debate, did not have the foggiest notion of what this legislation was all about. I am referring specifically to the hon. member for Pinetown now. I wish to caution this hon. member to be very careful. He is an advocate, and a cobbler should stick to his last. I think that he was fed with certain information, on the basis of which he made a speech here, a speech which clearly showed that he had not done any homework. Perhaps he did do a little work on it this morning, but he had certainly done none for yesterday evening; if he had, he would have faired better. He realizes this himself; that is why he is laughing so furtively in his bench over there. [Interjections.] The hon. member referred to a report which had been published in 1962, and wanted to know what had happened since then. Nothing, he said, until I suddenly introduced the legislation here. However, the hon. member is not even aware that the Chiropractors Act was passed in 1971 and the Homeopaths Act in 1974. Surely the hon. member must know about them, or is he hearing about them for the first time <span class="col_3005-3006" refersTo="page_1527"/>now? [Interjections.] He said that 20 years had elapsed, and wanted to know what had happened in the meantime. However, I shall return to the hon. member, because he put a few specific questions to me, to which I wish to reply.</p>

<p>I wish to thank the hon. member for Rustenburg for his contribution. He debated in a calm and peaceful <i>(rustige)</i> manner, probably because he is the hon. member for Rustenburg! As a doctor he approached the matter from a professional point of view, and did not allow himself to be stampeded by hon. members on the Opposition side. He was prepared to live and let live. He summed up the purpose of this legislation very aptly by saying that it was concerned with the establishment of a statutory body. The legislation does not deal with the question of whether or not a chiropractor has been well-trained. It does not prescribe whether or not he may administer an injection. Provisions of this nature are already contained in existing laws, and in terms of such laws a chiropractor may administer an injection. I was not responsible for those laws, but it is my task to administer them.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rustenburg raised a point to which other hon. members also referred. It is my endeavour to bring everything concerned with the weal and woe of a person, including his psyche, under one council, which has to ensure that the conduct towards the patient is at all times correct. After all, the hon. member for Parktown and the hon. member for Pietersburg were not appointed to act as the Don Quixotes of the patient. All medical practitioners are involved with their patients, and that is what this legislation is concerned with. At present there are no measures in terms of which proper discipline may be exercised in respect of chiropractors, and these matters are constantly being referred to the department. Surely the department cannot be constantly involved in disciplinary measures, in the composition of boards and the appointment of people to do certain things. Surely people must regulate their own affairs. Initially I was completely astounded at the reaction of the hon. member for Parktown. He is a very well-known medical man, who is probably at the top of his profession. But what did he do? He quoted here what someone had said about chiropractors in 1885. These he then considered to be unscientific. Not many years ago people had completely different ideas about the heart than they have today. They thought that the heart was the seat of love. They thought that heartache was caused by the heart being hurt when a person went through a shocking experience. But what happened? Prof. Chris Barnard removed the heart from one person and transplanted it to another, after which he told the world that there was nothing situated in the heart, that it was merely a pump. The heart is merely a pump. Who would at that time, then, long before the Anglo Boer War, have thought that a person would ever operate on an open heart, while it was still beating? Or even more incredible, who would have thought at the time that the heart could even be stopped while an operation was performed on it? Or does the hon. member for Parktown now wish to suggest that at that time people were not scientifically minded enough? Does he wish to suggest that people should at that time, by way of legislation, have prohibited anyone from ever touching the human heart? Surely one cannot argue in that way. Every day brings new things.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pretoria East pointed out how far back the roots of our medical science are situated. In every generation new things emerged. Just think of all the things that are being done today. Think of all the injections which are being used today. Even radio-active scanners are being used. Surely these are things we had not even dreamed about five years ago. In this way things keep on improving. So how can one fall back on certain things which people said 20 years ago, in 1962.</p>

<p>I am not here to make a plea for chiropractors. However, we must tell nothing but the truth in this House. The hon. member for Pinetown wanted to know from me what recognized colleges or universities were providing these people with training. I do not know whether the hon. member is aware of this, but chiropractors are accredited with the Department of Education in America. Chiropractors are being trained at 14 colleges in America. They undergo a six year course. Some of those courses are so widely recognized that chiropractors may even switch over and continue with medical training. Did the hon. member for Pinetown know that?</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinetown proposed that the Bill be referred to a Select Committee. What is the sense of a Select Committee? The hon. member for Parktown and the hon. member for Pinetown, as well as the hon. member for Pietersburg of course, decried me for allegedly walking all over the Medical Association of South Africa and the S.A.

<p>Sometimes the hon. member for Pinetown also makes the front page, but for other reasons. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Let us see what these two bodies are doing. The one is a statutory body, i.e. the S.A. Medical and Dental Council. I have every confidence in that council, but surely it is not my task to consult the S.A. Medical and Dental Council every time I wish to act administratively in my department. The same applies to the Medical Association of South Africa. Allow me to explain to hon. members the procedure I adopt when I wish to introduce legislation here. When legislation has to be introduced after I have received representations, and if it is legislation which affects doctors, I consult the Medical Association of South Africa for a long time before matters are ultimately disposed of. However, when it affects other bodies, for example these bodies which approach me, bodies which have their own associations, extensive talks take place with them before we proceed to take further action. In the present case the matter was at one stage discussed over and over again. After that we published a draft Bill. That draft Bill was published 15 months ago. When the draft Bill was published, we asked for comments on it, which we received. I went even further. The hon. member for Parktown quoted from a letter written to the Director-General by the Medical Association. But that letter is ancient history. Subsequently there was considerable further exchange of letters. There were interviews too, one after another. I am not going to quote again what they said in <span class="col_3009-3010" refersTo="page_1529"/>the letter. The hon. member has already quoted it. In it they express their misgivings at the legislation, and at that stage they asked for an interview. On 2 June 1981 I had an interview with the executive committee of the Federal Council, during which we discussed the matter. They had the idea that this legislation now opened the list for the chiropractors to get on to the register. But that is not true, and I pointed this out to them. Since we are quoting letters to one another, let us see what really happened. I conducted a long interview with these people and we had an in-depth discussion of the whole matter. When I received this letter on 26 June, I thought that the matter had been resolved. Would hon. members not also have thought the same if they had received this letter? The chairman of the Federal Council wrote to me saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Baie dankie vir die skrywe met betrekking tot die samespreking met die uitvoerende komitee van die Federale Raad insake die voorgestelde Wet op Geassosieerde Gesondheidsdiensberoepe.</block>

<p>I gave him a pr&#x00E9;cis of what we discussed there and what I told them. The letter continued&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Namens die Federale Raad wil ek my waardering uitspreek vir die gesindheid waarin die samespreking gevoer is en ek neem met bladskap kennis van die houding wat u inneem met betrekking tot hierdie aangeleentheid, wat &#x2019;n aansienlike mate van verontrusting wat daar in die beroep geheers het, nou uit die weg geruim het.</block>

<p>My interview with them had removed any uneasiness which may have prevailed, they said. The letter went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ons neem dan ook kennis van die mening deur u uitgespreek dat daar &#x2019;n groot behoefte bestaan om behoorlike tug en beheer oor hierdie individue uit te oefen, en wil dit dan ook konstateer dat die Federale Raad akkoord gaan met die houding wat u hier ingeneem het en die moontlike oplossing wat u soek met betrekking tot hierdie spesifieke aangeleentheid.</block>

<p>Here the Federal Council is in agreement with what I said, viz. with my view that there should be a law. Now, at the last minute, the hon. member quoted a letter which had been written previously. I even went further. After that interview I had a meeting with the executive of the Medical Council. With Prof. Geldenhuys in attendance. I spoke to them and asked them to take these groups under the protection of the Medical Council. I did this because it is my view that everyone who has anything to do with the health of the individual, whether one likes him or not, whether he employs manipulative techniques or whether he dispenses pills&#x2014;whatever he does&#x2014;ought to fall under one council. That council may then impose discipline and draw up curricula for their training. Surely it is not my task as Minister, nor the task of the department, to do so. I had a very satisfactory conversation with the council, so much so that we arranged a meeting afterwards at which the council members, the Medical Association, the hon. member for Pietersburg, the chiropractors and the homeopaths were present. There was half an auditorium full of people. There they stated their case to one another. I specifically asked the president of the Medical Council to be present. He, and the chairman of the Federal Council, were there. They stated their case and I listened to it, but did not offer any comment. It was not for me to comment on whether they could influence one another or not. From that, however, sprang my decision that we would have to proceed with legislation, but only after the Medical Council had decided what they wanted to do. I suggested that they should take these people under their protection, protection in this sense that they can impose discipline and lay down what their qualifications should be. Obviously the Medical Council considered this matter for a long time and then decided against it, but by only one vote. If one person had been ill that day, the vote would have gone the other way. Then they would in fact have taken these people under their protection. Consequently the voting was not unanimous. I wish to add that the chairman of the Federal Council of the Medical Association was in favour of this legislation. So how unscientific can this business be if the chairman of the Federal Council of the Medical Association voted in favour of this matter falling under a <span class="col_3011-3012" refersTo="page_1530"/>scientific body such as the Medical Council? Is the hon. member able to make out what is happening now? How is it that he maintains that these people should be left precisely where they are? Should we simply pull the blankets over our heads and hope that they will not hurt, poison or cripple anyone. Surely that is not how it works. How can the hon. member for Pietersburg now say that the patient comes first? The hon. member for Pietersburg made a few other very nasty remarks and I wanted to get back at him immediately for doing so. He referred to the hon. member for Brits and he said that the hon. member for Brits&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; gave a very good pastoral philosophical survey which in my opinion had very little to do with the legislation.</block>

<p>I wish to say that the speech made by the hon. member for Brits had far more to do with the legislation than the one made by the hon. member for Pietersburg. The hon. member for Pietersburg tried to indicate to us how well the practitioners ought to be trained, what they ought to do and how competent they ought to be. That has nothing to do with this legislation. However, the hon. member for Pietersburg went further and he said something which I cannot allow to go unanswered because it now stands in Hansard.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietersburg said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I put my standpoint in the caucus of that side of the House and the hon. member and hon. members opposite know very well what my standpoint in this connection is.</block>

<p>That is correct. The hon. member stated it in the group. But then the hon. member for Pietersburg went further and had this to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They know that I disagree with them about legislation, but I was deprived of the right to state my point of view within that caucus, so I am being forced this afternoon to put my standpoint in respect of this legislation across the floor of this House.</block>

<p>Who deprived the hon. member of that right?</p>

<p>The hon. member for Langlaagte is known on this side of the House as a joker, and he is still one, even though he is sitting on that side. [Interjections.] That hon. member should concern himself with his own affairs and with the party he wants to establish. He should not come here and bandy words with me across the floor of this House. He threw down the gauntlet, and he must stay on his side of the House. [Interjections.] Don&#x2019;t go away. I am now talking to the hon. member for Pietersburg. [Interjections.] I now want to ask the hon. member for Pietersburg: If he had stayed on this side of the House and had discussed the matter with us in the caucus and had been in the minority, would he also have left that caucus? [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I want to come now to a few other points. The hon. member came to light with the allegation that this could be regarded as being nothing else but a motion of no-confidence in the functions of the Medical Council. Surely that is not correct. How can it be a motion of no-confidence in the functions of the Medical Council, while the Medical Council refused to exercise that supervision and I was for that reason compelled to take steps to regulate these people, to exercise discipline and to ensure that there is protection for the patient? We heard from the hon. member for Rustenburg that more than a million people had consulted chiropractors. That is without counting those people who had consulted homeopaths. Surely one cannot say that that has nothing to do with a person&#x2019;s health. Seated over there are the hon. members for Parktown and Pietersburg. Are they qualified in manipulative techniques?

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that is correct. [Interjections.] I like an honest man. However, since the hon. member is a registered medical practitioner and for good reasons does not employ these manipulative techniques&#x2014;and I agree with him&#x2014;he ought to weigh his words in this particular connection. Nor should the hon. member for Pietersburg imply, with reference to my hon. colleague the Minister of Environmental Affairs and myself, that we are of the opinion that a chiropractor can cure asthma and ulcers. That is what he said in his speech. [Interjections.] The hon. member asked us whether we thought this was the case. Why should we? Who would be such a fool as to think that a chiropractor could cure ulcers or asthma? Can the hon. members for Pietersburg and Parktown give me a written guarantee that they can cure ulcers and asthma? [Interjections.] Can they give me that written guarantee? When we argue, we should not only which to advance our own profession and try to disparage other professions. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Pietersburg quoted in detail what the American medical association had had to say. In October last year I paid these people a visit. Not only did I hold talks lasting two or three hours with the same Dr. Sammons who was quoted by the hon. member, but we also had lunch that afternoon with their executive committee. Does the hon. member know what Dr. Sammons told me? He said that the American medical council had allowed a great opportunity to slip through their fingers, because he had urged them to take the chiropractors under their protection. Why did the hon. member quote the American medical association as supposedly having had some difficulty with the chiropractors as well, or as supposedly thinking that they were not scientific? I do not wish to say whether they are scientific or not. That is not my argument this afternoon, nor is it the task of legislation to state whether they are scientific or not.</p>

<p>If one quotes such people, one should also be consistent. The hon. member for Pinetown said they were not a profession. In the legislation on homeopaths it is provided&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">With regard to this profession &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is followed by provisions relating to their conduct. The point, however, is that the Act refers to a &#x201C;profession&#x201D;. I did not say that, nor did I frame the Act. Why did the hon. member suddenly feel now that &#x201C;it should not be an associated profession&#x201D;? If we want to score verbal points off one another, I must point out that what is really at issue here is not the name. What is at issue is the question of what the legislation contains.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietersburg made a great issue of the need for us to protect the public. Of course that is what we are doing. Cannot the hon. member perceive that when we wish to protect the public, we must in fact have legislation which makes provision for disciplinary measures? There must also be provision for rules.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Stilfontein, and possibly the hon. member for Swellendam as well, asked us to consider re-opening these peoples&#x2019; register. Such a request was made to me, but I told the group that I did not feel that we should incorporate this in the legislation. The board must first prove itself. I shall not do the evaluation; it is not for me to evaluate how scientific they are or what the prescribed educational qualifications should be. The board will have to refer it to us and we shall probably refer it to the Department of National Education or the HSRC, for in the USA their Department of Education deals with the matter and they do the accreditation. They will have to see whether the profession can be trained and whether they should be afforded an opportunity to expand. They will also have to say whether the register can be reopened.</p>

<p>I want to put a question to my medical colleague, the hon. member for Pietersburg, as well as to the hon. member for Pinetown. If the board makes a recommendation to the <span class="col_3015-3016" refersTo="page_1532"/>effect that such a person should be trained for six years as a physician before he tackles the two-year course on the manipulative techniques of chiropractic, would they advocate that such a person could be allowed to practice as a chiropractor?</p>

<p>But then we are moving closer to one another&#x2014;but not too dose. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>&#x2020;I should like to thank the hon. member for South Coast for his very positive contribution. At a certain stage the hon. member very definitely brought the debate back. At that stage it needed to be brought back to ground level, and with this I mean that it was re-emphasized that we are dealing with a certain problem when we discuss the legislation. The problem which we are trying to solve is how to form a board that will be empowered to take certain steps if people do not practise as they are supposed to practise. There is also the point that their fees are to be controlled. This is virtually all this legislation is about.</p>

<p>*I wish to make it very clear once again that the Bill has nothing to do with the question of whether a chiropractor has been accepted or not. Nor is it concerned with the question of whether a homeopath or other similar groups have been accepted or not. I find it very easy to see through the campaign of the official Opposition. Yes, the hon. member for Pinetown points to the gallery when I talk about the Medical Association, because he thinks I may be going to say something bad about the Medical Association. I have every confidence in them. Moreover I have the greatest admiration for the medical practice; it is my own practice and why should I not admire it? But it is my task as Minister to decide, together with the House, whether it it not time that justice was done. One cannot simply leave these people as they are. Surely it is not in the interests of the patient that they are simply able to apply any practices.</p>

<p>There were other very good contributions as well; not that I wish to imply that the first two contributions to which I referred were not good ones.</p>

<p>At the beginning of his speech the hon. member for Brits tried to bring the standard of the debate to where it ought to have been, viz. that it was merely concerned with those specific two aspects. The hon. member made it very clear that the patient should be seen as a person and not merely as someone who was going to receive manipulation. After all, many people consult chiropractors. The hon. member for Rustenburg was right when he said that chiropodists do fall under the Medical Council. Do hon. members now wish to tell me that a chiropodist, with all his training, falls into the same category as a doctor? I want to ask the hon. member for Pinetown whether a chiropodist falls into the same category as a doctor.</p>

<p>Yes, I shall, but the hon. member does not want to answer my question. The fact remains, however, that chiropodists also fall under the Medical Council, but that does not mean to say that they have had the same level of training as that of medical practitioners.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Brits said it was important that one discipline these disciplines from an early stage and ensure that discipline is exercised. All the speakers on this side of the House agree with that. The hon. member for Swellendam made a very clear plea and also said that this profession should not be stifled now, but should in fact be reinstated. I do not wish to comment on it today, nor is that the purpose of the legislation. I explained to the Medical Association and other interested parties that if the board were to come forward with requests and state that they were satisfied with the qualifications, that would be something which would have to be considered at that stage, after which this House would first have to pass the necessary legislation. This cannot merely be done by the Minister. I was asked to include a provision in the legislation empowering the Minister to do so by way of regulation, but I refused.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Swellendam also referred to the possibility of RAU being prepared to establish a chair in this discipline if they could receive the assurance that these people would be re-instated on a register. <span class="col_3017-3018" refersTo="page_1533"/>This is a matter which they will have to thrash out themselves. However, it is interesting that one of the top people in the chiropractic profession, a person who trains chiropractors in Australia, is a certain Dr. Kleynhans. He received his training at the University of Potchefstroom in physical culture&#x2014;I am not quite certain of the correct name of the subject&#x2014;and after going through an experience which caused him to believe in chiropractors, he qualified as one. At present he is training chiropractors in Australia, where they enjoy recognition in most of the federal States. We cannot say at this stage that the profession of chiropractor will not come to an end. These people will now have to regulate their own affairs and make proposals to the department, which will then take them further if they have any merit.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for South Coast again made a very interesting point, which seems to be difficult to get across to the hon. member for Pietersburg, the hon. member for Parktown and to the hon. member for Pinetown. The hon. member said that these people are already in legitimate practice and that they are controlled by an Act. They are allowed to practice. They can call themselves &#x201C;doctors&#x201D; as long as, according to the Act, they do not do it in such a way that they can be confused with a medical doctor.</p>

<p>*That is what the Act states. I did not write it into the Act. It was done by my predecessors as long ago as 1971. The hon. member for Parktown asked why we did not define a chiropractor. How is a doctor defined in any of our Acts? No definition of a doctor exists. What definition is there of a dentist?</p>

<p>What definition is there of a physiotherapist? There are definitions of things which fall under the Department of Nature Conservation which would fit the hon. member for Bryanston. [Interjections.] All that is stated in this legislation is that if one complies with the requirements for registration, one is a doctor. [Interjections.] However, there is no definition of what a doctor may do. There is no Act which even defines a &#x201C;nurse&#x201D;. Perhaps the hon. member for Parktown should define a &#x201C;nurse&#x201D; for us. One cannot incorporate definitions in legislation. Why should I therefore rack my brains to define a &#x201C;chiropractor&#x201D; and a &#x201C;homeopath&#x201D; while no other practitioner is defined in our health legislation.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Stilfontein stated his case in a very calm and reasoned way. He referred to the taking of blood samples and asked whether or not those people should be allowed to take blood samples. I think this is something which we shall eventually have to sort out, after we have received submissions from the board. However, I do not wish to comment on these matters now, otherwise I might fall into the trap I am trying to avoid, for I do not want to do the work of the board. The board itself will have to state its position to us. In all the time I have been Minister, I have not received one complaint from the patient of a chiropractor. All the complaints I have had about chiropractors have come from doctors. I have not had one complaint from the patient of a chiropractor. Consequently there cannot be any major problems in connection with what those people are doing.</p>

<p>I have already replied to the hon. member&#x2019;s question on the doctor. This is something which they can do. The hon. member for Pretoria East also made it very clear. He spoke in a very calm and scientific way. He did clarify his position immediately by saying that he was not a medical practitioner.</p>

When the Medical Council did not want to take these groups under their protection. I decided that we should make provision for them, although it is not really the task of my department to do so. I also wish to indicate that this legislation has nothing to do with the question of whether chiropractic is a science or not. It is actually concerned with the need for us to introduce proper regulation of these professions.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The Bill under discussion primarily contains two separate but related proposals which are not contentious.</p>

<p>In the first place it is concerned with control over the development and production of armaments. In view of the arms embargo instituted against the Republic in 1977 by the United Nations, it is of the utmost importance that the armaments industry should be stimulated as much as possible in order to achieve the highest possible degree of self-sufficiency.</p>

<p>In order to ensure that a high quality and proper standards are maintained, as well as to prevent inefficient utilization of the country&#x2019;s financial and manpower resources, it is essential that the establishment of undertakings for the development and production of armaments should take place in orderly manner. The unregulated manufacture of armaments may also create the risk of items which may be of strategic importance falling into the wrong hands, or of manufacturers incurring great expenses and then having to face a situation where they are unable to find a market for their products.</p>

<p>&#x2020;In terms of the Armaments Development and Production Act, 1968, Armscor is authorized, <i>inter alia,</i> to control the manufacture, acquisition and supply of armaments. However, the Act is silent in regard to the manner in which control over manufacture may be exercised, and it is now regarded as imperative that this deficiency be rectified by the creation of machinery by which such control can be exercised.</p>

<p>Under the Arms and Ammunition Act, 1969 (Act 75 of 1969), authority is vested in the Minister of Law and Order to issue permits for the production of arms and ammunition, as defined in that Act. The arms under discussion are the so-called commercial firearms used for hunting, self-defence, farming activities etc. and exclude military firearms. Since there is a clear difference between commercial firearms and armaments, and Armscor have therefore no material interest in the manufacture of the former type of firearms, it was decided that the South African Police should continue to exercise control over such manufacture, while Armscor should control the development and manufacture of armaments.</p>

<p>In practice the proposed control over the development and production of armaments will be effected by the identification by the Minister of Defence, by means of a notice in the <i>Government Gazette</i> of certain types of armaments which may not be developed or produced unless a permit has been received from Armscor authorizing such action. In addition, an employee of Armscor or any other person authorized thereto by the Minister of Defence, may enter any armaments factory at any time for doing any inspection which he may deem fit in order to establish whether the conditions stipulated in a permit are being complied with.</p>

<p>A period of six months&#x2019; extension of time within which to make application for the necessary permit will be granted to concerns which, on the effective date of the notice referred to previously, are already busy developing or producing the type of armament mentioned in such notice.</p>

<p>*The second aspect is the import and conveyance of armaments. As has already been mentioned, Armscor is at present empowered to exercise control over the manufacture, acquisition and supply of armaments. In connection with the acquisition and supply of armaments, too, the Act is silent about the way in which this control may be exercised. Apart from local manufacture, armaments may also be obtained by importing them from other countries. It is <span class="col_3023-3024" refersTo="page_1536"/>obvious that the unco-ordinated import and conveyance of armaments through the country not only create a security risk for the Republic, but may also harm the country&#x2019;s political ties. Armscor is always fully acquainted with the stated and projected armaments requirements of the South African Defence Force, and is consequently in an excellent position to determine whether the import of specific types of armaments is necessary. For these reasons Armscor is regarded as being excellently qualified to co-ordinate and control the import and conveyance of armaments.</p>

<p>The Arms and Ammunition Act, 1969, at present contains a prohibition on the import or conveyance of arms and ammunition without a permit. An agreement was entered into with the South African Police that they would agree to exercise such control over the import and conveyance of commercial firearms and ammunition, while Armscor will exercise such control over armaments.</p>

<p>In practice the proposed control over the import and conveyance of armaments will also be effected by way of a notice in the <i>Gazette,</i> in which the Minister identifies certain types of armaments which may not be imported or conveyed through the Republic unless a permit has been received from Armscor authorizing such action. Armaments on board any vessel entering a South African harbour, or on board an aircraft landing on a South African airport, are also covered by such prohibition, irrespective of whether or not the armaments are intended to be offloaded in the Republic.</p>

<p>The Import and Export Control Act is also being suitably amended.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we in the official Opposition will support this measure. I wish, however, to deal very briefly with a few aspects of this Bill, because in some respects we believe the measure does not go far enough.</p>

<p>Firstly, there is the question of the arms boycott, to which the hon. the Minister also referred. I think that those of us who have had the opportunity of looking at the arms which are being manufactured in South Africa will realize that the country has indeed responded in a very substantial manner and also in a very effective manner, to the existing arms boycott. I think that some of those who are responsible for the arms boycott against us should bear in mind that the expenditure that we have to incur in respect of the manufacture of arms is expenditure which, I believe, most of us here should prefer to see spent on social purposes and on the uplifting of people in this country. The very people who have imposed the arms boycott and who profess to do so for the sake of other people in South Africa, however, are the people who do not take into account that by our having to spend this money the very people they profess to help are in fact harmed because that money has to be spent on armaments in order to defend our country and to overcome the arms boycott. To some extent therefore there is a degree of disadvantage to the people that they profess they are seeking to assist. I think all of us here would prefer to spend this money for social purposes rather than on arms, but we have to spend it on arms and we have no choice in the circumstances. Therefore, looking at the arms boycott in that context, we can say that the country has responded as it had to respond in the circumstances in order to defend itself.</p>

<p>Dealing specifically with the merits of this particular measure, the one matter on which we do differ with the hon. the Minister is that we do not believe that there should be a distinction between the control of the manufacture of so-called commercial firearms and the control of other armaments which obviously include firearms. Let me give a simple example. There is, for example, the manufacture of certain weapons such as pistols, shotguns or certain rifles that can be used for sporting purposes, if hunting can be classed as sport. Pistols can be used for self-defence, but they are also weapons that can be used for defence purposes. Very often it is very difficult to distinguish, if not impossible to distinguish, between a particular weapon that is used for a self-defence purpose by an individual and a weapon that is used for a defence purpose by the S.A. Defence Force. The same pistol can be used for the same purposes. The same shotgun can be used for the same purposes and the same rifle can be used for the same purposes. We believe that all armaments as such, in the broad definition, should be under the same control. I say this because when we talk about armaments we are not just talking <span class="col_3025-3026" refersTo="page_1537"/>about cannons, armoured cars and things of that sort: we are talking about small arms as well. In exactly the same way, when it comes to the question of the movement of arms, one obviously has to give certain functions to the police. However, there is no doubt that all of this should be under one particular control. We think that experience has shown that that control can best be exercised by Armscor in co-operation with the S.A. Police, but that the actual final decision in respect of the manufacture in South Africa should be a decision which is centralized and which should be co-ordinated. I want to make a forecast that this will be done in exactly the same way as we indicated. When we knew there was going to be control, which we supported, we said then that the hon. the Minister had not yet dealt with the method of that control, and he is coming back now to deal with the method of control. Therefore I want to forecast that he will come back in exactly the same way in order to centralize control of the manufacture of all armaments in the broadest definition under one entity, and when it comes we shall again support it. We hope it will come relatively soon.</p>

<p>The further question that arises is the question of the notice that must be given in the <i>Government Gazette.</i> I have great difficulty in relation to that because to my mind by advertising in the <i>Government Gazette</i> one is almost telling the people outside South Africa, people who are not one&#x2019;s friends, what one is going to be manufacturing. To my mind what really is required is that we should impose a blanket prohibition in regard to the manufacture of all armaments and firearms and that anybody who wants to manufacture them should first of all apply for a permit. To my mind it is quite ludicrous to advertise to the world what one is going to be manufacturing. I ask therefore that this matter be considered because I think we would actually be helping the opponents of this country if we were to advertise this in the <i>Government Gazette.</i></p>

<p>There is another matter to which I should just like to draw attention. I propose to move an amendment in this regard in the Committee Stage. We have had lots of legislation which has been passed in regard to inspections. In this particular Bill there is a provision in clause 4 which provides for people to be authorized by the Minister, both employees and other persons, to inspect premises.</p>

<p>We think it is necessary that this be done but there is the requirement of identification. Only last week we passed legislation in which the powers of inspection were dealt with and the standard procedure that has now, I think, been accepted by this House is that when inspections are carried out, an inspector must have written authority and he must produce that written authority before he seeks to inspect. I propose moving an amendment in accordance with that standard procedure which I think should be accepted and I hope will be accepted by the hon. the Minister because one cannot have a situation, particularly in regard to armaments, where people enter premises without there being any safeguards in regard to the question of inspections. If, for example, we can have such a provision in the Estate Agents Bill, how much more important is it not to have such a provision in regard to the inspection of premises concerning armaments so as to make sure that such person is in fact the person who does have the authority of the Minister to enter such premises?</p>

<p>I am prepared to give credit to anybody who makes this suggestion. I do not mind giving him or anybody else the credit. All I am saying is that we want that provision included in this Bill and I hope that the hon. member for Durban Point will support me in this. I am sure he will.</p>

<p>I wish to raise one final matter and that is the question of firearms generally. We believe that in the circumstances in which we are living in South Africa today the need to control firearms is far greater than it has ever been before. I think that there are too many people in South Africa who are walking around with firearms or keeping firearms without adequate knowledge of those weapons and without adequate safeguards that those weapons will not be stolen and so fall into the wrong hands.</p>

<p>Yes, there is an investigation going on. However, I want to say that whether it is a question of the manufacture of arms, the control of the movement of arms or a question of the possession of arms, as far as we are concerned we feel that the control measures in this regard in South Africa should be extremely strict. We believe that this control must be exercised to ensure that none of these firearms falls into wrong hands and also that the hands in which they are at present moment are safe hands and capable of using those particular weapons in the correct way. It is for that reason that as a control measure in respect of armaments, this Bill will have our support and we will vote for it at the Second Reading.</p>

<speech by="#cuyler">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. J. CUYLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Yeoville has expressed certain views in connection with this legislation at present before this House. One could almost call it a gift of prophecy concerning what may happen in the future. I think that the hon. member for Roodeplaat will deal with him on that score.</p>

<p>It is not often that we on this side of the House agree with those hon. members, but the hon. member for Yeoville has often made positive contributions in this House and particularly as far as this kind of legislation is concerned. I think that he has again broached certain matters today which could be positively considered. As he will know, the question of the necessity for control over firearms has already been referred to a Select Committee, and the possibility of better control over weapons and ammunition is at present being investigated. As far as the remarks of the hon. member in regard to the question of the inspections in terms of clause 4 are concerned, I think that the provisions of this clause are very clear and that such persons will be appointed by the Minister. I also think that in the regulations which will be promulgated in terms of this legislation, sufficient provision will be made to ensure that if the Minister should appoint such a person, he would be provided with a certificate of appointment or other proof in this regard. An aspect which worries me, however, and which was raised by the hon. member for Pretoria West, is the question of the identification of such inspectors if a person should pretend to be an inspector as defined in terms of clause 4. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister could consider the question of protection with regard to this matter.</p>

<p>A further aspect of the recommendation of the hon. member for Yeoville, is, of course, that it would result in a tremendous amount of administrative work for the Police. With all due respect, I do not think provision has at present been made in that department for work in that regard.</p>

<p>As the hon. the Minister indicated, the Bill seeks mainly to ensure control over the manufacture, acquisition and supply of armaments and the creation of machinery through which such control may be exercised. As has already been indicated, the Arms and Ammunition Act of 1969, as administered by the Minister of Law and Order, controls the manufacturing of, and other circumstances in connection with, commercial weapons by means of a permit and the Act specifically excludes military weapons. In terms of clause 2 of the Bill, section 4C of the Act is being amended to empower the Minister to exercise control over the development, manufacture, import and conveyance of armament items which are specifically identified by way of notice in the <i>Gazette.</i> The control of such armaments takes place by means of a permit system, and such permits will be issued by Armscor.</p>

<p>As has already been mentioned, manufacture is being controlled. In clause 1, the definition of the word &#x201C;manufacture&#x201D; is being extended to remove all doubt as to whether the mere assembly of armament parts shall also be regarded as manufacture. As has already been mentioned, Armscor will issue permits to interested parties who will be affected by the legislation.</p>

<p>In order to ensure compliance with the provisions of the legislation, inspectors are being appointed in terms of clause 4, as the hon. member for Yeoville has already remarked. However, a new section 4F is being inserted in the Act to provide for the inspection of armaments factories. This provision is essential to enable Armscor to ensure proper compliance with the provisions of the Act. The proposed clause 2(6) gives the interested armaments manufacturers a period of six months&#x2019; grace to obtain a permit as already defined from Armscor. However, in <span class="col_3029-3030" refersTo="page_1539"/>order to ensure proper control on armaments over a larger area, it is necessary not only to control the manufacture of armaments, but all other aspects such as development, import, conveyance and export of armaments as well. Provision is being made for this in clause 2 of the Bill.</p>

<p>In addition, however, the meaning of the term &#x201C;import&#x201D;, is being extended in the definitions as contained in clause 1, in amplification of sections 8 and 9 of the Marine Traffic Act, 1981.</p>

<p>The security of the Republic, as well as the public interest and good order, necessitates that armaments ought to be properly controlled over a very wide area and under all possible circumstances. I should like to refer to section 8 of the Marine Traffic Act, 1981, which provides for the protection of the control of armaments as soon as the territorial waters of South Africa are entered. When the cargo, or any appliance or apparatus the use of which or person on such ship who in the opinion of the Minister may constitute a threat against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of the Republic, shall be deemed to be not innocent, and then the Minister may deal with the ship and cargo and those persons as set out in section 9 of the Act. Such a ship may then be stopped or anchored. There are many steps which the Minister may take in terms of sections 9, 10, 11 and 12 of the Act. The powers which are referred to in the Act, are not, however, exercised <i>per se</i> by the inspectors of Armscor, but in terms of section 12 of the Marine Traffic Act the Minister may delegate his powers to persons in the service of the State, and in my opinion, this would include inspectors of Armscor, officials of the Department of Law and Order and other persons, as the minister sees fit. With regard to control within harbours, the provisions of section 8 of Act 91 of 1964, as amended, apply. According to these provisions the Controller of Customs and Excise may send a person to carry out an inspection on a ship in the harbour, and he may take appropriate steps in this regard. In other words, there are at least three Acts which supplement one another in exercising effective control over the manufacture, import and export of armaments.</p>

<p>Clause 6 of the Bill amends section 5A of the Import and Export Control Act, Act 45 of 1963, to prevent any duplication of the provisions of this Act and the Armaments Development and Production Act. The Director of Imports and Exports is at present in possession of a list and, in terms of the Bill before this House, if certain armaments in respect of which permits are needed, should be listed in the <i>Gazette,</i> such items would be dropped from the list of the Director of Imports and Exports.</p>

<p>The permissible penalties prescribed in clause 3 of the Bill to replace section 4E of the Act, are being increased from a fine of R5 000 to R10 000, or of imprisonment for two to ten years. In the first place, these new penalties indicate the seriousness of the violation and the serious light in which the legislature regards such violations, as well as bringing it into line with the penalties which apply to the Army and Ammunition Act, Act 75 of 1969.</p>

<p>As far as confiscation is concerned, the Armaments Development and Production Act is also being amended and certain cumbersome provisions fall away. In future it will be dealt with in terms of chapter II of the Criminal Procedure Act, Act 51 of 1977.</p>

<p>I wish to say with all due respect, that this Bill will bring about a great improvement and will result in far better control over armaments in general. I therefore have pleasure in supporting it.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. J. SNYMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is very clear that the hon. member for Roodepoort has made a very thorough study of the amendments in this Bill. I wish to congratulate the hon. member on the very sound contribution which he has made in this regard.</p>

<p>The armaments manufacturing industry in South Africa should very definitely be conducted in the best possible way. We are very proud of the fact that the armaments manufacturing industry is rendering such a fine service to the country that we are today almost self-sufficient in the sphere of armaments manufacture. However, it is also very clear to us why it has been necessary to introduce this legislation. There are certain deficiencies which have to be ironed out. This applies particularly in regard to the import and conveyance of armaments. The proposed legislation defines more precisely how this should be controlled. It is essential that, for strategic reasons, there should be more <span class="col_3031-3032" refersTo="page_1540"/>thorough control, expecially with regard to the strategic aspect of the conveyance of armaments.</p>

<p>I wish to refer to clause 5 of the Bill in particular. The amendment reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; to empower the Minister of Defence to prohibit or control the export, marketing, import, conveyance through the Republic, development and manufacture of armaments.</block>

<p>In other words, the Minister should have the power to exercise complete control over these matters. We on this side of the House will support all legislation concerning the security of South Africa, and I therefore pledge our support to this legislation as well.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. LLOYD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, on the part of the Government I should like to thank the hon. member for Pietersburg for the support of the independent National group for this legislation. I think all of us in this House were considerably shocked when we learned about the incredibly large quantities of weapons that were found on certain estates in the old Rhodesia&#x2014;Zimbabwe today. I think we must accept that we are living in a time when there is an excess of certain types of armaments throughout the world and that this excess is being despatched, chiefly from behind the Iron Curtain, to places like Africa and South America. We in South Africa would be foolish if we were not to take note of the fact that South Africa is also a target area for the dumping of these types of armaments. However, I believe that the hon. the Minister is amending this legislation in good time. After all, in terms of the existing legislation he is already empowered to restrict or curtail the export of weapons from South Africa by subjecting it to a permit system. However, he does not have the same degree of control when it comes to the production of arms in South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister on the fact that we have now reached the stage where we can really restrict this type of thing. I do not think that the hon. the Minister wants to take over the functions or tasks of the police, in the words of the hon. member for Yeoville. Armscor is simply not geared to do so. I think the police are acquainted with all 700 points of sale for small arms or hand arms, i.e. hunting pistols, shotguns, pistols and revolvers. However, Armscor wants to regulate the production of armaments in south Africa and to ensure that the quality of these arms, that have given it such a good name, be maintained. However, this can be done only if the hon. the Minister can act through Armscor as the monitor when it comes to the manufacture and export of arms. I believe that even the British Press is now encouraging the hon. the Minister to become an exporter of armaments.</p>

<p>Therefore I am very pleased to support this legislation.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the NRP will support this measure. We have no serious problems with it, but I do have one administrative problem that is closely related to that raised by the hon. member for Yeoville who dealt with the question of sporting and commercial weapons <i>vis-à-vis</i> armaments. In terms of the definition of &#x201C;armaments&#x201D; in the Armscor legislation, all types of weapons are covered. The definition covers every type of weapon or vehicle or any other thing that can be used in warfare. The definition is so wide-ranging that one could almost say that a pea-shooter or a catty would be covered by it, because virtually anything that can be used in a hostile act is covered by the definition. That being so, I think the hon. the Minister might find some difficulty in identifying, or let me rather say differentiating, in the notice he gives in the <i>Government Gazette,</i> between let us say a side-arm that is issued for military purposes, or even to the police, and a revolver that is bought by a householder for his own protection.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>A shotgun is a very valuable riot weapon. It is often far more valuable than a rifle in combat at close quarters and is being used more and more in certain circumstances these days. I therefore wonder whether it would not be better to take over control of all arms and then, perhaps by arrangement, exclude some from control. Otherwise I think one is going to have a problem. In fact, I am not sure&#x2014;the <span class="col_3033-3034" refersTo="page_1541"/>hon. the Minister did not make it clear&#x2014; whether he had difficulties with the present divided police and military control and, if so, what the specific difficulties were. If there was close co-operation, as one would assume there would be, there should not have been a problem, nor should there have been any difficulty with the department of his colleague the hon. the Minister of Industries, Commerce and Tourism in controlling the imports that fell under that department, because the controls were there. What this Bill is doing is that it is simply transferring those controls, for their administration, to the Armaments Board or Armscor. There has only been a change in the sort of control that will exist.</p>

<p>I can see some problems. I remember when a change was made with regard to the control of weapons at airports. At the time I foresaw difficulties there with people bringing in weapons for perfectly legitimate purposes. If a definition is published in the <i>Government Gazette,</i> it might lead to a clash and difficulties being created in those circumstances. I think the hon. the Minister will have to give a little more thought to the question of identification and the question of split control. Have there been examples of undesirable practices? We have heard allegations with regard to the export of arms, which I shall not refer to in this debate because the matter is being dealt with elsewhere, but has the hon. the Minister had problems or is it merely a question of his tidying up the position rather than eliminating a problem?</p>

<p>Finally&#x2014;I do not want to delay the debate and am happy to give all the co-operation we can in getting this measure passed&#x2014;I want to associate myself with what I have always called the &#x201C;Lawrence Wood&#x201D; clause, the &#x201C;father-and-son&#x201D; clause, about inspectors identifying themselves before entering any premises. With those few remarks we support this measure.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. members from the various parties that have participated in the debate, for their fine contributions and the pleasant attitude that prevailed. It is very clear that all the hon. members who contributed, have a good understanding of what the legislation is about and why it is essential.</p>

<p>I propose to deal with the suggestions made by the hon. member for Yeoville and the hon. member for Durban Point during the Committee Stage. I just want to refer very briefly to one of the facets which the hon. member for Yeoville raised. It has a bearing on the publication of certain matters in the <i>Gazette.</i> Perhaps I should explain it a little further. He made the very valid point that what we publish in the <i>Gazette,</i> should not clearly state our abilities or requirements because in doing so we would be giving away our total pattern. I want to assure him that it will not be published in the <i>Gazette</i> in that spirit.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. member for Durban Point that the reason for this legislation is to bring about better control for the sake of the security of the country. We are faced with the two aspects of commercial arms and armaments. The one aspect affects the Police and the other Armscor. However, when the various clauses are discussed, I shall explain this aspect further.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The Bill which is now before the House provides, in the first place, that the Small Business Development Corporation, as well as companies wherein a controlling interest is held by that corporation, shall not be disqualified companies for the purposes of the Group Areas Act. In terms of the Small Business Development Act, 1981, the Small Business Development Corporation took over the assets, rights, liabilities and obligations of the Development and Financing Corporation, as well as the Indian Industrial Development Corporation, and therefore <span class="col_3035-3036" refersTo="page_1542"/>the statutory amendment which is now being made is actually of a consequential nature.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Secondly it is now proposed to amend the Group Areas Act to the effect that the provisions of this Act, or any proclamation issued there under, shall not apply in relation to any person attending a <i>bona fide</i> sports meeting or visiting a <i>bona fide</i> sports club or a club in respect of which a club liquor licence has been granted. In terms of existing policy multi-racial sport meetings are not subject to Government sanction, and the proposed amendment merely removes the statutory restrictions imposed by the Group Areas Act.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, a long history has preceded the introduction of this Bill. Apart from Government statements and restrictive action taken over the years, it has in fact, been legislation and its implementation that has played a decisive role in isolating South African sport and sportsmen from the rest of the world. It all started in earnest some years ago with the D&#x2019;Oliveira incident and the then Prime Minister&#x2019;s statement on Basil D&#x2019;Oliveira&#x2019;s inclusion in an English cricket team.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>It is ironic that that statement made years ago, had another very positive consequence. [Interjections.] The Loskop statement and the D&#x2019;Oliveira incident heralded a perceptible and permanent change of heart and direction by South African sportsmen. While therefore the Government tried to enforce rigid separation and thus assisted the enemies of South Africa in their efforts to isolate us further, our sportsmen did everything in their power, within the framework of the law, to broaden the base for support of sport across racial barriers. I wonder whether hon. members remember the Aurora Cricket Club. When the Aurora Cricket Club of Natal opened its doors to all races, it precipitated a minor sensation in the South African sporting world. The National Government&#x2019;s response at that time was one of indignation, of reprimand, and also one of threatened action. The threatened action came in the form of Proclamation 228, framed in terms of the Group Areas Act, that specifically prohibited the occupation of fields, premises and facilities that were situated in one group area by members of a race group occupying another group area. Incredibly, this proclamation that has been considered by many learned people, including Government thinkers, as being <i>ultra vires</i> the law, has never been tested in the courts. It has nonetheless served as an all-embracing damper on non-racial sport in South Africa, and has been quoted&#x2014;and I ask the hon. the Minister to admit this&#x2014;time and time again with success in world forums by people who have sought to punish this country.</p>

<p>This Proclamation No. 228 has aided and abetted the sport war conducted against our country. It is a proclamation formulated and executed by this Government. I do have to point out that there has been, very little that sportsmen or even the official Opposition have been able to do about it for, in the end, the laws on the Statute Book, the laws that are there and by which people have to live and conduct their lives, bear stark witness, indisputable witness, to the stranglehold apartheid has always held on sport.</p>

<p>Times, however, were changing under both internal and external pressure. Permits authorizing multi-racial sport were issued. The term &#x201C;multi-national&#x201D; came into vogue, and although today that anachronistic <span class="col_3037-3038" refersTo="page_1543"/>concept has already descended into obsolescence, and has been discarded it remains, strangely enough&#x2014;that is multi-national sport&#x2014;the policy of the NP as accepted by its congresses. The joke of course is that this policy has for several years been ignored by every sportsman in the country, and is today observed only in its breach.</p>

<speech by="#dalling">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member Mr. Van Staden asks what I am complaining about. I think it is very important that we learn something about the history of this matter. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>&#x2020;Time continues to move on. Multi-national sport&#x2014;the concept thereof&#x2014;soon gave way to the acceptance of a new policy. That new policy was called &#x201C;autonomy in sport&#x201D;, in terms of which individual permits were replaced by blanket permits. Existing laws were circumnavigated administratively, although, if I may say so, with dubious legality. Regrettably, this new policy did almost as much damage as it did good. The tide of opinion and the action to be taken sport wise finally turned with the publication, in 1980, of the report of the Human Sciences Research Council on legislation affecting sport. I should like to quote one or two passages from the Human Sciences Research Council&#x2019;s document&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Discriminatory measures, such as discriminatory legislation, for example, are regarded as unacceptable in principle in the field of sport.</block>

<p>It goes on to say, and I quote again&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The principle of sport autonomy must be maintained and promoted.</block>

<p>Next quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the formulation and implementation of sport policy sport should not be used as a political instrument by the authorities, but it should in general be supported, promoted and sponsored.</block>

<p>Paragraph 1.12 reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In support of sport by the authorities interference with the autonomy of sport should be guarded against.</block>

<p>Paragraph 1.13 states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Legislation that does not by nature relate to sport situations, for example the Group Areas Act, should not, for example, be made applicable to sport by proclamation.</block>

<p>Finally&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Administrative exemption from legislative measures is legally impermissible, and undesirable from a policy-forming point of view.</block>

<p>At last, like a ponderous tortoise, the Government has moved to legislative action. A few months ago&#x2014;and I must say that I welcomed what happened then&#x2014;the Liquor Act was amended, releasing sport clubs and sport gatherings from the racial provisions of that Act. Today it is the turn of the Group Areas Act to jettison apartheid. Let us make no mistake, with the passing of this Bill separate development in sport is being thrown overboard.</p>

<p>Now that the Government has thrown it overboard, separate development will never again appear in sport, and certainly not on the Statute Book.

<p>All right, Sir, I withdraw it. [Interjections.] Nevertheless, some people will argue that the guts of the law still remains. And they do have a valid argument, for the Group Areas Act covers far more than sport fields. Others will argue that normal sport cannot be played in an abnormal society. They will, with justification, point out that it is a personal insult to an individual to be classified a first-class citizen while watching or playing sport, only to be rendered inferior and to be discriminated against as soon as the sports gathering is at an end. [Interjections.] This is the approach that I call the all or nothing approach. Other people again will argue that a continued boycott against South Africa must be maintained until such time as the Separate Amenities Act and the Blacks (Urban Areas) Act have been repealed. Then of course there are those outside our country who want to see no change or improvements taking place.</p>

<speech by="#dalling">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>To them apartheid legislation is the very meat which they use to attack this country.</p>

<p>But I hold none of those views at all, firstly, because I know&#x2014;and I say this with all the seriousness that I can bring to bear&#x2014; that the scrapping of these laws is just the beginning. The other laws will follow soon because the Government has promised to change those other laws. The already ragged flag of apartheid in sport will soon be in total tatters and will be lying in the dust. I welcome it. The inexorable movement towards non-racial sport is now unstoppable and sport, more than people realize, will be one of the major factors in leading our society out of the desert of separate development. I believe therefore that this measure must be supported. It is not broad enough, it is curiously worded, it is restrictively timid, but it signals the opening of a door, a door which can never again be closed.</p>

<p>The second reason for supporting this measure does not relate to the Government but to hundreds of thousands of young South African sportsmen and women, Black and White, and entire generation of people. I believe that it is a tragedy that these people have been denied, through no fault of their own, the competition and stimulation of participation in international sport. Any step taken by this Government which might aid them in their quest to regain the friends of the past must be supported.</p>

<p>Thirdly, any move, no matter how hesitant, no matter how small, which will allow Black, Brown and White South Africans to meet and to get to know each other on a normal footing can only lead to better understanding and to a lessening of the conflict situation in our country. We must support such moves and we must continue to press for more. It is for these reasons, knowing full well that sportsmen still have a long to go, that we shall vote with the Government on this legislation.</p>

<p>I have three questions that I should like to put briefly to the hon. the Minister. What does the hon. the Minister mean by the words &#x201C;in some or other capacity&#x201D; contained in clause 1 (b)? Can the hon. the Minister explain that to us? Also, in the same paragraph, what does he mean when he uses the term <i>&#x201C;bona fide</i> sports meeting,&#x201D;? What does he regard as a <i>bona fide</i> sports meeting and what does he regard as a <i>mala fide</i> sports meeting? I think the hon. the Minister should tell us what he means by the terms &#x201C;in some or other capacity&#x201D; and a <i>&#x201C;bona fide</i> sports meeting&#x201D;.</p>

<p>My last question to the hon. the Minister is the following. The hon. the Minister is for all purposes effectively nullifying Proclamation 228 in relation to sport by the passing of <span class="col_3041-3042" refersTo="page_1545"/>this legislation. The provisions of that proclamation have been hurled back at our country to the detriment of our sportsmen for years. Why does the hon. the Minister not have the guts to repeal that proclamation in itself, on its own and as it stands? This proclamation only affects sport. It has been used only as a weapon against sportsmen. It has been used for virtually no other purpose at all. I say that if the hon. the Minister has the courage of his convictions he will not use only this sort of backdoor method of nullifying the proclamation. I say that he must repeal the proclamation and let the world know that South Africa is moving away from apartheid, is moving away from discrimination and is moving towards non-racial sport, which is where we all want to be.</p>
