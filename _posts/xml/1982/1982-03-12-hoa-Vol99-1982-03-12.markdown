<heading>PROMOTION OF FREE MARKET SYSTEM IN SOUTH AFRICA</heading>

<summary>(Motion)</summary>

<speech by="#nothnagel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. E. NOTHNAGEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House expresses its support for the sustained endeavours on the part of the Government to further promote the free market system in South Africa for the good of all its inhabitants.</block>

<p>It is said that politics and the economy are very similar. One person in ten thousand understands the economy and every day one meets that person. Today I should like to discuss four basic points in connection with this motion, namely the role of the State, the reduction in the size of the Government sector, the great challenge of involving the Black people in the capitalistic system and the training drive which in my humble opinion is needed to promote the free enterprise system in South Africa.</p>

<p>Since I intend to start with the role of the State, I first wish to thank the hon. the Minister of Industries, Commerce and Tourism and his department most sincerely for the opportunity to learn something which we as a group were recently afforded in Pretoria, and for the very useful documents we received from them. I think I can say on behalf of all the hon. members in this House that the work done by that department is not only aimed at promoting the free enterprise system in South Africa, but that in reality we have, over the past few years, reaped the benefits of the work done by its department and that we want to wish the department and its staff everything of the best for the future. I think the Opposition would agree that it would not be inappropriate for us to pay tribute to the Government for what has been done when we discuss the free enterprise system. It is true that there is still a great deal to be done. However, I think that if we look in all fairness and honesty at the economy and at the factors that play a role in it, at the Government&#x2019;s attitude to these factors and the steps they have taken, we can say that South Africa now has a Cabinet that will do everything in its power to ensure that the free enterprise system succeeds in South Africa for the good of all its inhabitants. We need only think of the tax measures introduced by the hon. the Minister of Finance, to enable the State to channel an increasing amount of money to the private sector during the past few years, to see that as far as capital is concerned the attitude of the State is that the private sector must succeed. If we consider the measures taken in the field of labour, we see that with all the relaxation of restraints allowed in regard to the utilization of labour, we have now in fact reached the stage in South Africa where there are very few, if any, restrictions left on the free utilization of labour in South Africa.</p>

<p>I think it is against the background of these factors that South Africa, in a world struggling in the grip of an economic recession, can boast with its economic growth rate during the past few years of which many countries would be proud. It is true that a very difficult economic period now lies ahead for South Africa. However, if we in South Africa look at the African situation, we have to admit that under the policy of this Government, we have a great deal to be proud of. The Opposition frequently accuses us of hindering economic growth with our policy of separate development. When they say this they need only look at the African States around us and the economic conditions there, which exist in spite of the fact that they do not have a policy like the one in South Africa.</p>

<p>Another point I should like to make&#x2014;and <span class="col_2737-2738" refersTo="page_1393"/>if this sounds racistic it is not meant to be&#x2014; is that I think it is necessary that we in this House tell the Black people in South Africa and Africa that the stabilizing role played by the Whites in the economic development of this country and of Southern Africa, is of so much importance to them in general that in the face of the onslaught of what the enemy is telling them, they should think twice before they renounce the role of the Whites. This Government has taken the lead in a great many spheres which led to economic growth and development in South Africa. When we think of the Sasols, the Iscors, the tremendous work done by Escom in respect of infrastructure, and Foscor, we can say that this Government has played its part in the field of agriculture, in the industrial sector, the commercial sector, the services sector and every other economic sector. The large-scale research projects that were launched and the assistance that was given to various sectors of the economy wherever and whenever necessary, made a tremendous contribution to the prosperity we have experienced. The large measure of assistance given to the Small Businesses Development Corporation, which I do not wish to discuss&#x2014;my colleagues will do so&#x2014;is another point in favour of the Government. In addition this Government has showed itself to be a Government that would like to hold talks with businessmen. I think the Carlton Conference and the Good Hope Conference showed that there is goodwill on the part of the Government to work together with the private sector. When all is said and done, a country&#x2019;s economic development is first and last a team effort by the Government and the private sector, and there can be no proper growth-rate if good team work between the Government sector and the private sector is lacking.</p>

<p>When we thank the Government we in this House should also thank the businessmen of South Africa. It was Benjamin Franklin who said: &#x201C;The first big mistake every businessman makes, is to become a businessman.&#x201D; Every member of this House who has been involved in the business world will agree that the business world is a world full of tensions, challenges and problems. Frequently I ask myself whether it is really worth the effort to be a businessman. I read a very interesting article in the <i>German Tribune</i> of 13 December 1981 in connection with businessmen in Germany. A disturbing statement was made in this article, and I think it is true of most Western economic systems&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The number of independent businessmen and hence employers has decreased dramatically since 1960 from 3,3 million to 2,4 million. This is evident because people are less ready to take risks and be independent.</block>

<p>Then this article went on to discuss a television broadcast outlining the career of a businessman from the day he decided to enter the business world, showing how he had to struggle to get round all the rules and regulations, how he had to struggle to pay the high salaries his employees demanded, how he had to struggle to remain competitive because of the social assistance he had to give to his employees, etc. The conclusion arrived at by this article&#x2014;and I think it is important that we take these things into consideration in South Africa as well&#x2014;is that it has become so complicated and difficult for people to be businessmen that many of them prefer to join the public sector or to work for large State corporations where the work is easier and they are not subject to the same stress.</p>

<p>I want to say a few words about the reduction in size of the Government sector in South Africa. When one ventures into this field one is in a dangerous and sensitive area. However I want to corroborate what Dr. Colin Cameron, the chairman of the Public Servants&#x2019; Association, said, according to the <i>Citizen</i> of 15 September 1981. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What is needed now &#x2026;</block>

<p>He was referring to the central Public Service&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; is complete reorganization. The trend to follow is the one working in some other countries. Every service rendered by the State must be reassessed. Everyone that could be handled by outside agencies must be put out to these agencies. In doing this the Government could then maintain the best possible manpower and use it to its best advantage.</block>

<p><span class="col_2739-2740" refersTo="page_1394"/>South Africa is a country with a mixed economy. On the one hand the free market system has to function to its maximum extent, and on the other hand the Government has to lend a hand itself here and there. Millions of people in South Africa are lagging behind in development, the vast geographic expanses of South Africa and the strategic threat to South Africa has also led to greater State involvement in our economy than is perhaps desirable. Of course the Afrikaner also had to come a long way in the economic sphere to eventually arrive at a Carlton Conference and a Good Hope Conference. After all, there was a time in our history when many Afrikaners believed, as many Black people do today, that political power means economic power. Fortunately most Afrikaners have now buried these Hoggenheimer ideas. South Africa&#x2019;s communistic enemies are concentrating their attack in the economic sphere in particular and they turn to the masses with a question which they reduce to a simple form: What does the capitalistic system mean to you and what are your chances of owning something and of getting ahead? Our enemies find it easy to answer this question. They say: Overthrow the entire system. Capitalism must make way for socialism. For this reason the great question in South Africa is: Are we going to succeed in selling the free market system to the Black masses or are they going to rebel against it, as has happened in the rest of Africa? There is still a great deal we must do to ensure that the free market system wins. We shall have to look more closely at the role of the Government sector in the economy, and dramatically reduce that role. The sometimes exaggerated impression and image that the Government wants to control and regulate everything must be completely eliminated. In South Africa we shall have to take a penetrating look at laws, ordinances and decrees. Are these laws, ordinances and decrees, rules and laws that have a damping effect on initiative, or do they stimulate economic development?</p>

<p>During 1981 the following number of people were employed by the Government sector: Central Government, 335 922; provincial administrations, 250 567; local authorities, 226 600; various statutory bodies, 25 843; S.A. Transport Services, 271 488; the Post Office, 77 829; universities, 33 645 and the Black national States, 82 097. In addition, several thousand people are employed by public corporations, for example Iscor, Escom and Foscor. A tremendously high percentage of South Africa&#x2019;s economically active population is therefore employed by the government sector. South Africa is a country that has to utilize all its economic resources to the maximum. Entrepreneurial talent, capital, manpower and raw materials, have to be utilized to the maximum. Annually 350 000 Blacks enter the labour market in South Africa, and we cannot afford to under-utilize a single economic resource. It is not possible for the government sector of any country in the world to utilize economic resources completely. Stimulating organizations and individuals in the government sector to achieve maximum production, is only one of many problems.</p>

<p>The second problem in the government sector revolves around the idea that money is plentiful. This can lead to waste and the unproductive utilization of capital goods, for example machinery and equipment. There is also the tendency in the government sector for an ever-increasing number of posts to be created. The vicious circle of establishment expansion and salary and pension increases can eventually be destructive. In a developing country such as South Africa we cannot afford this. Now is the right time to reduce the size of the government sector. The government sector is burdened by a great shortage of trained people and a great deal of the work done by the government sector in the past can no longer be dealt with efficiently. This means that here and there in our community we shall have to take a look at certain little empires, and it is in this spirit that I am making these remarks.</p>

<p>A large part of our government sector is living in a dream world as regards the role of the private sector. Recently I received a newsletter from the municipality of Pretoria in which the city council boasted that they were going to enlarge their printing section by installing further equipment to the value of more than R100 000. The fact of the matter is that this is work which ought not to be done by a municipality. It is pre-eminently work that ought to be done by a private printer. It is tendencies of this kind that deprive the small businessman of opportunities and which result in the taxpayers&#x2019; money <span class="col_2741-2742" refersTo="page_1395"/>being used incorrectly by the government sector. I want to advocate in earnest that we in the overall government sector, including State corporations and municipalities, should give fresh consideration to which work could be transferred to the private sector, which work the private sector should preferably carry out because the private sector is a large employer and also because competition can be stimulated in that way. If the municipalities, the central Government or Provincial Administrations themselves undertake more and more work that could be done by the private sector, we are not doing justice to the concept of &#x201C;competition&#x201D;. However, it is true that the Standing Advisory Committee on State Competition tries to ensure that State departments do not undertake new work that belongs in the domain of the private sector.</p>

<p>Today, however, I want to ask the hon. the Minister of Industries, Commerce and Tourism to launch a further investigation on the part of the Government into the work at present being undertaken in the overall government sector, with the specific terms of reference to ascertain what aspects of that work being done by the State departments, Provincial Administrations, municipalities and State corporations may be transferred to the private sector. I am utterly convinced that we can stimulate the private sector in South Africa tremendously by transferring a large part of the work at present being undertaken by the government sector to the private sector.</p>

<p>The next point I should like to discuss is the question of the selling of the free market system to the Blacks in South Africa. This is one of the biggest future problems we are going to have to contend with in South Africa. I have no doubt that if we as Whites, the Government and the private sector, cannot succeed in future in selling the free market system in South Africa to the Blacks and in making them full-fledged partners in the free market system, the free market system will disappear completely. It is of no avail that we Whites try to keep everything for ourselves, and perhaps lose everything in the end. It is in this spirit that I want to make this appeal. In the <i>Sowetan</i> of 6 January I read an article by the President of the Azanian People&#x2019;s Organization, Mr. Kehla Mthembu. He began with these disturbing words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The year 1981 ended in gloom for the oppressed and exploited masses of our country. The White minority settler groups still tenaciously holds its exclusive political, social and economic privileges and advantages at the expense of the Black people.</block>

<p>He concludes his short article with these words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is no price which is too high for a dominated and oppressed people in the struggle for an eventual just and equal distribution of wealth and power in South Africa.</block>

<p>And&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Once again we re-emphasize our belief and conviction that Black people have nothing to lose but their chains in the economic, political and social sphere.</block>

<p>I believe that a large-scale onslaught is being made on the emotions of the Black people in South Africa with this kind of appeal. I say that the aim of this side of the House should be to make the Black people in the Black States and in White South Africa partners and participants in the system of free enterprise.</p>

<p>In my humble opinion we have, with the 99-year leasehold system, taken the first step towards eventual full ownership, because property is a basic element in one&#x2019;s overall economic development. Ownership of property is the perception of every person to become a partner in a free market system.</p>

<p>And I believe if we do not have a strong, stable urban middle class among our Black people in South Africa, we are doomed for all time in the economic sphere. Then our enemies will exploit the Black people and will use the <span class="col_2743-2744" refersTo="page_1396"/>emotions of the Black people against the White people who have to play an important part in this country. I believe this is unavoidable and I have frequently said in this House &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_rensburg">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. E. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>We have been trying for more than 30 years to bring this about.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#nothnagel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. E. NOTHNAGEL</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; if we think we can get by unscathed by allowing the Black residential areas in our cities to remain poor appendages of rich White cities, we are living in a dream world. I have frequently said that if we think that the Black national States&#x2014;the Opposition can help us here&#x2014;must remain poor appendages of a rich South Africa, we are living in a dream world.</p>

<p>We are therefore facing a tremendous challenge, for just as the Afrikaner used to tell himself that political power meant economic power, so too do the Black people, as the late President Nkrumah put it: &#x201C;Seek ye first the political kingdom and all these things will be given unto thee&#x201D;. I believe that in future we can bring about tremendous stability in this country through the establishment of a strong Black middle-class. There have already been ideas about the opening of certain central business areas for trade by various population groups. I am a great supporter of there being more and more freedom for people to do business and run business enterprises.</p>

<p>However, it is not as simple as the Opposition may think, because we must be honest, we must acknowledge that a large number of Black businessmen will not be able to stand up to competition from White businessmen. For this reason we must follow a long and arduous process, but the message, the tangible message that must be conveyed to the Black people in South Africa is that the Government wants to make them partners in a free market system. One of the greatest onslaughts on us is in fact the onslaught on the free market system.</p>

<p>Finally I want to advocate that the hon. the Minister and the Government launch a very comprehensive education campaign on the economy. The fact of the matter is that money is power. If one ignores that simple truth in a country like South Africa, one loses so many opportunities of getting things done that have to be done. For example, if we can stabilize the Black communities in our cities, there will immediately be a reduction in their growth rate and in this way our ability to ensure that justice is done in the sphere of education, as a matter of fact in all spheres, is so much greater. If one has money one can establish a much stronger infrastructure in one&#x2019;s country. Money is power. Let us launch a comprehensive education campaign to make every South African, White and Black, a generator instead of merely a consumer. If we carry on as we have been doing, and more and more people consume more instead of generating more, then, economically speaking I see hard times ahead for this country. The Minister of Transport Affairs frequently said we complained while we had a loaf of white bread under the arm. I share that opinion of the hon. the Minister. Until we have educated our people to realize what is involved in the economy and what productivity is, they will not be able to understand it. Ask any factory worker what productivity means and he will reply that he works from eight o&#x2019;clock in the morning until seven o&#x2019;clock at night, and that he works as hard as he can. But for the life of him he cannot see himself in the overall production picture. His production level is determined by the managers and the management cadre.</p>

<p>We can talk about productivity, the spending of money, the free market system, initiative and everything else, but I still feel that thousands of young people leave school every year without having the vaguest idea of how the free market system functions. I am therefore earnestly advocating that, over and above the scholastic training, we make an extra effort in our White and our Black schools to turn our young people into capitalists in the full sense of the word. Our young people must understand this system, so that everyone in this country can help to generate more than we consume.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I was hoping that we would today have a debate over economic alternatives that are available to South Africa, a debate over which would be the most satisfactory alternatives. When the hon. member for Innesdal started, I was a little concerned as to <span class="col_2745-2746" refersTo="page_1397"/>whether we were going to have such a debate, but towards the end of his speech, I became more hopeful, not only because we were going to have that debate, but also for him as an individual. He made three very important points that I propose to enlarge upon.</p>

<p>The first point is the need to own property as being a basic requisite to having a stake in the system. I am more than happy to hear that coming from the Government benches, and I hope the hon. member for Innesdal will throw his weight in with people like the hon. member Mr. Van der Walt, who has, as a minority in his committee, himself said that freehold rights must be given to Blacks in the urban areas. I think there is now at least one other recruit that we welcome to that cause.</p>

<p>The second point that the hon. member has made relates to the question of reducing the work of the bureaucracy. Here we have a very important factor, one which we cannot really ignore. Of the 1 388 000 economically active Whites, 498 602 are involved in the public sector. If these figures are wrong, I must tell hon. members that these are the figures that were quoted in a debate here by the previous Minister of State Administration, whom they may or may not wish to repudiate at the moment. That high percentage of people who are involved in the public sector, as opposed to the percentage that are in the private sector, must cause concern to everyone who is interested in productivity in South Africa.</p>

<p>The third point as made by the hon. member relates to the selling of the system that he believes in, in South Africa. There we may find that we have a slight difference of opinion because I believe that it is going to be very difficult, if not impossible, to sell capitalism in Africa. I shall give my reasons for saying this. To begin with I quote what Mr. Dennis Athridge says. He is, I believe, not regarded as a socialist by any means. His words were&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They, the Blacks, appear to reject capitalism because it is identified with Whites and with a system which, they believe, is oppressing them. It is associated in their minds with selfishness, with greed and with exploitation.</block>

<p>If one should try to sell a system to the Black man, and one has to start with that disadvantage, it is obvious that one must operate from a point of complete disadvantage in one&#x2019;s attempt to sell that system. He is not alone in saying that. If I may, I also want to quote an opinion from Zimbabwe because Africa as such has a view on capitalism. I should like to quote the words of Dr. Mugabe. He addressed the Zimbabwe Economic Society, and this is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Capitalism, apartheid, colonialism, are seen in the eyes of many Africans as a package, and they want neither the whole package nor any part of it. Whether it is argued that apartheid and capitalism are inconsistent philosophies or that the objection to colonialism is inappropriate to South Africa, the reality is that capitalism is a difficult commodity to sell.</block>

<p>The reality is there. This is what Dr. Mugabe&#x2019;s approach is. That is also what the approach is of Blacks in Africa. One must accept that it is a reality that the term &#x201C;capitalism&#x201D; is not a marketable term in Africa at this stage. That is the reality.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_health_and_welfare">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH AND WELFARE</person>:</from>

<p>Dr. Mugabe says that because he is a Marxist.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Well, whether Dr. Mugabe is a Marxist, as the hon. the Minister of Health and Welfare says, or not, is not the relevant issue. The relevant issue is that we have to persuade our people of a cause, and that when one starts off with that sort of disadvantage one has, I believe, a very real disadvantage.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. D. K. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>You should learn something about African culture.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>You must learn some African culture. When we talk about communism in Africa, when we learn to understand that, only then will we understand what it is all about. I should like to tell the hon. member for Rissik that he should begin to learn what Africans are actually thinking, instead of holding what he thinks Africans are thinking. That is part of the reason why he is sitting where he is sitting <span class="col_2747-2748" refersTo="page_1398"/>now. That is because he does not know what Black people in South Africa are thinking. He wants to think for Black people in South Africa. That is his problem. I do not pretend to think for the Black man. I make no pretence at that. What I do know, however, is that I have taken the trouble to study what they do indeed think.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Innesdal quoted the words of a representative of the Azanian Peoples&#x2019; Organization. One cannot pretend that they are not saying that. This is indeed the tragedy of South Africa. People are pretending that there are movements afoot in South Africa which, because they do not like to admit that they exist, they prefer to pretend that they do not exist. That is not the way to handle a problem. Trying to do that is a way towards failure.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I wish to become involved in a debate on economic alternatives, and in order to do that I move, as an amendment to the motion of the hon. member for Innesdal&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House expresses its belief that the future security of South Africa and the well-being of its people can best be assured under a system of economic democracy in which free men are afforded equality of opportunity and in which there is incentive to work in a market system operating within the constraints of a social conscience, and society makes provision for those who, due to sickness, disability, advanced age or inability to obtain employment, cannot do so for themselves.&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Let us really define what the issues are about which we are talking. This motion deals only with the free market system. Let us deal with what the free market system is indeed. The free market system is not capitalism. The free market system is not free enterprise. The free market system is something quite different. I should like to quote the definition which appears in a recognized textbook, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The free market is a market in which buyers and sellers are free to trade, that is in which no compulsion is exercized and no restriction exists concerning prices and amounts.</block>

<p>We can define the details required for a free market, but it is not in itself free enterprise, because in a free market socialist organizations can also operate, as can State organizations. It is well known that a free market does not mean that only free-enterprise entities can operate in it. I see the hon. the Minister of Industries, Commerce and Tourism shaking his head at that, but I can quote economic text books and other examples that show that in a free market State-owned enterprises and socialist-orientated enterprises can operate. So it is no use disputing that economic fact.</p>

<p>The second point is that free enterprise, if I may again give a definition from a text book&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; is a feature of capitalism in which economic activities are carried on with the expectation of profit by private individuals or groups.</block>

<p>So one must clearly distinguish between free enterprise on the one hand and the free market on the other. If hon. members want a definition of capitalism for the purposes of the debate, I could give another one, and I quote:</p>

<block name="quote">Capitalism is an economic system in which the means of production are wholly or substantially owned privately, a system in which the individual is free to make contracts with others and undertake economic activities for his own profit. Any Government restriction that exists will do so to protect the public from abuses of the system only.</block>

<p>That is really what is required. If we take those definitions, and start analysing what people in South Africa actually want, we find that in the Government ranks there is a most remarkable dichotomy. Let me, for example, quote the view of the hon. member for Randburg, Mr. Wynand Malan. I was somewhat startled to read what he had to say, but let me quote him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">People must moderate their demands for higher salaries and wages, for the sake <span class="col_2749-2750" refersTo="page_1399"/>of the economy and the survival of the free enterprise system.</block>

<p>These words are often heard these days, but let me quote him further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I personally concur with the first point but seriously question the profit motive as the prime basis for an economic philosophy.</block>

<p>That was said by a Nationalist spokesman, a prominent member of the economic group.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_rensburg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. E. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>That is Marxism.</p>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>He goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The profit motive, as an end in itself, is not defensible, profit, as a means to an end, is.</block>

<p>What economic philosophy is that? It is certainly a most remarkable state of affairs. Let me, however, go one step further. Let me refer to someone who was, I think, a prominent person, a person who was formerly the chairman of the South African Broadcasting Corporation, Mr. Piet Meyer.</p>

<block name="quote">May the Afrikaners never allow themselves to adapt passively to the tendencies and demands of the free-enterprise system, especially where it involves well-being for its own sake.</block>

<p>I wonder whether the hon. member for Innesdal agrees with this, because he has been advocating it, and he is an Afrikaner? Dr. Meyer goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Free enterprise is not a system of Afrikaner enterprise, but was largely controlled by non-Afrikaners with a different world view.

<p>If hon. members do not like those quotations, I have some others. I am not short of quotations. Let me read the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Apart from its direct participation in the process of production and distribution, the South African Government has its greatest influence on the economy through the operation of numerous and powerful controls which <i>in toto,</i> directly or indirectly, affect the environment in which the private sector is free to operate.</block>

<p>I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Many of these controls, while differing in detail, are similar to those found elsewhere, but a few which are particularly severe in their limitations on individual freedoms are peculiar to South Africa.</block>

<p>I wonder who wrote that. Let me go further. The writer, referring to the Group Areas Act, says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Secondly, geographic mobility is curtailed by restrictions on the physical movement of persons and workers mainly through the operation of the Group Areas Act, the various pass laws and certain other legislation.</block>

<p>Then he deals with some other things in connection with the Group Areas Act and says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This policy not only restricts the mobility of workers by controlling the areas in which they reside, but also in many cases threatens the workers&#x2019; livelihood, especially in the case of the Indian community.</block>

<p>I want to put it very clearly that, as I see it, what South Africa needs is an economic system which combines the maximum degree of equality of opportunity with the highest degree of efficiency. What has to be realized is that a completely free and uncontrolled market in reality leads to combines, monopolies, abuse and exploitation. The economic market, like any other human activity, should be governed by reasonable rules. Without enforceable rules there is a return to the law of the jungle. Do those who speak glibly of a free market want to have consumer protection abolished? If they do, why in this House did they support the Trade Practices Act, the Credit Agreements Act and the Limitation and Disclosure of Finance Charges Act? Do they want the repeal of the laws relating to monopolies? Do they want there to be no protection against fraudulent advertisements? Do they want all of this? The reality is that a market without rules favours the big battalions. The resources of big business in respect of advertising and the use of skilful selling techniques and the non-availability of options to the consumer are the realities of the market. So, too the man, that starts a new business, faces insurmountable obstacles in this kind of market where there are no rules. The argument that the big corporations and the corner grocer are governed by the same economic forces, have the same competitive advantages and that each has the same influence and opportunities, is of no substance, and needs only to be stated to be shown to be such. While the market needs to exist, it needs to be subject to rules. Freedom does not mean freedom to exploit, but means freedom to operate within reasonable rules which give fair and equal opportunity to all, as has been put by a well-known economist&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The market has a place but the market must be kept in its place.</block>

<p>That is the reality.</p>

<p>What kind of free market do we actually want in South Africa? Do we want a market in which all men are free or only some men are free? Do we want a market in which all can compete or only some can compete? Do we want a market in which all can own property or only some can own property? Do we want a market where people can move where they like or only some can have freedom of movement? What are the objectives of the market that we are talking about? Riches for some, or a fair chance for all? Advantages for the haves or opportunities for the have-nots to uplift themselves? As far as we are concerned, we want a market that gives equality of opportunity, that gives protection to the weak, which prevents exploitation of the consumer and that allows competition to be fair and equitable. This does not mean that government plays no part or that it has in return to play a dominant role. Adam Smith referred to three roles that government had to play. The first was to protect the society against violence; the second to protect the individual member of society against other members of society and to have an exact administration of justice and, thirdly, the duty of erecting and maintaining public works and certain institutions which the individual cannot do and which in fact the State can do at a profit and benefit to all. These are the obligations of government and Milton Friedman added a <span class="col_2755-2756" refersTo="page_1402"/>fourth one, namely the duty to protect the members of the community who cannot be regarded as being able to look after themselves. To argue against any role of the State is theoretical nonsense and practical unreality. Defence, law and order, rules for conduct and behaviour, socio-economic provision for community services and care for those in need are essential State roles and must not be negated. The challenges that we face for the &#x2019;80s are whether we can in fact, firstly satisfy the aspirations of people in this country; secondly, whether we can remove discrimination and, thirdly, whether we can provide adequate services for all. The community as a whole has to ask itself if it is able to provide for these services and if it is willing to provide for these services. To remove a notice on a station is cheap, to let somebody sit next to you in the cinema is cheap, but to equalize education costs, costs money&#x2014;real money. To provide housing also costs real money. The issue is whether South Africa is prepared to pay the price for its future and for its own security. I believe that South Africa has to pay that price, and the question is if a free market without State action can solve all these economic problems. I believe there is a place for the free market, but there is also a place for State assistance and State help.</p>

<p>When the hon. member for Yeoville began to speak, I thought for a moment that he was presenting his own programme of &#x201C;Dis my geheim&#x201D;. It reminds me of when the hon. member for Waterberg was addressing students in Pretoria and made certain allegations. When a student posed an open question, he said: &#x201C;Come here to the back; then I shall tell you about it&#x201D;. I hope that the facts given by the hon. member for Yeoville are more correct. I agree with the hon. member for Yeoville that selling the concept of capitalism in the African context to the Black man in South Africa, is a tremendous problem. If the hon. member wishes to discuss the Black man&#x2019;s reservations with regard to capitalism, he should be very careful whom he listens to and whom he quotes. Surely one cannot quote Mugabe, who is a self declared Marxist, because then we should be arguing with one another from a completely wrong premise. The hon. member came forward with his &#x201C;economic alternative&#x201D;, as he puts it. This is merely &#x201C;social democracy&#x201D;, as he has tried to explain it before. He spoke, <i>inter alia,</i> of an economic democracy in which free people are afforded equal opportunities and in which there is an incentive work in a market system which functions within the bounds of a social conscience. Basically, one cannot find any fault with the wording of this. However, we must look at the background against which the PFP operates in South Africa. Their premise is completely different to that held on this side of the House. After all, they propose a unitary State. Then one can come forward with such theories.</p>

<speech by="#fourie">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. FOURIE</person>:</from>

<p>They simply avoid certain realities, which I shall deal with during the course of my speech. Therefore I wish to state today that it is essential that we gain perspective about the concept &#x201C;free market system&#x201D; here in South Africa, especially after we have listened to the hon. member for Yeoville. Therefore I wish to compliment the hon. member for Innesdal on his motion and the positive speech with which he opened this debate.</p>

<p>The ideology surrounding the free market system is an economic theory, and this theory emphasises two principles, viz. private initiative and private ownership. It is a fact that capitalism, as a premise, does create the opportunity for the individual to show initiative by, <i>inter alia,</i> initiating his own enterprise&#x2014;be it large or small&#x2014;on condition that he finances it himself or arranges financing for it. Furthermore, that the individual is entitled to private ownership, to a choice of profession and to the right to compete within the supply and demand concept in South Africa. The alternative is very clear to all of us, viz. that of socialism and State intervention in almost every sphere. The fine example of this situation in reverse, is what has in face happened in Zimbabwe. There we had a fine capitalists system which has now been placed in reverse gear by a man who could not accept this principle.</p>

<p>Having said this, I suggest that we look at the background against which we in South Africa should apply this basic ideology, this economic theory. We know that we have to <span class="col_2757-2758" refersTo="page_1403"/>do this with a First World concept which has to take account of a Third World community. It is a fact that a large number of people in South Africa, as well as in Southern Africa, see this ideology as an alien concept. There I agree with the hon. member for Yeoville. It is a tremendous task to sell this concept to people to whom it is an alien concept. Furthermore, we know that our premise involves three basic facts which must be borne in mind, viz. that the economy of South Africa&#x2014;and no one can dispute this&#x2014; is a free economy. At the same time, South Africa cannot deny that its economy is partly modern, but for the rest still largely underdeveloped. Finally&#x2014;and this will surely not be disputed&#x2014;our economy is indissolubly linked to the Western World. The question now arises: How do we in South Africa overcome this backward position we are saddled with? I say that it is through sustained efforts to extend the free market system, as called for by this motion, which we are justified in saying that this side of the House is seeking to bring about through the policy of the hon. the Minister. What we in South Africa should try to do, is to give free choice a greater share and control a lesser share. I repeat this, as we must be clear on this: We must give free choice a greater share and control a lesser share. However, we must also bear in mind that freedom of competition on the one hand, and control on the other hand, is a matter of balance. One should not disturb the balance in such a situation to such an extent as to place the future of South Africa on a chaotic path.</p>

<p>What do the business leaders in South Africa say? They want self-determination for the private sector, but without the Government abandoning its function of regulation. The business leaders also say that the private sector should exercise this right to self-determination in a disciplined and responsible manner. The business sector further accepts the challenge which South Africa is faced with, viz. to reconcile self-interest, the interests of the businessman, and the interests of the country. The business leaders also wish to associate themselves with the national goals of South Africa. In such a spirit one can surely adopt a positive approach to the country&#x2019;s problem.</p>

<p>What does the hon. the Prime Minister say? Let us place this on record, as there is so much that we are accused of. I recall that the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central has in the past alleged that all South Africa&#x2019;s economic problems are attributable to the apartheid policy of the Government. The hon. the Prime Minister, in discussing the formulation of an economic strategy in South Africa, said at the Carlton Conference&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Om enige misverstand in di&#x00E9; verband te vermy, wil ek dit onomwonde stel dat ek nie met die begrip &#x201C;ekonomiese strategie&#x201D; enige vorm van sentrale beplanning bedoel nie. Die formulering en implementering van &#x2019;n ekonomiese strategie omvat in geen opsig groter Regeringsinmenging in die private sektor deur middel van beheermaatreëls nie. My Regering onderskryf nie alleen ten voile die beginsels van vrye onderneming in die markmeganisme nie, maar sal hierdie beginsel ook in &#x2019;n groter mate in die praktyk toepas.</block>

<p>This is what the hon. the Prime Minister of South Africa is saying. Hon. members on the other side of the House should accept the <i>bona fides</i> of the Government in this regard. After all, here we have a positive atmosphere.</p>

<p>Our biggest problem&#x2014;I believe it is a priority on the road ahead&#x2014;is to involve the masses of South Africa in the free market system, being as it is one of the fundamental principles of capitalism. There are very few, if any, of the developed South Africans who are not already, to a greater or lesser extent, capitalists in the true sense of the word. However, we must also make capitalists of the under-developed people in South Africa. If we can succeed in this then I believe we shall be more than halfway to success. I am referring here to the Black man in particular, but also to the individual, the small businessman and the entrepreneur who lacks sufficient capital. In the time that remains to me I should like to concentrate on this aspect.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Innesdal said that where possible, the services of the Government sector should not clash with those rendered by the private sector, especially the small business sector. I wish to endorse this idea. In a developing country such as South Africa, there is an unparallelled demand for services and goods. This is, after all, one of <span class="col_2759-2760" refersTo="page_1404"/>the basic causes of inflation in South Africa. The fact is that in my humble opinion, the small business sector is and remains the cradle of a country&#x2019;s free enterprise system. The role which the small business concern plays or should play in South Africa, is of the utmost importance for the maintenance of the free market economy, for the initiative to develop new products, techniques and services, for the contribution to product variety, especially speciality goods, and for the development of the social life of a nation. Furthermore, the small business concern is the partner of the large business concern in South Africa and it is the instrument whereby entrepreneurs may enter the business world. In addition, it is a supplier of job opportunities to a significant proportion of the work force in South Africa. Last but not least, I believe that if one can involve the masses in this concept, the small business sector will become the bastion of a total onslaught against South Africa.</p>

<p>Resulting from the Carlton Conference, the first consultations, there was a proposal by Dr. Anton Rupert that we in South Africa should establish a Small Business Development Corporation. This Small Business Development Corporation has been established. There was a question in this regard on the Question Paper, and the hon. the Minister told us that the Small Business Development Corporation is a private company, that the State has a shareholding in it, and that the corporation is responsible to its shareholders. Here again we have a fine example of the Government not wishing to interfere, but instead creating an instrument and then leaving it to the private sector to support it. I believe that this is a fine effort on the part of the Government. This Government is therefore making a real effort with regard to the small businessman in South Africa as well.</p>

<p>The question we wish to ask is: What does the &#x201C;small business concern&#x201D; entail? Once again, there are three facets. Firstly, there is private ownership, secondly, independent management, and thirdly, private business. Therefore it is important that a healthy, efficient and balanced small business sector should develop in South Africa so that this sector may become one of the cornerstones of the free market system.</p>

<p>I think that it is necessary in a debate such as this for us to discuss once again the goals of the Small Business Development Corporation. Firstly, one of the goals of this Small Business Development Corporation is the promotion and the extension of the small business sector amongst all race groups in South Africa; secondly, the financing of and assistance to individual small business undertakings in South Africa; thirdly, the developing of an infrastructure for small business concerns where such a need exists; and finally, auxiliary services such as management and business guidance to small businessmen who make use of the Small Business Development Corporation&#x2019;s programmes. The Small Business Development Corporation has therefore got off the ground, but not without problems, and here the public sector, the private sector, this House and the academics of South Africa should put their heads together to make a success of this whole concept. The public sector created the mechanism and the private sector contributed substantially to the dowry of R40 million for the Small Business Development Corporation. I also wish to say here today that there are academics, universities which are showing a special interest in this concept. Here one must pay tribute and express gratitude to, for instance, the Small Business Advisory Bureau at the University of Potchefstroom. These people try to make a positive contribution with regard to the promotion of the small businessman as far as advice and training for these people are concerned. Academics are playing a role in this regard, and accordingly I also wish to request that we look to the private sector, as I believe that they ought to be playing a far bigger role.</p>

<p>However, a few problems remain. There is one thing we must accept about the Small Business Development Corporation. They are expected to tackle low-rated projects and this entails serious financial complications. These relate to the granting of loans, financing, the after-care of these people, consultation and training, and finally, guarantees to the commercial banks. While the Small Business Advisory Bureau at the University of Potchefstroom is assisting, there are other people in South Africa who I think should be doing their share. The other problem of the Small Business Development Corporation, is that it has to initiate certain action <span class="col_2761-2762" refersTo="page_1405"/>programmes in areas on which the profits on projects are low-grade. For instance, these people are expected to assist in areas known as decentralization or deconcentration areas, such as Richards Bay and Atlantis. The Small Business Development Corporation has a further problem with regard to the erection of business centres in the underdeveloped areas, for instance in the group areas for Coloureds and Indians, in the Black urban areas and in the underdeveloped industrial areas in South Africa. I should like to illustrate a problem or bottleneck with regard to the Small Business Development Corporation by means of an example. These people tackled a project in Orlando West. They erected buildings there at a cost of approximately R1 million. The maximum rental they may charge, because we are dealing with the small man in the business world, is an amount of something like R1,40 per sq. metre. This R1,40 per sq. metre has to cover capital and interest, as well as all additional services, such as municipal services and so on. The direct cost amounts to 75 cents per sq. metre, which means that a balance of 65 cents remains. The return is something like 3,3%. That is by no means all, since these people do not obtain the land for nothing; they have to buy land from the Administration Boards. In that case, they have to purchase a piece of ground of 26 500 sq. metres. This would therefore cost them a further R400 000. The return is thereby reduced to something like 2%.</p>

<p>However, the Small Business Development Corporation does not merely adopt a mendicant attitude. If one talks to these people about their problems, one finds that they are positive. All they ask is that a sympathetic attitude be adopted by the public as well as the private sector. I understand that the Small Business Development Corporation has already dealt with approximately 1 000 applications, of which they have been able to approve 162 up to the end of February. The total amount they have lent, is in the region of just under R10 million.</p>

<p>What worries me, however, is the share of the commercial banks in the granting of loans. I understand that the commercial banks have only loaned approximately R2 million to the small business sector, using the formula of an 80% guarantee from the Small Business Development Corporation. The commercial banks have to obtain security for the remaining 20% from the individual. I believe that the commercial banks of South Africa should increase their risk, as their risk is absolutely minimal at the moment. They have to consider security for a mere 20% of the loans. And interest? They do not ask prime rates for these people; they ask prime plus. I think that the commercial banks, which make enormous profits in the business world of South Africa, should realize that it is time that they plough back their large profits to a certain extent, so that they too can make a contribution towards putting things right and being constructive as regards this specific problem of selling capitalism in South Africa. They should take greater risks and they should at least apply lower interest rates.</p>

<p>I wish to conclude by saying that the welfare of South Africa lies in the extension of capitalism, of which the free market system is a key. And this is the task of each one of us. Therefore it is a pleasure to support the motion which appears on the Order Paper in the name of the hon. member for Innesdal.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bartlett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. BARTLETT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there is very little in what the hon. member has said with which one can disagree when it comes to the promotion of small business enterprises. I find the attitude of the hon. member and that of his colleague the hon. member for Innesdal, who moved the motion, very admirable indeed. I do believe that we are seeing changing attitudes emerging from Government members, and I believe this is to be welcomed. I particularly welcome the call of the hon. member for Innesdal for an enquiry into the work being done by the various public sectors, and his appeal to the hon. the Minister that he should try to hand over as much as possible of this work to the private sector. I also welcome his statement that Blacks should be encouraged into the private or free market system because private ownership by Blacks is absolutely necessary in order to establish a strong, stable middle-class establishment in South Africa. These ideas and thoughts are very much welcomed by the hon. members in these benches.</p>

<p>I think what we see emerging in the NP is what Prof. Lombard, a professor in <span class="col_2763-2764" refersTo="page_1406"/>economics at the University of Pretoria, describes as a movement towards economic liberalism in South Africa. I think it is clear that the NP is changing its direction and its attitudes held in years past. Prof. Lombard&#x2019;s papers have been published in book form. In one of these papers, entitled &#x201C;Multi-nationalism in a liberal society&#x2014;A case for South Africa&#x201D;, he refers to the failure of the Verwoerdian design. It is very interesting reading this, because Prof. Lombard goes into the myth of Verwoerdian apartheid dogma and says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Not only Dr. Verwoerd but many of his colleagues, followed by business leaders in the private sector, held out this image of a Southern African economic community or common market within which all the nations concerned could maintain their political identities and independence. While the businessmen were, of course, more interested in the common market, the politicians were more interested in the political independence. It is now clear that the faith in this Verwoerdian grand desire for South Africa has begun to crack. Its implementation has not succeeded in supporting the legitimacy of the Republic in international affairs, and domestically it has not received the support of all the quarters necessary to make it a basis for political stability and continuity.</block>

<p>What is happening in the NP today is that there is this movement towards reality in South Africa, and we in these benches welcome that whenever it emerges.</p>

<p>I do believe, however, that there is a bit of confusion in regard to terms. Here I agree with the hon. member for Yeoville when he gave a definition of what a free enterprise, a free market, is. I do believe that there is some need for clarification of this. For instance, the hon. member for Turffontein said that the free market system is based on two principles, i.e. firstly, private initiative and, secondly, private ownership. I do not agree with it entirely. The free market system is what the hon. member for Yeoville says it is: a market completely free of restraints, controls and regulations; a <i>laissez-faire</i> type of market.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. BARTLETT</person>:</from>

<p>I doubt whether it can be completely free, as I intend to show. I should like to say, however, that we in the NRP have for many years expressed the view that we are a party that believes in the freedom of the individual to use his initiative, to better himself and to build up assets that he can pass on to his children, etc. We believe in a free market as much as possible.</p>

<p>The hon. members on the other side would assume that consequently we should be able to support the motion before the House. I think it is advisable that we should once again read the motion, because I believe very little has been said that is directly in terms of it. The motion reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House expresses its support for the sustained endeavours on the part of the Government to further promote the free market system in South Africa for the good of all its inhabitants.</block>

<p>I am afraid that we cannot support this motion for reasons which I will give later. In so far as we would like to see the free market system being promoted in South Africa, we do not believe that the Government has been dynamic and positive enough in promoting this system in recent years. In recent years there has been a movement in that direction, and I believe that was probably started by Dr. Wassenaar&#x2019;s book that has been widely read and in which Dr. Wassenaar condemns certain interference in the economy by the State. We in these benches, however, do not believe that the Government has been aggressive and dynamic enough in its efforts to promote certain aspects of the process.</p>

<p>I should like to ask the hon. member for Innesdal whether he really believes that one can have an economy or market that is totally free. The hon. member for Yeoville has already referred to the fact that there is certain legislation on our Statute Book which I doubt whether the public in general would condone this Parliament to repeal. There is, for example, the Trade Practices Act and the Limitations and Disclosures of Finance Charges Act. Then there is also the Hire Purchase Act and the Sale of Land on Installments Act, as well as the Drugs Control Act. We must have dozens and dozens of Acts <span class="col_2765-2766" refersTo="page_1407"/>which have been placed on the Statute Book by this Parliament in order to protect the public. I believe we have to concede at the outset that it is inevitable that, human nature being what it is, there are certain controls that are necessary in order to protect the public. A number of hon. members have already referred to this.</p>

<p>Unfortunately once a government begins to control the economy one thing leads to another and ultimately the free market suffers to a greater or lesser extent. As Prof. W. H. Hutt of the University of Cape Town used to lecture his students, and I quote his words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Controls breed controls. Controls inevitably lead to attempts at evasion which, in turn, calls for more controls; and controls are bound to distort the system somewhere and cause marked disequilibria which can usually only be avoided or alleviated by further controls.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is the dilemma in which the legislature gets itself when it tries to serve the interests of both the free market concept and the social conscience, to which the hon. member for Yeoville referred. A very good example of this, I believe, is the Rents Control Act. That is an Act which was promulgated in order to protect the public under certain circumstances. As years have passed, however, this specific Act has completely distorted a whole section of our economy relating to accommodation for rental. The question at issue today, however, is whether the Government has been active enough in order to promote the free market system wherever possible.</p>

<p>As I have said, there have been some steps taken by the Government, though very small steps when one really considers the major areas in which the Government could indeed act. If we truly believe in a free enterprise system, why are Blacks, for example, denied freehold title to land in places like Soweto, Langa and Guguletu? This is a very basic, ordinary area of activity in which the Government could act. It acts very, very reluctantly, however.</p>

<p>That brings me to a further question. Why are the central business districts of our major towns and cities not open yet to entrepreneurs of all population groups? Here is an area in which the Government could act without affecting the types of control to which I referred earlier, those which are needed in order to satisfy our social conscience. I am of the opinion that no greater blow could be struck for the concept of a free market system, for the concept of the individual and individual enterprise, as well as for good race relations in South Africa, than by the repeal of all legislation relating to private ownership of homes in Black townships and the right of entrepreneurs of all population groups to conduct businesses in central business districts.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Rissik wants to know whether this should also apply to the suburbs. I believe the hon. member for Rissik must accept that it is inevitable that these changes I have referred to in regard to private ownership of land in Black townships and in regard to the right of entrepreneurs of all population groups to conduct their businesses in the central business districts will come about. It is inevitable.</p>

<speech by="#bartlett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. BARTLETT</person>:</from>

<p>As far as suburbs are concerned, the position of the NRP is quite clear. We believe in local option as far as suburbs are concerned. Our opinion is that if a suburb wants to open its business district to people of all races, the suburb should be entitled to exercise that option. Yet, the Government, despite the fact that these developments are inevitable, vacillates, equivocates and allows the free market system to suffer.</p>

<p>I wil certainly concede that there have been certain amendments to our labour legislation, for example, which have opened the door to Blacks for a freer marketing of their own talents and labour. We welcome this. These are positive steps, but I must ask the hon. member for Innesdal how long it took the Government finally to see the inevitability and correctness of this and eventually to take the plunge. [Interjections.] We believe that because of the principles involved <span class="col_2767-2768" refersTo="page_1408"/>in such things as the labour legislation amendments and the other points I raised, and also because the cause is just, there should be no shyness, on the part of the Government, in shouting out this progress from the rooftops. Instead, however, this Government seems to be far too concerned about the reactions of the Arrie Pauluses of South Africa and is far too reluctant to come out boldly into the open and proclaim its unequivocal commitment to this cause. Talking about the free market, one must remember that there is the question of Government involvement and participation in business. I do believe that there is a case to be made out for State involvement in those areas where, because of the risk factor and other considerations such as greater infrastructural development for the country, the private sector is reluctant to invest, and under these circumstances there is a case to be made out for the State becoming involved. We have seen how this has happened in the case of the Transport Services, Sasol, Iscor in the past, Escom, Foscor and so on. Why is it, however, that Iscor, after nearly 50 years or more since its establishment, today has&#x2014;as I am led to believe&#x2014;a controlling interest in 200 or 300 other companies? Why has Iscor become such a giant in its field? Surely the time has come for, let us say, Iscor or the State to start channelling some of its shares to the public, as Sasol has done to a limited degree. I believe there is a great deal that can be done in that direction.</p>

<p>That hon. member says he agrees with me. Well, I am pleased to hear it. Other areas in which I believe the Government should be seen to be actively promoting the free market is in those areas that are at present under the control of Administration Boards. I believe that the State can only be condemned for its insistence upon the fact that in certain areas certain businesses have to be under the control of the State of the Administration Boards. Imagine the bitterness in the heart of a Black entrepreneur who has not only had his brewery taken away from him, but also the right to distribute the products from his brewery. May I just say that I am aware of the fact that the hon. the Minister of Co-operation and Development has said that he would transfer a larger number of these businesses to Blacks as soon as possible, but I believe that the Government has been very slow indeed in moving in this direction. If we want to talk about promoting the free market, I believe that the Government must really get going in this direction and transfer as many as possible of the breweries, hotels, cinemas, bottle stores, etc., at present under its ownership and control, to Black entrepreneurs. There are plenty of competent men who have the money and who are prepared to take over many of these businesses. I therefore believe that the Government must get on with things and do the job. The Government is far too slow in moving in that direction.</p>

<p>Then there is the area of price control. Over the years this Government has applied price control in so many areas in which I believe competition has suffered. This opens the door to inefficiency brought about by over-capitalization because, after all, within the price structure there is the so-called fair return on capital. Today a great many of these price-controlled industries are, in fact, over-capitalizing by putting millions of rand into capital development&#x2014;much of it perhaps not entirely necessary&#x2014;because they know that when it comes to negotiating a new controlled price, they will be given a fair return on capital.</p>

<from><span class="col_2769-2770" refersTo="page_1409"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. H. MEIRING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, to begin with I should like to thank the hon. the member for Innesdal for proposing this motion. I listened with interest to him as well as to the hon. members for Amanzimtoti and Yeoville. It is very clear to me that there may be a difference in emphasis with regard to certain aspects of this matter, but that ultimately, everyone in this House and in the country is striving to balance a First World economy and a Third World economy to the benefit of the country as a whole and all its people. I have no doubt concerning the undertaking of the Government with regard to the expansion of the free market system. The reality is&#x2014;I do not think that there can be any doubt about this&#x2014;that we in South Africa will, for very good reasons, have to have a healthy mixed economic system in which there will have to be an essential interaction between the private and public initiative. This means&#x2014;we must bear this in mind&#x2014;that the ordinary market mechanism will have to be constantly monitored and, where necessary, will have to be steered in the right direction to ensure that the necessary order is maintained.</p>

<p>Many theories have been expressed in this House today concerning what the free market system and the free market mechanism in fact are. I too wish to make an effort to do so. I would say that the general objective is to strive for a higher and stable growth rate in the economy which is determined by various factors, for instance consumption, investment, saving, and increased productivity. The subject I wish to speak about, is most definitely an important factor as well, viz. self-sufficiency and the necessity for regular supply. There can be no doubt that the role of the State, is to create the macro-economic framework in which the opportunity to promote growth should be created by means of stimulation.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it all amounts to a healthy balance. I specifically wish to put forward a few ideas concerning agriculture and the agricultural industry, because after all South Africa, being a developing country, still has a very important agricultural sector in its total economy. I should like to speak today on the importance to our economic set-up of the system of orderly marketing; our control board system. It is often criticized as though it were in opposition to the free market system, but as far as I am concerned it is in reality an extremely important extension of our free market system. In my opinion, there can be no criticism of control in agriculture as such. There may be criticism concerning inefficient control, but in my opinion, there can be no criticism of the principle of control. It is true that from time to time, and more often nowadays than in the past, very strong attacks are being made on the controlled marketing system in terms of the Marketing Act. Often these attacks are the result of ignorance, but I fear that they are often organized attacks from sectors which feel that they would make better profits than at present, under a system other than the control board system. At a later stage I should like to attempt to prove this.</p>

<p>Firstly, it must be borne in mind that the principle of the free market mechanism can only perform its function if there is complete freedom of information in the market situation, i.e. if both the supplier and the consumer, or the producer or manufacturer on the one hand and the buyer on the other hand, have full knowledge of the supply and demand position. It is just here, i.e. in the obtaining of full information, that the specific problem lies in the case of agriculture. It is not only in our country that this is a problem&#x2014;it is a worldwide problem. It is a simple fact that in all countries, even the most developed and industrialized countries, the number of farmers today is still far greater than, for instance, the number of industrialists or dealers or brokers who supply the demand for the product. It is often said that the marketing of agricultural products should take place strictly according to the principles of supply and demand under the absolute&#x2014;I wish to stress this&#x2014;under the absolute free market mechanism, and that the competing elements of the capitalist economic system would present the ideal solution to the problems which both the primary producer and the consumer are faced with. History has proved that throughout the world control measures, in one form or another, have to be implemented. Sometimes they are implemented with regard to specific countries or regions, or with regard to specific products. As far as the position in our country is concerned, traditionally there are three factors to be taken into account. Firstly, there is the principle of price stability <span class="col_2771-2772" refersTo="page_1410"/>which enables the producer to meet the demand at all times. Secondly there is the principle of profitability within each branch of the agricultural industry and, thirdly, there is the principle that free enterprise should be retained as far as possible. These three factors which I have mentioned are basic to the system of control boards and are just as applicable to the free market system. The reason for this&#x2014;hon. members will concede this&#x2014;is that there are many factors which play an extremely important role with regard to agricultural products. Here one calls to mind changing climatic conditions, the fact that production is necessarily seasonal, the lack of elasticity of supply and cultivation practices and the uncertainties this involves.</p>

<p>The need for control in agriculture has been given worldwide recognition, particularly since the depression years. As a result, there are control schemes in most countries. However, the nature of the control differs. Hon. members know that in America, for instance, which sets its sights on an absolute free market system, there is a system according to which producers are, in fact, forced to take a proportion of their lands out of production so as to prevent an oversupply from occurring.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I want to say that the system of the control boards is not faultless. There is no doubt in my mind that many errors are being made, but at the same time I believe that if there had been a better system it would have been introduced long ago. In the evaluation of the controlled marketing system, it should be borne in mind that South Africa is far from ideally suited to agricultural production. In fact, our soils, compared to those of other countries, are poor in quality. The main objective of the Marketing Act&#x2014;I want to compare that with the free market system&#x2014;is firstly to secure a measure of stability in the prices of farm products and secondly to reduce the price differential between producer and consumer and to give the consumer a product of good quality at a fair price. What better proof than this do you need for a free market system. The most important factors that are taken into account in determining producers&#x2019; prices are briefly as follows: The relationship between supply and demand, the cost of production, the general level of agricultural prices, the relationship between domestic prices and world prices and the general economic policy of the Government.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there are certain fallacies in connection with the control system which I think should be put right. Firstly, it is often said that the taxpayers provide the funds for the control boards. This is completely wrong, because the control boards are financed by levies paid by the producers. Secondly, it is sometimes said the control boards are not established in a democratic way, which is also completely untrue. They are never established unless they are specifically required by the producers. Thirdly, it is often said that subsidies, for instance, on bread which amounted to almost R200 million this year, are paid to producers. This is also not true, because these subsidies are paid to consumers in order to make the product cheaper. The fourth fallacy is the thought that there will always be an ample supply of agricultural products. The time is long passed when a producer of any article will produce at below production cost for any length of time. The last fallacy is that it is said that too many people work for the control boards. That was also inferred by the hon. member for Yeoville in a broader sense. Throughout the whole country only 2 500 people work for 22 control boards. They handle R3 000 million worth of marketing, and the administration costs of that is only 0,7%, compared with 5%, which is the average of any industrial organization. I venture to say that if it were not for the stability brought about for producers by control boards many more farmers would have left the land and prices would have soared even further.</p>

<p>*Here I briefly wish to refer to one of the industries which is controlled by a control board and in which I am intimately involved, viz. the wheat industry. To come back to the free market system, I cannot think of a better testimonial for orderly marketing as an extension of the free market system, than the establishment of control over the wheat industry in the late thirties. Up until that stage, when an absolute&#x2014;and again I underline the word &#x201C;absolute&#x201D;&#x2014;free market system applied, the production of thousands of wheat farmers was dependent upon the demand of a small group of grain brokers who <span class="col_2773-2774" refersTo="page_1411"/>simply played cat and mouse with the farmers. There was no control over processing, and there was no control over production and marketing. In contrast to this, control has achieved precisely what the free market system strives for, viz. a fair and competitive price, higher productivity and a balance between supply and demand. It is not only the producer who has benefited by control; it most definitely has advantages for the consumer as well. The price of a loaf of brown bread in South Africa is 30c, and I have brought with me today a very nice loaf of bread, a loaf of healthy brown bread. The subsidy on it amounts to approximately 12c. So, in reality, this product costs 42c.</p>

<speech by="#meiring">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. H. MEIRING</person>:</from>

<p>We only pay 42c for this product, i.e. about one quarter of the price of a similar product in the highly industrialized countries. I am not even speaking of African countries. However, the important point is that the wheat value of this bread, unsubsidized, amounts to 40% of the 42c. The wheat farmer only gets 40% of 42c for the wheat is in this loaf of bread. In America the farmer gets a mere 8% of the price there. What better proofs is there than control in South Africa is, in reality, an extension of the free market system, in the sense that the end product is sold to the client at the most reasonable and competitive price?</p>

<p>To produce wheat in South Africa today, to store it, to grind it, to bake it and market it in the form of a loaf which, as far as quality is concerned, does not take second place to bread in any other country, and at a price which is one quarter of a comparable product in Europe, for instance, is, as far as I am concerned, the best testimonial and proof that the system of control is indeed a very important component of the free market system. There are 20 other control boards too, but I am not going to discuss them now. Some of them follow a one channel system, others a pool system, surplus disposal, sales promotion and so forth. The only criticism that could be levelled at control, would be in respect of its implementation, inefficient implementation, but certainly not in respect of control <i>per se.</i></p>

<p>I wish to conclude by saying that the free market system may be found in different forms, that orderly marketing in the form of the control board system is an important component of this system, that it is in the general interest of everyone and that, as far as I am concerned, criticism is therefore completely unjustified.</p>

<speech by="#malcomess">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. N. MALCOMESS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Paarl delivered a speech in which he predominantly tried to justify the control board system as being part of the free market system. To start off with, this is a total contradiction in terms. While I can see that the hon. member has made out a reasonable case for control boards&#x2014;in theory reasonable cases can be made out&#x2014;in practice the reality is that tremendous problems have been created. This is why the control board system has come under so much attack. I want to draw the hon. member&#x2019;s attention to the fact that for the last year for which figures are available, meat and dairy products amounting to some R17 million had to be imported. This was a tremendous drain on our financial resources and was occasioned to a very large extent through the machinations of the control boards, particularly relating to the dairy industry. At one stage we had a butter mountain and a cheese mountain which we could not sell because there was an over-production. Then certain actions were taken and we have now reached the situation in the dairy industry where we are importing butter. We are now even importing milk powder to subsidize our own meagre resources in this regard.</p>

<p>If one wants to look at control boards I only have to ask the hon. the Minister of Finance&#x2014;who is present in the House today&#x2014; what the situation is regarding for instance the over-production of maize and the financial problems which it has caused. The hon. the Minister himself referred to these problems in, I think, the debate on the Part Appropriation Bill. This has resulted from a price being set by the control board for the production of maize which resulted in maize being totally over-produced in South Africa, creating tremendous problems as a result.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Amanzimtoti made a plea for central business districts to be open to all race groups. The hon. member said, in reply to a question regarding suburban areas, that that would depend on the policy of local option. As far as central business districts are concerned the hon. member wants the free market system to operate, but as far as the suburban areas are concerned the policy of the hon. member&#x2019;s party is that the free market system should not operate unless it has local option. I want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that that local option means that two-thirds of the people in the area have to vote in favour of it&#x2014;not just a simple majority&#x2014;and even then it can still be vetoed by the local authority. I cannot be made to accept that that is in any way local option. It simply is not.</p>

I am very delighted to see that the hon. member for Innesdal talked about the correlation between economic freedom and political freedom and said that the two could not be divorced. One of the problems in our country today is that the only expression of freedom of the Black man really lies in the economic field in terms of trade unions.</p>

<p>This is of course creating a great problem, because the Black population is utilizing their only means of debate for political reasons, which creates great problems for the businessmen themselves.</p>

<p>When we consider the motion before this House I believe we also have to look at what the alternatives are. Without doubt the two major economic systems in the world are the free market system with lesser or greater degrees of socialism mixed in, and the communistic system which is, of course, based totally on economics. Assuming that we have a free choice, we in South Africa have basically to chose between these two systems&#x2014;the free market system or the communistic system. We have supposedly in this country a free market system and if this system is perceived by the population to bring them the rewards they require, they will continue to support that system. If it fails them and their needs they will reject it and, as soon as the opportunity presents itself, they will adopt the communistic system. I believe that this is a very real danger that exists in this country today and the hon. member for Innesdal pointed this out. I believe that it is imperative that if we are to have a healthy and on-going free market economy in South Africa, in order for that economy to survive it must be shown to bring rewards to a majority of the people. One of the frightening aspects of the current situation is that the vast majority of the population is not adequately rewarded. The hon. member for Innesdal has obviously seen this very clearly.</p>

<p>This Government constantly tells hon. members on these benches that we are obsessed with race. However, we have to bring this subject into almost every debate because of the attitude of this Government which leaves us no choice. Almost every aspect of South African life is affected by one or other of the Government&#x2019;s racial laws and, until we rid ourselves of these monstrously evil laws, we will have no option but to bring that subject into debate. The free market is no exception to this rule and I believe that we have to bring this subject in to the debate here this afternoon.</p>

<p>Before going any further, let me inform this House about what Karl Marx said about communism and how it would be achieved. Among other principles that would bring about a redistribution of wealth, which he was after, was, firstly, a heavy, progressive or graduated income tax system. This we have. Secondly, he believed that the centralization of communication and transport in the State&#x2019;s hands was necessary. Need we <span class="col_2777-2778" refersTo="page_1413"/>look further than the S.A. Transport Services, the SABC and SATV and the Post Office? Thirdly, he said that the extension of the means of production further into the hands of the State was necessary, and here we need only look at Escom, Iscor, Sasol and the Uranium Corporation, which are only a few examples. Therefore, my first point is that to further the free market system in South Africa we must reduce the State&#x2019;s participation in private enterprise.</p>

<p>The second major point I wish to make relates to the enormous bureaucracy we have built and are continuing to build in South Africa. Here again, the hon. member for Innesdal mentioned this point. I referred earlier in this session to the pushers of pens and the shufflers of paper and the many pettifogging rules and regulations which unnecessarily bind and restrict private enterprise. The hon. member for Innesdal in fact quoted from a German article about German businessmen actually not going into private enterprise because there are these problems in Germany as well. He also quoted Dr. Cameron in this regard. However, as I have already spoken on this subject during the course of this session, I shall not elaborate on this regard.</p>

<p>The third major point&#x2014;and I believe that this is the most important one&#x2014;is that the Government must move away from economic discrimination in order properly to carry out the free market system in South Africa. This economic discrimination is driving the Black people straight into the hands of the communists and the Marxists. There are many forms that this discrimination takes and it affects the Blacks from the cradle to the grave. When I refer to Blacks, let it also be understood that I am talking about the Coloureds and the Indians as well.</p>

<p>Let us, firstly, start with education. In 1980 and 1981 expenditure per White child was estimated at R1 071 per annum. In respect of the Black child it was estimated at R113,50. So right from that early stage, in terms of education considerably more money is spent on the White child and he is prepared more adequately to participate in the free market system by obtaining the basic education necessary to meet his needs.</p>

<p>Secondly, one has then the aspect of freedom of movement. Having left school, he looks for a job in his area, and if he is lucky, he finds it. If there is nothing available to that Black man, he cannot move to where the job exists. This is totally in conflict with the free market system. There are many examples of this. There are the squatter camps which hit the headlines in the course of the last session with the evils which develop from that situation. There is the separation of fathers from mothers and children. There is the forced removal to areas where jobs are not available. This is still going on today, and let me quote a case which was reported in the <i>Eastern Province Herald</i> only on Wednesday. The headline reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Barred from the city of birth.</block>

<p>It is the strange story of a man with nowhere to go. It relates to a Mr. Nkulu from Port Elizabeth. This man was born in Port Elizabeth and he lived for 25 continuous years there, but the law does not allow him to live and work there now. His parents have rights to live in Port Elizabeth and his little brother stays with them in the house, but Mr. Nkulu must go.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. N. MALCOMESS</person>:</from>

<p>The problem is that this gentleman accepted a job in a farming area where he worked for a number of years. After 25 years that job has come to an end and he is not allowed to go back to find a job in the city where he was born.</p>

<p>This is in total conflict with the free enterprise system and it must be sorted out by the Government to ensure that the rewards of the system are given to all people. I believe that any Christian who supports this kind of evil needs to examine his conscience.</p>

<p>Thirdly, there is salary inequality. Having overcome the obstacle in his way, the lucky employee finds that simply because of the colour of his skin, the State does not pay him on the same basis as his White counterpart who does the same job. As I have said before, a White policeman and a Black policeman are just as dead when they get on the wrong side of an assassin&#x2019;s bullet. This is continuing. Only this week, Wednesday, 10 March, the hon. the Minister of Law and Order answered a question of the hon. member for Green Point. Apparently the average <span class="col_2779-2780" refersTo="page_1414"/>salaries of White policemen were increased in 1981 by 24,39%, but the salaries of Black constables only by 13,95%. A 10% bigger increase was given to the White policeman than to the Black policeman who already is being paid considerably less.</p>

<speech by="#malcomess">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. N. MALCOMESS</person>:</from>

<p>I come to the fourth question and this relates to industrial and commercial inequality. The very few Blacks who overcome all these problems and become businessmen of substance find that they too still have to pay the penalty. They cannot buy or operate business premises, businesses or industrial enterprises in the prime areas or central business districts in many industrial areas. They are barred from these areas. The same goes for the suburban shops. We know today that the whole development of shopping is into the suburbs, but the Blacks are denied the right to move into the suburbs where a lot of the money today is being spent. Even advocates, attorneys and doctors may not practise in many areas. They cannot set up their consulting rooms or surgeries in those areas.</p>

<p>Fifthly there is residential inequality. These businessmen and their families may not own a house in some 87% of what was the land area of South Africa before the independence of certain homelands. Hon. members on that side as well as on this side have referred to this fact, and it is absolutely basic that a man must be allowed to own his own home. While we welcome the 99-year lease proposals, (a) they do not seem to have worked particularly well and (b) it is not the same thing. It does not actually replace the ownership of his own home by the individual whatever the colour of his skin. We hope that the Government will move in this direction. These people, the Blacks with capital who have succeeded, are lumped together with all the others in the Black townships. If we want to establish a Black middle class, let them have the rewards of being middle class in terms of wealth. Let them have their areas where they can move into their own houses, where they are not cheek by jowl with the people lower down in the economic spectrum.</p>

<p>The final point I want to make in this debate relates to the cradle to grave concept. Having experienced all this throughout his life, what happens to the Black man when he reaches the declining years and wants a pension, something to live on during the rest of his lifetime? The White pensioner gets R122 as a pension, while the Black man gets only R44 per month. Let us look at the means test. The means test for Whites is R122 per month while that for Blacks is R348 per annum. If a Black earns more than R348 per annum, he is not even entitled to that meagre pension of R44. Moreover, the Black man is very often lucky to get that money. Let me refer to another article in the <i>Eastern Province Herald</i> of 15 January 1982, where we read the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">African pensioners queue at night to beat pay rush: An old man who said he was nearly 80, said he resorted to overnight queueing when on several occasions he was told by officials handling the payout that they have run out of money. &#x201C;On three occasions they told me there was no more money after I had been in the queue the whole day&#x201D;, he said.</block>

<p>Further in the article a spokesman for the department is quoted&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Fourie said: &#x201C;That may be correct, but it happens only once in a blue moon. Normally we take enough money&#x201D;.</block>

<p>So if one is Black, throughout one&#x2019;s life the free enterprise system appears to be a system that one cannot beat and that holds very little in the way of rewards. It has been inadequate in all periods of one&#x2019;s life, from the cradle to the grave. I believe therefore that we should urge this Government to ensure that the undoubted benefits of the free enterprise system are brought to all the people of South Africa. I think this is the aim of the hon. member for Innesdal and certainly mine, as well as those of hon. members on these benches. I support the amendment moved by the hon. member for Yeoville.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the first place I should like to thank the hon. member for Innesdal for the opportunity his motion has given us to <span class="col_2781-2782" refersTo="page_1415"/>debate this important matter this afternoon. Thus far the debate has generally been conducted on a very high level, although I must single out the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central because the tirade at the end of his speech was definitely not on a par with the contributions of other hon. members. In general, however, it was a constructive debate, and I want to thank the hon. members who took part in it most sincerely. Various aspects were discussed in an objective way, which was a credit to this House.</p>

<p>It was only to be expected that hon. members of the Opposition, in this case the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central in particular, would harp on the same old theme. Their entire approach is that as far as the free market system or market economy in South Africa is concerned, our entire policy is an illusion. They allege that the restrictions and limitations that the Government&#x2019;s so-called apartheid policy places on the free market economy turns it into an illusion.</p>

<p>The hon. member reminds me of a fellow who once said to Spurgeon that he was looking for the perfect church and therefore did not want to join any of the other churches in the world. When Spurgeon argued with him and pointed out to him that there was no such thing as a perfect church, he simply refused to change his attitude. Spurgeon then said to him: &#x201C;Go ahead; keep on looking for the ideal church which I do not believe exists, but if you find such a church I want to give you some sound advice: Do not join that church because you will only spoil it.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x2020;He had it against the Government&#x2019;s monstrously evil laws, the evil policies of this Government. He called it an evil system, and even tried to substantiate his argument by referring to a number of individual cases of hardship. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>No one on this side of the House denies the fact that the economic system in South Africa does have specific shortcomings and deficiencies. Of course the system we have in South Africa has many deficiencies and shortcomings, which in many respects are the result of the complicated nature of our population structure, and also of the realities of the history in which these developments are rooted, as it were. However, it is the expressed policy of this Government, and also its intention, to continue to eliminate those restrictions which are identified in this regard and which can be eliminated, and also to create further opportunities for participation in the free market system by everyone. These are matters which are being dealt with by the Government. These are aspects to which constant attention is being given.</p>

<p>When we want to conduct a constructive <span class="col_2783-2784" refersTo="page_1416"/>debate in this House on matters which are elevated above superficial party politics, we must be honest with one another.

<p>Since the member for Yeoville is becoming vociferous again, I also want to say a few words to him, pursuant to the remarks I made about the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central. The hon. member for Yeoville made his contribution to this debate this morning. He dealt with the free market system in a theoretical way. Also in the spirit of the report of the commission of which he was chairman&#x2014;the economic commission of the PFP&#x2014;he gave us a definition of a free market system&#x2014;a perfect definition. At the same time, however, it indicated one of the problems of hon. members of the PFP. They are dealing with ideals, with theories, with textbook theories. However, when one philosophizes in that way, one loses touch with reality. It is very easy to make a meritorious speech on general matters. But when it comes to applying those theories in practice, that philosophy is neither here nor there.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville also said that capitalism was an unmarketable concept in Africa. However, it is not only unmarketable in Africa. It is also unmarketable in certain sectors of that hon. member&#x2019;s own party. That is the dilemma in which that hon. member finds himself. On the one hand there are hon. members in his party to whom capitalism is unmarketable. I believe the hon. member for Yeoville himself has problems with certain aspects of the capitalistic system. In the same party, however, there are hon. members to whom the concept of socialism is unmarketable.</p>

<p>This is why the political statements of the PFP and of the hon. member for Yeoville are theoretically so wideranging that they are neither here nor there. The hon. member for Yeoville, as chairman of this commission, published a report in which the commission accepted that a free market system should exist in South Africa. I quote from paragraph 3.3 of the report&#x2014;</p>

Perhaps we also have the most windmills trying to pump water from dry boreholes, but I would rather not comment on that. [Interjections.] In the field of mining the RSA already contributes approximately 95% of the coal production in Africa, 38% of the uranium production, 14% of the copper production, 27% of the diamonds, 81%&#x2014;please note, 81%&#x2014;of the chrome ore, 70% of the manganese ore, etc. I can go through the entire list.</p>

<p>However, let us consider the manufacturing sector. In the industrial sphere the RSA is responsible for 40% of the manufacturing production in Africa, for 22% of Africa&#x2019;s exports and approximately 66% of Africa&#x2019;s steel consumption. In the sphere of transportation we find virtually the same situation. The RSA is responsible for 50% of all motorcars, trucks and tractors. The RSA also has 4,2 times more kilometre rail capacity than the rest of Africa. So I can continue.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to discuss a number of aspects concerning the State&#x2019;s involvement in the economy. In the first place I should like to refer to price control. The place of price control within the system of business freedom is frequently debated. Price control and economic power formation, about which I shall have something to say a little later on, can prevent prices from performing their function properly in the interests of the greatest possible satisfaction of needs and prosperity and can make a material contribution to a distortion of economic life. Frequently this results from incorrect concepts being used or incorrect concepts forming the point of departure when the <span class="col_2787-2788" refersTo="page_1418"/>market economy is being discussed. There is an incorrect view that price control can keep profit margins at an acceptable level, that it can, as it were, guarantee levels of return, and that it can also keep prices at low, acceptable levels over long periods. However, the economic reality is not static and does not know about general conditions of equilibrium. There is momentum in the economy. There is movement and change in the economy and the economic policy of the State should as a rule, endeavour to promote this economic dynamism and not to obstruct it. It should be the task of the State to correct the faults of free competition and free price formation and not to regulate them otherwise the free market system could break down to the detriment of everyone and the free market economy will eventually become nothing more than a planned economy. The consumer in South Africa must realize that a free competitive market economy is also to his advantage in the long term, and that prices can be kept at their lowest levels in this way. A cornerstone of any free market system is and remains a sound competition policy.</p>

<p>In this regard I want to refer briefly with great appreciation to the valuable work that is being done by the Competition Board. This board was established at the beginning of 1980 in terms of the Maintenance and Promotion of Competition Act, Act 96 of 1979, and the board immediately began to institute various important investigations. Naturally these investigations took time, but many of them have already been completed and in several cases it was necessary to take steps to put an end to restrictive practices. Since its establishment in 1980 the Competition Board has already investigated 98 cases. Of these 81 were completed during 1981. The board&#x2019;s second annual report will be tabled in this House soon, and I want to make an appeal to hon. members to study that report and in that way take cognizance of the very important work which is being done by the Competition Board. This year the board has already completed a few important investigations and reported on them to me. Further statements in this regard may be expected in the near future.</p>

<p>The board is also at present engaged in a number of other important investigations. For example, the board has already made a great deal of progress in the investigation into the provision and distribution of alcoholic beverages, an investigation which has aroused widespread interest and which may also bring about important and far-reaching proposals regarding structural problems at present being experienced in the liquor industry.</p>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<p>And the beer price.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The South African market remains a relatively small and limited market, in spite of its significant growth and development over the years. This factor, together with many other structural characteristics, has in many cases led to a lack of a significant degree of competition in the national economy. This in turn has led to market forces not being able to perform their functions properly. In addition there is also a great amount of ignorance in the national economy and among a large sector of our population of the functioning of the market system, and they are not always able to look after the functioning of the market system in their own interest. The hon. member for Innesdal also referred to this aspect and emphasized the importance of an education programme. In this regard I could just mention that the Consumer Council is doing important work, but owing to its size and its means there is a limit to what it can achieve. However, the Competition Board can do a great deal more in co-operation with local communities. I was privileged to be present when the local business community, in fact, more than just the business community, took the initiative and called in the assistance and advice of the board to launch a consumer campaign in their own area. The board can make a valuable contribution in this regard and can help us to increase outreach of the education campaign.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the possibility of promoting a more widespread campaign to introduce the market mechanism, the system of private initiative, even at school level. These ideas also warrant further investigation. In such a situation, where consumer ignorance exists on the one hand and, as a result of the high level of inflation we have to contend with, continuous price increases occur on the other, the task of the <span class="col_2789-2790" refersTo="page_1419"/>Competition Board is of course very important and also very difficult. People are unfortunately under the erroneous impression that price increases can be avoided if price control is applied on various products. The short-term advantages of price control are certainly not to the advantage of the consumer or the economy in the long term. For this reason it is the policy of the Government to allow the market forces to operate where possible, under competitive conditions, to the greatest advantage of efficiency and productivity and of growth and development and to determine price levels themselves. If an enterprise in the free market system places a new product on the market, either by innovation or by new marketing techniques markets a product and earns higher profits on it than other enterprises, and access to that branch of the industry remains open, it is merely sound common sense and logic that other entrepreneurs will follow that example and that the supply of that article will increase in due course and that the competition created in this way, will be beneficial to the consumer in the long term. Of course this is on condition that there are no restrictive practices that prevent competition or that prevent entry to that branch of the industry. There may not be any restrictions at all on the right of entrepreneurs to engage in that branch of the industry. The Competition Board is therefore an important instrument to promote competition and to ferret out restrictive practices. If it appears that the board is not able to succeed in this aim in terms of the present powers given to it by the Act, I shall not hesitate to extend the authority of the board so as to enable it to pursue those aims more effectively. In this connection and with a view to the promotion of the system of industrial freedom and free price formation, a working group on price control was appointed in September 1980 to investigate cases in which existing price control could be lifted. The working group is under the chairmanship of the Price Controller and consists of representatives of organized trade and industry, State departments, organized agriculture, consumers and others. At the end of last year, arising out of the recommendations of the working group, the price control on a large number of commodities was lifted. This was done in the belief that the lifting of control on those commodities would be to the greater advantage of the consumer, thanks to the functioning of the market and the competition in those branches of the industry.</p>

<p>Another group of commodities was referred to the Competition Board by the committee to investigate the market conditions in respect of those products so as to ascertain in what cases price control could be lifted. The board reported to me recently on this matter and I hope to make further announcements in this connection in the near future.</p>

<p>Another important aspect is that the board also investigates take-overs and mergers to ascertain whether such take-overs and mergers were really in the public interest. Economic activities in South Africa are strongly concentrated, a matter to which I have already referred and regarding which I voiced the concern of the Government. Sometimes it cannot be helped because, as I have already indicated, the local market is in many cases small and limited and there is only room for one or two undertakings in a particular branch of the industry. I want to emphasize that monopolistic or oligopolistic industries are not necessarily detrimental and undesirable <i>per se.</i> However, it is true that take-overs and mergers constitute potential dangers and disadvantages and cannot be allowed to continue in an unauthorized way without the necessary supervision. The Competition Act also makes provision for supervision of this form of concentration. The legislation and its implementation was entrusted to the Competition Board and does not assume that take-overs and mergers <i>per se</i> are contrary to the public interest. Some may even be in the public interest. In cases where real competition and economic implications are at stake, however, it is desirable that the Competition Board should be consulted beforehand. In this way embarrassment for the respective parties can be prevented in that, if it is deemed to be necessary in the national interests a public investigation need not be instituted, one which could even lead to further steps being taken. For this reason the Act makes provision for consultation with the board. The board may provide prospective parties to such a take-over or merger with advice and could even give a binding decision that such take-over or merger would not be contrary <span class="col_2791-2792" refersTo="page_1420"/>to the public interest. I am delighted to be able to say that these advisory services of the board are being used to an increasing extent by undertakings.</p>

<p>Although I must repeat that the Government does not generally condemn the possession of economic power, mergers or takeovers, it is obvious that many industrialists and businessmen frequently follow the line of least resistance in deciding to expand or diversify by simply acquiring an interest or a controlling share in an undertaking. It goes without saying that this behaviour is not always to the greatest advantage of the socioeconomic development of the country in the long term. One also understands the motivation which is presented to one when undertakings indicate that they want to expand their production line or were motivated into taking a certain step as a result of rationalization benefits or as a result of the fact that they want to strengthen their position <i>vis-à-vis</i> their competitors. Today, however, I want to make a serious and urgent appeal to our major industrialists, businessmen and entrepreneurs in particular, and I hope the Press will also help to convey this appeal further. I should like to make a serious and urgent appeal to our major undertakings rather to start new and original undertakings than to employ available investment funds for the take-over of existing undertakings. It would be more beneficial to our economy if large undertakings were to utilize their expertise, their capital, their entrepreneurial and managerial ability more creatively to establish new undertakings than to take the easy way out of take-overs and mergers. Such behaviour will of necessity contribute to greater competition and a greater utilization of raw materials, capital and managerial and manpower potential and also to greater productivity, employment, the opening up of new markets and eventually to a general broadening of our economic base.</p>

<p>Frequently a complaint in respect of excessive State competition with the private sector is also heard. The hon. member for Innesdal also referred to this. He also referred to the Standing Committee on State Competition, under the auspices of the Department of Industries, Commerce and Tourism. I should like to draw attention to the fact that any person or body who feels unhappy about competition from the State in a specific field may bring this to the attention of this committee. With reference to the motion of the hon. member for Innesdal I think the committee could also be directed to identify fields in which the public sector could more readily transfer its activities to the private sector. The aims still remain to reduce State interference and State involvement in the economy and to give the market forces an opportunity to play a greater role. However, these aims must naturally be pursued in an orderly and responsible way.</p>

<p>The ballot box is the only way in which a democracy can elect its governors. It is cardinal to the very existence of this Parliament. In addition, it is imperative that the ballots placed in the ballot box shall be secret, for obvious reasons.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#the_purpose_of_elections">

<heading>THE PURPOSE OF ELECTIONS</heading>

<p>The purpose of elections is that the governed should elect their rulers, and that they should have the power to renew, at intervals, the authority they gave to them. Furthermore, the elected should be prepared to give up their power voluntarily and to submit to a new exercise of the will of the electors when they no longer have the confidence of the majority. In addition, it is essential that all elections be free.</p>

<p>In South Africa at present we have White adult suffrage of all persons over the age of 18 years, electing this Parliament from among the White persons only, voting in constituencies that elect one member to the House of Assembly under a system known as &#x201C;The first-past-the-post&#x201D; system, because whoever obtains the most votes is declared the winner.</p>

<p>Our Parliament, to which each member here has been elected, is completely sovereign. Only our Parliament can legally pass any law that can affect the manner in which Parliament can be constituted. Only our Parliament can change the present constitution to a new type of constitution. Because our Parliament is sovereign, we as members must jealously guard our own integrity in relation to the voters who elect Parliament. It is therefore the duty of every member of this House to ensure that, no matter where any voter may live in this land, no matter what his occupation or calling, he shall in the most practical manner possible be able to know that no other voter shall merely in casting his vote be able to exercise more influence numerically than he has when casting his vote.</p>

<p>It is not for me to anticipate the recommendations for a change in the constitution by an extra-parliamentary body such as the President&#x2019;s Council. Until a different method of electing members to this House is agreed to, I can only confine myself to the present situation.</p>

<p>As the present constitution stands, the number of members of this House is 165. 55 of them come from the Cape; 20 from Natal; 14 from the Orange Free State and 76 from the Transvaal. As this was fixed for 10 years, this is of force and effect until 21 June 1983. Four members are nominated by the State President and eight are elected by proportional representation by members of Parliament.</p>

<p>A delimitation commission of three judges of at least five years&#x2019; standing is appointed not less than five years after, and not later than 10 years after, the last delimitation.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#allocation_of_electoral_divisions_to_provinces">

<heading>ALLOCATION OF ELECTORAL DIVISIONS TO PROVINCES</heading>

<p>I shall deal firstly with the effect of section 40(2) of the unequal number of voters required for an electoral division in South Africa, because the number of electoral divisions in effect can be fixed for up to 18 years because the Act came into effect in 1972 and the 14th delimitation can, as the law now stands, be valid until 1990.</p>

<p>I should point out that even before delimitation begins, the variations found as a result of Parliament fixing the number of electoral divisions according to provinces for 10 years, are so great that there has been and could be until 1990, an injustice to many voters of South Africa. If I mention the injustice to certain provinces, it is not because I favour one province or another. It is because it has caused these inequities, that the attention of this House must be drawn to them.</p>

<p>Let us start at the beginning with the original constitution of 1910.</p>

<p>It is with interest that I quote from &#x201C;The Inner History of the National Convention&#x201D; by Sir Edgar Walton, because no minutes were allowed to be taken at the National Convention so as not to preclude open discussion. He says on page 165&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Convention proceeded to deal with the more difficult question of representation of the various provinces in the House of Assembly.</block>

<p>On page 166 he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">General Smuts had proposed that representation be allotted to each province <span class="col_2795-2796" refersTo="page_1422"/>on the basis of the number of registered white voters in each &#x2026;</block>

<p>On page 168 he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Merriman speaking to the resolution No. 7 moved by General Smuts in favour of what was known as the voters basis, declared it to be unsound and not in accordance with the practice followed elsewhere. It opened the door to fraud and to the influence of wealth. The only sound basis of representation in his opinion was population.</block>

<p>On page 183 he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It was a dispute which cut across party interests and the feeling of the Bond, Het Volk and Unie was in opposition to that of the Progressives.</block>

<p>There was a Progressive Party even then.</p>

<p>The National Convention eventually compromised on the allocation of electoral divisions on the basis of population census statistics. This method remained in vogue until 1951. In the light of the tremendous population redistribution that has taken place, it is well to look at the latest publication of the Human Sciences Research Council, namely, &#x201C;Bevolkingsherverspreiding van RSA 1970-1980&#x201D;, because it shows the shifts in population since 1910 and the economic and demographic changes that have taken place especially in the last decade. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Bevolkingsherverspreiding binne die grense van &#x2019;n land of streek het verreikende sosio-ekonomiese en politieke implikasies.&#x201D;</block>

<block name="quote">Suid-Afrika het binne die relatief kort tydperk van minder as &#x2019;n 100 jaar van &#x2019;n primitiewe selfversorgingsekonomie na &#x2019;n markekonomie oorgeskakel, wat dramatiese verskuiwings in die verspreiding van bevolking en ekonomiese aktiwiteite tot gevolg gehad het.</block>

<block name="quote">Die landbousektor raak relatief steeds verder by ander sektore agter. Waar landbou in 1920 nog 22,5% tot die BBP bygedra het, het die bydrae in 1980 to 8,5% gedaal.</block>

<p>Because Parliament, in 1972, fixed the number of seats, it would be interesting to see what effect the 1980 census figures would have had if we still had delimitation and the allocation of seats to the provinces on the aforesaid basis. If, at the first delimitation, there had been 165 members in the first South African Parliament, the Cape would have had 75 members, Natal 13, Transvaal 54 and the Free State 23. If the 13th delimitation had been based on population, the Cape would have had 49 members, Natal 20, the Transvaal 83 and the Free State 13. If the 14th delimitation in 1980 had been based on population, the Cape would have had 46 members, Natal 21, the Transvaal 86 and the Free State 12.</p>

<p>It is well to note, at this stage, that in future a census will take place every five years. However, at present, the allocation of electoral divisions takes place on a voters&#x2019; roll basis. Let us therefore consider the situation as it is. If the 13th delimitation, instead of being on a fixed number basis, had been based on the number of voters, the Cape would have got 53 members, Natal 19, the Transvaal 80 and the Free State 13. In 1980 the situation would have been as follows: Cape 49, Natal 19, Transvaal 84 and the Free State 13. If one takes the figures at the end of December 1981, the Cape would get 48 members, Natal 19, Transvaal 85 and the Free State 13.</p>

<p>The report of the 14th Delimitation Commission was published in the <i>Government Gazette</i> on 3 October 1980, and it will be possible for it to be in force until 1990 with this present inadequate delimitation.</p>

<p>Let us examine some of the inequities, as stated in paragraph 6.4 of the report of the 14th Delimitation Commission. The quota for the four provinces, calculated as laid down in section 43 of the Constitution Act, comes to the following: Cape Province 12 626 voters, Natal 13 283, Orange Free State 12 863 and Transvaal 15 433.</p>

<p>If one looks at paragraph 6.5 of the Delimitation Commission&#x2019;s report one finds the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Your commission will not comment on the clear differences in the quotas and will merely make the following comparisons. The Transvaal&#x2019;s quota is 1 414 or 10% higher than the average number of voters per electoral division in the Republic. In the Cape Province, the Transvaal quota would have meant a load of 22,2%, in Natal a load of 16%, and in the Orange Free State a load of 19,9%. Conversely, this may be put as follows: In the Transvaal, the Cape Province&#x2019;s quota would have meant a deloading of 18,1%, Natal&#x2019;s quota a deloading of 13,9% and the Orange Free State&#x2019;s quota a deloading of 16,6%.</block>

<p>This House cannot in all conscience, ignore the inexorable trend and adopt a King Canute attitude against the rising tide of population redistribution. Surely, every province is entitled to adequate proportional representation in this House, whether this be based on population or on voters per province.</p>

<p>It is intolerable that this Parliament treats the various provinces unequally. There is no justification for this, as it is contrary to the principles of parliamentary representation and democracy. I trust the Government will soon amend the legislation and bring it into proper line.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#method_of_dividing_the_republic_into_electoral_divisions">

<heading>METHOD OF DIVIDING THE REPUBLIC INTO ELECTORAL DIVISIONS</heading>

<p>First of all a provincial quota must be established by dividing the number of votes by the number of seats. Each division should be as near the provincial quota as possible. Then there are seven factors that have to be taken into consideration, which I shall deal with presently. In addition, there can be a variation of 15% above or 15% below the quota, except where a constituency is more than 25 000 sq. kilometres in extent, in which case it can have a number of voters equal to 70% of the quota.</p>

<p>I wish to deal briefly with the seven factors, but I must just say that the interpretations of these factors by the various judges would fill volumes. First of all I should like to deal with the community or diversity of interests, the probability of increases or decreases in population, and local authority or <span class="col_2799-2800" refersTo="page_1424"/>magisterial district boundaries. Of these, the first creates difficulties in interpretation. I would recommend the use of the Statistical Main Regions, as laid down by the Department of Statistics, for these cover all three of these factors. I have a map here, a copy of which I shall have sent to every hon. member who takes part in this debate today. As hon. members will be able to see on this map, the basic unit of grouping is the magisterial district, one or more of which are combined to form a Statistical Region. Over the past two decades the magisterial districts have been redrawn as a result of representations to the Department of Justice. These Statistical Main Regions consist of a number of related adjoining magisterial districts.</p>

<p>Where Planning Regions are delineated, and do not extend over provincial boundaries, Statistical Regions agree with Planning Regions. The main application of this is that all our statistics today are calculated on this particular basis by the Department of Statistics, and these in turn are put into the Statistical Main Regions.</p>

<p>We have here an independent scientific system in which community of interests, particularly economic, and the probability of an increase or decrease in the population and in magisterial boundaries have been delineated, a system which did not exist at the time of the formation of the Union of South Africa in 1910. It is proposed that somehow the constitution or the Electoral Act be amended so that use can be made of these Statistical Regions for the future delimitation of constituencies.</p>

<p>It is my intention to use these Statistical Main Regions to elucidate the allocation of electoral divisions towards the end of my speech. The other factors that are of interest are means of communication, physical features and the boundaries of existing electoral divisions. These terms are self-explanatory.</p>

<p>I do, however, want to deal at greater length with the last one, which is the sparsity or density of population. Although the commission states that when a delimitation is done all seven factors determine the loading and deloading of an electoral division, it is in effect this factor that has determined the loading of urban divisions and the deloading of rural divisions.</p>

<p>Let us return to the National Convention of 1910 and read again from Walton&#x2019;s book. There were numerous and prolonged debates in an effort to define &#x201C;sparsity or density of population&#x201D;, but in the end, as the following quotation shows, the onus was passed on to the judges of the Delimitation Commission. On page 192 of his book Walton writes as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Convention, in fact, declines to give any definition of the words &#x201C;sparsity and density of population&#x201D; but preferred to leave the interpretation to the discretion of the judges themselves.</block>

<p>The first Delimitation Commission stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It appeared obvious, though not specifically laid down, that the intention was, in sparsely populated areas, that the Commission should endeavour to frame divisions containing a number of voters less, and in densely populated districts a number exceeding the quota.</block>

<p>This has been the principle of all subsequent commissions. At the first delimitation&#x2014;and this is very important to remember&#x2014;the number of rural and urban voters were about the same, so that loading and deloading were very near the quota. Now, with the urbanization of South Africa, it is possible to deload the rural constituencies almost to the maximum. Added to this, there are these large area divisions which can be deloaded to 70% of the quota.</p>

<p>Legislation changing the Constitution was introduced in 1965 for large area divisions. <i>Inter alia</i> these are some of the reasons given by the then Minister of the Interior for introducing the new legislation. I quote from Hansard (Hansard, Volume 15, column 7713)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The cause of the problem being combated by means of this Bill is, of course, the shift of voters from the rural areas to the towns.</block>

<block name="quote">The shift of voters from the rural areas to the towns has continued for many years now. The end of the process is not yet in sight, and the process itself is due to the industrialization of the Republic and the situation of minerals and other raw materials.</block>

<p><span class="col_2801-2802" refersTo="page_1425"/>Let me quote again from the Human Sciences Research Council&#x2019;s report that has just been published&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die Blanke se &#x201C;tweede Groot Trek&#x201D;, di&#x00E9; na die stede na die ontdekking van diamante en goud in die vorige eeu, duur onverpoosd voort. &#x2019;n Belangrike keerpunt is in 1931 bereik toe &#x2019;n absolute daling in die plattelandse bevolking plaasgevind het, deurdat meer as die jaarlikse natuurlike aanwas aan stedelike gebiede afgestaan is. Tydens die 1980-sensus was 88,7% van die totale Blanke bevolking in stedelike gebiede woonagtig.</block>

<p>This House cannot ignore two inexorable trends towards urbanization and the metropolitan growth points in South Africa. Therefore this House is deliberately penalizing growth and giving the voters and citizens of the metropolitan areas less representation than that to which they are entitled. The result is that this House does not truly reflect the distribution of the population or voters.</p>

<p>The 13th Delimitation Commission states in chapter 2 of its report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">3. As a result of the abolition of De Aar, which had been a special electoral division, your Commission could, <i>inter alia,</i> create two more special divisions, viz. Aliwal and Cradock. As would appear from the report of the 12th Delimitation Commission, the electoral divisions of the platteland are already so large that it is not desirable that the platteland should surrender more electoral divisions to the urban areas than is necessary. Your Commission, therefore, found that where one electoral division on the platteland disappeared, it was unnecessary to surrender another rural division, if two electoral divisions, which had not previously been special electoral divisions, were to be converted into a special division.</block>

<p>In other words, if one loses one division, it is possible to create two divisions. What the Delimitation Commission is saying is that the more an area becomes depopulated, and the more wide-spread the voters, the more special electoral divisions it is possible to create. Surely the aim of Parliament is to create electoral divisions where the population and therefore the voters are growing.</p>

<p>The anomaly is that as the number of voters diminishes due to the depopulation of this area, it will be possible to create even larger area seats at the expense of the growing urban areas, because an area exceeding 25 000 sq. km. can enjoy a 30% deloading.</p>

<p>I now want to quote from <i>How Democracries Vote</i> by Enid Lakamen, because everybody says: &#x201C;&#x2019;n Verteenwoordiger moet sy mense gaan sien, sy mense besoek.&#x201D; Lakamen states the following&#x2014;</p>

<p>This can best be demonstrated by showing the inequitable anomaly created by deloading, and this can be done by comparing 13 electoral divisions adjoining each other in the Karoo and Northern Cape with 13 electoral divisions adjoining each other in Pretoria. Furthermore, all 26 seats have members who were elected from the same political party in the 1981 election.</p>

<p>Therefore, to delimit the average division in the Karoo requires 10 000 voters while Pretoria requires 16 000 voters.</p>

<p>What is the situation in the various provinces with regard to the urban population, viz. the people living in cities, towns and villages, because those are urban people? In the Cape Province only 4,4% of the population live in magisterial districts where the rural population exceeds the urban population. For Natal the figure is 5,3%, for Transvaal 7,3% and for the Orange Free State 11,3%. The Transvaal, therefore, actually has more rural people than urban people but it is still penalized. It would appear that, although in area the Cape Province has the biggest and most sparsely populated electoral divisions, it has the lowest percentage of population living in magisterial areas where the rural population exceeds the urban population. Therefore it would appear as if the Cape Province consists of a larger proportion of urban places with small rural populations in between. That gives the lie to the myth that there are these constituencies extending over large areas. One does have them, but it is the towns that are far apart from one another. It is indeed interesting to examine many of the magisterial areas in the so-called large electoral divisions which exceed 25 000 sq. kilometres to discover the phenomenon of urbanization. These statistics show that in 1980 the so-called rural areas were predominantly peopled by persons living in small towns and villages rather than by farmers living on the land.</p>

<p>There is another thing that is puzzling to me and that is that delimitation commissions have always included Black homelands with a handful of White voters to obtain areas exceeding 25 000 sq. kilometers. Surely, as Black homelands elect their own representative bodies and the White voters in those homelands are now registered in the nearest magistracy as the crow flies, these should not be included in any delimitation.</p>

<p>Loading and deloading of electoral divisions shows discrimination between White voters who live in different areas, even though this may have had historical origins.</p>

<p>I want to put this question: What makes a South African voter who has been registered until the age of, say, 30 in Prieska inferior as soon as he registers in Wonderboom or Waterkloof? It is amazing to me how it is that, when he goes to live in a city like Pretoria, he suddenly becomes inferior in this sense.</p>

<p>The formation of the large-area seats brings into even greater focus the need to eliminate the so-called loading and deloading of electoral divisions. It is very easy to talk of not agreeing with &#x201C;one vote, one value&#x201D;, but this legislature is dependent on the voter for its very existence.</p>

<p>The 13th Delimitation Commission set it out very plainly when it said that the sparsity and density of population is the greatest indication that more voters are allocated to urban divisions than to rural divisions. Today, with the greater urbanization, the urban voter, because of loading of urban constituencies, is under-represented in Parliament while urban problems have assumed a major role in South Africa, particularly as the migration from rural areas to urban areas has taken place not only among the White people in South Africa but large numbers of Blacks, Coloureds and Indians have also come to live in the urban areas. Parliament must face the inevitable fact that there is no end to the trend of migration from rural to urban areas. We are now living in 1982 and not in 1910. There is really no need any longer to discriminate against the voter depending upon where he lives. Therefore I should like the whole question of loading and deloading to be eliminated altogether and for the judges to try to bring each constituency as near as possible to the provincial quota.</p>

<p>In conclusion, where would the electoral divisions be if there had been no loading and deloading and the allocation of divisions had been on a voters&#x2019; roll basis at the time of the 14th delimitation? I have given certain hon. members a copy of the map I have here, and those who have it can have a look at it.</p>

<p>I should now like to deal with the distribution of electoral divisions in Statistical Main Regions. They are as follows&#x2014;</p>

<p>Surely the members of this House would then be more representative of South Africa as a whole, with every member feeling that he is elected on the same basis. There would also be no discrimination against voters, wherever they may be.

<from>*Dr, <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. A. ODENDAAL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout presented us with a considerable number of maps, histograms, tables and I do not know what else. I do not want to deal with this, but with the slogan that he used for the principle according to which he wants the democracy in South Africa to function, viz. &#x201C;one vote, one belly&#x201D;. Translated into Afrikaans, this is &#x201C;een stem, een gewigswaarde&#x201D;. This immediately brings to mind the Van der Merwe story that the hon. the leader of the NP in the Free State so often uses. It is the one about the aircraft. The American mentioned the Boeing that can transport 450 passengers in luxury conditions directly from New York to Los Angeles. The Englishman spoke about the Concorde that they were building there, and said if one boards the aircraft after breakfast, one arrives in Washington in time for the same breakfast. Koos van der Merwe then mentioned the frigate that we are building in South Africa. Then the American said: &#x201C;But surely a frigate is not an aircraft; it is a ship.&#x201D; Van der Merwe replied: &#x201C;Oh, that is why they could not get it off the ground.&#x201D; I very much doubt whether the system that the hon. member <span class="col_2809-2810" refersTo="page_1429"/>for Bezuidenhout submitted to us here today, is ever going to get off the ground.</p>

<p>I feel that there are two important requirements with which the mechanism according to which the democracy in South Africa should function, should comply. The first is that the opinion of the voting corps must be reflected in the representation of members of various political parties in the policy-making bodies in all three tiers of government, i.e. parliamentary, provincial and municipal. The hon. member has no fault to find with this. On the contrary, this is more or less what he is suggesting. The second requirement is that individual voters or groups of voters have the right to effective representation in all three tiers of government. That is, voters must have free access to public representation. Does the hon. member agree with this second requirement? Does he believe that voters should have the right to access to their representatives?</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. A. ODENDAAL</person>:</from>

<p>I think that this is the hon. member&#x2019;s problem, viz. that voters should not have access to their representatives. That is why the hon. member does not want to reply to it at this stage.</p>

<p>I want to make another statement, viz. that these two requirements should carry equal weight in the method of public representation, and I intend to motivate these statements further. A system of proportional representation according to which the participating parties are allocated seats on basis <i>pro rata</i> to the number of votes that each party has gained in an election, complies best with the first requirement that I stated. I know this is not what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout was advocating, but it is a system that will best comply with the former requirement. This system, however, does not satisfy the second requirement of the right to effective representation. However, a system of representation according to constituencies can do this. Apart from participation in the Government, the above-mentioned two requirements also place a responsibility on a representative to put his unselfish service at the disposal of his voters. The area of constituency and the consequent distances that must be travelled by a representative, can in fact have a considerable influence on the quality of representation, i.e. the quality of service which a public representative is physically able to render.</p>

<p>That is true, Waterberg is big.</p>

<p>I have studied the map and have tried to establish what the distance between the two furthest points are in the constituency of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. I do not want to be unfair, but I think the furthest distance is approximately five kilometres.</p>

<p>In peak traffic it probably takes the hon. member ten minutes to drive from one point to the other.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to certain constituencies in the Cape. I do not want to refer to constituencies such as Namaqualand, Prieska or Beaufort West because I am not very well acquainted with these constituencies. However, I think the hon. member for Fauresmith will allow me to refer to his constituency. It is a constituency in the Free State and it is one of the constituencies that I know fairly well. The distance between the two furthest points in that constituency is approximately 350 km. It takes a representative five hours to travel from one point to the other in the constituency. It is true that it is probably possible to make use of aircraft in such constituencies, but I think there are very few hon. members in the House who can afford to run their own aircraft.</p>

<p>It is also true that the Fauresmith constituency consists of 14 community centres that each require attention on their own. These different communities each have their own basic infrastructure just as any business enterprise has its own infrastructure. Whether it has a turnover of R10 000 per annum or a turnover of R10 million per annum, it is as plain as a pikestaff that such a business enterprise cannot exist without someone who makes tea. There must be a receptionist and there must be a manager at least. Similarly, each one of these smaller communities has its own municipality. I should like to know from the hon. member for Bezuidenhout how many municipalities there are in his constituency.</p>

<p>This means that approximately 4% of Johannesburg&#x2019;s wards fall within the Bezuidenhout constituency. The point that I want to make&#x2014;I do not want us to wrangle about the number of wards&#x2014;is that he has the responsibility of only a fraction of the obligations that a municipality generally imposes upon a representative. Now that he is a member of the House of Assembly, I wonder how many problems he has with the municipality of Johannesburg. He was a member himself and he had many problems at the time.</p>

<p>I wonder whether in his entire argument this afternoon in which he referred to depopulation in the rural areas and the extremely small contribution that those rural areas make towards the population figures and the small contribution that agriculture makes towards the economy of the country, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout wants the infrastructure in the rural areas to collapse completely. I wonder whether this is really what he is aiming at.</p>

<p>The Fauresmith constituency has 16 schools. I do not know how many schools there are in Bezuidenhout but I do not think there could be nearly the same number. Each one of these schools has its own problems, its own school committee, its own requirements and its own time that it demands from the MPC in question who deals with it in this case. Each of these 14 communities has its own hospital or at least its own clinic. I do not know how many hospitals or clinics there are in the Bezuidenhout constituency. In the rural areas in particular, there are farmers&#x2019; associations and other farmers&#x2019; organizations that the urban representative does not have to deal with at all. This places an even greater burden on the rural representative. The proposals that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout made, may indeed lead to a better proportional representation but it is definitely going to detract from the right to effective representation, the right that a voter has to effective representation. I just want to say that I think that any system according to which a democracy should function will have to maintain a healthy balance between the two requirements that I have stated and not bear only one in mind as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout wants to suggest.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if this House were a school debating society, I might as well have supported the hon. member for Bezuidenhout in his motion. If we had a dual system of representation in South Africa, namely, single member constituencies and proportional representation for a portion of the member of this House, we could also debate that reasonably and intelligently. However, we are in fact dealing with a single member constituency system. This motion refers to a single member constituency system. I want first to deal with the system that we have in South Africa. I shall deal with the question of proportionality later.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout has been riding this hobby-horse for as long as I have known him. I have heard him put it to delimitation commission after delimitation commission and I once used to think myself that it was a good academic idea&#x2014;that all constituencies should be more or less equal. This was what I thought until I tried to do a delimitation and got down to the practical reality of dividing South Africa into X number of constituencies. One finds then that the position is completely different. As far as I can discover, in every Western democratic country where there is a single member constituency system under which people vote for <span class="col_2813-2814" refersTo="page_1431"/>an MP by name, there is a departure from the voter average in the delimitation of such constituency. This goes far further than in South Africa. In America, for instance, one can have constituencies that vary by more than 50% from each other in their number of voters and there are also vast differences in constituencies in the United Kingdom&#x2014; 33% to 40% is not unusual. In Canada and in Australia and wherever the single member constituency system is applied, it is applied with a departure from the mean average of voters necessary if one is required to have exact proportionality in those constituencies. Those countries have fewer problems than South Africa.</p>

<p>Let us look at the situation in South Africa. We have 14 constituencies with a surface area of over 25 000 sq. km. We have one with a surface of 103 323 sq. km. Over 100 000 sq. km for one constituency for one member of Parliament! There are 10 in the Cape, one in the Orange Free State and three in the Transvaal&#x2014;these are all constituencies with an area in excess of 25 000 sq. km.</p>

<p>If one were to take that 103 323 sq. km constituency and try to bring the number of voters in it up to average quota&#x2014;the average for the number of voters divided by the number of electoral divisions&#x2014;it would become totally ridiculous; it is almost ricidulous enough as it is for the area of some constituencies.</p>

<p>Therefore when one has to consider a motion such as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout has moved, one has to look at the principle of whether one intends voters to be represented in Parliament or whether one intends political parties to be represented. This is one&#x2019;s choice. If one is going to go for proportionality, one seeks to have political parties represented and not voters. The system we follow is that voters vote for a member of Parliament who will represent them. As long as you are voting for a member of Parliament to represent you as a voter, then the authorities have to make it possible for that representation to be applied effectively. It cannot be applied if one is going to take the theoretical arguments of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. It just is not realistic; it is just not on.</p>

<p>I wonder how much constituency work the hon. member for Bezuidenhout gets. I know how much I get from a small urban constituency, but has he any concept of what a rural MP has to do? Such an MP may have 15 or 20 local towns, every one with a farmers&#x2019; association, a town board, a school, a hospital, etc. It becomes an impossible job. The hon. member should ask my colleagues here, the hon. members for Umhlanga and South Coast and in the case of Mooi River it is even much worse. He should also ask hon. members on that side.</p>

<p>It is a lovely dream, but if voters are to be represented properly, then one has to make it possible for that representation to be effective. That is why I say that one can consider&#x2014;I would be happy to debate it&#x2014;a system where one has, say, 100 single member MPs and 50 proportionately represented. One will then get one&#x2019;s direct representation and one will also get closer to proportionality in the overall strength of the seats.</p>

<p>I now want to come back to the purpose of the motion which is to establish a proportional basis. I am sorry the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is not here, because I want to discuss this matter very seriously. It is the policy of his party&#x2014;I accept that&#x2014;as set out in its own official policy document presented to the Constitutional Commission, and as it was supported in the Buthelezi Commission, that there should be proportionate representation. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The PFP stands for a system of proportional representation in the election of members to the legislature, based on the principle that each adult will have the same voting rights as any other adult and be free to associate with or support any party.</block>

<p>It is also correct and I believe that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout agrees, when he talks of his regionalization, means all races being represented on a common voters&#x2019; roll on a proportional basis. It goes further, and in paragraph 4.6.4 we read the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The PFP believes that the principle of proportional representation should also apply to the executive arm of Government.</block>

<p>That is their policy. It was what they supported in the Buthelezi Commission: An Executive with proportional representation for <span class="col_2815-2816" refersTo="page_1432"/>White, Coloured, Zulu, Indian. This is what they believe in. This is what they stand for. This is what they have just fought an election on in Johannesburg. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said so in this House. He said: &#x201C;We will fight on our policy&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Last night, in the city council of Johannesburg, the NRP, through its one councillor, caused a proportionally representative executive management committee for Johannesburg to be elected consisting of two Nationalists, one Independent and three PFP members. This is also proportional to the votes cast as well as proportional to the wards held. We decided to apply PFP policy. In terms of that policy there should be a proportional executive, and so we voted for it. Our one determining vote elected a proportionally appointed management committee for Johannesburg: The ratio is 2:1:3.</p>

<p>Do they deny that?</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>They cannot deny it. So, what did that party do? Their three members promptly resigned. [Interjections.] The first opportunity the PFP have ever had to apply proportional representation at executive level is used by them for a demonstration of political intolerance, for a boycott of management in the Johannesburg city council. [Interjections.] This makes a mockery of all their protestations. If they cannot in Johannesburg apply and effectively accept proportional representation between White political parties, White councillors, in the Johannesburg city council, and they cannot assist in achieving consensus between White parties, how on earth are they going to rule South Africa by proportional representation with the divergence of opinion varying from Mandela to Jaap Marais? [Interjections.] That is the sort of scope involved: Mandela to Jaap Marais in one Government. But that party is going to rule South Africa by proportional representation and with a proportional executive! The PFP has, however, run away from its first test. It has run away from its first opportunity to apply its own policy in order to take boycott action against the administration of that city. [Interjections.] It reveals their policy as a monstrous confidence trick on the voters of South Africa. [Interjections.] The people of South Africa will now know what the promises and the policies of the PFP mean when it comes to applying them. If I am wrong, I appeal to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to say to his Johannesburg city councillors: &#x201C;It is our policy to take part in executive government on a proportional basis&#x201D;. In the total number of votes cast, the PFP got a minority&#x2014;38 000-odd against 43 000. So they are getting more than their share with half the management, they are getting more than they are entitled to by proportional representation. I appeal to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to give his party a chance to take part in the government of Johannesburg on the basis of proportional representation.</p>

<p>In the minute or two left to me, I want to deal with the other aspect of this motion, and that is the proposal by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout in paragraph (b)(i) of his motion&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(b) amending section 43 of the said Act in respect of&#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(i) the provisions regarding the calculation of provincial quotas.</li>

</ol></li>

</ol>

<p>This is very interesting because section 43 does not refer to provincial quotas. There is no reference to provincial quotas. Nevertheless, the hon. member wants to amend a provision which is not even there! What he actually wants to amend is the fixed number of constituencies per province. That is what he wants to amend but that is in section 40.</p>

<p>That was a deal, an arrangement made between all parties in order to prevent total under-representation because of population movement. The PFP believes in the protection of minority groups. Here the PFP is again demonstrating against an allocation of seats which ensure loaded representation in respect of minorities. It is demonstrating against that in order to ensure majority domination by the majority party. Again we have here a party that claims it wants to protect minorities, but when minority groups in rural areas and in small provinces are protected by legislation, the PFP wants to do away with that; they want a strictly proportional representation so that the majority will dominate. Majority rule is in fact what they stand for. It is majority rule.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am interested in that interjection by the hon. member for Durban Central. I am interested in that interjection coming from a party that sees a &#x201C;miracle of reconciliation in Zimbabwe&#x201D;. Yet it is not prepared to seek reconciliation between White and White in Johannesburg. I am not interested in that sort of party. I can assure the hon. member for Durban Central that I do not only not intend to join them but I shall never join them because I believe in a party which stands by its principles, which says what it stands for and sticks to it. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>This House will have to look at section 40 of the Constitution again in 1983. That will be the time to look realistically at the allocation of seats per province. We oppose the motion moved by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_staden">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. VAN STADEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not think it is possible for me to agree more wholeheartedly with the hon. member for Durban Point than I do today. He has proved that he is living in the tradition of this House.</p>

<p>The PFP amazes me with this motion. They are the national convention party. Now we simply have to hear how contemptuous their remarks are about the National Convention of 1909. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout referred to the proposals that the National Convention made in 1909. I am convinced that should the motion of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout have formed the basis of discussion at the National Convention of 1909, the Union of South Africa would never have come into being.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout referred to one book only, the one by Walton. However, I want to refer him to the diary of the late Senator F. S. Malan. Senator Malan made notes from day to day on what happened at the National Convention. The things that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout wants deleted from the Constitution today, are those very things for which the convention strived at the time. Without the addition of those proposals, a Union of South Africa would never have come into being.</p>

<p>The PFP&#x2019;s approach to this matter is, I find, very strange. It has been the tradition of this House since the earliest times that a Select Committee be appointed on matters relating to Constitution and elections. Every change is brought to this House by a Select Committee. If I had to word this motion, I would not have asked the Government simply to delete these sections. I would have asked that a Select Committee be appointed in due course to deal with the matter.</p>

<p>No, I shall not support that hon. member&#x2019;s motions, because he wants to drag his Prog policy in at the back door. [Interjection.]</p>

<p>Every Government has maintained the tradition that Select Committees deal with these matters. This was the case in the time of the United Party. In 1946&#x2014;I just want to mention a few examples&#x2014;there was a Select Committee that consolidated the Electoral Laws. In 1962 there was also the Select Committee on the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa under the chairmanship of the late Mr. Paul Sauer. Sir De Villiers Graaff also served on that committee and the late Mr. Mitchell served on it too.</p>

<p>Oh, sorry. However, he served on it. Unanimity was reached and do hon. members know how little was deleted from the South Africa Act of 1909? That Act was carried over practically as it was, with changes of words only. Therefore, all Governments act with circumspection when it comes to the Constitution and Electoral Laws. In 1973 we had the Select Committee on which the hon. member for Durban Point served. He is the only surviving member on the Opposition side who served on that committee. The committee published a unanimous report and formulated legislation, and all the stages of that legislation were passed unanimously by this Parliament. Therefore it is in fact that proposals of those committee members that have been laid down in legislation, which that hon. member and the other members of the PFP are now opposing and want to eliminate. The constituencies are fixed until 1983. Then it will be time to act again. It is not at all necessary now. We held an election last year and the year before that we had a delimitation. Therefore we cannot look at this matter prior to the next delimitation.</p>

<p>No, not necessarily. A delimitation may take place every five years. Therefore there could be a delimitation in 1984 again. There is nothing to prevent it, not the Act or the Constitution.</p>

<p>However, I find it interesting that they want to eliminate these provisions regarding loading and deloading. During the National Convention the largest number of voters were in the rural areas. Then the distribution was inverted. The largest number were in the rural areas and by far the smallest number in the cities. In spite of that fact the convention laid down the loading and deloading of constituencies in the Constitution. This was done in order to make it possible for South Africa to become a Union. It was done to protect the smaller provinces. If it had not been done, the Union would never have come into being. That Prog party, which is a convention party, has no policy. That party still has to establish a policy by way of a national convention. It must be done at the national convention that they still want to hold. I want to ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition who is going to believe that party after this. Even if they succeed in holding a national convention, who is going to believe that they would adhere to the decisions of that convention?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. VAN STADEN</person>:</from>

<p>That is not true. We complied with the two entrenched clauses in every respect. [Interjections.] That hon. member is simply babbling. He does not know what he is talking about. I ask: Who is ever going to believe those people again? They want to introduce their policy into the House in an undercover manner, as the hon. member for Durban Point very clearly indicated.</p>

<p>The Select Committee of 1973 reached unanimity. Similarly, most of the Select Committees have reached unanimity over the years. However, there has never been equality. There was no equality in 1909. As there was inequality between the constituencies with regard to loading and deloading, there was inequality between the provinces as well. The hon. member laid a great deal of emphasis on the quotas of the provinces, but the Cape and Natal had Coloured and Black voters and those voters were never included in the provincial quotas. A Union-wide quota was established by the Delimitation Commission. Following that the Cape had to include its Coloured and Black voters, with the result that over the years the provincial quota of the Cape was always higher than that of any other province. The Coloured voters could be divided into five or six constituencies. However, there was a great deal of respect for the Constitution of South Africa and for the agreement at the convention of 1909. Gen. Hertzog was never amenable to the Coloured voters being included. Nor was Gen. Smuts amenable to this. When the Select Committee was appointed in 1946, we spoke to former Senator Jack Loock, who was the secretary of the UP, and told him: &#x201C;After all you are as unwilling to delimitate as we are: Ask your Government to change the Act&#x201D;. However, Gen. Smuts refused point blank. This has <span class="col_2821-2822" refersTo="page_1435"/>been the standpoint since 1910 and today we have here revelation of a party that does not have traditions. It is a party without traditions and this country cannot believe it. It is a party that does not have a word of honour.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. D. K. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, whilst I was listening to the hon. member Mr. Van Staden, and the previous speaker, the hon. member for Durban Point, I had to admit to myself that it is very pleasant to listen to two such old hands at party politics, particularly when it comes to this specific matter. The hon. member Mr. Van Staden is a person with a great deal of experience in this matter that he has gained over several years. It was interesting to hear how he delved into the past. This applies to the hon. member for Durban Point as well. In addition, I want to say that it is pleasant to be able to have rather interesting discussions on a Friday afternoon once again. At least it keeps one awake.</p>

<p>I want to come to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. In spite of all the criticism that has been expressed against him, I want to say that his motion nevertheless has possibilities for extremely interesting debating this afternoon. I do not think that one can simply shoot it down as such. Over the years the hon. member for Bezuidenhout has shown a great deal of interest in this specific facet of our system of Government. That is why not only is it interesting, but it is a good thing that the attention of the House should be drawn to this matter in this particular way once again this afternoon. When this Act was amended previously, I participated in that particular debate on 25 March 1980. At that stage, as a member of the previous Select Committee, I expressed certain ideas and the principles that I have laid down for myself once again. One of these is that historically we have four provinces. For me personally, the four provinces have real value and significance in their historical origin and their existence today. As far as I am concerned, I would not like the four provinces to disappear. It would be interesting to know what the new constitutional proposals will entail and in what respect we will retain this specific system. It was my personal standpoint and that of the party at the time, and it remains mine today, that the principle of a minimum number of seats per province should be maintained. In doing so, we would also maintain the special history and the evolution of the Union at the time. This is what we took over to a large extent when we became a Republic. Therefore as far as I am concerned, I should like to have it accepted as part of any further proposals or subsequent principles that the various provinces would be guaranteed a minimum number of seats.</p>

<p>The second principle that I advocate strongly, is the question of the loading and deloading of constituencies. I think there is a healthy phenomenon in the parliamentary system in South Africa, viz. that although a member of Parliament is elected according to the principles of the specific party&#x2019;s programme of principles, he represents those voters too. In addition, it is not all the voters in one&#x2019;s constituency only. I think it should also be made more simple for the voter to have access to his representative and vice versa, viz. that it should be made easier for the representative to have access to his voters as well. That is why I should like to associate myself in this respect with the hon. member Dr. Odendaal who spoke earlier on. In the evolution of every country&#x2019;s constitutional, parliamentary system and its politics there are certain reasons why things are done in a specific way. I think we must tell our inhabitants and the voters in the rural areas that we do not want to deprive them of their right to participate in and have a say in this process.</p>

<p>Then there was the third principle that I stated and which I still advocate today, and this is that we must accept that during certain periods&#x2014;shorter or longer periods&#x2014; there will be growth in specific provinces or areas. I think that we will have to take this principle into account as well. When on the one hand one guarantees a minimum number of seats per constituency and this inherently guarantees the good representation of the voters in the rural areas, on the other hand one must also include the growth possibilities for those areas and those provinces where growth is in fact taking place.</p>

<p>That is why I think it may be necessary in the future, as the hon. the Minister deems fit, to appoint a Select Committee once again in order to investigate this particular matter. I think that a Select Committee could look at the entire matter with good <span class="col_2823-2824" refersTo="page_1436"/>effect at this stage, as well as at the standpoints of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, <i>inter alia.</i> I am saying this because changes and movements lie ahead in the politics of South Africa today. I do not think that the members of the PFP were involved in the previous Select Committee. I think that this is one reason why we could appoint a Select Committee once again. Another reason is the fact that extraordinary growth has taken place in the Transvaal. I think that hon. members of the other provinces will agree that the growth in the Transvaal has been so extensive that an unbiased look should be taken at the situation once again.</p>

<p>There is a third reason, too. A regular critical investigation into our entire system by a parliamentary Select Committee is a healthy principle. Every three, four or five years, as circumstances justify, a new Parliament with its new members should investigate the matter once again.</p>

<p>The final remark that I want to make, is that I trust that this future Select Committee will approach the matter in the spirit of harmony that usually prevails in Select Committees. If one looks at the programme of principles of the various political parties in the House&#x2014;of ours as Independents, too&#x2014;one must accept that moments of tension such as those which the hon. member for Durban Point built into his debating with the hon. member for Bezuidenhout this afternoon, may in fact arise. The representatives of the various political groups in Parliament should in fact serve on such a Select Committee with a positive attitude.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. VAN R. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the approach of the hon. member for Rissik, which provides for minimum guarantees linked to provision for growth, is a reasonable approach to this matter, a sensitive matter which could very easily provoke sensitive feelings among provinces. The hon. member will excuse me, however, if I do not react to him further because my time is fairly limited.</p>

<p>&#x2020;In contrast to the approach of the hon. member for Rissik, the speed with which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout sought to capitalize politically on the population distribution trend towards the cities by proposing far-reaching changes to our electoral system, displays the despair felt by the PFP of ever winning the support of the platteland voters of South Africa. Their only hope of ever becoming a significant political force in this country is intimately linked to the creation of ever more constituencies in affluent suburbs of our cities.</p>

<p>The hon. member&#x2019;s motion is deceptively worded. On the face of it, little more is being sought than a truer reflection of the voter distribution in the allocation of constituencies. However, our present provisions for periodic redelimitation already provide for that. In essence this motion is a move away from area representation in the direction of proportional representation. In that respect it touches on the very foundation of our electoral system.</p>

<p>The heavy emphasis the hon. member places on numerical considerations and the &#x201C;one vote, one value&#x201D; concept is indicative of an over-simplification of our system of representation. For, although our parliamentary system provides for periodic adjustments of numbers and distribution of seats to allow for population distribution trends, we have a system of area representation. This is simply a different wording to what the hon. member for Durban Point called &#x201C;single representative constituencies&#x201D;. This is a system of area representation rather than quota representation. Consequently, the disparity in voter content between urban and country constituencies reflects a deliberate and a historically well-founded means of compensation for the disadvantages imposed upon the non-urban representative by distances and poor communications. Far from being symptoms of imperfect representation, these disparities are in fact balances aimed at correcting natural imbalances due to population distribution. Indeed, at least four of the seven criteria for delimitation laid down in the Constitution, criteria which the mover of this motion does not propose to have deleted, give expression to this bias. I refer to the reference to means of transportation, natural characteristics, density or sparsity of population and local authority and magisterial district boundaries.</p>

<p>As the hon. member Mr. Van Staden has indicated, this system in South Africa was part of the contract of Union. This is illustrated by Prof. Verloren van Themaat and Prof. Marinus Wiechers in their standard <span class="col_2825-2826" refersTo="page_1437"/>work <i>Staatsreg</i> on page 326. They refer here to &#x201C;plattelandse kiesafdelings met minder as die kwota en stedelike kiesafdelings met meer&#x201D; and say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dit is in ooreenstemming met die bedoeling van die Nasionale Konvensie met die totstandkoming van die Unie. Die Kaapkolonie en die Oranje-Vrystaat het destyds daarop aangedring dat plattelandse kiesafdelings meer verteenwoordiging moet kry. Daartoe is dan ook ooreengekom. &#x2019;n Basis van Unie is dien ten gevolge die effens groter gewig van die plattelandse stem en die stelsel van gebiedsverteenwoordiging waardeur elke kiesafdeling een lid kies.</block>

<p>In a footnote they have this to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dit is &#x2019;n kenmerk van die parlementêre stelsel sowel by ons as in Engeland en di&#x00E9; wat dit veroordeel, veroordeel daarmee daardie stelsel.</block>

<p>This basis of representation was arrived at after careful consideration at the time of the National Convention, and the merits of proportional representation were taken into account. In this regard, the authors say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hoewel die Nasionale Konvensie voor Unie oorspronklik &#x2019;n beperkte stelsel van eweredige verteenwoordiging voorgestaan het, is ten slotte op gebiedsverteenwoordiging besluit, en tereg. Die parlementêre stelsel is op die beginsel van gebiedsverteenwoordiging opgebou en werk nie goed waar daar eweredige verteenwoordiging bestaan nie.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, even in Britain where our electoral system basically evolved, both provisions which the motion seeks to abolish were retained, i.e. protection for the numerically smaller provinces and the loading and deloading of constituencies. In his book <i>The Electoral System in Britain since 1918,</i> Prof. Butler of Oxford, one of the leading British constitutional experts, deals with the representation of Scotland, Wales and Ireland. In this regard Prof. Butler states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Apart from the attempt to respect local boundaries, two other exceptions have been made to the principle of numerical equality. The first is the special treatment accorded to Wales, Scotland and Ireland. In 1917 the problem was met by the creation of extra seats.</block>

<p>He then proceeds to give particulars in this regard. As far as departures from the electoral quota are concerned, on page 214 of his book Prof. Butler refers to the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One of the rules for redistribution to be observed by the commission provided that the electorate of a constituency should not be greater or less than the electoral quota.</block>

<p>That is the general principle. He goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This electoral quota should not be exceeded by more than approximately 25%.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is 10% more than our constitution allows. He states further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In practice &#x2026;</block>

<p>And this is important&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; this limitation was found to be far too rigid and in 1946 the Government decided to replace it by a more elastic instruction.</block>

<p>If such norms are observed in Britain, which is a densely populated country with a homogeneous electorate, the argument in favour of their retention is certainly far more commanding in South Africa with its enormous distances and heavy concentration of voters in four metropolitan areas.</p>

<p>Time does not permit me to deal with the movement towards proportionate representation which the hon. mover of this motion has in mind. However, I should just like to refer to our actual population distribution as indicated in the 1980 census. On our present population figures, if a system of proportional representation were to be introduced, such a system would result in 88% or 145 of the 165 directly elected MPs representing urban and suburban constituencies. Were the rest of South Africa to be represented by a mere 20 members of Parliament and were <span class="col_2827-2828" refersTo="page_1438"/>they to represent 96% of the area of South Africa, it would not be a case, as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said, of the urban areas being under-represented, but of 96% of the total area being vastly under-represented. After all, the census of 1980 also revealed that our urbanized population lived on 4% of the area of the country.</p>

<p>At present the ratio in this House is roughly 105 to 60. Far from the urban areas being under-represented, as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout claims, I suggest that every single issue of particular importance to city dwellers can be fully and adequately catered for by such representation in this Parliament.</p>

<p>I have not even touched on the practical difficulties, on the almost impossible task of accommodating all seven delimitation requirements in the narrow confines of the electoral quota whether it be provincial or national. I have also not referred to the already onerous task of a country representative in offering his voters effective and fair representation, an experience that I myself had in the Natal Provincial Council for nine years. Other speakers have done so and will do so. The hon. member Mr. Van Staden has and I have no doubt that the hon. the Deputy Minister will deal with the customary procedures to be followed in debates of this nature.</p>

<p>I believe, however, that I have shown that our present electoral machinery is part of our system of parliamentary government. If the whole system should be reviewed, the necessary means to do so have been created but, until such time as that happens, this is the electoral basis which is the result of an evolution which has stretched over centuries. It is the result of very careful consideration and it is a system which by and large serves our country well.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I believe the House is indebted to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout who, in introducing this motion, initiated a discussion on a subject which is quite clearly dear to the heart of many hon. members, but which is clearly not yet resolved. I believe that in the course of the next few years we are going to see changes in our whole electoral process, our whole electoral system. It is well that on occasions such as this the House considers seriously alternatives to the present single member constituency system which we have.</p>

<p>Hon. members on the other side, the hon. member who has just sat down as well as the hon. member Mr. Van Staden, have dwelt heavily on the 1909 Convention and the agreement at the time of Union. They pointed out that there was an agreement reached at Union and therefore this should be a dominant factor in the year 1982 or the years to come. Of course there were areas of compromise at the time of Union. At the time of Union there was a Senate which was part of a compromise. In the Senate there was equal representation for the provinces, but in the 1960s this House abolished the equal representation for the provinces and went on to proportional representation for the provinces. This is what the House did, as the hon. member for Umlazi will know. He quoted that in 1909 it was agreed that the provinces should have a certain fixed representation, but he knows that it was only to apply for ten years. He knows that the Act said that this arrangement should apply for the first ten years.</p>

<p>He also knows that until 1973 as amongst the provinces there was proportional representation. Right up to 1973 the provinces were allocated seats on the basis of the number of voters divided by the Republic quota. That was the position right up until 1973, and it was only in 1973 that we went on to a new fixed, disproportionate number of seats for each of the provinces. In 1973 we introduced a new element. Therefore, for the sake of those people who believe in sticking by tradition, let me reiterate that in as far as the representation of provinces is concerned&#x2014;I am not dealing with the loading or deloading of constituencies, but as amongst provinces&#x2014;there was proportional representation until 1973. It was only in that year that we departed from it. All we are saying is that we should go back to the sound system according to which seats generally should be composed of the same number of voters, while between the provinces there should be proportional representation depending upon the number of registered voters in each province. It is not <span class="col_2829-2830" refersTo="page_1439"/>breaking new ground. It is going back to the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act. I with some of the other hon. members were here when we voted for the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act in 1961 which set up the Republic of South Africa. We voted for proportionality between the provinces. All we say, therefore, is that we should go back to the principle that was the foundation of the Republic, and not to the 1973 arrangement for a disproportional dispensation.</p>

<p>A number of hon. members, and particularly the hon. member Dr. Odendaal and the hon. member for Durban Point, raised the problem of large constituencies. We do not deny that there are certain practical difficulties, but can one compare the difficulties in representing rural or even semi-rural seats in 1910 with those in representing those seats in 1982? In 1910 there were no aircraft to fly in. There was a very inferior telephone communication system. One could not move easily from one part of the country to the other, and yet the system worked. Why is it that now suddenly in 1982, with all the modern communications available to people, it becomes more and more difficult to represent rural constituencies? I am not denying that there are practical difficulties. The hon. member Dr. Odendaal tells us that in the Fauresmith constituency&#x2014;and I do not know why he chose Fauresmith&#x2014;there are 14 towns, 16 schools, 16 hospitals and farmers&#x2019; associations. I want to ask him how many trade unions there are, how many chambers of commerce and chambers of industry there are, and how many other aspects there are to the infrastructure of the city. Those are also important features. Hon. members should not think that the infrastructure is dependent only on small communities. Within the urban community there is a vast infrastructure of society, which is a very important part of the whole representative system. We on this side of the House do not deny that there are practical problems all round relating to representation, but we do not see why that should distort the principle that each person&#x2019;s vote should more or less have the same value, and that this House should reflect the reality of the voting structure around the country on a proportional basis.</p>

<p>This kind of debate on a Friday afternoon obviously tends to verge on the party-political, and one of the most predictable people in this House, the hon. member for Durban Point, quite obviously tried to steer in the direction of a party-political involvement. He referred to the Johannesburg municipal elections. In my view his arguments were some of the most ridiculous arguments that even he has advanced in this House. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Let us for a moment look at proportionality. This party the PFP stands for a restructured Constitution so that at all levels there will be a new dispensation based on proportionality. We do not say that in one section of the present unitary system one can suddenly apply a separate system of proportionality. The hon. member knows it. Does he believe that the voters of Johannesburg thought that, if we got 28 seats, we were going to apply proportionality in that system? Of course he does not believe it.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Durban Point is simply too clever by half. He comes along with a superficial slick argument and suddenly finds himself locked into proportional representation, which he is not going to apply. The hon. member for Durban Point has become a party-political joke rather than a statesman. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Let us return, however, to the motion moved by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. What does it seek to establish? It seeks to accomplish one thing. That is that in South Africa one person&#x2019;s vote should be represented equally with any other person&#x2019;s vote, that for the House of Assembly, votes in general should have the same value. As I said, as far as this House was concerned at the time of the founding of the Republic of South Africa, that was the principle applied between the provinces. Seats were allocated to provinces on the basis of a number of votes. In that section of his motion the hon. member for Bezuidenhout asks whether we cannot simply go back to what we agreed upon in the Select Committee referred to by the hon. member Mr. Van Staden, the Select Committee on which the hon. member for Durban Point sat in those days. It said there should be proportionality between provinces. That view was held unanimously. Because it was unanimous then we say that in that respect&#x2014;in respect of proportionality between provinces&#x2014;it is a sensible principle and we should go back to it.</p>

<p>Perhaps we are really wasting our time because I, with my ear close to the ground, hear the statements made by the hon. the Minister of Internal Affairs. Perhaps we are not going to have provinces for very much longer. Perhaps there are eventually not going to be provinces in South Africa. Perhaps the Transvaal province is going to disappear. I do not believe I am stretching it too far, but when I hear the statements made by the hon. the Minister of Internal Affairs speaking to Coloureds, Indians and others, I hear a lot about regional Governments. According to him we must break away from tradition. We are being directed to think of regional Governments. Whatever other hon. members may be saying, I want to know whether they are going to insist that there must be equal representation for provinces. Or are they indeed going to accept the concept of regional Government in South Africa, a system which will at least include Coloureds and Indians?</p>

<p>Hon. members on the Government side should not look upon what they call tradition as too precious, because I would venture to suggest that we will be debating a different Bill in this House, a Bill which will not involve the principle of equal representation for the provinces of South Africa. Let them ask the hon. the Minister of Internal Affairs about that. Fortunately, only his Deputy is here in the House today. I think he knows enough to tell us whether the sound-waves coming towards us are reliable, and that the provincial system is likely to be abolished in favour of a new system.</p>

<p>I want to refer now to the second area of disproportionality. That does not pertain to the question of whether the provinces should be treated on the basis of proportionality, <span class="col_2833-2834" refersTo="page_1441"/>but to the question of whether there should be a loading or deloading of various constituencies. I was distressed indeed when I listened to almost every hon. member on the Government side, and also to the hon. member for Durban Point, argueing the case for loading and deloading almost exclusively on the basis of the sparsety or density of population. They said that because there were rural seats they should be deloaded. If one reads the debates in this House, if one looks at the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act, if one looks at the decision of various delimitation commissions, one sees that they reject this. They reject this time and time again. They say there are seven criteria, and any one of those seven criteria must be used to give weight to the argument, and any one of those seven criteria, or a combination of any of those seven criteria, can lead to a decision on whether to load or deload. Nowhere in the Act, however, does it say that rural seats must be deloaded. Certain delimitation commissions have in fact rejected this directly. They hold it to be a misrepresentation of the Act. If we looked at the Act very carefully we see that it really says there should be an equality, but that there is permission granted to the delimitation commission to depart from the norm or the standard in the light of seven different criteria. I believe that hon. members should understand this. It is not simply a question of rural versus urban constituencies. There are seven factors, a combination of which should determine whether a constituency should be loaded or deloaded. The simple fact is that this does lead to a Transvaal vote only being worth three-quarters of a Cape Vote, and if one adds the extra loading that applies at the moment in the vast rural constituencies, a Transvaal vote is only worth half a Cape Vote.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>I believe that there are other ways in which one could overcome the problem of direct representation. We in these benches advocate a system of proportional representation. We have advocated this ever since the Progressive Party was founded way back in 1959. Proportional representation does not necessarily mean a simple list system. It can be a combination of a constituency-based electoral system and a list system, as they have in West Germany. It is my point of view that that is the one that is most preferable, a system allowing voters direct access to a representative, whilst at the same time ensuring proportionality as a whole.</p>

<p>There are, of course, other systems. There is the multi-member constituency system with a single transferable vote. In terms of this system one could, within a region, have say five members of Parliament. They would be elected within that region on a proportional basis by way of a transferable vote. We believe that it is fundamental, not just to democracy, but also to the very structure of our society, that this House should be truly representative of the forces of the power structure that exists outside this House. If one mutilates or distorts the power structure by arbitrary gerrymandering with figures or boundaries, applying non-political criteria which might, by accident, produce political results, it is our belief that this House would not be fulfilling its true function. This House is an institution that must represent people, and we therefore believe that there has to be this direct link with the people. At the same time, however, if this House is going to be effective, those people must be able to determine the course of decision-making in this House, not according to an arbitrary formula applied by a delimitation commission, but according to their actual votes.</p>

<p>Before I come to some of the points that he raised, however, I first of all just want to touch on a general theme, and I shall then deal with his points on the basis of that.</p>

<p>The hon. member Mr. Odendaal and the hon. member for Umlazi both pointed out the problems caused by the geographic size of <span class="col_2835-2836" refersTo="page_1442"/>some constituencies. I actually want to build a theme around that. After all, politics revolves around the fact that the interests of the citizens should be taken into account by the State, and the process presupposes that the citizens must articulate their interests, put them into words, and that a community of interests should be found between the various groups, because one cannot transform every articulated interest into legislation. Then the articulated, grouped interests must be submitted to the Government. Following that, the Governmental process of legislation and implementation takes place. The laws and the regulations that are made, then have to be referred back to the population again. Of course, the entire process requires communication between the voter and the Government, i.e. between the voter and his representative, but it also requires communication amongst the voters themselves, because otherwise this process cannot be accomplished. It is here that we must take note of the fact that the vast geographic expanse of the rural constituencies inevitably means that there should be fewer voters, or otherwise the size of the constituency should not be out of proportion. For instance, a constituency of 103 000 sq kilometres expressed as a simple square, would be a stretch of land 1 000 km long and 100 km broad. One can imagine that if a representative should attempt to canvass that area, it would cause a tremendous problem. How could he bring the people together effectively? The representative of a small constituency like Hillbrow can hold a meeting in one place on one evening and reasonably speaking, all the voters in his constituency are in a position to attend the meeting. However, if the limits of a constituency are situated 500 to 600 km from one another, this simply cannot happen. Then a meeting must be held at each of the 14 or however many community points in order to achieve the same goal.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Sea Point says they are sensitive to the problems of a large constituency, but he does not do anything about it. He simply leaves it at that. They say they are sensitive to this, but nevertheless he votes in favour of changing this constituency system into an ordinary proportional system. It troubles me that, whilst they say that they are sensitive to it, he simply carries on and does nothing more.</p>

<p>In this regard I want to raise a point that was raised by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout who moved the motion. He said that we should have a high regard for the relationship between the voter and the representative. This is exactly what we are trying to do with this system of loading and deloading, viz. to give the representative the opportunity to reach his voters and to give his voters the opportunity to reach him in order to achieve effective communication, and in these days in which South Africa finds itself in a period of accelerated change in the economic, the social and the political spheres, it is extremely important that the communication between the representative and the voter should be of the best. The needs of the voters are continually changing and the measures that the Government takes, are continually changing, and therefore communication must be intensified. That is why it is very important that we should not ignore the problem that is being experienced by the rural constituencies, but that we should do something about it, as is indeed being done by means of the current system.</p>

<p>What troubled me most about the premises of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout was that he said that there was no reason why anyone should be discriminated against when he goes from a rural area to an urban area. He said there was no reason why one vote should have more influence than another vote. Then he added: &#x201C;Numerically&#x201D;. He said there is no reason why one vote should have a greater numerical influence than another vote. However, it is in fact the numerical aspect that is at issue. They do not take into account the fact that due to the greater distances it is more difficult for the man in the rural areas to make his voice heard and to discover what is going on. At the moment it is more difficult for the voter in the rural areas to make his voice heard <span class="col_2837-2838" refersTo="page_1443"/>properly and really to find out what is going on. Distances are greater, newspapers are fewer, post is slower and telephone connections are not of the same quality as elsewhere. All these factors have an influence. That is why the voter in the rural areas is in an inherently backward position which must be compensated by giving him proper representation. I am opposed to this over concentration on the mere numerical value of a vote in the policy of the PFP. For them it simply amounts to each person having an equal say, and then everything would be all right. This is all that it is about. In the case of South Africa this would lead to a total denial of the rights of minorities and so on. Therefore it would result in total chaos in South Africa. That is why I think that the current system of a differentiated way of treating the rural areas and the cities is a very fair system. If the hon. member for Sea Point were simply to look at the seven points that are mentioned, he would see that communication plays a role in practically every point. It is not with regard to one point only where the geographic distribution plays a role, but in things like modes of transport and community or diversity of interests. People who live 600 km away from one another, do not necessarily have the same interests, whilst people who live six km from one another, are more likely to have the same interests. The natural characteristics, the sparseness or density of the population and many of these types of criteria do in fact have a bearing on this.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it does not surprise me that the hon. member for Rissik should support the principle of loading and deloading. However, I am surprised that the hon. member for Helderkruin and the hon. member for Umlazi gave the same kind of support to that principle and that they continued to support it. It affects the rural constituencies, of course, and those are the very constituencies with which the members of the NP are going to have problems from now on. [Interjections.] It is precisely in those constituencies that the rural Nationalist voters&#x2014;this is the way I see it, but I may be wrong&#x2014;now regard the NP more as an urban party, the men with the big Mercedes Benzes who live in big houses. [Interjections.] They are the men who met with all the big industrialists at the Carlton Conference, where the problems of the rural areas were not discussed. It is in those rural constituencies that the NP is going to have right-wing problems in future. I would have thought that they would be taking steps today to divise means of thwarting the right-wing groups in the rural areas in the future.</p>

<p>&#x2020;They are going to be hoist by their own petards in the rural areas. Until now, as far as the ordinary man in the street is concerned, the argument has been: Why so few voters in the rural areas, whilst there are so many per constituency in the city areas? That is the argument of the man in the street, the reason being that the Nats are in power and they see to it that they get maximum representation. Now they are going to be faced with the same right-wing problems, and it does not matter whether those emanate from the independents, the HNP or any other party. I predict that the suggestion by the hon. member for Rissik that this should be looked at again, will be taken up very soon. I say that because the NP realizes that in the platteland they are in trouble, and they are going to do something about it. [Interjections.] All the nonsense that we have heard about tradition, about the 1909 National Convention and the agreement that existed in the parliamentary select committees in 1965 and 1973 will mean nothing. They will want to save their skins in the platteland and they will do something about it by means of another Select Committee.</p>

<p>The problem of communication is the one which is brought up in every debate on this particular issue. It was brought up in 1965, in 1973 and again in 1982. As the hon. member for Sea Point has pointed out, it does not seem that there is a realization of the fact that communication&#x2014;the very aspect that has improved since 1910&#x2014;has made phenomenal advances in South Africa. The hon. <span class="col_2839-2840" refersTo="page_1444"/>member for Helderkruin said that telephone do not work properly and that postal services are slow. One would think that the platteland areas work on a backward system. We will wait for the Post Office Budget speech next week and hear the facts about how many automatic exchanges have been installed in the rural areas. I think we will hear from the hon. the Minister that the rural areas are the ones where the greatest improvements have taken place. Obviously, for the purpose of this debate, the hon. member prefers to describe the rural areas as backward as far as telecommunications are concerned. Telecommunications as a whole, including as it does communication by telephone, radio, television, and rail, air and road transport, have all improved, so that cannot be the main criteria for the large rural constituencies.</p>

<p>I wanted to refer to the speech by the hon. member for Durban Point. However, I notice the hon. member is not in the House and for that reason I shall not take the point any further. The remaining hon. members of the NRP in the House will not be in a position to deal with the problem.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton, who was in the House in 1965 and in 1973, made it as clear &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; as can be that the system which is at present entrenched in legislation is not equitable. Contrary to what the hon. member for Durban Point has suggested, there was no agreement by all the parties on the principle. The hon. member for Houghton specifically opposed it. One of the reasons why the NRP sits there as if lost&#x2014;with only 2 speakers of the 8 hon. members in this House&#x2014;is because they thought they could be comfortable with the NP on this aspect as well, but they have also been caught with that. We will continue to press for a system whereby all individuals, whether it be in the Transvaal, Natal, the Free State or the Cape, have equal weight in the electoral system.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this was the last private member&#x2019;s motion of the present session, and I want to thank the hon. member for Bezuidenhout for his interesting motion. It was a real pot-pourri. I suppose hon. members have eaten this kind of dish and they will know that it is delicious. The debate this afternoon was a real pot-pourri. Even the election of the executive committee of the Johannesburg City Council was mentioned in the debate this afternoon.</p>

<p>Right at the outset of the debate it was clear to me that this afternoon it was a case of the cities versus the rural areas. It is rather strange that while the Springboks are playing cricket at Wanderers for the first time in 12 years today &#x2026;</p>

<p>What is the score now?</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I do not know what the score is now, but we do seem to be winning.</p>

<p>While the cricket is going on, we are playing off the cities against the rural areas in this House. I got the impression that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout also had something against the Karoo. I want to tell the hon. member that the Karoo has been very good to me. If the hon. member for Beaufort West does not mind, I am going to carve out a small constituency there one of these days, and I am going to call it Victoria West and claim it for myself.</p>

<p>It also seemed to me in the debate that it was almost a case of one province against another. The hon. member for Sea Point said that we were going to abolish the provinces. I do not know what we are going to do in the constitutional field, but I can assure you that Province will go on playing against the Blue Bulls, and I think Province is going to win this year.</p>

<p>While we are on the subject of one province against another, I should like to refer hon. members to the report of the 14th Delimitation Commission. The commission <span class="col_2841-2842" refersTo="page_1445"/>mentions certain facts in the report and comes to the following conclusion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">These few comparisons show that the loads and unloads of one province&#x2019;s electoral divisions cannot serve, either in numbers or in percentages, as a guideline in the determining of the loads and unloads in the electoral divisions of any other province.</block>

<p>That is all I want to say, and I agree with the hon. member for Rissik that we should leave the minimum number of constituencies for a province as it is, and that while there is growth which the hon. member mentioned and which no one can deny, we should rather investigate that in the future and should not tamper with the number of seats allocated to a province at this stage.</p>

<p>In this debate it has also been a case of theory versus practice. The theory was represented by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. As the hon. member for Durban Point said, this is the hobby of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout; actually I should say his field of interest. One appreciates the trouble he takes and I think it is something which requires a great deal of study. I sincerely appreciate it. On the other hand there were the representatives of the practical side. Here we had hon. members who had had years of experience in this House and as members of Select Committees. There were the hon. members Mr. Van Staden and Dr. Odendaal, for example. It is true that Dr. Odendaal is a younger member, but he has experience of organizing a party. In particular, there was the hon. member for Durban Point, and one could hear that that hon. member was speaking with authority. There was also the hon. member for Rissik, who has represented his constituency in this House for many years. Then there was the hon. member for Umlazi as well as the constitutional expert, the hon. member for Helderkruin. As I say, these hon. members represented the practical side. They were the people with the experience.</p>

<p>It struck me that the official Opposition had no great liking for the rural areas. I can understand that, because they have no one representing a rural constituency. [Interjections.] I am not saying that those hon. members would not like to gain acceptance in the rural areas. They are probably very welcome there. However, they do not represent the rural areas. The hon. member for Durban Central is very concerned about the rural areas. He said that we were going to have problems in the rural areas now. I just want to tell him that we like a good fight during an election. Do you know what the farmers in the rural areas do? On Friday night they smash all the chairs in the hall; on Saturday, &#x201C;Dopper&#x201D; and &#x201C;Gaatjieponner&#x201D; have a combined bazaar to collect money for fixing the chairs, and on Sunday they take communion in that same hall. This is the way things have been done over the years. [Interjections.] Looking at the hon. member for Waterberg, I know we are ready for a good fight. [Interjections.] However, it will still be in a very good spirit. When two former clergymen tackle each other, the fight is not so rough; we do not smash any chairs.</p>

<p>I want to say this afternoon that we must look after the rural areas. I do not want to say that I am now siding with the rural areas, because I am fortunate in having been born in the city and representing a rural constituency. However, some things have been said here of the rural areas which are true. That contact with the electorate is very important. There is the question of the size of the constituency and the number of municipalities in such a constituency which all make demands on one&#x2019;s time. In the Cape we still have divisional councils. There are hospital boards and school boards and school committees and these are all bodies which make demands on a representative&#x2019;s time. There are also very long distances that have to be travelled. If a member with an urban constituency has been holding a report-back meeting in his constituency, he can be home within five or ten minutes of locking up. In my case&#x2014;I do not represent the biggest constituency&#x2014;when I have finished in a remote <span class="col_2843-2844" refersTo="page_1446"/>corner of my constituency at night, I have a good three hours&#x2019; drive ahead of me. Therefore we must not write off the rural areas, and we cannot write them off. We must not write off the rural areas because these are areas with specific needs and specific circumstances, especially in the Cape. In the Cape we have about ten area constituencies. Some of them are bigger than the whole of the Free State. I hope the leader of the NP in the Free State will not be angry with me for saying so. If we were to implement the proposed policy, it would mean that we would have constituencies in the Cape that would be twice as big as the whole of the Free State. I think it would be absolutely impossible for anyone to represent such a constituency.</p>

<p>I should now like to refer to proportional representation. The Convention was mentioned in the course of the debate. In this connection I quote from Marinus Wiechers&#x2019;s <i>Staatsreg,</i> third edition, page 198&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die Parlemente van die Kaapkolonie en die Vrystaat het, behalwe minder belangrike wysigings, twee ingrypende veranderings voorgestel. Die twee wysigings het daarop neergekom dat die voorgestelde stelsel van proporsionele verteenwoordiging deur gebiedsverteenwoordiging vervang en die vraag of &#x2019;n stem altyd gelyk behoort te tel, heropen moes word. Hierdie wysigings van die Parlemente van die Kaapkolonie en die Oranje-Vrystaat was veral op aandrang van die Bondsparty in die Kaap en die verteenwoordigers van die Boerebevolking in die Vrystaat wat beswaar gemaak het teen die gelyke behandeling van stad en platteland, en die gevolg hiervan was dat van die stelsel van proporsionele verteenwoordiging waar daar geen kiesafdeling is nie, maar alle kiesers vir dieselfde kandidate stem, afgesien en ons huidige stelsel ingevoer is. Daarom is artikel 40(3) van die Suid-Afrika-Wet ingevoer waarvolgens die Afbakeningskommissie bepaalde faktore in aanmerking moet neem op so &#x2019;n wyse dat kiesafdelings, waar nodig, afgebaken kan word met 15% meer of minder kiesers as die kwota. Dit maak dit moontlik dat een kiesafdeling tot 30% meer kiesers kan hê as &#x2019;n ander.</block>

<p>I believe we should not tamper with this without serious consideration. I think we should refer this matter to a Select Committee on which all the parties are represented, as has been requested&#x2014;I agree with this, because it is parliamentary custom. Then we can deliberate calmly on the Select Committee, so that we can achieve consensus about the whole matter, as we have always done.</p>

<p>I should like to refer more specifically to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. As a member of the Commission of Inquiry into the Constitution under the chairmanship of our present Vice State President, I wish to confirm in this House that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout submitted a very comprehensive memorandum to the commission at the time, which the hon. member&#x2014;at that time he was not yet a member of the House&#x2014;subsequently elaborated on in his evidence before the commission. It was a comprehensive document, and the evidence given by the hon. member was also of a high quality.</p>

<p>I also confirm that all the members of the Schlebusch Commission at that time agreed with the following recommendation in the interim report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The commission received specific proposals from a certain witness for the submission of an interim report with regard to the delimitation of electoral divisions which commenced on 1 April 1980 and certain matters connected therewith, namely&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(1) that consideration be given to introducing a system of proportional representation, together with a right of veto for minorities in Parliament;</li>

<li>(2) that in the delimitation of electoral <span class="col_2845-2846" refersTo="page_1447"/>divisions the loading or deloading of 15% above or below the quota be reduced to 5% and that the so-called area electoral divisions (i.e. larger than 25 000 square kilometres) be abolished; and</li>

<li>(3) that the present provision in terms of which a fixed number of electoral divisions is allocated to each province, be replaced by a provision in terms of which seats are allocated to each province in accordance with the proportion of the number of voters in that province to the number of voters in the Republic.</li>

</ol>

<p>Since these proposals relate to a matter on which the commission would most probably wish to express its views in a further report, they decided not to make any finding or recommendation on the proposals at that stage.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. member for Bezuidenhout that all the memoranda submitted to the Schlebusch Commission have been handed over to the President&#x2019;s Council. I would therefore suggest, and I shall even arrange it for him, that the hon. member give evidence before the President&#x2019;s Council in this connection. I believe that the President&#x2019;s Council would be more than willing to hear the hon. member on this point, since the documents and the evidence are already in its possession. Since the President&#x2019;s Council is deliberating about the constitutional dispensation of the Republic, I want to ask whether the hon. member would not give evidence before this council. [Interjections.] The hon. member would then have more time available than he had today. I think it is an important matter which the hon. member has raised, and even the President&#x2019;s Council can come to this House with proposals in this connection. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>There is a second reason why this motion is not acceptable to me. The first reason why I could not accept the motion was that these documents had already been submitted to the President&#x2019;s Council and that the council was considering them. The second reason is that the motion advocates the repeal of subsection (3) of section 40 of the Constitution, while this subsection pegs down the number of members of the House of Assembly for every province for a period of 10 years, and this period is only due to expire on 23 July 1983. The next delimitation of electoral divisions can only take place in 1985 at the earliest. Therefore it serves no purpose to discuss this matter at the beginning of 1982. Since the electoral divisions are pegged down until 23 July 1983, and the next delimitation can only take place in 1985 at the earliest, hon. members can understand that it actually serves no purpose to discuss the subject now. What would in fact serve a purpose, as the hon. member for Rissik and the hon. member Mr. Van Staden also said, is to refer this matter to a Select Committee, as is customary.</p>

<p>Apart from the fact that the introduction of this motion by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is untimely, for the reasons I have already mentioned, I cannot agree with its content either, so I cannot accept that either, for&#x2014;as the hon. member said&#x2014;the principle underlying it is, in essence, &#x201C;one vote, one value&#x201D; in the Republic. I cannot accept that principle. The principle of &#x201C;one man, one value&#x201D; cannot be applied in South Africa, nor is it applied in other countries such as England and the USA. The value of the urban vote is bound to differ from the value of the rural vote, and I believe that they will always differ in South Africa, because this is a country of extremes and a country with unique circumstances, and we must accept that. It extends over a vast area, and for that reason the value of the rural vote will always be different from that of the urban vote.</p>

<p>However, it is not in the interest of the rural community that the abovementioned principle be applied, since it may diminish the participation of the rural areas in the government of the country, and I do not believe that we want that. I believe there is no one here who would deny the importance of the rural areas and their contribution to the country. This was also the view of the Select Committee on the Constitution Amendment <span class="col_2847-2848" refersTo="page_1448"/>Act and Elections in 1973. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout should be aware of this, because he and Prof. Kleynhans submitted a joint memorandum to that Select Committee at the time.</p>

<p>The number of voters in the Cape and the Orange Free State is not increasing as rapidly, proportionally speaking, as the number of voters in the Transvaal and Natal. If this principle of &#x201C;one vote, one value&#x201D; were to be applied, therefore, it would mean that the Cape and the Orange Free State would continually be losing constituencies. This, too, is a situation which can surely not be allowed. Regard must be had to the way in which the legislative organs of a democratic State function and the way in which voters with widely divergent interests are represented in those organs.</p>

<p>Now I wish to make a further statement. If, because of growth, a province deserves more seats, this should be granted on the basis of the growth in the number of voters in that province, and it should not be done at the expense of any other province. I even want to make the statement this afternoon that where there is growth, we should not be bound by the number of constituencies, but should be prepared to change this number. However, I want to advocate that the representation of the rural areas in the government of the country should not be reduced.</p>

<p>As far as the rural areas are concerned, especially in the Cape and in the Orange Free State&#x2014;as I have already said&#x2014;there has been a considerable decline in the number of voters, which will mean that the rural areas will have to yield constituencies to urban areas. This may mean that communities in which a feeling of cohesion has developed over many years, and in which people have come to know one another in a political and socio-economic sphere, will have to be amalgamated with other communities with which they have nothing in common.</p>

<p>Now I also wish to draw the attention of the House to the fact that, as I have already said, the principle of the 15% loading and deloading has been in the constitution since Union.</p>

<p>I think one could take the matter even further and advance even more arguments. However, I wish to conclude now. I want to repeat that I believe it was a good thing that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout moved this motion. It was a good thing that we all discussed it. Naturally it affects us all. However, I believe that it was not the right moment for such a discussion. I believe that, as in the past, the House will appoint a Select Committee on which all the parties can serve. I just want to emphasize again the principle that the representation of the rural areas in the Government of the country should not be reduced.</p>

<from>Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. SIVE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to thank all the various speakers for the contributions they have made to the discussion of my motion this afternoon. I believe a very useful debate has taken place here.</p>

<p>Before withdrawing my motion, I think it is apt that I should quote from <i>The Prince</i> by Machiavelli, because in changing constitutions we have a problem&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It should be borne in mind that there is nothing more difficult to arrange, more doubtful of success and more dangerous to carry through than initiating changes in a State&#x2019;s constitution. The innovator makes enemies of all those who prospered under the old order, and only lukewarm support is forthcoming from those who would prosper under the new. Their support is lukewarm partly from fear of their adversaries who have the existing laws on their side, and partly because men are generally incredulous, never really trusting new things unless they have tested them by experience.</block>

<p>That, Mr. Speaker, was written 400 years ago.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with leave, I withdraw the motion.</p>

<p>With leave, motion withdrawn.</p>
