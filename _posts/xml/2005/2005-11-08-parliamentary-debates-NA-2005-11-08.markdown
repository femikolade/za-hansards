                    PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

                                    ____

The House met at 14:02.

The Acting Speaker, Mr G Q M Doidge, took the Chair and requested members
to observe a moment of silence for prayers or meditation.

ANNOUNCEMENTS, TABLINGS AND COMMITTEE REPORTS - see col 000.

The ACTING SPEAKER (Mr G Q M Doidge): Hon members, before we proceed I wish
to advise the House that I have agreed to the request by the hon Minister
of Correctional Services for an opportunity to make a statement on the
Zonderwater incident. This will come after we have dealt with Members’
Statements.


                   TIME ALLOCATED TO PARTIES FOR RESPONSE


                             (Draft Resolution)

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Acting Speaker, I move without
notice:

   That -


   notwithstanding Rule 106(5), which stipulates the time to be utilised  by
   parties when responding to Ministerial statements, the following times be
   allocated in respect of party responses to the Statement by the  Minister
   of Correctional Services today: ANC 6, DA 3, IFP 2 and  other  parties  1
   minute each.



                             MEMBERS’ STATEMENTS



                             FRAUD-BUSTING TEAM


                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr D C MABENA (ANC): Chairperson, the Freedom Charter declares that “there
shall be houses, security and comfort”. The establishment of a fraud-
busting team in the national Department of Housing can play an important
role in addressing some of the housing challenges that are hampering the
realisation of this vision. This team will probe corruption and fraud
associated with government housing projects. The team is one of the
interventions by the ANC-led government to restructure national and
provincial housing departments to increase service delivery.

Another intervention is the appointment of additional housing inspectors to
monitor the quality of houses being built by developers.

The ANC welcomes the action taken by the  Minister.  Those  contractors  who
are found to be unscrupulous  will  be  stopped  so  that  the  governments’
intent to create sustainable communities that are able to  create  a  better
life for themselves is realised. I thank you.


                               ARMED ROBBERIES


                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr R JANKIELSOHN (DA): Chairperson, armed robberies with automatic and
other weapons are fast becoming part of the South African experience. Cash-
in-transit heists and armed robberies at retail outlets, shopping malls,
and even at doctors’ and dentists’ waiting rooms are now an everyday
occurrence in the country.

The greater Johannesburg area alone experienced no less than six armed cash-
in-transit heists, two bank robberies and seven  robberies  at  supermarkets
in the last week alone. Travelling on  our  roads  and  shopping  at  retail
outlets  should  be  a  pleasurable  and  not  a  dangerous  experience  for
consumers. The South African Police Services will have  to  take  additional
steps to ensure the safety of consumers during  our  festive  season.  Armed
security guards carrying large  amounts  of  cash  among  innocent  shoppers
should be limited.

Furthermore, the management  of  large  shopping  centres  should  work  out
strategies with private security companies  and  the  South  African  Police
Services to ensure the safety of consumers. A central and secure  point  for
the storage and collection of cash at  shopping  centres  could  be  a  good
start. Thank you, Chairperson [Applause.]


                           PHASING OUT OF TARIFFS


                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr H J BEKKER (IFP):  Mr Speaker, the IFP has noticed with appreciation
that after five years the European Union has now agreed to phase out all
tariffs on South African automotive imports by 2010. This should be a boost
for our local manufacturers to seize the moment and to further expand the
manufacturing of automobiles and particularly components and spare parts of
vehicles.

In contrast, our automotive sector will have to adjust and even become  more
competitive since the contra requirement of  the  European  Union  was  that
South Africa would have to reduce our tariffs on European car  imports  from
the existing 25% to 18% by 2012. Of course, this  will  have  a  significant
impact on the South  African  automotive  industry,  and  could  in  certain
categories even have a negative effect.

However, the IFP believes that with the resilience  and  initiative  of  the
South African entrepreneurs, timeous  adjustments  and  innovations  can  be
implemented to counteract any negative aspects of this EU-SA ruling, and  to
create a win-win situation for both. Thank you.


                           VOLUNTEERS IN HOUT BAY


                            (Member’s Statement)

Ms S P RWEXANA (ANC): Chairperson, Hout Bay, like many communities in South
Africa, is one of the many examples where the stark contrast of the two
economies mentioned by President Mbeki is evident. The impoverished
community of the Imizamo Yethu informal settlement overlooks the mansions
on the hills on the opposite side. The ANC therefore notes with
appreciation the contribution made by the Niall Mellon township project. It
consists of volunteers from Ireland who aim to build more than 100 homes
over the period of two weeks in Imizamo Yethu.

More than 700 volunteers have paid to join hands with  the  members  of  the
Imizamo Yethu community to improve their lives. The initiative was  launched
in 2002 as a random act of kindness by businessman  Niall  Mellon,  who  was
moved by the plight of the Imizamo Yethu community. The  ANC  calls  on  our
own more privileged communities to emulate the spirit  of  ubuntu  and  have
the generosity of  spirit,  in  order  to  give  a  handout  to  those  less
fortunate. I thank you.


                              GAUTRAIN PROJECT


                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr S N SWART (ACDP): Chairperson, the ACDP shares in the mounting unease
regarding the financial costs of the Gautrain project. We are astounded
that the costs have escalated from the initial R7 billion to R20 billion.
There are also no assurances that this will be the final figure, as
financial closure has yet be obtained, because government is still
negotiating the contract with the Mbombela consortium. We are also
concerned that the project will not be completed before the 2010 Soccer
World Cup. Whilst we appreciate that the project was not conceived with
this event in mind, it has become an integral part of the plans for the
event.

The progress  will  undoubtedly  be  closely  monitored  by  Fifa,  when  it
conducts the 2008 inspection, as to our readiness  to  host  the  event.  We
understand that the only obligation upon the consortium is to  complete  the
project within 54 months. At this stage,  should  construction  commence  in
January next, it will be cutting it  extremely  fine  to  have  the  project
completed with all safety testing taking place before  the  World  Cup.  The
ACDP welcomes the enquiry into the feasibility of the project  conducted  by
the transport portfolio committee.

Whilst this project has been dealt with as a provincial  matter,  there  can
be no doubt that it has become a national issue, with  mounting  concern  as
to the costs of the project and questions as to whether  this  huge  amount,
or parts thereof, could not be spent more  wisely  on  improving  roads  and
rail infrastructure throughout the country. I thank you.


                    ABOLITION OF DISTRICT MUNICIPALITIES


                            (Member’s Statement)

Mnr P J GROENEWALD (FF PLUS): Agb Voorsitter, die Minister van Finansies
het tydens die minibegroting aangekondig dat die streeksheffing aan
distriksmunisipaliteite op 30 Junie volgende jaar gestaak gaan word.
Distriksmunisipaliteite is oorblyfsels van die ou streekdiensterade en
heffings wat steeds aan hulle betaal word, blyk ongrondwetlik te wees.

Die belastingbetaler moet egter steeds opdok, aangesien daar nou R24
miljard deur die sentrale regering toegeken gaan word aan
distriksmunisipaliteite. Distriksmunisipaliteite is oorbodig en behoort
afgeskaf te word, aangesien die funksies van distriksmunisipaliteite deur
plaaslike stadsrade self gedoen kan word. Onnodige heffings en belasting
word aan hierdie munisipaliteite betaal en dít terwyl die munisipale
bestuurders van distriksmunisipaliteite salarisse verdien gelykstaande aan
Ministers en selfs meer as die President.

Deur die afskaffing van hierdie munisipaliteite sal miljarde rande bespaar
word - net aan administratiewe koste alleen. Die VF Plus doen ’n beroep op
die regering om nie net die heffings uit te faseer nie, maar ook
distriksmunisipaliteite in geheel af te skaf. Dankie. (Translation of
Afrikaans member’s statement follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Hon Chairperson, during the minibudget the Minister of
Finance announced that the regional levy for district municipalities will
cease as of 30 June next year. District municipalities are remnants of the
old regional services councils and levies that are still paid to them are
apparently unconstitutional.

The taxpayer will still have to pay up, however, since R24 billion will be
assigned to the district municipalities by the central government. District
municipalities are superfluous and should be abolished, as their functions
can be carried out by local municipalities. Unnecessary levies and taxes
are paid to these municipalities while the municipal managers of district
municipalities receive salaries equivalent to those of Ministers and even
exceed that of the President.

By abolishing these municipalities, billions of rands will be saved – in
administrative expenses alone. The FF Plus appeals to government not only
to phase out these levies, but also to abolish district municipalities
entirely. Thank you.]




           DISSOLUTION OF ABAQULUSI MUNICIPALITY IN KWAZULU-NATAL


                            (Member’s Statement)

Mnu B Z ZULU  (ANC): Sihlalo, uhulumeni kaKhongolose uzibophezele
ekuphatheni ngobuqotho kanti futhi, uma kudingekile, uyakugxambukela
ngenhloso yokulungisa kulezo zindawo lapho kubonakala kuphazamiseka khona
ukuhlangabezana nezidingo zabantu kanye nokuletha intuthuko kohulumeni
basekhaya. Ngakho siyasincoma kakhulu isinqumo esithathwe yisigungu
sikahulumeni waKwaZulu-Natali sokuhlakaza umasipala wabaQulusi obuholwa
yiqembu leNkatha. Lesi sinqumo silandele ngemuva kophenyo olukhombise
ngokusobala ukuthi lo masipala wabaQulusi wehlulekile ukufeza lokho
owawukuthunywe ngabantu ukuba ubenzele khona.

Ukungenelela    kukahulumeni    ukwenze    elandela    isigatshana    139(3)
soMthethosisekelo wezwe lethu,  futhi  lokho  kulandele  izigigaba  eziningi
ezenzakele kulo masipala. Esinye sazo kube yilapho iqembu  leNkatha  lixoshe
khona amakhansela alo ayisishiyagalolunye abekulo masipala  ekuqaleni  kwawo
lo nyaka. Uhulumeni  oholwa  uKhongolose  uzoqhubeka  enze  lokho  okudingwa
umphakathi ukuze sibe nabaholi bomphakathi  abazimisele  ukuguqula  izimpilo
zabantu  bakithi.  Ngiyabonga.  [Ihlombe.]  (Translation  of  Zulu  member’s
statement follows.)

[Mr B Z ZULU (ANC): Chairperson, the ANC government is committed  to  govern
according to the highest ethical and moral standards and, if  necessary,  it
will intervene with the objective of addressing those  areas  where  service
delivery  and  development  in  local  government  has  been  hampered.   We
therefore  salute  the  decision  taken  by  the  KwaZulu-Natal  cabinet  to
dissolve the  AbaQulusi  Municipality  controlled  by  the  Inkatha  Freedom
Party. This decision was taken after an investigation  clearly  showed  that
this municipality has failed to meet its mandate.

Intervention by the government was done in terms of section 139(3) of the
Constitution after several incidents occurred at this municipality. One of
those is the dismissal of nine of its councillors at the beginning of this
year by the IFP. The ANC government will continue to do what the public
needs in order to have leaders who are prepared to change the lives of our
community. Thank you. [Applause.]]

              REDETERMINATION OF MUNICIPAL BOUNDARIES – UNREST

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr T LIKOTSI (PAC): Chairperson, the recent spate of unrest about poor
service delivery and redetermination of municipalities in our country is a
recipe for spontaneous uprisings. All political parties, social movements,
business and civic society must close ranks to nip these unrests in the
bud; else we may suffer the consequences thereafter.

Urgent measures must be taken against corrupt and nonperforming
municipalities and provinces whose councillors and members of provincial
legislatures, including officials, are involved. The redetermination of the
Merafong local municipality in Gauteng Province and that of the Matatiele
local municipality in the province of KwaZulu-Natal must be revisited.

Our people have for a very long time suffered extreme oppression and
harassment by the past colonial and apartheid regimes, and may not be
expected to endure hardships during our time of governance. The voice of
the people of Kgotsong, Matatiele, Mount Frere, Mount Ayliff, Umzimkhulu
and Maluti must be heard. I thank you.

                           CORRUPTION IN KUNGWINI

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr K J MINNIE (DA): Mr Chairperson, the people of Kungwini,
Bronkhorstspruit in Gauteng have had to suffer the incompetence and poor
governance of the ANC council for long enough. It is time for a change.

Die munisipale bestuurder het aan die einde van 2004 byna R3 200 spandeer
op vleis vir ’n personeelfunksie. Hy’t egter al die vleis self huis toe
geneem. Terwyl ses beamptes en die munisipale bestuurder hulself verryk,
bly die armer mense van Kungwini in haglike omstandighede. Dis egter nie al
nie.

Die DA het die Gautengse provinsiale minister belas met plaaslike regering
in kennis gestel van eiendomstransaksies ter waarde van R1,3 miljoen wat
deur die Kungwini-raad aangegaan is, maar wat strydig met munisipale
regulasies is. Die raad het met ander woorde die wet verbreek (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The municipal manager had spent almost R3 200 on meat for a staff function
at the end of 2004. He, however, took all the meat home himself. While six
officials and the municipal manager enrich themselves, the poorer people of
Kungwini live in appalling circumstances. This, however, is not all.

The DA informed the Gauteng provincial minister charged with local
government that, contrary to municipal regulations, the Kungwini Council
had entered into property transactions to the value of R1,3 million. In
other words, the council had contravened the law.]

After the DA had intervened and blew the whistle, the executive mayor of
Kungwini was forced to resign, and the municipal manager and six officials
were suspended. I have good news for the people of Kungwini. On election
day next year you can tell the ANC council to pack their bags and leave
office. The DA is ready to fix what the ANC has broken in Kungwini.
[Interjections.] The people of Kungwini, Bronkhorstspruit, deserve better
than the ANC. I thank you. [Applause.]

         WORLD ASSOCIATION OF SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETERS CONFERENCE

                            (Member’s Statement)

Chief M NONKONYANA (ANC): Chairperson and hon members, 250 delegates
representing 39 countries attended the World Association of Sign Language
Interpreters’ Conference in Worcester in the Western Cape last week. The
delegates included sign language interpreters from 10 African countries.

South Africa, having one of the most, if not the most, progressive
constitutions in the world, recognises sign language as a language to be
developed. In our own Parliament we have a member who makes use of the
services of sign language interpreters. When the state of the nation
address is televised we have someone doing sign language interpretation.

However, more needs to be done since there are only six accredited sign
language interpreters, and there are 1,5 million people with hearing
disabilities in the country. One of the suggestions made by the conference
was creating an enabling environment that would assist people interested in
a career as a sign language interpreter to find employment. I thank you.
[Applause.]

          DISPROPORTIONATE GAP BETWEEN HIGHEST PAID AND LOWEST PAID

                            (Member’s Statement)

Prince N E ZULU (IFP): Mr Chairman, some analysts describe the gap between
the highest paid and the lowest paid in the country as alarmingly
disproportionate. Their concerns intersect with those in the private sector
and with those in the public sector. This underscores what is regarded as a
fact of life in South Africa, that factors of production are not
distributed proportionately. Inequalities are more on the increase than on
the decline. Those who have are blessed with more and more resources, while
those who don’t have are cursed with scarcity and poverty.

While others are notching up R40 million per year, others live on a hand-to-
mouth pittance. Economists don’t dispute this state of affairs. They
believe one has to be rewarded according to his or her performance. Even
shareholders of companies accept that large packages for executives, who
add value and contribute to the long-term interests of their companies,
deserve what is due to them.

Expectations regarding those who live on hand-to-mouth toil were heightened
by statements made in this House that an accelerated and shared growth
initiative may be on the cards in the new year. The new year is only two
months away. This statement was further expanded on in that it would shift
the focus and emphasis away from macroeconomic management towards the
restructuring of the real economy through infrastructure investment. Thank
you. [Time expired.]

                       PROTECTION OF CHILDREN’S RIGHTS

                            (Member’s Statement)

Ms M D NXUMALO(ANC): Chairperson, the ANC led-government has been vigorous
in putting the issue of children at the top of its agenda - being a
signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and
by taking seriously our responsibility of ensuring that children are
protected from harmful influences, abuse and exploitation.

We welcome the announcement by Cell C, MTN and Vodacom to put measures in
place that will protect children from accessing inappropriate images and
texts on their phones. The steps taken by the South African cellphone
operators will play an important role in protecting children against a new
form of exploitation and abuse. According to a new code of conduct,
operators will be required to adopt measures to ensure that no illegal
content is screened over their networks.

Children make up almost half of our population. Therefore, as the guardians
of South African children let us commit ourselves vigorously and oppose any
action that threatens their right to a safe environment. Protecting their
safety and innocence must be our everyday business. I thank you.
[Applause.]


                   SPORTS DEVELOPMENT POLICIES OF THE ANC


                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr T D LEE (DA): Chairperson, the ANC is not interested in the development
of sport in South Africa. To them it’s all about a numbers game and race,
and nothing more. Merit should be the only criteria for decision-making for
the national and international competitive stages.

The teams representing South Africa in all codes should always be the
strongest possible squads we can put together. It is at grass-roots level
where development should be taking place. Instead of trying to legislate on
everything they can find, government should make sure that all our schools
and sports clubs have the necessary facilities at their disposal.

Just imagine if the USA tried to apply the ANC’s mad formula to its
basketball teams or athletes. They would lose all the encounters they now
win as a matter of course. Black Americans play a hugely disproportionate
role on merit even though they are a minority of less than 15%. We need to
develop our own potential sportsmen and sportswomen. We don’t need more
laws. I thank you, Chairperson.

           KHOMANANI EXCELLENCE AWARDS FOR COMMUNITY CARE WORKERS

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr C T MOLEFE (ANC): Chairperson, Mr Bob Phato of Queenstown, the winner of
the community care worker category in the second Khomanani Excellence
Awards hosted by the Health Ministry at the Presidential guesthouse last
week, has showed that ordinary people can do extraordinary things.

This 53-year-old man is helping more than 700 orphans with, among other
things, food, clothes and blankets. With the help of the Department of
Education, he ensures that orphans can go to school without having to pay
school fees and he assists child-headed households by applying for their
birth certificates, IDs and social grants. He truly is practising the
maxim, “Your child is my child.”

We commend Mr Phato for his selflessness and his dedication in putting a
smile on the faces of so many children. We also commend the winners in the
other categories of the Khomanani Excellence Awards. Their example is an
inspiration to all of us to respond with passion and compassion as we
strive collectively to find a solution to reduce the impact of HIV and Aids
on our society. Thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]


        INFORMATION ON VIOLENT CRIMES AGAINST SOUTH AFRICA’S CHILDREN

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr M WATERS (DA): Thank you, Chair. Safety and Security Minister Charles
Nqakula says that he has no idea how many crimes are committed against
South Africa’s children, despite the government claiming that the
protection of children is a priority. If he doesn’t know how many children
are raped, kidnapped or killed each year, how can the government draw up an
action plan to tackle this problem?

The Minister has told Parliament that the gathering of information is too
time-consuming. Yet, how can he plan to curb the scourge of rape,
kidnapping and murder of children if he doesn’t know the extent of the
problem or the patterns of where and how these crimes occur? Either the
Minister knows that the answers will be an embarrassing indictment of his
department, or he has been misleading the public into thinking that he is
tackling these crimes with some degree of seriousness. Is he hiding the
information or is he genuinely clueless? It is time for the Minister to
come clean on violent crimes against children. I thank you. [Applause.]




         WORLD ASSOCIATION OF SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETERS CONFERENCE


                            (Minister’s Response)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: Chairperson, I’d like to
thank the hon member from the ANC for reporting back to this House on some
of the key suggestions made by the 250 delegates representing 39 countries
who attended the World Association of Sign Language Interpreters conference
in the past week.

There are many things that make us proud of being members of this House.
But, one of the things that I think we can rightfully be proud of is that
we have a member in this House who has the assistance and enjoys the
assistance of sign language interpreters. That’s a good thing and sends out
a very good message.

Equally, the fact that the state of the nation address is communicated to
1,5 million people with hearing difficulties throughout the country is
something that we can rightfully feel proud of.

One thing that strikes me when I watch the sign language interpreters – I
watch them with a great deal of admiration – is that they are immensely
skilled people. But the point that came out of this workshop is that there
are not enough people with sign language interpreting abilities and that we
need more people to provide this service. I think when we take into account
that there are 1,5 million deaf people in our country, this is a matter
that needs to be addressed with some urgency.

Sign language is something that doesn’t belong to a region, that knows no
ethnic boundaries and no race boundaries. People with hearing difficulties
communicate with each other using sign language. It’s really about time
that we gave full recognition for the value that sign language has in our
society. Certainly, the Minister of Education and we in the Department of
Science and Technology will try to rise to the challenges put to us by the
member to ensure that people who are interested in careers in sign language
interpretation are given as much assistance as possible. Thank you,
Chairperson. [Applause.]


                   SPORTS DEVELOPMENT POLICIES OF THE ANC


                            (Minister’s Response)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SPORT AND RECREATION: Chairperson, the hon Lee came
here today and made petty politics out of something that is very serious in
this country - our sport and the transformation in general. However, what
the hon member doesn’t do is to recognise the lack of facilities due to the
skewed development this country has because of the legacy of apartheid.
We are rectifying that. We have embarked on eradicating those backlogs
through the Municipal Infrastructure Grant and the IDPs of the local
authorities. You should be going out, hon Lee, and assisting government to
allocate those facilities to local authorities. That includes the IDPs

We also went further by entering into a landmark agreement with schools
sport. We will see schools sport phased in on an incremental basis as from
next year because we want to see our 12 million children playing sport on
Wednesday afternoons and Saturday mornings. It is because we want to
identify the talent we have in this country, the talent that was previously
ignored. The moment we succeed with that and with the mass participation
programme of this government, we will bring opportunities to the people
that never had them before.

No one, not the DA, not the hon Lee, will stop this government on our road
and on our march to unlock the potential and all the talent we have for
sport in our country. Thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]




        INFORMATION ON VIOLENT CRIMES AGAINST SOUTH AFRICA’S CHILDREN


                            (Minister’s Response)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Comrade Chair, we welcome the statement by
the comrade about the protection of children from harmful influences, abuse
and exploitation. To Cell C, MTN and Vodacom we say, “Ukwanda Kwaliwa
ngumthakathi! [Forward!]

This government takes the issue of the rights of children very seriously.
For this to succeed, all of us, including Cell C, MTN and Vodacom –
particularly parents – must begin to look at how we make sure that our
children are protected. I thank you, Comrade Chair. [Applause.]


           KHOMANANI EXCELLENCE AWARDS FOR COMMUNITY CARE WORKERS


                            (Minister’s Response)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chairperson, we would like to commend the
Minister of Health for hosting the Khomanani Excellence Awards. What this
does is in fact to recognise and acknowledge the important role of people
such as Bob Phato in assisting those who are indigent and poor,
particularly orphans.

It is also consistent with the policy and legislation of government in
terms of which for the first time in the history of this country learners
would be exempted from paying fees.

With the introduction of the Education Laws Amendment Bill, which has been
passed by this House, many schools, which are located in communities that
suffer from abject poverty, would be completely exempted from charging
fees. This will go a long way in eradicating poverty. It also reflects the
kind of compassion and empathy that is necessary in the caring society such
as ours.

I think we must applaud the wonderful efforts by persons such as Bob Phato
and others, for contributing meaningfully to the eradication of poverty and
who show the kind of affinity in association with those who are less
privileged and who are indigent and in need.

Lastly, with regard to the HIV/Aids situation, the Department of Education,
in collaboration with Khomanani, has piloted an advertisement in which it
has appealed to the communities to support initiatives in terms of which
people who are affected and infected by HIV/Aids must be supported by
communities so that they are not stigmatised and are provided with the
appropriate community care that is necessary. Thank you very much,
Chairperson. [Applause.]


                 INCIDENT AT ZONDERWATER CORRECTIONAL CENTRE


                           (Statement by Minister)

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Chairperson, hon members of this
House, thank you for giving me the opportunity to address this House on the
recent incident of an attempted escape at Zonderwater Correctional Centre
in Cullinan just outside of Pretoria, which resulted in one official
fighting for his life in hospital and one offender dead.

A group of five callous, long-term offenders with no respect for human
life, took hostage five officials in an attempt to escape from Zonderwater
Correctional Centre on the morning of Sunday, 6 November 2005. Our
partners, the SA Police Service, were immediately called in with their
experts to help handle the situation. Negotiators managed to control the
situation, without panic or irrational decisions that could have led to a
blood bath, from about 11am until about 6pm when the intervention put an
end to that ordeal.

The offenders were demanding loaded assault rifles, two loaded R5s loaded;
a getaway Kombi, with its windows painted to conceal the people inside; and
they also demanded a passage out of the correctional centre without police
interference. In short, the professionalism and dedication of the SAPS
officials and Correctional Services managed to save many lives.
Regrettably, one official, Mr Dirk Thiart, was seriously injured and is
currently fighting for his life in Montana Hospital. I’m sure members of
this House will join us, as Correctional Services, in praying for his life.

Four other officials survived unhurt and were provided with counselling
services. These officials are: Mr Mpho Masemola (33); Nursing Sister Marcel
Naude (33); Sister Grace Sekgabutla (47); and Mr Goodman Mthimkhulu (43),
who is also a diabetic. I praise them for their bravery and courage.

One offender serving 80 years for multiple, serious crimes, including
murder, armed robbery and possession of illegal firearms and ammunition,
Classmed Lekota, was killed. [Interjections.] Four other offenders - no, he
is no relation of the Minister - were immediately transferred to the C-Max
Correctional Centre in Pretoria and will face the full might of the law.
I’m not going to mention their names, only their sentences: the first one
is serving two life sentences for murder, attempted murder and robbery; the
other one is serving a life sentence for murder and robbery; the next one
is serving 15 years for rape; and the last one is serving a life sentence
for robbery.

Criminal and internal investigations are being done following strong leads
that indicate that there was collusion by at least three officials of my
department. It is because of incidents such as these perpetrated by callous
offenders, who have no respect for human life, that some people may begin
to ask the question: Is the route we have taken of transforming
Correctional Services into a rehabilitation-centred institution the correct
one? Let me hasten to respond by saying that we are winning the war on
violence, the war on escapes and the war on safety in our correctional
centres.

We therefore remain quite resolute, working side by side with our partners
in the criminal justice system, to build a rehabilitation-centred
correctional system with a secure, safe and humane framework as our
contribution to a safer society.

Various strategies are being rolled out to create a safe and secure
environment in our centres for the effective implementation of our
programmes aimed at correcting the offending behaviour of human
development, including a roll-out of a R88 million state-of-the-art
security system that is based on biometric access control. We have put in
metal detectors and a closed-circuit TV system to prevent entry of illegal
and dangerous weapons and substances into our centres.

The programme is 100% complete in the Eastern Cape, nearly complete in
Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal, while the roll-out has begun in other provinces.
Our national escape prevention strategy progressively registers the desired
results, as we have already reduced escapes by more than 33% between
January and September 2004, compared with the same period in 2005 – 105 in
2004. We have reduced it to 70 escapes so far this year.

Internationally, running a correctional system is a function full of risks
and there can be no quick fixes for the challenges we have to overcome.
Although we are making significant progress, the desired targets can only
be achieved with every role-player, including families of the offenders and
communities, putting their weight behind all these efforts in order to
realise corrections as a societal responsibility.

Guns kill people. It matters not how many people are at work at that stage,
smuggling a firearm into a correctional centre for use by people who do not
shy away from breaking the law, will never serve any right-thinking person,
be that a colleague, a corrupt official or a family member, because at the
end of the day lives may be lost.

This question of the staff complement over weekends does not arise at all.
The first thing that normal, caring human beings do when a life is or lives
are lost is to offer condolences and show sympathy, and have empathy for
that family; not to point fingers and not to score points. I therefore
implore all people and organisations sharing the passion of building a
better life for all in South Africa to unequivocally condemn, first of all,
any act of smuggling illegal weapons and substances into our centres.

I also wish to condemn in the strongest possible terms any efforts to
justify these illegal actions by raising issues of dissatisfaction or any
allegations of ill treatment or abuse. We have built an accountable system
of governance to ensure that the transformation of Correctional Services is
kept in check and is on course.

My door, as Minister, is open at any time to any family member, any
offender in any prison, any relative of an offender, or any hon member in
this House to call on me, to call on the area commissioner, to call on the
Commissioner of Correctional Services, the Deputy Minister, and report any
abuse or humiliation by any of my staff members, and vice versa. Acquiring
an illegal weapon, brandishing a weapon to try to get out of a correctional
centre will never work. I condemn any criminal activity, irrespective of
who is involved. Anyone may also report these incidents of dissatisfaction
to the Judicial Inspectorate of Prisons and the Human Rights Commission,
which are the state agencies assigned to deliver checks and balances in the
delivery of Correctional Services.

Lastly, to my staff members all around the country in the 243 centres in
the country – you might call them prisons – and to those who are applying
and aspire to join Correctional Services to become ideal correctional
officials, I’d like to assure your that your wellbeing and your safety as
members of staff will always be paramount to the Minister. I appreciate the
hard work that you guys do. Keep it up. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Mr J SELFE: Acting Speaker, the incident in Zonderwater on Sunday comes in
the wake of similar incidents in the Pretoria C-Max and Baviaanspoort
correctional centres. All involved hostage taking, all involved serious
injury and or fatalities; two involved firearms smuggled into prison; all
happened on a Sunday.

Perhaps, more than anything else, all these tragic incidents demonstrate
very graphically the enormous danger every single Correctional Services
official lives with every single day. We take our hats off to the men and
women who are prepared to face those dangers uncomplainingly and
professionally.

But, these incidents also call for action. Firstly, many of the inmates who
are involved in these incidents are serious criminals facing very long
sentences. In Zonderwater one inmate was serving a double life sentence,
two were serving life sentences and another a sentence of 80 years. These
are violent criminals without fear of consequences and without hope of
release. Owing to the fact that they have no expectation of release, they
can become violent. These people and similar offenders in other prisons
belong in C-Max prisons.

At the moment the C-Max prison in Kokstad does not have the necessary
capacity and needs to be capacitated immediately, and those violent inmates
need to be transferred there before there are other incidents. Secondly, it
is worrying; indeed, it is almost unbelievable that firearms continue to be
able to be smuggled into maximum security institutions.

While security has been improved and the Minister referred to it, in many
centres it is clear that still more attention needs to be given to stopping
this from happening. Thirdly, all these incidents happened on Sundays when
security tends to be a little bit more relaxed than on other days. It is an
unfortunate reality that security in maximum prisons will have to be just
as strict on Sundays as it is on any other day. We must ensure that there
are enough staff over weekends to ensure the safety of both staff and
inmates.

Finally, we would like to express our appreciation to the Minister, who
displayed enormous personal courage and commitment in this particular
incident, to the SA Police Service’s task force, and to the DCS for
successfully defusing the situation in Zonderwater, and for preventing
these offenders from escaping.

We wish those injured and traumatised a speedy recovery, but, more than
anything else, we express the hope that this is the last time that an
incident of this nature will have to be debated in Parliament. I thank you.
[Applause.]

Mrs S A SEATON: Chairperson, hon Ministers, hon members, the IFP is very
concerned about yet another hostage drama. It is really getting beyond a
joke. It is not acceptable that we keep having this sort of situation. We
wish that those who have been traumatised will recover very soon. We wish
Mr Thiart full recovery. We will keep him in our prayers.

Minister, we hope that you find the persons responsible for smuggling the
arms into the prison because this really is the problem. The problem is
that firearms are being smuggled into high security prisons.

I agree with Mr Selfe that we really have to do something about security.
We cannot allow complacency in our prisons on any day, at any time. We have
to make sure that we maintain tight security, especially in high security
prisons.

We believe that any official found guilty of having smuggled arms into such
places as the high security prison one way or the other should be dealt
with in the firmest possible manner. They should be put behind bars for the
rest of their lives because they have in fact brought about damage to other
people and serious concern to our country.
I, too, would like to commend you, Minister, first of all for your
courageous dealings over the weekend and also for bringing it to
Parliament’s attention very speedily. We heard early this morning already
from you. We appreciate that. And we would ask you please to convey our
appreciation to your departmental staff. We would also like to thank the SA
Police Service special task team and all who attended to the matter for the
way in which they did to save lives as they did. Thank you, Chairperson.

Mr S N SWART: Acting Speaker, the ACDP is similarly shocked at the events
that unfolded at Zonderwater Prison near Cullinan this past Sunday. The
immediate question that arises is yet again how it was possible that a
firearm was smuggled into the prison. These are not petty criminals; they
have been convicted of cases ranging from murder, rape and robbery and are
serving multiple life sentences.

Severe punishment must be meted out, should it be found that any warder
assisted the inmate in obtaining the firearm. We support you in that, hon
Minister.

Additionally, the ACDP shares concerns that staff shortages may have
contributed to the weekend security breach. It is to our horror in fact
that we hear security is slightly more lax over weekends. The fact that
there are more visitors over weekends as well as various activities such as
church services logically dictate that there should be more security, not
less. I’m sure, hon Minister, that you are looking into that as well.

The ACDP wishes to commend you, hon Minister, for your actions as well as
your department for the professional manner in which this hostage situation
was dealt with, which resulted in the shooting and capture of prisoners who
had attempted to escape.

We similarly commend the SAPS special task team for its successful
intervention, and trust and pray that Mr Thiart, the severely injured
warder, will fully recover. I thank you.

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Agb Voorsitter, van die VF Plus se kant af wens ons die
gewonde persone alles van die beste toe. Mnr die Voorsitter, ek wil vir die
agb Minister sê dat dit nou ‘n gewoonte word by die agbare Minister dat
wanneer ‘n insident plaasgevind het, om hier na die Parlement toe te kom en
dan vir ons te vertel wat gebeur het. Dan wil dit lyk so asof hy sy hande
in onskuld wil was en vir ons sê, “Ek het julle ingelig”.

Mnr die Voorsitter, in die beperkte tyd wat ek het wil ek vir die agbare
Minister net sê as dit nie vir die optrede van die polisie was nie dan kan
‘n mens maar net dink wat die verdere gevolge sou gewees het. ‘n Besondere
dank aan hulle vir hul vinnige optrede.

Maar ek wil vir die agbare Minister sê hy moet ophou om verklarings te
maak. Hy moet begin optree en iets doen. Dankie, mnr die Voorsitter.
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Hon Chairperson, from the FF Plus’s side we wish the
injured persons all the best. Mr Chairperson, I want to tell the hon
Minister that it is now becoming a habit of his that when an incident has
taken place, he comes here to Parliament and tells us what happened. It
then seems as if he wants to wash his hands of it and tells us, “I have
informed you”.

Mr Chairperson, in the limited time that I have I would just like to tell
the hon Minister that if it were not for the action of the police, one can
only think of what the further consequences would have been. A special
thanks to them for their quick action.

But I want to tell the hon Minister he should stop making statements. He
should start acting and do something. Thank you, Mr Chairperson.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Chairperson and hon members, the UCDP is greatly concerned
about the apparent, incessant attacks on law-enforcing agents in our
prisons. Praise goes to the police for the bravery they showed to bring the
situation under control. The public has however not come to regarding the
rape of nurses at Bavianspoort and the stabbing of a doctor at C-Max prison
in the past.
The lack of vigilance with regard to the acquisition of dangerous weapons
by inmates in our prisons is cause for concern. The UCDP, in the interest
of law and order in respect of the citizens of this country, calls on the
Ministry and the officials of Correctional Services to ensure that those
incarcerated are kept where they belong. Those who collude with prisoners
should join them – behind bars. On the flipside, we call on members of
society to desist from aiding those incarcerated.

The UCDP regrets the death of one of the prisoners in that Zonderwater
debacle and wishes the injured officer well. We still call for a greater
use of . . . [Time expired.]

Mr T LIKOTSI: Chairperson, the PAC wishes to send condolences to the
families of the bereaved Classmed Lekota and wishes a speedy recovery to
the injured Dirk Thiart at Zonderwater correctional centre.

Our prisons are a hive of gangsters, and there is very little on the side
of rehabilitation. The PAC has time and again warned this government of
overcrowding, ill treatment and gang-related misconduct in our prisons.

The issues of gun trafficking and drug trafficking are norms in our
prisons. We have, and are still calling for the release of all imprisoned
former guerrillas from our prisons. This government cannot afford to
imprison the very people who fought for the democracy we all so cherish and
enjoy.

We support the position of Popcru on demanding better working conditions
and improved staff complements in the prisons. This will boost the morale
of prison authorities. I thank you, Chairperson. [Time expired.]

Ms S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, it is sad that one has to stand here and speak
about crime again.

The MF has in the past moved notices of motion and also made statements in
respect of crime in the country. In spite of the rehabilitation taking
place in the correctional service, we still face such terrible crimes. We
want to applaud your bravery, hon Minister, and your team for the quick
action that you took in respect of this crime that happened.

The MF prays for the warder who is fighting for his life and wishes him
recovery, and conveys its condolences to the bereaved families of the lost
ones. Thank you very much, Chairperson. [Applause.]

Mr S SIMMONS: Chair, the Department of Correctional Services is in chaos.
Since the hon Minister Balfour has taken office, this department has had
one crisis after the other. The list is too long to mention. But security
and safety within prisons have for a long time been an area of serious
concern for South Africans. The security issue, hon Minister, has not
improved as you have claimed. It is quite clear that the Department of
Correctional Services lacks competent management skills and therefore
requires drastic damage control management.

Subsequently, the UPSA calls on the Minister of Correctional Services to
resign, and for the President to appoint a commission of inquiry into
obvious poor management of the Department of Correctional Services. I thank
you, Chairperson.

Mr N B FIHLA: Hon Chair, hon members, it is unfortunate that amongst us
there are some who are very ignorant of the dangers and conditions that the
staff and the members of the Department of Correctional Services are
working under, and the risks that they are taking. And it is unfortunate
that there are members who are ignorant of the difficulties experienced and
risks that are taken by this department. These members have unfortunately
never been part of the committee and have never visited a prison but they
are speaking from hearsay. It’s just unfortunate, indeed.

The ANC is in deep sympathy with the member of the department who was
repeatedly shot by those heartless and brutal inmates at Zonderwater
Prison. We, as the ANC, condemn this act in the strongest terms and assure
the people of South Africa that our department will try by all means to get
hold of the culprits who have done this dastardly act, including those who
helped them with the smuggling of weapons. We will deal with these corrupt
elements by giving them the severest sentences that our justice system can
give for exposing our members to the most dangerous conditions.

We can assure the people of South Africa that our department will work
endlessly to sharpen the security at all prisons and ensure the safety of
all inmates and the staff. I thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                         REVENUE LAWS AMENDMENT BILL

                               (Introduction)

The ACTING MINISTER OF FINANCE (Mr A Erwin): Thank you, Chairperson. Hon
members, the Revenue Laws Amendment Bill of 2005 and the Revenue Laws
Second Amendment Bill of 2005 contain the remaining tax proposals as
announced in the 2005 Budget. The reason for the two Bills is to ensure
that matters that must be dealt with by way of a money Bill, are dealt with
separately from administrative and other matters.

The tax changes dealt with in the two Bills include a variety of matters,
and I will deal with each of these. Firstly, the medical scheme
contributions, medical expenses, and employer-provided medical services.
The attached Bills provide for taxpayers to deduct medical scheme
contributions from their taxable income, provided the amount does not
exceed specified limits per beneficiary.

Where the employer pays for medical scheme membership for its employees,
this benefit will be tax free in the hands of the employee, subject to
certain gaps. These limits are R500 for each of the first two
beneficiaries, and R300 for each additional beneficiary. This proposal will
also provide relief to self-employed persons or employees not entitled to
employer-sponsored medical scheme membership.

The tax-free medical scheme contributions may be for any dependant of the
taxpayer, as defined in the Medical Schemes Act, to take cognisance of the
fact that a taxpayer may be responsible for the care of family members
other than his or her immediate family. Medical expenses exceeding 7,5% of
taxable income will also be tax deductible, and this is aimed at providing
tax relief to those taxpayers who incur high, out of pocket medical
expenses in cases of a medical catastrophe.

Other medical expenses paid are only permitted as a tax deduction in
respect of the taxpayer, spouse and children, to encourage medical scheme
membership and limit the potential for abuse in this area.

Further, in order to assist low-income earners who cannot afford even the
most basic medical scheme package, but who are entitled to employer-
provided medical care, no taxable value should be placed on this offside-
employer provided medical services. This treatment may also be provided to
the employee’s spouse and children without attracting tax in the hands of
the employee.

In terms of dealing with tax-free travel facilities, in terms of current
legislation where an employer provides free travel facilities to the
relatives of an employee to visit that employee, who may be stationed for
work purposes away from his/her main residence, this facility will be
taxable in the hands of the employee.

It is proposed that where an employee is, by virtue of the conditions of
service of that employee, placed more than 250km away from his/her main
residence, or where they ordinarily reside, any travel facilities granted
to them by their employer, to the spouse and minor children of the
employee, to visit that employee, will be taxable as a fringe benefit.
However, the employee is required to spend at least 183 days of the year in
the assessment place.

Company cars and the fringe benefit of that - as from 1 March 2006, the
monthly fringe benefit associated with the use of a company car is to be
increased from 1,8% to 2,5% of the value of the car, excluding VAT. This is
in line with the adjustments to the treatment of motor vehicle allowances.

Where an employee bears the running costs for private use of a company car,
the monthly monetary caps for fuel and maintenance are to be replaced with
percentage adjustments to the monthly fringe benefit. This would be less
0,2%, where the employee pays private fuel costs and less 0,18%, when an
employee pays private maintenance costs.

A measure to attract foreign, skilled expatriates; the implementation of
worldwide bases of taxation, and a capital gains tax in South Africa,
serves as an unintended deterrent to nonresidents with scarce skills to
work in South Africa. This system imposes taxation on a nonresident’s
foreign income and capital gains when they are physically present in the
country for a period of more than three years, and thereby become a
resident for income tax purposes. In line with other countries, essentially
this three-year limit has been extended to five years.

It is an internationally accepted practice that nonresident entertainers
and sportspersons are liable for income tax in the countries in which they
perform. A failure by South Africa to collect taxes from such persons is,
in effect, an erosion of its tax base in favour of the country of residence
of that person.

The Bill proposes that South African residents withhold a 15% tax from
payments to nonresident entertainers and sports persons, and pay the tax
over to SARS. Failure to do so will result in these residents becoming
personally liable for the tax. The withholding tax will be a final tax at a
flat rate, ie there is no need to file a tax return. This means that there
will be no opportunity to claim tax deductions.

In order to compensate for the inability to claim tax deductions, the rate
of tax to be imposed will be at 15%, which is lower than the existing
highest individual marginal rate of 40%, and the corporate rate of 29%. As
it is highly likely that these entertainers and sportspersons will be taxed
on the same income in their own countries, tax certificates will be issued
to them so that they can claim tax relief accordingly.

The Urban Development Zone Tax Incentive is intended to encourage
investments in identified urban development zones, to address the problem
of urban decay. This incentive takes the form of an accelerated
appreciation allowance for the construction of new buildings and
refurbishment of existing buildings in identified inner cities.

Under current law the allowances are available to taxpayers who own the
building, or have constructed or refurbished it, and are using it solely
for the purposes of trade, including the letting of the property. Therefore
if a developer builds, in an urban development zone with the intended on-
sale of the building, no allowance under this section will be available,
since the developer will not use the building.

The purchase of the property will also not be eligible for the allowance,
as a purchaser had not undertaken the construction or improvements.

Essentially, and I won’t go through the detail of it, we are remedying this
to allow for the first purchaser to benefit from this incentive, and the
detail is spelled out in the Amendment Bill.

With regard to public benefit organisations, given that many public benefit
organisations need to find innovative ways to raise additional finances,
provision was made to allow such PBOs to engage in certain trading
activities. However, a difficult accounting by many such PBOs is that if
their trading activities exceed the threshold as defined, their tax-exempt
status is terminated altogether. This all-or-nothing approach has proved to
be impractical.

A system of partial taxation is proposed. This means that PBOs who do
conduct business activities that fall outside the permissible trading
rules, may continue to do so without losing their exemption for nonprofit
activities. They, however, pay income tax on the income from those business
activities falling outside the allowable trading rules.

A tax-free gross income threshold of 5% of total receipts and accruals or
R50 000, whichever is the greater, will be introduced. The revised
thresholds will accommodate two concerns raised by the PBOs. It will not
discriminate against larger PBOs or those who are late for group
registration, and will allow for some, if not most, of the rental income
earned, from the letting of manses by certain churches and other faith-
based organisations, to be treated as tax-free income.

Regarding corporate restructuring, the threshold to qualify as a group of
companies is reduced from 75% to 70% to accommodate more intragroup tax-
free transfers of assets. This reduction will help to facilitate the
implementation of BEE charters. A group of companies, for example, which is
transferring a 26% interest in the group to a BEE partner, will continue to
be able to benefit from the current tax neutral intragroup transfers, and
no degrouping charge will be triggered.

The threshold to qualify for tax neutral company information transactions
has been reduced from an interest of more than 25% to 20%. This would
enable, for example, five persons to transfer assets tax-free into a
company where the parties hold equal shareholder interest in the newly
formed company. The leave provisions are also made for the incorporation of
partnerships consisting of individuals.

In order to streamline the administration of the collections of the road
accident levy, SARS will become the agency responsible for collecting the
road accident levy. Accordingly the Bill proposes various amendments to the
Customs and Excise Act of 1964, as well as the amendments to the Road
Accident Fund Act of 1966. These amendments will come into effect on the
date to be determined by the President.

Regarding measures to combat smuggling, the Bills introduce measures to
combat the smuggling of goods subject to excise and customs duty, by
introducing antidiversionary rules for goods removed in bond, and the
probation of transiting of imported cigarettes through the Republic, when
bearing the diamond stamp impression.

Regarding financial transaction tax relief with regard to the issue of new
shares, as from 1 January 2006, stamp duty, as an uncertified security tax
on the issue of new shares, will be abolished. This amendment will align
the tax treatment of shares with other financial debt instruments.
Appropriate safeguards are proposed to ensure that this exemption is not
used to avoid the payment of stamp duties, or uncertified securities tax
imposed on the sale between shareholders or the so-called secondary trade.
In regard to stamp duties, in order to limit the amount of stamp duties
that will be payable in terms of a long-term lease, a 10% limit equivalent
to the maximum transfer duty rate is proposed in respect of any lease
executed on or after 1 January 2006.

In keeping pace with modern technology, adhesive revenue stamps and
franking machines will be phased out. The Bill proposes a number of
consequential amendments to provide for the introduction of electronic
stamping. In order to simplify administration and compliance, no stamp
duties will be payable where the aggregate duty payable on a lease is R200
or less during the lessor’s financial year.

Certain amendments are being made to the VAT Act. The Bill proposes that
generally input VAT cannot be claimed on motor vehicles and entertainment
expenses. Accordingly, as proposed, vendors may claim input VAT on motor
vehicles and entertainment that are awarded as prizes, provided that bets
are placed. It is proposed that goods supplied to a foreign company, but
delivered to a registered vendor in South Africa, should be zero-rated.

This amendment will ensure that VAT is not a cost to the South African
vendor, where it contracts with a foreign company. The Bill also provides
for the zero-rating of the supply of services under a warranty agreement,
where the warrantor is a nonresident. This amendment will ensure that VAT
is not a cost to the South African vendor, where it contracts with a
foreign warrantor.

Finally, international donor-funded agreements, to which government is a
party, often contain clauses stating that the funds may only be used for
the agreed purpose, and not be spent on tax. Amendments proposed create the
mechanism to give practical effect to the agreements in that such funds
received will be zero-rated, and all VAT paid on expenses will be claimable
as an input tax.

Regulating the write-off, waiver and compromise of undisputed tax debts by
the commissioner, the now repealed Exchequer Act provided a mechanism which
enabled the then Commissioner for Inland Revenue, as part of the Treasury,
to write off the whole, or any portion of a tax claim. The Exchequer Act
was repealed upon the commencement of the Public Finance Management Act of
1999, and section 76(1), of the PFMA, and regulations issued in terms
thereof, provided for the writing off of losses of state money, or other
assets or amounts owed to the state.

However, section 76(1) and consequently the regulations issued hereunder
are not applicable to SARS. The Bill proposes that enabling legislation be
incorporated into the Income Tax Act to grant the Minister of Finance the
power to prescribe, by regulation, the circumstances of write-off, waiver,
or compromise, of undisputed tax debts. The Bill provides for the draft
regulations to be published and made to available for Parliament before
their promulgation.

Finally, on behalf of Minister Manuel, I would like to thank the chairs and
members of the PCOF and the SCOF for their constructive engagement with the
national treasury and SARS teams, with the view to improving the Revenue
Laws Amendment Bills. I thank you. [Applause.]

Order disposed of without debate.

Bill referred to the Portfolio Committee on Finance for consideration and
report.

Mr N T GODI: Chairperson, comrades and hon members, let me start off by
expressing my appreciation for the privilege and responsibility given to me
to chair this important committee. I want to give my assurance that the
trust placed in me will not be in vain. For me it is an opportunity to
serve and grow; to serve Parliament and our people in the continuous
struggle to transform our country and substantively improve the material
conditions of the majority.

It is a responsibility that I take upon me with open eyes. It is a
responsibility that I will discharge with neither fear, nor favour, sparing
neither courage nor energy in the service of our people. These are values
bequeathed to us by the liberation movement.

The reports we are presenting to the House were considered by Scopa when it
was still under the stewardship of Comrade Francois Beukman. May I take
this opportunity to salute him for the role he has played in ensuring that
Scopa, with its numerous challenges, is still able to discharge its
responsibilities as provided for in the Constitution, legislation and
National Assembly Rules.

My appreciation also goes to the members of Scopa, its administrative staff
and the Auditor-General’s Office for their service and sacrifice.

I understand that a total average of between 270 and 290 reports of the
Auditor-General are referred to Scopa annually. Scopa has to ensure that
all these reports receive the attention they deserve. This is a huge
workload.

Scopa is bringing before this House reports that, in the first instance,
have been considered to have a clean bill of health in that they were both
unqualified audits and have no material issues of concern. The committee is
happy and hopes that they will maintain this level of financial management
forever and that others can copy from them.

There are, however, other reports that have unqualified audit reports, but
have other deficiencies that Scopa believes cannot be left unconsidered or
unattended. We consider them in a serious light and we have made
recommendations that we expect these entities to follow up and report back
to Scopa to ensure compliance with the Public Finance Management Act and
Treasury regulations.

We cannot condone a situation in which a public entity keeps huge cash
reserves when the demand for service delivery is so high. Nor is it
acceptable to have incomplete asset registers, weak or almost nonexistent
internal audit mechanisms. This is a perversion of Treasury regulations.

Worst still are instances where some entities do not have fraud prevention
plans. The question of fraud prevention plans is not just a good thought;
it is legislated for and regulated. It is one of the basic building blocks
in the fight against fraud and corruption.

To not have such plans is completely intolerable. As the Auditor-General
has always indicated - and I would like to believe that that is our common
understanding - we need a preventative approach. It is more effective than
a reactive one.

If only we could - and we should - change the mind-set of the executive
authorities, the accounting authorities and the general cadreship of the
Public Service to lead by the dictum, “Prevention is better than cure”.

Some other concerns raised by Scopa look so unnecessary that they can only
be a pointer to a lackadaisical attitude towards probity, good governance
and accountability.

For example, the qualified report of the Land Bank of South Africa
contained a lot of issues that were disturbing and unacceptable. The
committee called senior management to a hearing, which then only further
confirmed the existing inadequacies. There were clear instances of
noncompliance with the Public Finance Management Act and Treasury
regulations.

What is disturbing is that in the financial year in question the bank
incurred losses, yet it was able to dish out bonuses of about R3,4 million
to senior management. On checking, we found that there were no clear
guidelines or policies for awarding bonuses.

I think that I still need to be schooled in this incomprehensible practice
of the captains of industry, of dishing out bonuses to themselves, to the
total exclusion of the workers, even when a company or entity has incurred
losses. If this is not daylight looting, I need to be enlightened
differently. The committee has made numerous tough recommendations that we
expect the bank to implement to improve its lamentable state.

As we commend these reports to the House, we commit ourselves, despite the
huge workload, to ensuring that all reports referred to Scopa by this
honourable House will receive the attention they deserve. Scopa will
continue to work as methodically as possible, sifting the more serious
reports from the less serious ones, and dealing with the more serious
reports in sufficient detail.

The criteria that Scopa uses are well known. We’ll have to see whether
these should be improved to make Scopa’s examinations even more relevant to
the priorities of Parliament, for example, the optimal utilisation of
public resources, intolerance of fraud and corruption and effective
administration that can support the service delivery that our people
deserve.

Scopa seeks to ensure improved financial management to provide quality
public service and ensure careful use of public money. There is indeed a
very direct relationship between effective financial management and service
delivery.

The dialectical transformation of the institution of Parliament also
involves the areas of focus and method of work of committees, including
Scopa. From what I have so far heard and seen as chairperson, one may want
to see improvements in one or two areas that might need priority attention.

It seems that the time line from the date of a hearing to the tabling of
reports and recommendations in the House is too long. These well-considered
reports make appropriate recommendations on identified areas of concern. It
would enhance oversight processes if these recommendations were brought to
the appropriate authorities more quickly.

The Rules Committee’s Task Team on Accountability and Oversight focus group
is developing a best practice guide on parliamentary oversight with respect
to parliamentary committees, and one of its recommendations is that
Parliament should develop a mechanism and processes to monitor the
implementation of its recommendations to the executive to ensure improved
executive compliance.

The effectiveness of Scopa is dependent on the response to its
recommendations. Where entities have responded positively to Scopa’s
recommendations the overall quality of their financial management and
administration has improved. It is, therefore, not surprising that these
institutions have unqualified opinions.

Another aspect that needs attention relates to cases where departments or
entities appear before Scopa year after year, and often with much the same
problems, without financial management as one of their strategic
objectives. Surely, if an institution’s financial management doesn’t get a
clean bill of health from the Auditor-General, then improving its financial
management should be an obvious strategic objective, and Scopa would have
to ensure this.

Lastly, comrades and hon members, I think it is appropriate for me to
dispel the myth, once and for all, that there is anyone in this country who
is more concerned about fraud and corruption than the liberation movement.
Corruption is about greed, and not poverty. It is the well connected, the
well off, and not the poor, who are the motivating force of corruption.

It is about a clique of the ideologically corrupt acting against the
people. It is completely inimical, in sharp contradiction with the ethos
and values of the liberation movement. It is against revolutionary
morality.

There is, therefore, no way that the liberation movement can sacrifice
itself on the altar of corruption. Of course, in our unceasing battle
against corruption we are not going to be hysterical. We will be systematic
and unequivocal; just firm and decisive.

We fought for this democracy, and the spirit of our martyrs forbids that we
can hand the baton of guarding and advancing this democracy to reactionary
elements, not now, not ever! Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr T R MOFOKENG: Hon Chair, the House at large, allow me to welcome and
congratulate our new chairperson. I give him our vote of confidence and
hope that the workload we have on our hands will be minimised. And I hope
that he will work within the maximum speed limit required by this
institution. He has already indicated his intention to do so, and I
appreciate it.

Today’s debate on Scopa is not surprising, I think. I think it has not been
held in this institution for many, many years. Now the question is: Why do
we have it today?

That shows that there is really improvement in that committee. Without any
fear of contradiction, we are not worried that there will be any criticism.
Our aim is to deal with corruption. That is the reason we brought this
issue for debate here. Whoever thinks that we are not doing the right thing
should spell that out clearly.

The work of Scopa is not merely about ensuring proper financial management
in government departments and public entities. Scopa’s oversight role is
important to service delivery.

Coming to the reports, I think that we have got approximately 42 reports.
However, of the 42 reports 17 deal with the education Setas. Of the 42,
four reports, I think, deal with unauthorised spending. However, the
chairperson of the task team will deal with that.

I would like to dwell more on 17 of the 42 reports. To throw some light on
this, at Scopa we allocated members to deal with the administration. Even
though our approach is more political, we are dealing more with the
administrative side of things. You take along documents and deal with them
over the weekend.

The question of Setas, which we are considering now, is normally dealt with
by hon member Don. Apparently, when we were called in I had to deal with it
myself. He normally deals with close to 70 entities of all the Setas. So
without any waste of time, let me proceed to the matter.

I will speak exclusively on the 17 reports of Scopa that deal primarily
with the Sector Education and Training Authority. The Skills Development
Act of 1998 and the Skills Development Levies Act of 1999 were specifically
put in place to address the skills shortage in our country by encouraging
and supporting training across all sectors of the economy through the
Setas, and therefore those falling under their jurisdiction should make
every effort to adhere to the policy framework contained in the
legislation.

The question is: Why are we pushing for the education Setas? I think that
we are responding to a statement that has been made by the President many a
time about the problem that we have in our country, that our country is
handicapped by the so-called “two economies”. So to deal with this
dualistic economic model we have to think of the labourers based in rural
areas moving to urban areas. As they move, they try to fit into the modern
economy.

The modern economy has for years been fraught with problems related to
apartheid. So its not going to be easy to pay the salaries paid in the
modern economy. That is the reason you will find a big gap existing between
the highest paid and the lowest paid workers.

As is the case with all annual reports before Scopa, we carefully
scrutinise all reports from the Setas. In most cases these are unqualified
audit reports. This is indeed a compliment to the Minister for the manner
in which he deals with the Setas.

Occasionally, there are Setas that do not meet the requirements. In those
instances Scopa does not hesitate to outline to the Minister, through the
resolutions, the areas that need improvement.

At Scopa we believe that we are not here to haunt the Ministries and
examine with malicious intent all their financial accounting structures.
Rather, we are here to work with the Ministries to rectify things where
there have been contraventions of the Public Finance Management Act and
Treasury regulations in order to achieve compliance with these.

So in the case of the 49th report on Forestry, Industry, Education and
Training, which had an unqualified audit report, we found that Fiat had not
submitted its budget by 30 September 2003 as required in terms of the
Public Finance Management Act. We thought it prudent to bring this matter
to the attention of the Minister of Labour.
Similarly, there were cases in which Scopa was very concerned about the
very excessive surplus, as was the case in the 50th report of the Health,
Wealth Sector Education and Training Authority. Again, the Auditor-General
gave an unqualified audit opinion, but Scopa requires details of how and
when the Health, Wealth Sector Education and Training Authority plans to
reduce excessive cash reserves.

We found that they still have lots of cash reserves in their budget, which
will get rolled over the following year. Now this gives a bad picture. The
same holds true for the Advertising, Publishing, Printing and Packaging
Seta.

Here Scopa requires a progress report regarding the forensic audit into
discrepancies regarding grant payments. Consciously, we believe, as any ANC
member would, that it is in the interests of the new democracy to ensure
that those who attempt devious means of self-enrichment by diverting
government funds into their own pockets are found out and removed from the
positions of trust that they hold.

We cannot, and will not, condone corruption in any form, which will
undermine this democracy that you people have fought hard for.
Consequently, we know that the National Skills Development Strategy was
reviewed by the Minister and tabled for adoption by Cabinet in January
2004, and proposed for implementation in April 2005. This is, of course, a
very welcome intervention since it seeks to prioritise certain areas of
work and to direct skills and funds to where they are most needed.

We are pleased to note in the Ministry of Labour’s annual report, that the
Minister has instituted a uniform set of annual financial statements for
the Setas. Scopa is also pleased that in addition to this, the statements
of the Setas were consolidated in the new format prescribed by the Office
of the Accountant-General.

These positive steps augur well for increased financial accountability and
adherence to the Public Finance Management Act and Treasury regulations.

Scopa is also awaiting the full implementation of the National Skills
Development Strategy from 2005 to 2010, which the Minister of Labour hopes
will play a key role in realising government’s goal of halving the
country’s unemployment by 2014.

The Minister sees learnerships and internships targeted at unemployed
youths as critical to addressing unemployment. For the adults he sees adult
basic education and training policy, driven through the National Skills
Development Strategy, as a way to enhance the basic skills of people beyond
their school-going years and tackle long-term unemployment.

We wish the Minister of Labour well in his endeavours to bring about sound
financial accountability in the many Setas under his jurisdiction. We look
forward to the new annual reports, which are already in Parliament for our
scrutiny. I think I am through, Chair. Thank you very much to everybody.
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr E W TRENT: Acting Deputy Speaker, during the period 1994 to 2004, I
served on and chaired our province’s standing committee on public accounts.
I believe that I have sufficient experience and the licence to make a few
fundamentally important observations as a contribution to the ongoing
debate on accountability and oversight.

If hon members accept the recommendations of this afternoon’s debate, and
hopefully they will, they must be reminded that they must have something in
mind at the end. It’s not just a debate.

Let me illustrate this Transformation, oversight and accountability are
powerful words. I hear them often. However, if transformation fails to
improve the lives of the intended beneficiaries, then it remains just a
meaningless word.

By the same token, if the oversight role of Parliament, and therefore that
of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts does not result in improved
accountability on the part of the executive, and of course the resultant
better governance and use of resources, then the word ``oversight’’ also
becomes meaningless.

The reports under discussion deal with government entities, not
departments, and they were tabled during the last quarter of last year.
They, however, remain the direct responsibility of the various Cabinet
Ministers and, I presume, the Deputy Ministers.

On 14 September, 27 were tabled, and then again, in October, a further 17
were tabled. I will deal with each group separately, but briefly, because
of the time constraints. However, all are published in full in the
Announcements, Tablings and Committee Reports.

I have divided the 26 reports tabled in September into four basic
categories. Eight of these entities can be described as being in the
financial sector. All are clean, except for the Land Bank, a very important
institution if we are going to succeed in assisting emerging farmers under
the government’s programme of land reform. Sadly, this institution remains
problematic.

Scopa has recommended 20 interventions. However, it is important for hon
members to note that these recommendations will take effect after the Land
Bank’s 2005 annual report and audit report has already been tabled. The
time lag is simply too long.

There are reports from 14 sector education and training authorities - four
have clean reports, nine carry the obligation to respond to Parliament in
60 days. This is a new innovation. If we are serious about addressing the
skills shortage, Setas must be made to work. It is therefore disappointing
that the Auditor-General has seen fit, once again, to raise the issue of
excessively high cash reserves in some of them.

Three are environmental entities, all with clean reports, and finally, the
National Gambling Board, the wild card, is okay. I’m not so sure that those
who frequent the casinos whilst their families starve are OK, but that is a
personal opinion.

The Scopa reports tabled on 12 October contain at least 40 recommendations
that are broken into subrecommendations. There are many, many more matters
that have to be dealt with. Many of them also carry the 60-day requirement.

If Parliament says yes to these recommendations, and it does so in the
belief that this will lead to better governance, then Parliament must also
be prepared to say yes to punitive action against those who fail to respond
to the decisions of this House. What are our chances of success if history
continues to repeat itself? The end objective of this process must be to
get responses as quickly as possible, because poor financial management
leads to wastage of resources, fraud and theft.

I have tracked the Scopa reports tabled on 16 March, and 18 May
respectively, which were adopted on 7 June. There were only six, comprising
four entities and two departments. The entities pose no problem, but the
two departments, Correctional Services and Public Works were asked to
respond, collectively, to no less than 17 recommendations that deal with
serious matters. It is important to note that these recommendations were
adopted by this House. I am not aware of any responses that have been
tabled thus far.

I am also concerned about the time lags between the tabling of annual
reports and the ultimate acceptance of Scopa recommendations by this House.
Let me illustrate by using just a random example. The Department of
Correctional Services tabled its 2004 report on 30 September 2004. Scopa’s
report was finally adopted by Parliament on 7 June this year. By then, the
2005 accounts were almost ready for audit.

I use this example – and there are many – not as a criticism of the
committee, but to emphasise that all is not well with Parliament’s
oversight role.

I conclude with a few observations in respect of the draft final report on
the developing of a best practice guide for Parliament’s oversight role. I
have noted the challenges set out on pages 24 and 29, and the chair
referred to this. I quote:
  There is very little follow-up on recommendations to the executive.
  Committees do not have the power to sanction the executive when the
  latter does not comply with a request of this committee.


I repeat: If the end objective to this whole process is better governance,
then we cannot continue to allow reports and recommendations to pass
through the system simply to be ignored. There is no rule that specifically
places an obligation on the executive committee to report and respond to
decisions of this House. There are no easy choices. If we are to have
voluntary compliance, as is pointed out in a document by the state law
adviser of 27 August 1999, it doesn’t seem as if that is going to come
easily.

The simple fact is that a recommendation to the executive remains but a
recommendation, even though it emanated from a parliamentary committee and
has been endorsed by a House of Parliament. That is what the law advisers
to Parliament tell us.

However, Parliament is not without redress. There are other avenues to
explore. The refusal or the failure of the executive to act in accordance
with the recommendations of the committee need not necessarily be the end
of the matter. Parliament, by virtue of its position as the supreme
legislative authority, could pass legislation to regulate or rectify the
mischief concerned, thus imposing its legislative will on the executive.

I am sure that none of us would like to go to those ends, and hopefully, in
this new phase in Scopa’s cycle, we will get better co-operation from the
executive. What we need to understand is that it is no good the executive’s
passing the buck to civil servants. They carry the ultimate responsibility
for what happens in their departments, and they also carry the
responsibility for those entities that fall within the jurisdiction of
their departments.

The DA will be supporting these reports, and we look forward in
anticipation to see how many of them are responded to by the executive
committee. [Applause.]

Mr H J BEKKER: Hon Mr Deputy Speaker, I am glad to see you here. It may
only be for a few days, but at least the “misters” have gained control of
this honourable House for a few days.

The IFP supports the comments and all the relevant reports of the Standing
Committee on Public Accounts, the relevant reports from the 32nd report to
the 74th report, totalling an enormous 43 reports. This, in no uncertain
way, reflects the enormity and scope of work being done by this standing
committee.

Primarily, this debate is about the approval of the reports as listed. I
have, however, not been an integral part of the Scopa committee, since I
have just been redeployed by my party to be the principal member.

I have, however, in the past, served for several years on this committee
during the previous political dispensation. Therefore, I have a real
appreciation of the workload and the dedication required from members. More
so, I do have sympathy for our new chairperson, and I can only wish him
well with his great task. He will have the full support of the IFP. Also, I
congratulate the hon Godi on his maiden speech as chairperson.

I cannot speak on the detail of the reports, since this is my first speech
in my new capacity. Acting Deputy Speaker, I hope I will have the latitude
and your protection, as this is practically also a maiden speech. So,
therefore, I am now hopefully being protected against howling and
interjections.

I haven’t had that privilege since 1981. In fact, since 1981, this is now
approximately my fourth maiden speech, taking into consideration my sojourn
between provincial legislatures, and moving forwards and backwards in this
highly esteemed Chamber of the National Assembly.

Coming back to the importance of the Scopa reports and detailed minutes of
this committee, it may suffice to reflect on some of the watchdog
achievements going back to even the previous dispensation.

Scopa was, at that time, indeed responsible for the ultimate appointments
of judicial commissions into the corruption scandal of the then Department
of Bantu Education, and more so the investigation into the atrocities of
the Civil Co-operation Bureau. Scopa and even the representatives of the
then ruling party had to convince a reluctant State President to appoint
the relevant judicial committees.

In this regard, I personally played a role, particularly in respect of the
CCB, when I requested and proposed a snap debate on the atrocities, which
was duly seconded by Mr Harry Schwartz of the opposition. This snap debate
indeed opened the proverbial ``can of worms’’.

Scopa will remain important and will carry on its duty as the watchdog of
this government. [Time expired.]

Mr S N SWART: Chairperson, the ACDP would firstly like to commend the
Standing Committee on Public Accounts for its sterling work this year, and
congratulates the new chairman, Mr Godi, on his appointment.

Scopa scrutinises annual reports and the Auditor-General’s reports and, in
so doing, holds national departments, public entities and government
business enterprises financially accountable in terms of the Public Finance
Management Act and the Treasury regulations.

We in the ACDP share concerns regarding the long period of time it takes to
respond to decisions of this committee and this House, and believe that
something needs to be done in this regard.

In the limited time at my disposal, I would like to highlight certain
aspects from the report. We share the concerns relating to the Land Bank,
regarding the late submission of financial statements and their
incompleteness. How is it possible that financial statements were not drawn
up in accordance with generally accepted principles of accounting practice
regarding impairments, that is, the difference between the book value and
the expected recoverable amount? And this for a bank! In the absence of
this accounting requirement, how will this bank know what the correct
amount recoverable from its debtors should be? No wonder that bad debts to
the amount of approximately R1 million were written off in the period under
review.

We share concerns that bonuses to the total amount of R3,4 million were
paid, notwithstanding that the bank experienced losses. A further concern
is that the bank’s key capital adequacy rate fell from 12% to 9,8% for the
year under review. We agree that the liquidity situation of the bank is too
low, and must be built up to an acceptable level.

Regarding other Scopa reports, we note that Scopa recommends that
Parliament approve unauthorised expenditure of various amounts in various
departments, such as R1,591 million in government communications, for
example.

We note the various concerns expressed by the committee and that various
national departments, public entities and government business enterprises
will be closely monitored. This, in addition to parliamentary portfolio
committees checking expenditure against Budget Votes, should have resolved
problems of financial accounting. However, again we look at the delay in
these entities responding to the concerns that Scopa and the portfolio
committees raised, and again I reiterate that something needs to be done in
this regard.

What can be done? The point was raised in the reports that we in Parliament
have ensured that the Public Finance Management Act contains provisions
aimed at strict budgetary discipline. This must be emphasised. All
instances of unauthorised expenditure should be thoroughly scrutinised to
ensure compliance with sections 34, 38 and 81 of the PFMA. Section 81
contains provisions relating to financial misconduct by accounting officers
and can result in disciplinary action. Perhaps Scopa should consider
instituting disciplinary action against accounting officers where such
action is warranted.
In conclusion, we are pleased to note that the majority of entities
considered by Scopa received unqualified auditor’s opinions. Therefore, the
ACDP will support these reports. I thank you.

Mr P A GERBER: Deputy Speaker, on behalf of the ANC, I’d like to welcome Mr
Godi as chairperson to this committee. I also would like to welcome Mr
Hennie Bekker back to this committee because he has been on this committee
since 1994. I believe that Dr Woods is apparently leaving the committee,
and I’d like to thank him for the hard work he has done on this committee.

I would like to concentrate only on two of these reports we are tabling
today. One of these is the report of the South African National Parks
Board. Although it is a clean report, one is a bit concerned if you look at
certain information in their latest report. For instance, its turnover
increased by only 6% from R392 million to R419 million. Its salaries rose
by 9% from R233 million to R256 million. These figures might look
insignificant to you, but the salaries constitute more than 60% of their
turnover. This can’t be healthy.

If SA National Parks’ turnover was compared to the market value of their
nature reserves, then it will be one of South Africa’s biggest under-
performers in terms of capital and turnover.

The SA National Parks also has a board of 18 people. One can dissect the
attendance register of all the board meetings, and it will raise a few
questions of concern. However, what concerns us the most is that the seven-
member audit committee had only met six times during the course of that
year. Only the chairperson of the audit committee attended all six of these
audit committee meetings. The other six members only attended one meeting
each. This is sad, Mr Acting Speaker, and really unacceptable.

The SA National Parks earned income less than the R43 million, namely R41
million. Yet its executive management were paid R9 million, of which R2
million was for bonuses.

Scopa is basically concerned with value for money for the taxpayer and the
state. I think the Department of Environmental affairs and Tourism should
go and analyse if SA National Parks is still the best vehicle in terms of
value for money for the taxpayer to manage these most beautiful parks in
the world. Other reasons that were motivated for the formation of that unit
are still valid today.

I’d like to move on to the report on the SA Diamonds Board. One of these
reports deals with investigation relating to the export and sale of
diamonds in terms of the Diamonds Act of 1986. The committee noted with
concern the significant weaknesses highlighted in the audit report with
regard to the export and sale of diamonds.

The following issues were raised: firstly, the validity of exemptions given
under section 63 of the Diamond Producers and Dealers Act by virtue of
agreements entered into in terms of section 59 of the Act; secondly,
limited documentation for section 59 agreements; Thirdly, the drastic
decline in export duties;
fourthly, differences and disputes between the government diamond valuator
and the South African Diamond Board relating to the role and functions of
the government diamond valuator; and lastly, the length of time for which
the above issue remained unresolved.

Having heard and considered the views of National Treasury, the South
African Diamond Board, the Department of Minerals and Energy and the
Auditor-General, the committee is of the view that this matter has been
unduly prolonged. The committee is aware of the many administrative
initiatives to resolve these issues, but notes the failure of these to
produce any positive results.

The committee therefore recommends that firstly, the relevant state
institutions should initiate legal proceedings with the view to resolving
the section 59 exemptions in question; and that a special meeting should be
convened by the Auditor-General for this purpose within 30 days after this
report has been accepted and adopted by Parliament - in other words, 30
days from today. Secondly, the board should ensure that all South African-
produced diamonds be valued in South Africa on a fair market basis.
Thirdly, the board should strengthen its efforts to increase local
beneficiation of South African diamonds. Lastly, the board should confer
with the Department of Minerals and Energy to finalise and implement the
new legislation.

In a nutshell, we had a public hearing with the South African Diamond
Board. The Auditor-General raised questions about the shipment of R19
million carats of uncut diamonds where De Beers shipped more than nearly
three tons to London just before the April 1994 elections and avoided
paying the 15% export duty to the state. Scopa investigated the matter as
millions of rands, if not a billion rand, in export duty was at stake.

Scopa is now adopting this resolution, which we will bring to the House on
the matter, asking that the relevant state institutions should initiate
legal proceedings with a view towards resolving the section 59 exemption in
question. A special meeting is to be convened by the Auditor-General with
all stakeholders within 30 days after today to resolve this issue. This
resolution we are bringing to this House today. All we want this company to
do is to give us a copy of the exemption from paying this 15% export duty -
nothing else, nothing more and nothing less.

Apparently, the same thing also happened on the eve of the independence of
Namibia with certain mining companies. They say the golden rule in Africa
is: He who controls the gold, makes the rules.

I thank all the members of Scopa for their hard work in processing all
these reports, as this is our last report for the year. Thank you very
much, Mr Deputy Speaker. [Applause.]

Mr B E PULE: Hon Chair and hon members, the Standing Committee on Public
Accounts looked at the aforementioned annual reports, that is the 32nd and
74th Reports.

Scopa observed that most reports were generally unqualified, but there were
some concerns about some matters such as those in the 54th report, that is,
that of the Chemical Industries Sector Education and Training Authority.
The following were noted: Firstly, there was no fraud prevention plan as
required by Treasury Regulation No 21.2.1; secondly, there were no weekly
bank reconciliations as required by the Public Finance Management Act; and
thirdly, they failed to update the asset register during the 2003-04
financial year.

Furthermore, there are some unauthorised expenditures in some reports:
firstly, R1 million incurred by GCIS during the 2003-04 financial year;
secondly, R491,2 million and R256,9 million incurred by the Department of
the Presidency in 1998-99 and 2002-03 respectively; thirdly, R4,6 million
incurred by the Department of Home Affairs in the 2000-01 financial year;
and fourthly, R4,3 million incurred by the entity Samdi in the 2002-03
financial year.

After considering the evidence provided by National Treasury and the
department, the committee recommended approval of expenditure by Parliament
where it was found that the expenditure was not wasteful or fruitless. It
is only on those conditions that the approval could be made.

Allow me furthermore, Chairperson, to revert to the most disturbing report
among these reports, that is, the 32nd report on the Agricultural Bank of
South Africa. The following were of great concern: firstly, noncompliance
with generally accepted accounting principles - Gaap; and secondly,
unresolved deficiencies in the banking loan module of the computer system
used by the Agricultural Bank of South Africa during the 2003-04 financial
year - there were also a number of internal control weaknesses identified;
and thirdly, bad debts to the value of R1 million written off during
February 2004 without formalised approved policies and procedures. [Time
expired.]

Mr T LIKOTSI: Hon Chairperson, the PAC wishes to join all progressive
political parties in congratulating the incoming  committee chairperson.
I’m sure he is going to be equal to the task.

On the report, the PAC wishes to observe that almost all the reports of the
Standing Committees are unqualified; that some committees default on
various administrative issues such as rules, regulations, policies and
accounting procedures that do not conform to the Generally Accepted
Municipal Accounting Practices and the Public Management Finance Act. These
are basic accounting principles and must be followed.

On the internal auditing functions, deficiency and incomplete asset
register may lead to nontracing of default and theft. Some committees
failed to submit their budgets timeously, and as a result they may be
affected by unauthorised expenditures.

There are high costs of research in some Setas, and that is to the
disadvantage of the unskilled and unemployable persons.

In conclusion, some Setas have no fraud-prevention plan whilst this country
is fast being affected by fraud and corruption. I thank you, hon
Chairperson. [Time expired.]

Ms S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, with regard to the public accounts investigated
by Scopa, all accounts appeared to be adequately managed and maintained;
and if any remedy is needed for an account, that too appears to be in
place.

This, the MF finds, creates satisfaction with and trust and confidence in
the system that appears to be adequately managing the sector. Our
compliments are extended to those accounting institutes that have rendered
these services and delivered effectively on the task of balancing all
public accounts.

We especially extend our good wishes to the independent auditors for the
forthcoming year and the reports they will efficiently, effectively and
precisely deliver.

The transparency advocated by our nation is tremendously important to the
democracy we are building, maintaining and upholding. The people have a
right to all this information, not only to have access to the doings of the
government but to engender confidence in our responsibility towards them
and our nation.

The MF takes this opportunity to thank Scopa for bringing to the House an
open and descriptive report of our public accounts situation. We respect
this and expect that this efficiency and delivery will be maintained. The
MF supports the 32nd and 74th Scopa Reports.

May I also take these few minutes to congratulate hon Godi on his
appointment as the Chairperson of Scopa. Thank you very much, Chairperson.
[Applause.]

Mr S SIMMONS: Deputy Speaker, having read the report of the Standing
Committee on Public Accounts on the Land Bank and Agricultural Bank of
South Africa dated 7 September 2005, it has become abundantly clear
according to the evidence submitted by the Auditor-General that the
financial statements of the Land Bank for the year ended 31 March 2004,
leave much to be desired.

Why are so many loans being written off by the said bank? The UPSA is of
the opinion that improper criteria are being applied when considering a
loan application. This should be the starting point in preventing a
continuation of the huge number of bad debts that have occurred up to now.

In conclusion, the UPSA calls for a review of the application criteria as
well as the appointment of competent loan officers. I thank you,
Chairperson.

Mr V G SMITH: Chairperson, in 1999 the Minister of Finance stated that the
Public Finance Management Act is one of the most important pieces of
legislation passed by the first democratic government in this country. He
went further to state that the Act promotes the objective of good financial
management in order to maximise delivery through the efficient and
effective use of limited resources.

It is for this reason that Scopa and Parliament have a duty to intensify
the scrutiny of financial management by government departments and
agencies.

Having considered the Auditor-General’s reports, Scopa presents over 40
resolutions to Parliament for consideration. The overwhelming majority of
these reports are unqualified and we acknowledge the visible improvement by
departments as far as financial management is concerned.

At the same time, it must be noted that among these resolutions being
tabled today, four departments have incurred unauthorised expenditure
totalling R13 706 962. In simple terms, what we are saying is that these
four departments overspent their allocated budgets in excess of R13,7
million.

It is of concern to Scopa that the Auditor-General’s reports highlight
incidences of unauthorised expenditure incurred by some government
departments year after year. The question that we must all answer is: Was
the overexpenditure a result of poor financial
planning and poor financial management, or was this expenditure a result of
unforeseen circumstances? Or, if this expenditure was not incurred, would
the results of not incurring such expenditure be life threatening?

These questions must be answered before Parliament can approve any
unauthorised expenditure, especially in the light of the fact that section
81 of the Public Finance Management Act states that an accounting officer
for a department or a constitutional institution commits an act of
financial misconduct if that accounting officer wilfully or negligently
makes or permits an unauthorised expenditure, an irregular expenditure or a
fruitless and wasteful expenditure.

Section 34 of the Public Finance Management Act is very clear that
unauthorised expenditure does not automatically become a charge against a
Revenue Fund unless when such expenditure is approved by Parliament.

An HON MEMBER: Why?

Mr V G SMITH: I’ll tell you why in a few minutes. Finally, section 38(2)
states that an accounting officer may not commit a department, trading
entity or a constitutional institution to any liability for which money has
not been appropriated. In the event of Parliament not approving the
unauthorised expenditure incurred, this amount becomes a charge against the
funds allocated for the next future financial years under the relevant
department’s budget.

This in essence means that departments will have less to spend in future
years and, as a result, service delivery will be hampered and the ultimate
goal of pushing back the frontiers of poverty may just not be attained.

After consulting with National Treasury and the Auditor-General, Scopa
established that the reasons for unauthorised expenditure were as a result
of noncompliance with procurement procedures totalling R4,5 million,
noncompliance with National Treasury regulations totalling R653 000 and
overspending totalling R8,5 million.

In considering its resolution to recommend approval for the unauthorised
amounts, Scopa was satisfied that the services for expenditure were
received to the satisfaction of the department, that no individual
benefited from such expenditure and that control measures are now in place
to prevent this from reoccurring. Today we, as Scopa, are recommending to
Parliament that these amounts of unauthorised expenditure be approved and
charged against the Revenue Fund.

Future requests by the departments that Scopa and Parliament consider
unauthorised expenditure and finally approve such will be subjected to
thorough evaluation before any approval is granted.

The reality of our oversight role as Scopa is that we only get to find out
about these deviations from approved budgets by departments, 12 to 18
months after the fact. By this time, corrective action might not be as
useful as it might have been had corrective action or explanations been
sought much earlier in the oversight cycle.

For the financial oversight cycle to be more comprehensive and meaningful,
portfolio committees must be encouraged to review actual spending versus
budgets of departments on a more regular basis during the course of the
current financial period.

Finally, we want to take this opportunity of welcoming the chairperson of
Scopa and assure the hon Godi that the ANC, together with him, will ensure
that oversight and accountability grows from strength to strength. Thank
you very much, Chairperson. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, I move:

  That the Reports be adopted.

Motion agreed to.

Reports accordingly adopted.

The House adjourned at 16:11.

    Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2004 / 2005 of the Department
    of Science and Technology and Entities, dated 8 November 2005:

        The Portfolio Committee on Science and Technology, having
        considered and examined the Annual Reports of the Department of
        Science and Technology (DST), the National Research Foundation
        (NRF), the Africa Institute of South Africa (AISA), GODISA, the
        South African Council for Natural Scientific Professions (SACNASP),
        TSHUMISANO, the Academy of Science of South Africa (ASSAF), the

        of Innovation (NACI) accountable to it, reports that it has

3.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Finance on the Special Pensions
    Amendment Bill [B 28 -2005] (National Assembly – sec 75), dated 8
    November 2005:

        The Portfolio Committee on Finance, having considered the subject
        of the Special Pensions Amendment Bill [B28 – 2005](National
        Assembly – sec 75), referred to it and classified by the Joint
        Tagging Mechanism as a section 75 Bill, reports the Bill with
        amendments [B 28A-2005].

        The Committee recognises that there are potential beneficiaries who
        have met all, except the age criteria. Given the original purpose
        of the Special Pensions Act, 1996 (Act No. 69 of 1996) to address
        people who have rendered service in the establishment of a non-
        racial democratic constitutional order, the Committee has resolved
        that the Executive should urgently develop other measures to
        address the plight of those excluded purely on the basis of age,
        and that the Executive should report to the House within six months
        on progress made in this regard.
