    reform in South Africa, particularly in the provinces, the Select
    Committee on Education and Recreation (Arts and Culture, Science and
    Technology, Sport and Recreation) undertook a study tour to Brazil
    between 28 February and 4 March 2005. As part of the study tour to
    Brazil, the Committee reports as follows:

2.    Objective of the study tour

      The main objective of the study tour was to study the education

      The following Parliamentary support staff accompanied the delegation
    to the study tour:

   1) Ms. C. Gcasamba, Committee Secretary.
   2) Mr. Z. A. Mvulane, Parliamentary Researcher.

4.    Meeting with the Ministry of Education

      On the first day of the study tour, the Committee met with the
    Director of the Ministry of Education in Brazil. The Director briefed
    the Committee on the social dynamics that are facing access to
    education and education reform in Brazil, as follows:

      The fifth-largest country in the world with the fifth-largest
    population, Brazil is the leading economic and political power in South
    America. Despite this, Brazil has several social and economic
    inequalities. Thus, over the years universal quality education for all
    has been identified as a key aspect in the Brazilian Government
    priorities. Since teaching and training in general is a key element of
    the drive to improve the quality of education at all levels, in 2004
    the Brazilian Ministry of Education developed over 227 educational and
    teaching training programmes, from Elementary School to Adults’
    Education, from special classes for youth and adult literacy to
    undergraduate and graduate courses.

      In January 2001, the President of the Republic of Brazil, the
    Honourable Mr. Fernando Henrique Cardoso and the Minister of Education,
    the Honourable Mr. Paulo Renato approved a new National Education Plan.
    Formulated through a participatory process involving civil society,
    academics and education professionals, government and congress leaders,
    the Plan sets education guidelines, goals and priorities to be
    implemented by the end of this decade in Brazil. Its premises and
    proposals are in line with the Education for All goals of the World
    Education Forum held in Dakar, Senegal, in April 2000.

      According to the Plan, the three levels of government, the Federal,
    State and Municipalities are committed to adopting measures to raise
    the Brazilian population’s level of schooling, improve the quality of
    education, reducing social and regional inequalities that hinder access
    to education and democratising the management of public education by
    the end of the decade.

      The approval of the National Education Plan has been a decisive step
    in guaranteeing education for all in Brazil from primary to Higher
    Education. The country is currently designing plans at the Municipal
    and the State levels to guarantee that the commitments and the goals of
    the National Education Plan be clearly achieved in order to improve the
    levels of education of the people of Brazil, particularly the poor.

      The main objectives and priorities of the Plan are to ensure:

    • A global raise in the level of schooling of the population.
    • An increase in the quality of instruction at all levels.
    • The reduction of social and regional discrepancies, concerning access
      and survival in public education.
    • The democratisation of the management of public education.

      The Plan specifies five priorities:

    • Guaranteeing access to and ensuring completion of compulsory primary
      and lower secondary schooling through eighth grade to all children
      aged 7 through 14.
    • Guaranteeing compulsory primary and lower secondary education to those
      who did not have access to it at the proper age or to those who did
      not complete it, which includes eradicating adult illiteracy.
    • Expanding schooling at the other levels.
    • Enhancing the status of education professionals.
    • Developing an information and evaluation system at all levels of
      instruction and in all types of education.

      In its quest to strengthen schools in Brazil, the Ministry of
    Education enhances the goals of unifying schools as the key factors in
    the educational process, as well as improving the consistency of
    federal government policies to improve primary education. New forms of
    assistance have been created, aimed at directly supporting schools and
    teacher performance in the classroom, so as to provide the necessary
    support to face the challenge of ensuring school space for all
    children. Sending the funds directly to the schools not only
    strengthens their autonomy, but also serves as a strong incentive for
    community participation in management of the schools. Furthermore, this
    policy helps to promote school accountability through the visible
    results of its undertakings, which encourages striving for new quality
    standards in educational management.

      The Constitutional Amendment 14 established in 1996 the primary
    jurisdiction of the states and municipalities as being responsible for
    providing primary education, with the federal government role being to
    mobilize and serve as a catalyst, as well as providing technical
    assistance, funds and other mechanisms, operating in a redistributive
    manner. The new National Education Guidelines and Standards Law (LDB –
    Lei de Diretrizes e Bases da Educação Nacional), also from 1996, is
    guided by the goals of both decentralizing and adding flexibility to
    the organization and carrying out of teaching, facilitating a greater
    adaptation of programmes and pedagogical practices to suit local
    circumstances.

4.1   Enhancing primary education and the teaching profession

      The Ministry is responsible for the improvement of the quality of
    primary education and enhancing the teaching profession and in ensuring
    that a minimum investment per student is met, especially in the lower
    income regions of Brazil. Associated with this goal is the
    implementation of the Education Plan and the Fund for the Development
    of Primary Education and the Teaching Profession that seeks to ensure a
    co-ordinated and efficient strategy to increase the employment services
    for teachers in Brazil. This includes redress against the unfairness of
    teachers’ income guaranteeing increases in the average salaries,
    correcting disparities in the teaching profession and, therefore,
    improving the quality of education. This fund is composed of
    contributions from the federal, state and municipal governments, with
    the federal government responsible for adding more money to the fund
    whenever the amount per student does not reach the minimum stipulated
    nationally.

4.2   The National Fund of Education Development (FNED)

      The National Fund of Education Development (FNED) is responsible for
    the following financial policy programmes:

    • The National Programme for School Nutrition.
    • Agreements for school renovations.
    • School Agreements delegated by the Minister of Education.

4.3   Funding for education in Brazil

      One of the goals of the transformation of education in Brazil has
    been driven by the country’s guarantee for the provision of financial
    support for the education transformation agenda, which is aimed at
    ensuring a regular flow of public funds to education. This guarantee is
    related to several basic guidelines. The first is the existence of
    constitutionally earmarked resources for the maintenance and the
    development of education.

      The 1988 Constitution establishes that states and municipalities must
    invest at least 25% of their tax revenue in education. The Federal
    Administration must invest a minimum of 18% of its tax revenue, 30% of
    which must be earmarked for actions to eradicate illiteracy and
    maintain and develop primary and lower secondary education.

      In addition, compulsory primary and lower secondary education receive
    additional funding provided by corporations under the form of a
    compulsory social contribution called Education Salary, amounting to
    2,5% of the pay-roll. One third of these contributions is allocated to
    the National Education Development Fund and two thirds make up similar
    funds, in the States where the contribution is collected. The Education
    Salary Fund is used only to public elementary schools.

4.4   The School Transformation Programme
      This Programme funds learners in public schools that live in the
    rural parts of Brazil. It is a fixed amount, which is distributed per
    capita or per leaner. It covers 5 350 municipalities throughout Brazil.
    One main challenge identified in this programme is that at the moment
    it covers only about 10% of all the learners who are mainly in rural
    areas in Brazil. However, some of these learners benefit from the other
    various programmes. Brazil is also putting in place more measures to
    ensure that more learners from rural areas benefit from the programme
    and other programmes that are aimed at expanding access to school,
    particularly to poor learners.

4.5   National Fund for Compulsory Primary and Lower Secondary Education
    Development

      In 1996 Brazil initiated a constitutional amendment approving the
    creation of the Fundo para Manutenção e Desenvolvimento do Ensino
    Fundamental e Valorização do Magistério or the Fund for Maintenance and
    Development of the Fundamental Education and Valorization of Teaching
    (FUNDEF), which was formally introduced in 1998. FUNDEF necessitated a
    reform in the funding of the public fundamental education system in
    Brazil.

      FUNDEF automatically redistributes public expenditures earmarked for
    compulsory primary and lower secondary education, thus contributing to
    the elimination of the problems relating to the sharing or
    misapplication of educational resources. The resources of the Fund in
    each State are made up of 15% of all tax revenues and are redistributed
    between state and municipal administrations. Based on the amount
    available in each State, the amount per student per year is calculated
    and the funds are allocated to the State and municipal education
    systems, according to the number of students actually enrolled.

      In addition to ensuring equity in the distribution of funds in each
    State, the constitutional amendment that created the Fund also provides
    a mechanism to reduce inequalities by increasing the availability of
    funds to be earmarked for education. In the States where the
    expenditure per student:year is below the nationally defined sum, the
    Federal Administration provides the complement.

      The basic premise is that funds should be allocated according to the
    needs and commitments of each system, expressed by the number of
    enrolled pupils. This is a means of stimulating universalization of
    access and coverage. The funds are directly applied in education
    activities to those who enrol more students receive a larger amount,
    giving a positive focus to the financing of education. Before, those
    who did not fulfil specific guidelines were punished. Now, those who do
    carry them out are rewarded. In addition, FUNDEF ensures the autonomous
    funding of the system. Although international loans are important for
    special projects, the routine funding of the system cannot depend
    solely on foreign resources.

4.6   Literacy Programmes

      The Brazilian educational system has been remarkably improved in
    recent decades, particularly over the last decade. As a result, there
    has been a sharp drop in the illiteracy rate, a huge increase in
    enrolments at all levels, and a gradual increase in the average
    schooling of the population, particularly of the female population.
    Several laws have been passed and many different campaigns and
    programmes have been launched to deal with the problem of illiteracy in
    Brazil.

      Among the several literacy programmes are the following programmes:

4.6.1 The Fundescola Programme

      The Fundescola Programme was initiated in April 1998 in order to
    develop an initial set of school-based instruments and support
    structures to improve school equity and effectiveness and to increase
    public awareness around the issue of school quality in Brazil. The
    Programme has had several shapes over the years. The second phase of
    the Programme, approved in June 1999, focused on improving and
    expanding the set of tools developed in the first phase, extending
    these to additional schools, and more aggressively engaging the
    education establishment and the public sector in the process of school-
    based development.

      The third phase of the Programme is aimed at completing the work
    involved in the development of the tools and processes and scaling
    these up within Brazil.

      The three main components of this project are to:

    • Raise schools to minimum operational standards, including implementing
      school-managed rehabilitation projects, and providing furniture,
      equipment and books to the schools.
    • Develop and implement a school development process, including
      developing strategic planning for schools.
    • Strengthen the education sector overall, including funding school
      councils and improving local education secretariats.

      The Programme also intends to:

    • Promote public engagement and parents’ sense of ownership of schools
      by giving school councils financial resources to manage.
    • Raise the equity of school quality by helping schools attain Minimum
      Operational Standards.
    • Help schools to prepare and implement their own strategic “School
      Development Plan” to improve student achievement.
    • Provide financing to schools to execute their School Development
      Plans.
    • Improve the effectiveness of teaching and learning and raise student
      achievement by providing integrated instructional models along with
      technical assistance and training to local secretariats of education.

4.7   Programme for Youth and Adults

      This programme is for elementary education for the youth and adults
    who do not have any form of schooling or those who started schooling
    late. The Programme covers 2200 municipalities in the North and South
    East of Brazil.

4.8   The National Programme for School Nutrition

      The National Programme for School Nutrition has been identified as
    central to education transformation in Brazil. Brazil’s school
    nutrition programme is the largest in the world and the oldest food
    distribution programme in Brazil. It covers 38 million learners in all
    primary public schools and day care centres (crèches/Early Childhood
    Development centres). Brazil’s school nutrition programme has changed
    over the years from a human assistance focus to a human rights focus.

      The current budget of the Programme is US$430 million. The main
    provision of the Programme is that 70% of the fund must be used for
    basic food items. This is to ensure that students get nutritional food
    and that schools do not buy cheap industrialised foodstuff. Moneys that
    are not spent by school at the end of the financial year are returned
    to the States.

      All students regardless of their social status are entitled to school
    nutrition in Brazil, as long as they are at school.

      The main objectives of the school nutrition programme are to:

    • Contribute to the general development of learners.
    • Ensuring educational progress.
    • Enhancing the learning abilities of all learners.
    • To promote good nutritional habits.
    • Contribute to local developmental needs of communities, particularly
      the poor, rural, and minorities.

      The Federation of States (municipalities) is responsible for the
    Programme. The money is only earmarked as a conditional grant for
    buying food. States are responsible for transferring the money to
    schools. Although the allocations vary according to municipalities,
    poorer schools tend to get more funding because of their needs.

4.8.1 Social control and monitoring of the Programme

      Social control and monitoring of the Programme is done by civil
    society organisations, communities, parents and other local structures.
    The main aim of establishing social control and monitoring measures is
    to ensure that the Programme caters and meets the nutritional needs of
    learners. The educators also play a fundamental role ensuring the
    effective implementation of the Programme and in fostering nutrition
    education to the learners. The various subjects within the curriculum
    also cover healthy food habits and proper notional foodstuff.

      In order to ensure that schools implement the Programme effectively
    and efficiently, all States have a provision that requires schools to
    have proper control and accountability measures. This is where schools
    draw up a working plan with their communities, parents, and civil
    society.

      The States and the Federal government have their own measures to
    ensure that there is no corruption and that it the learners who get the
    food. They monitor the purchase orders in relation to the menus. The
    States also take the responsibility to verify and monitor all the
    documentation relating to food orders, purchases and deliveries.

4.8.2 The Menu

      Since dietary requirements differ across the regions in Brazil, there
    is no nationally fixed menu for schools. However, schools are required
    to ensure that the learners get nutritious food. In all the schools the
    menu varies according to age group.

4.8.3 Challenges facing the School Nutrition Programme

      The School Nutrition Programme in Brazil is faced with several
    challenges including the following:

      (a)   The vastness of the Programme

      Because of the vastness of the Programme, there is a constant need
    for more innovative measures to ensure its effective implementation and
    coordination by all States and schools.

      (b)   Accountability Mechanisms

      The vastness of the programme also means that there should be strong
    accountability mechanisms. In some schools there are poor
    accountability mechanisms for the use of moneys for the Programme.
    However, if such shortfalls are detected, the States establish support
    systems to ensure that such mechanisms are established.

      (c)   Insufficiency of the Programme

      Despite it being the largest in the world, there is a need to
    increase the per capita allocation. There is also a need to expand the
    Programme to secondary schools because some of the learners in
    secondary school are from poor households.

4.9   Scholar Transport

      In order to ensure that all learners, particularly those living in
    rural areas and long distances from their schools, Brazil has
    established a scholar transport system. A fixed amount is transferred
    to the regions for scholar transport[1]. The allocation for the fund is
    done through the Census of Standards of Living in Brazil.

4.10  Literacy and diversity

      The Committee met with the National Secretariat for Literacy and
    Diversity. The mandate of the Secretariat is to implement Brazil’s
    framework that deals with diversity in education through literacy. One
    of the critical aspects of the transformation in Brazil has been the
    recognition that social inequality has a racial profile. The
    Secretariat, therefore, tries to ensure diversity through literacy and
    expanded access to educational opportunities, particularly to
    minorities.

      Up to 4 million people have been participating in Brazil’s literacy
    programme since its inception in 2003.

      The Programme tries to ensure hydrogenous interaction and diversity
    through racial relations and tolerance. It formulates some form of a
    diversity action for Afro-Brazilians in order to ensure that they also
    have better results and access to education and thus enhances their
    performance in the economy and the political activities of Brazil.

      The Secretariat is also tasked with seeking and implementing ways to
    reduce ethnic and racial differences.

      The major challenge that is facing the Secretariat is the lack of
    teachers that understand the history of Afro-Brazilians and diversity
    of the African continent at large.

      Although the main focus of the Secretariat is at elementary level, it
    also has diversity programmes that are targeted at secondary learners.
    There are also programmes that are targeted at university students,
    particularly in ensuring that Afro-Brazilian learners do not evade
    going to university.

      The Directorate also offers scholarships and has a tax reduction
    policy for universities and colleges that offers scholarships to poor
    learners and those with scholarships that are targeted towards Afro-
    Brazilians.

      There are currently 100 000 scholarships of which 30 000 were
    allocated to Afro-Brazilians. Brazil also has a social quota in public
    schools, which requires that 50% of the learners should be from poor
    households. Currently, there is a policy proposal that is aimed at
    ensuring that 50% of university learners are from public schools
    because learners from private schools tend to enrol in public
    universities and therefore limit the space for those coming from public
    schools.

4.10.1      Challenges facing the Directorate

      The Directorate is facing the following challenges:

    • Gender imbalances: There is the low participation of men in education
      in Brazil. As it stands there are more female learners benefiting from
      the programme than male learners. The challenge that is facing the
      Directorate is to attract more men into the education system,
      particularly to higher education institutions.
    • Large concentration of poor learners in Brazil: currently 52% of all
      children below 6 years in Brazil are from poor families. About 65% of
      blacks and 34% of white learners in Brazil are from poor families.


    • Racial variation in access to education: a young boy that is white in
      Brazil has an average of 8,4 years of schooling compared to a Black
      boy who has 6,8. These differences are also reflected in the education
      attainment for black and white parents.
    • Education attainment versus the labour market: there are extreme
      inequalities in Brazil with 85 million of the people earning about 10%
      of the income revenue. This is reflected in the levels of education
      before they enter the labour market. When people enter the labour
      market their differences become even worse.
    • Under- or non-qualified teachers: there are 7 000 teachers that are
      indigenous in Brazil and about 3 500 (50%) do not have university
      degrees.
    • Poor performance of teachers in mathematics and science subjects:
      There is a poor performance of teachers in mathematics and science
      subjects. This results in the poor performance of learners in these
      subjects.  The main aim of the directorate in this regard is to try
      and intensify the training of mathematics and science teachers.

4.11  Accelerated Learning Classes

      The program offers students with age/grade disparities the
    opportunity to return to the regular educational path. Increasingly
    adopted in various states, the programme has resulted in benefits for
    the local educational systems. The availability of a greater number of
    student openings in the early stages of primary education has resulted
    in the normalisation of the educational system and the reduction of its
    costs. Overcrowded classrooms have been eliminated. Perhaps the most
    noticeable result has been the fact that the opportunity to return to
    the regular educational process, offered by the accelerated classes,
    has motivated the return of children and adolescents who had dropped
    out of school to work.

4.12  Directorate of Basic Education

      The Directorate has the following four priorities:

      (a)   To eradicate illiteracy


      The eradication of illiteracy in Brazil from the core of all the
    programmes that are geared towards empowering the poor and indigenous
    people. Brazil has a very high illiteracy rate and this is exacerbated
    by the large numbers of children who are out of school.


      (b)   Ensuring quality basic education in all schools in Brazil

      The major problem facing education in Brazil is quality education.
    Although access to education has grown substantially over the last
    years, there is a failure rate of 30%. About 36% of learners in schools
    in Brazil should be in fourth grade but they are not because they fail
    their grades or drop out of schools every year. Fifty-five percent
    (55%) of learners have a problem learning Portuguese.

      (c)   Training of unqualified teachers

      There is a large supply of unqualified educators in Brazil. About 76%
    of teachers who teach basic education do not have college degrees.
    Sixty-three percent (63%) of teachers in elementary education do not
    have qualifications. There is also a lack of teachers in chemistry,
    physics, biology and mathematics.

      (d)   Encouraging learners to stay in school

      There are still large numbers of learners who are out of school in
    Brazil. The major challenge is to ensure that they are encouraged to
    stay in school. This will be done in line with other social priorities
    like strengthening learning system in schools in Brazil.

      The directorate has also established the following priorities with
    regard to basic education:

    • To redefine the Policy for Funding of Basic Education: the major
      initiative will be the replacement of the fund for Redistribution of
      Elementary Education with Basic Funding for Education as a whole. It
      is hoped that these will facilitate the flow of funds to cater for all
      children between 0 – 17 years of age. This will ensure that basic
      education gets an increase of about 25%. Brazil is in a process of
      establishing a minimum pay for teachers, it is hoped that the new
      funding approach will also ensure funds for this initiative.
    • Democratisation of basic education: The main initiative is to ensure
      the active participation of parents and communities in the education
      system. This will also ensure the establishment and strengthening of
      school councils and election of school directors. The proposal is that
      school directors be nominated by communities in order to ensure that
      parents take an interest in the education of their children.
    • Increasing the value of professional work particularly to male
      learners in order to encourage them to stay in school: by raising
      awareness of the value of education it is hoped that more male
      learners will have a reason to stay in school and proceed with their
      studies.
    • Establish a programme that will expand the pool of qualified
      educators: various programmes have been established with the various
      States and municipalities to ensure that underqualified educators
      improve their qualifications through distance education and the
      offering of more scholarships.

4.13  Directorate for Higher Education

      There are 160 universities in Brazil with 3,5 million students.
    Twenty-six percent (26%) of them are in public universities and the
    rest are in private universities. Public universities in Brazil are the
    ones responsible for most of the research with only about 10% of
    research activities taking place in the private universities. Although
    Higher Education is free in Brazil and each state has a public
    university, it is believed that only about 10% of children in Brazil go
    to universities. As a result Brazil has made it a priority to expand
    access to higher education to cover all the qualifying children.

4.13.1      Training of teachers

      Because of the large concentration of unqualified teachers in
    Brazilian schools, the government has partnered with universities to
    ensure the establishment of targeted training courses for unqualified
    teachers through distance and further education programmes.

4.13.2      Challenges facing Higher Education in Brazil

      The following are the main factors limiting access to higher
    education in Brazil:

      (a)   Poor investment in higher education

      The major challenge is that universities were neglected for many
    years in Brazil. The government is putting in place programmes to
    ensure that there are more funds channelled to Higher Education.

      (b)   Poverty

      Poverty is a major attributing factor to the low participation of
    learners in higher education in Brazil. Although higher education is
    free, learners tend to leave school for the labour market in order to
    support their families. Some of the learners are finding it difficult
    to meet their everyday expenses at university and then revert to the
    labour market.

      (c)   Proliferation of private universities

      There is a large proliferation of private universities in Brazil and
    most of them offering poor degrees. Brazil is in a process of putting
    in place more effective measures to control and monitor the content of
    private universities in order to ensure that they offer quality
    courses. The other issue that has been identified with private
    universities is that teaching normally takes place in the evening or
    weekends and that affects the quality of the education that they are
    offering.

      Because of the long history of neglect of higher education, Brazil
    has no policy or mechanisms that are aimed at monitoring the course
    content of Higher Education institutions. This has resulted in a
    variation of teaching standards, which affects the content and quality
    of higher education. There are several policy proposals that are aimed
    at initiating more control measures for the higher education sector in
    the country.

4.14  Measures to transform Higher Education

Brazil has initiated the following measures in order to transform its
    Higher Education system:

4.14.1      Affirmative action

      In order to address the above challenges Brazil has devised various
    programmes that are intended to ensure affirmative action in education.
    These programmes are intended to ensure that students get full
    scholarships that will cover their tuition and daily expenses while in
    university. Brazil has a national policy that ensures that 10% of
    learners in higher education are from poor communities and the
    minorities.

      There is an indication that a large number of the learners in fields
    such as medicine, law and engineering come from well-off families.
    Therefore, the Federal government is looking at measures to ensure that
    poor learners also have access to these fields.

4.14.2      More financial investment in higher education

      The government of Brazil has put in place several policy proposals to
    ensure that there are more funds channelled to higher education.

4.14.3      The role of the private sector

      The private sector’s role in education, particularly in higher
    education in Brazil is very minimal. This is largely because of the
    long history of neglect of higher education in the country. However,
    there are indications of keen interest from the private sector to
    invest in higher education, particularly in sectors like engineering,
    science and technology and medicine.

5.    Distance Education

      The main programme of the Distance Education Directorate is the
    School TV programme[2] or TV school channel, which is similar to the
    South African School TV programme. The main objectives of the school TV
    programme is to ensure the following:

    • The qualification and recognition of teachers in the public schools.
    • The enrichment of the teaching-learning process.
    • The improvement of the quality of teaching.

      The Programme is largely offered via the mainstream media. The TV
    school channel offers four hours of programmes aimed at elementary
    teaching repeated three times a day, and a one-hour programme focusing
    on high school teaching. A programme entitled "The Jump Towards the
    Future" has been specifically made to guide teachers and managers in
    their activities. School TV also produces a series of educational
    videos for in-class support concerning school subjects such as
    Portuguese, Mathematics, Science, History, Geography, Citizenship,
    Ethics, Cultural Identity, Hygiene, Nutrition, and several others. A
    large number of elementary and secondary schools are being supplied
    with a technology kit that includes a satellite antenna, a TV set and a
    VCR. Schools are expected to compose their own video collection using
    the educational programmes made available through TV School.

      The programme was started in 1996 largely to meet learners who are
    out of school and offer various programmes to cover more curriculum
    issues to all learners. The Federal government with the municipalities
    distributes the TV’s to schools across the country.

      The Brazilian school TV programme has reached over 50 000 schools and
    over 20 million learners and 170 00 teachers. The Programme is not a
    substitute for teachers but aimed at fostering creative ways of
    teaching.

      The major challenge in the inception of the programme was the lack of
    technological skills from teachers to effectively manage the programme.
    It was therefore decided to establish a parallel programme that was
    aimed at assisting teachers in using the School TV programme. Some
    teachers were also concerned that the programme might cause job loses.
    But with the training programme they realised that they were the
    integral part of the effective implementation of the programme and they
    started accepting it. The programme has since grown to DVDs, CD roms,
    computers and other technological means. Brazil has recently launched a
    180-hour course with the 27 States and their universities. This course
    is aimed at training teachers in the effective administration of the
    programme and offers a certificate to teachers who attend the course.



5.1   Curriculum

      The programme covers all subjects in the curriculum of elementary and
    secondary school in Brazil. There are also plans to expand the
    programme to cover the curriculum of universities in the coming years.



5.2   Participation of teachers

      What has been established is that the programme is not enough on its
    own. It needs the interaction and participation of teachers in order to
    ensure that there is active involvement of learners.

5. 3  Involvement of municipalities

      The municipalities are responsible for maintenance of the TVs and the
    distribution of the computers to schools. Some local municipalities
    facilitate the production of some of the activities covered by the
    programme, particularly on issues of arts, language, etc.

5.4   Challenges

      The programme has been subjected to eight different quantitative and
    qualitative appraisals ranging from 1995 to 2004.  Recently it was
    discovered that the Programme is still facing the following challenges:



5.4.1 Costs

      The main challenge that is facing the programme is the insufficiency
    of the available funds. School TV by its very nature is expensive. With
    more funding the programme could be expanded to reach more children.
    The Brazilian Parliament is currently lobbying for more funds to be
    allocated to the programme.

5.4.2 Lack of technological infrastructure

      The coverage of some rural parts of the country is limited by the
    lack of cable connections that link up with these areas. However, these
    are very few and with more funding it is hoped that more rural schools
    will have access to the programme.

5.4.3 Training for teachers

      Teachers in general need more training to learn how to operate the
    equipment, and how to adapt the use of the new media to the classroom.
    Brazil has started a separate programme aimed at empowering teachers to
    be able to operate the electronic equipment. This programme offers
    courses in Information Communication Technology (ICT) and basic
    computer skills.

6.    Secretariat of Municipal Education

      The Director of the Secretariat of Municipal Education briefed the
    Committee as follows:

6.1   Challenges facing the Secretariat

      The Secretariat is facing the following challenges, which form part
    of its core activities and priorities:

    • The coverage of children between the ages 0-6 years is only 16 %.
    • Economic and social problems with a large supply of parents who do not
      have a reliable source of income.
    • Low quality of education in Brazil.
    • A large percentage of the budget for education goes to transport.
    • 10% of learners have morbid obesity and 57% are anaemic.

      The main objective for the Secretariat of Municipal Education is to
    provide better education. The Secretariat has the following priorities:



    • To make literacy education a part of a social and educational
      inclusion strategy in order to provide quality in basic education.
    • To ensure the creation and alignment of the State with the FUNDEB as
      the fund established to maintain and develop basic education and value
      its professionals.
    • To ensure the expansion of vocational education in line with the
      sustainable growth of the nation’s economy.
    • To ensure higher education reform with a main focus on strengthening
      public universities.

6.2   Literacy education for young people and adults

      There are roughly 33 million functionally illiterate Brazilian
    individuals over the age of 15 years. Most of them have education years
    of less than four years of schooling. The State has realised that it is
    not possible to build a socially inclusive nation with justice and
    fairness for all unless this social debt, particularly illiteracy, is
    addressed. Therefore, the Federal Government has integrated literacy
    training with basic education for young people and adults so as to
    guarantee continued learning. This policy is executed by means of two
    complementary programmes. The Literate Brazil has so far benefited 3,7
    million young and adult students and trained 165 000 literacy teachers
    in 4 000 cities throughout country. The programme will reach more than
    2,3m young people this year and produce, by 2006, 10 million newly
    literate citizens. For its part, the Youth and Adult Education (EJA)
    transfers funds to states and municipalities for the expansion and
    improvement of public schools. In 2004, the programme encompassed 1,9
    million students.

6.3   Quality in basic education

      The Ministry of Education has increased investment in teacher
    training, debating new curricular processes and implementing a range of
    programs designed to enhance the quality of basic education in Brazil.
    The increase in school enrolment in recent years, especially in primary
    and secondary education, has produced a quantitative evolution,
    although qualitative results have fallen far short of expectations.

      To address this situation, the Federal Government has proposed
    creating a fund, known as FUNDEB, for short, to maintain and develop
    basic education and value its professionals. FUNDEB will channel
    funding to all levels of basic schooling, from early childhood
    education to secondary education. The injection of more funds will make
    it possible to improve both teacher training and teacher’s pay, while
    at the same time re-equipping public schools and keeping them in good
    condition, thus helping to bring about improvements in the quality of
    basic education.

      In addition to FUNDEB, the Ministry of Education has maintained and
    introduced a number of policies designed to improve and structure basic
    education, such as continuing teacher training and education, school
    busing for millions of students in rural areas, the implementation of
    school libraries and activities to encourage reading.

      After a decade without any increases, the current administration has
    raised the annual grant provided for school meals, while extending the
    benefit to public and charity nurseries and day care centres as well as
    indigenous schools. It is the world’s largest school meal programme,
    feeding 38 million students or 21% of the Brazillian population. The
    Nation Textbook Programme is another important policy instrument. It
    distributed 111 million books to 30,9m students in 2004. Furthermore,
    last year the programme was extended for the first time to secondary
    schools and will encompass all students at the secondary level by 2006.
    The Ministry is also introducing a new School Attendance Monitoring
    System to help reduce dropout and truancy rates as well as ensure more
    reliable public fund transfers to programmes such as Bolsa Familia,
    which benefits more than 12 million children.

6.4   Expansion of vocation education

      Developing an efficient industry policy, bolstering production chains
    and structuring local production arrangements are fundamental for
    national economic growth, while also requiring consistent investment in
    vocational education. The Federal Government has taken steps to
    increase the number of students enrolled in technical education,
    assuring them a solid foundation on which to enter the labour market.
    For 2005, not only have budget appropriations for vocational education
    been increased, but new projects designed to enhance the sector have
    been adopted. These include the integration of secondary schools with
    technical courses, so that thousands of young people can complete this
    part of their education with professional qualification. Moreover, this
    year the Escola de Fabrica Programme will open 500 schools in firms
    throughout Brazil to train 10 000 adolescents and young adults between
    the ages 15 and 21. In 2004, all 34 Federal Centres of Technological
    Education (FATECs) were recognised as institutions of higher education,
    giving them more autonomy to create new courses.

6.5   Reform of Higher Education

      In the 1960s, the student movement took to the streets in Brazil to
    confront the military dictatorship under the banner of university
    reform. Today, almost 40 years later, the struggle has been revived by
    a democratically elected popular government. The administration of
    President Lula is striving to ensure that public universities are more
    highly valued and is strongly advocating education as an entitlement of
    every Brazilian.

      This is the vision that guides higher education reform, one founded
    on a republican conception of the state in which public institutions
    play the role of promoting and regulating expansion, while spurring
    income and knowledge redistribution. In a broad national debate
    scheduled to continue through February 15, the Ministry of Education
    will receive proposals for a draft reform bill that will be sent to the
    office of the Presidency of the Republic and, subsequently, to congress
    for a new round of public consultations.

      The reform is motivated by a five-part rationale, as follows:

(a)   Reform to strengthen public universities

      The liberalization of Higher Education in the last ten years has led
    to the accelerated proliferation of private institutions, with adequate
    state regulation. Currently, public universities and colleges offer 29%
    of all openings, while private institutions account for the remaining
    71%. The federal government seeks to increase the public sector’s
    participation in Higher Education by setting up new public
    universities, expanding new centres and creating 200 000 new openings
    in federal institutions over two year period. The goal is to ensure
    that the public sectors share of available openings in Higher Education
    rises to 40% by 2011.

(b)   Reform to prevent mercantilisation of Higher Education

      The Brazilian Federal Constitution states that the provision of
    education to all is a duty of the state, while also allowing scope for
    private institutions. However, in performing the role delegated to them
    by the state, quality must be a central component of the activities
    undertaken by those institutions. In its regulatory capacity, the state
    must ensure fulfilment of this principle by guiding an orderly
    expansion of higher education and avoiding the proliferation of
    institutions whose only goal is to maximise short-term profit. To this
    end, the Ministry of Education has proposed an entirely novel approach,
    including instruments, which, in conjunction with the National Higher
    Education Assessment System (SINAES), assure more effective regulation
    of private colleges and universities. The proposals prohibit election
    campaign funding by trustees of private institutions of higher learning
    and cap foreign ownership at 30%, among other provisions.

(c)   Reform to guarantee quality

      In recent years, the opening of new colleges, higher education
    centres and universities in Brazil has not always been accompanied by
    proper assessment procedures or an adequate concern for quality,
    revealing the state’s fragile oversight and regulatory capacity. In the
    Federal Government’s view, it is not enough to create university
    openings. It is equally important to ensure that the learning process
    matches the needs and expectations of the nation by preserving quality
    and promoting social inclusion. The Ministry of Education plans to
    effectuate the social function of higher education through instruments
    such as Internal Development Plan (IDP) and more stringent requirements
    for the establishment of universities and university centres.

(d)   Reform to democratize access

      Today, only 9% of Brazilians between the ages of 18 and 24 are
    enrolled in institutions of Higher Education, a figure far below that
    registered in Argentina, where the proportion is 32%, and Canada, where
    it is 62%. Brazil National Education Plan, 2001-2010, prescribes a
    level of 30%.

      The reform proposal includes actions to guarantee student attendance,
    such as paid academic traineeship and lotteries, to fund student loans.
    The state’s role is to pursue policies that effectively assure access
    to Higher Education for low-income students by promoting the
    establishment of federal institutions in regions with little or no
    Higher Education. The reform Bill also proposes that 50% of all
    openings in federal universities be reserved for candidates from public
    schools and that quotas be introduced for blacks and members of
    indigenous communities.

      Guaranteeing access to Higher Education for low-income youth is one
    of the Ministry of Education priorities. The University for all
    Programme (ProUni) will offer 1122,000 grants in the first half of 2005
    to cover 100% or 50% of tuition costs in private institutions for low-
    income students and public school teachers without university degrees.
    The programme will also benefit blacks and indigenous people. The goal
    is to create 200 000 openings in two years.

(e)   Reform to democratize management

      Democratisation of Higher Education in Brazil refers to the building
    of a participative educational model with high social value capable of
    promoting the full exercise of citizenship. The reform bill calls for
    the end of shortlist, the direct election of rectors in public
    universities and the creation of Social Councils in universities to
    guarantee participation by all segments of society.

      Rectors of federal universities are appointed by the President of the
    Republic for a fixed term from shortlists of three candidates produced
    by each institution’s academic council.

7.    Meeting with the State Secretariat of Education in Sao Paulo

      The Secretariat of Education in Sao Paulo briefed the committee as
    follows:

      The Family School Programme is an initiative from the State
    Secretariat of Education, with the technical co-operation of UNESCO.
    The space used by the Programme is that of the state public schools
    that are open on weekends, with the goal of attracting youngsters and
    their families to that space having as aim the practice of citizenship,
    where social and educational activities are carried out in four areas:
    sport, culture, health, and professional training, with the purpose of
    improving self-esteem and cultural identity of the different
    communities that constitute the society in the state of Sao Paulo.

      The programme reaches:

    • 645 municipalities of the State of Sao Paulo.
    • Has 89 Teaching Boards, 89 Regional Teaching Officers, 89 Teaching
      Supervisors and 89 Technical/Pedagogical Assistants.
    • 5 306 State School Units.
    • 4 902 Supervisors.

      The goals of the programme is to:

    • Develop peace culture.
    • Enlarge cultural horizons and life perspectives for children,
      teenagers and adults, promoting quality of life and social inclusion.
    • Relate activities carried out during weekends with pedagogical
      projects of the school; thus guaranteeing its educational goal.
    • Incentivise the population to use school space in a responsible
      manner.
    • Contribute to the reduction of violence levels, by means of preventive
      and social/educational actions.

7.1   Participation of the civil society in the Programme

      The different sectors of the civil society: enterprises, non-
    governmental organisations, unions and other institutions are taking
    part as partners of the Family School Programme in an important and
    effective demonstration of the exercise of social responsibility.

      Besides those partners that have a macro reach, the Regional Co-
    ordinator of the Programme and the School Units also have the autonomy
    for the creation-localised partnerships.

      Institutions take part in the programme in different ways:

    • Supplying human resources and materials.
    • Developing educational projects.
    • Stimulating voluntary work.
    • Sponsoring and carrying out different activities.

      More than giving sustainability to the Programme’s actions, the
    participation of the civil society, by means of partnerships and
    voluntary work, contributes for the diversity of characters and
    identities in the community of Sao Paulo to be contemplated in school
    spaces, strengthening the principle that peace culture may only be
    built in a collective fashion.

7.2   Innovative technology for Information and Communication in Education:
    The Rede do Saber Project

      Rede do Saber, which means Knowledge Network, is the information
    technology and communications infrastructure implemented by Sao Paulo
    State Education Department providing virtual interconnection for all
    regions in the state in a wide-reaching interactive network that is
    part of IntraGov.

      Rede do Saber is the largest high-speed public network in Brazil and
    Latin America. It now comprises 100 videoconferencing rooms, over 2 500
    computers, 9 generating studios and an operation centre to monitor
    network use, support logistics and provide system management support.
    This entire infrastructure is interconnected 24 hours, 7 days a week,
    365 days a year.

      In all, there are 100 points located in 75 municipalities around the
    state in the 89 local Education Directorates. These points are
    continuously connected using latest-generation multimedia technology to
    create the most favourable conditions for development training for the
    different educational agents.

      The purpose of the programme is to expand opportunities and
    incentives, and enhance conditions for the ongoing training of the
    large number of educational agents in the State of Sao Paulo, it aims
    at redressing the social deficit of the past, with the definitive
    inclusion of community sectors who are the margins of the education
    system, and enhancing the quality and effectiveness of teaching and
    learning processes. On this basis, the policy of the Education
    Department under the coordination of the Secretary, attuned to the
    guidelines of the policy of Governor Geraldo Alckmin’s administration,
    is that this can only be done by redeeming another important social
    deficit from the past: the inclusion of its possibilities and
    challenges. It is the teachers who will be the agents of all the main
    changes in educational work that the Sao Paulo and Brazilian
    communities want and need. Also the programme provides sustentation for
    the State Education Department development of continuous training
    programmes.

8.    Conclusion

      The Committee would like to extend its gratitude to the Ministry of
    Education and the Senate of Brazil for their warm-hearted welcome. Such
    a welcome clearly demonstrates the long relations that the two
    countries have established over the years. The Committee also had the
    opportunity to meet with the Senators responsible for education in
    Brazil. Their comments and engagement on issues that are facing
    education in South Africa clearly demonstrated the keen interested that
    the two countries have to learning from each other.

      The Committee is also grateful for the assistance and guidance of our
    Brazil Mission, particularly the Ambassador Head, Her Excellency
    Ambassador Ms Lindiwe Zulu and her staff for their support during our
    stay in Brazil. It is indeed such ambassadors that continue to
    demonstrate the spirit of ubuntu in the countries where they are
    deployed and continue to work tirelessly for our people.

9.    Committee Recommendations

      The Committee recommends that the Department of Education undertake
    the following:

    • Analyse the Brazilian funding model to see how access to education
      could be expanded in all grades and at Higher Education, particularly
      for poor learners.
    • Analyse the Brazilian Literacy Programmes to see how it could be used
      to strengthen the country’s Adult Basic Education Programme.
    • Analyse the Brazilian Feeding Scheme Programme in order to enhance the
      country’s Feeding Scheme.
    • Analyse the Brazilian Teacher Development model to see how it could
      benefit non- and underqualified teachers in the country, particularly
      in strengthening the pool of qualified teachers teaching subjects such
      as maths and sciences.
    • Analyse the Brazilian Higher Education model, particularly in public
      universities to see how it could be used to expand access to higher
      education for poor learners.
    • Follow up on donated School TV programme to see how it could be used
      to benefits learners in the country by using television channels.
    • Undertake an analysis of the role of municipalities in education in
      Brazil in order to see how municipalities in South Africa could expand
      their involvement in education funding, school maintenance, etc.
