            GREETINGS TO MULTIPARTY DELEGATION FROM CÔTE D’IVOIRE

                             (Draft Resolution)

 1. The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam Deputy Speaker,  I  hereby  move
    without notice, that:

   That the House -


   (1)      expresses warm greetings to our friends from Côte d’Ivoire who
        are visiting our country as a multi-party group;


   (2)      hopes that their visit to South Africa will benefit both them
        and us in that we believe that all Africans, whether from the south
        or from the west of Africa, can only learn from one other and
        benefit from contact and friendship; and


   (3)      expresses on behalf of all South Africans its sincere hope that
        the negotiations in their country are successful and that their
        country is transformed into a vibrant multi-party democracy.


Agreed to.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon members, as we welcome the delegation from Côte
d’Ivoire, I would like to share with members of the House that we have had
excellent meetings with the delegation since this morning, and they are
still going to be meeting with other sections of our Parliament this
afternoon. So as soon as they are ready, we will allow them to take leave
of the House.

We welcome you and we hope that you have gained as much as we have gained
from this experience. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

In French we say: “Merci beaucoup.”




                    CONDOLENCES TO FAMILY OF Mr D D QEQE


                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Deputy Speaker . . .
ndiphakamisa ngaphandle kwesindululo:

   Ukuba le Ndlu –


   (1)      iqaphele ngosizi nangentlungu ukusweleka kukaMnu Daniel Dumile
        Qeqe ngomhla wama-20 kule nyanga imiyo;


   (2)      ikhumbule kakuhle ukuba uMnu Qeqe wazalelwa eBhofolo ngonyaka ka-
        1929. Uthe akugqiba uqeqesho lobutitshala ngo-1953 waba yinqununu
        kwisikolo samabanga aphantsi iFord. Wayengumdlali obalaseleyo
        womdlalo weqakamba, ekwangumdlali obalaseleyo wombhoxo;


   (3)      ikhumbule ukuba uMnu Qeqe nguye owathi waseka iqela iKwazakhele
        Rugby Union, iKwaru, ngo-1971;


   (4)      ikhumbule ukuba ebesoloko edlala indima ephambili ekulweni
        ucalucalulo kwezemidlalo;


   (5)      iyamkele into yokuba uMnu Qeqe yenye yeenkokeli ebeziphume
        izandla, ekwadlala indima yokucebisa nokuqinisa abantu kwindawo
        ebehlala kuyo. EbengumKrestu oqinisekileyo, engumntu othanda uxolo;
   (6)      iqwalasele igalelo lakhe elikhulu alenzileyo ekuphuculeni
        ezemidlalo. Ubawo uMongameli wokuqala, uNelson Mandela, waye
        wamwonga ngeSilver Presidential Sports Award;


   (7)      iqwalasele ukuba uMnu Qeqe ushiya ngemva imbali entle
        yokusebenzela abantu;


   (8)      idlulise uvelwano olunzulu kwizihlobo nezalamane zikabawo uQeqe,
        nakubantu bonke abamaziyo.

   [That the House –

     1) notes with sadness the passing on of Mr Daniel Dumile Qeqe on 20
        June 2005;


   (2)      remembers very clearly that Mr Qeqe was born in Fort Beaufort in
        1929. When he completed his training as a teacher in 1953, he
        occupied a position as a headmaster of Ford Primary School. He
        displayed excellent skills as a cricket player as well as a rugby
        player;


   (3)      remembers him as the person who first formed the Kwazakhele
        Rugby Union, commonly known as Kwaru, in 1971;


     4) remembers that he played a very significant role in fighting racism
        in sport;


   (5)      accepts that Mr Qeqe was one of the great leaders our country
        had as he also played a parenting and counselling role in his
        community. He was a devout Christian and loved peace;


   (6)      notes his contribution to the development of sport. The first
        president, Dr Nelson Mandela, honoured him with a Silver
        Presidential Sports Award;


   (7)      notes that Mr Qeqe leaves behind a good history of working with
        people;


   (8)      extends its deepest condolences to his family, relatives,
        friends and all those who knew him.]


                             MEMBERS’STATEMENTS


                     CELEBRATIONS OF THE FREEDOM CHARTER

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr D A A OLIFANT (ANC): Madam Speaker, on 26 June 2005, 50 years later, at
the square and place where the Freedom Charter was adopted in 1955, 40 000
people will, once more, gather to commemorate and celebrate the historic
People’s Assembly which adopted the Freedom Charter. Over 40 000 people
will gather to mark the historic moment and it will be people from all
national groups, black and white, united in our diversity, young and old,
those veterans who were part of the 1955 gathering, people from different
political persuasions, religions, business, traditional leaders, the youth
and student formations, nongovernmental organisations, civil society, women
groups, cultural groups, sport, public representatives in Parliament,
legislatures, municipalities and civil society organisations. The following
day, 27 June 2005, Parliament will assemble with thousands of people and in
a people’s assembly bring various sections of society to give them a
platform to voice their opinions. Unfortunately, a minority of
organisations in our country, namely the DA, the IFP, the FF Plus, decided
once more, like their predecessors in 1955, not to attend this historic
event. Once more they refuse to be part of this people’s march to build on
the foundation of the Freedom Charter. The ANC says: No force will deter or
stop the people in their gallant march. South Africa truly belongs to all
its people, united in their diversity. I thank you. [Applause.]

                                  ARMS DEAL


                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr E W TRENT (DA): Madam Speaker, President Mbeki was chair of the
ministerial committee in charge of the arms deal. He must therefore take
responsibility for the fact that Chippy Shaik was allowed to meet in secret
with a number of bidders in the arms procurement process; this, despite
Shaik’s declared conflict of interest.
Shaik’s involvement polluted the arms deal and violated all normal tender
procedures. Perhaps the reason for President Mbeki’s failure to sanction
Shaik was that he himself was also meeting with bidders in secret. The DA
is in possession of an encrypted fax, which suggests that Pres Mbeki
promised Thompson CSF as early as 1997 that they would be awarded the
contract . . . [Interjections.] . . . Here are the faxes and you can have a
look at them, if you wish to. Another fax indicates that President Mbeki
held a secret meeting with executives from Thompson CSF in December 1998,
in complete violation of tender procedures. President Mbeki needs to
explain why such a meeting took place, why there is no public record of
such a meeting and were Thompson CSF guaranteed the Corvette contract?
Unless the President breaks his silence, the public will justifiably be
thinking that corruption in the arms deal extends beyond Mr Jacob Zuma.
[Applause.]

Mr D V BLOEM: I don’t think it is fair for this member to attack the
President in his absence. I think he must make that statement when the
President is here. I don’t think it is correct for him and he must prove
that information.

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Deputy Speaker, with due respect, that is not a point
of order.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Ellis, please take your seat. Hon members, I don’t
think that you were as attentive as I thought I was when this member raised
this point. It is a question and it is supposed to be a statement. I think
I would be allowed time to study the Hansard. This being the last day of
our sitting, I would like to come back and make a ruling today. Part of the
statement implies that the President is engaged in some kind of activity.
That is what I heard. I think that is the part that I want to make a ruling
on.

Secondly, I also appeal to Whips that there is an opportunity for the
President to answer questions in the House. [Interjections.] Hon member,
you don’t sit on the programming committee. There are Whips of your party
who sit in that committee and we were informed that the President wouldn’t
be here to answer questions tomorrow, because he is engaged in Cote d’
Ivoire - which we respect. If your Whips did not inform you that the
President won’t be here and we were given an undertaking by the President’s
Office that he will make sure there is an extra slot. It is not that the
President does not want to answer questions. To pose a question to a
President who is not here is unfair and irresponsible. I would like to come
back to that point. I don’t think that it is fair for you to be saying the
kind of things you did about the head of state in his absence. I will make
a ruling later this afternoon.


                  NON-DELIVERY OF LEARNER SUPPORT MATERIAL


                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr A M MPONTSHANE (IFP): Deputy Speaker, we are now six months into the
academic year. Grade 12 learners ought to be writing their mid-year
examinations. We know that some of these learners will be or are writing
these examinations under very difficult and inhuman conditions which are
exemplified by, inter alia, not being electrified, freezingly cold and in
some instances, leaking classroom roofs and no sanitary facilities.

Of immediate concern to the IFP is the nondelivery of learner support
material. The reasons for nondelivery are many and varied. However,
nondelivery caused by the failure of provincial departments to pay service
providers must rank as the most intolerable.

The Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal are the most delinquent provinces in
this regard. We therefore urge the Minister to use her monitoring whip to
ensure that these avoidable barriers do not compromise the end educational
product. I thank you.


      JOB OPPORTUNITIES TO BE CREATED IN AREA BETWEEN UGIE AND MACLEAR


                            (Member’s Statement)

Nkskz X C MAKASI (ANC): Sekela-Somlomo, umzi ovelisa impahla yendlu wakwa-P
G Bison, onxulumene nowakwa-Steinhof, uzibandakanye kwiphulo lotyalo-mali
oluthe xhaxhe kwibhiliyoni yeerandi. Olu tyalo-mali luya kuqhutywa phakathi
kweDyoki neMaclear, kwiphondo laseMpuma Koloni. Kulindeleke ukuba ludale
amathuba emisebenzi angama-3 000.

Le nto ithetha ukuba wagwetywa ndlala. Umbutho i-ANC uyasiseka kwaye
usithakazelela esi sigqibo senziwe ngulo mzi-mveliso ukhankanywe ngentla
apha. Eli nyathelo liya kubangela ukuba kubekho utyalo-mali, kwaye lukhule
uqoqosho kule ngingqi.

Lo mzi uya kuthi uvelise impahla yendlu eya kuthi ithengiselwe amanye
amashishini akhoyo apha eMzantsi Afrika, kwaye ijonge nokwandisa
urhwebelwano namanye amazwe. Ndiyabulela, Sekela-Somlomo. [Kwaqhwatywa.]
(Translation of Xhosa member’s statement follows.)

[Mrs X C MAKASI (ANC): Deputy Speaker, the PG Bison furniture factory
together with Steinhof are involved in an investment initiative that costs
about R1 billion. This is an investment initiative between Ugie and Maclear
in the Eastern Cape province. It is expected that this will create about
3000 job opportunities.

This will assist in eradicating poverty. The ANC supports and is
enthusiastic about this decision by the above-mentioned factory. The
initiative will create investment and will result in economic growth in
this area.

The factory will produce furniture that will be sold to other businesses in
South Africa, and it is also looking at extending business to other
countries. Thank you. [Applause.]]

                        FRAUDULENT ACTIVITIES IN SAA

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr J J M STEPHENS (UDM): Madam Deputy Speaker, the UDM is disturbed by the
report in the Business Day today that SA Airways cannot account for
approximately R60 million. Fraud is suspected, and some executives
allegedly abused the payroll system in order to claim exorbitant overtime
and bonuses for ghost employees.

The provisions of the Public Finance Management Act regarding irregular
expenditure must now be strictly enforced. If indeed it has the information
implied in the article, SAA must not hesitate to bring criminal charges
against its former CEO, Mr Viljoen, and his executive team.

The unequivocal message to officials in the civil service and public
enterprises must be that abuse of taxpayer money will not be tolerated. We
urge SAA to act swiftly, given its poor record on financial matters in the
recent past. First taxpayers forked out a ridiculous golden handshake to
former SAA boss Coleman Andrews, in effect rewarding him for poor
performance. Then SAA was investigated for uncompetitive behaviour,
followed by the revelation of a massive so-called hedging loss, totalling
billions of rands. SAA also continues to dominate the market for inbound
foreign travellers, and there its failure to provide adequate capacity is
stifling our tourism industry.

This litany of mismanagement, financial disasters and dubious practices has
turned government’s leading and most profitable transport enterprise into a
farce.

The current international aviation environment is unforgiving in the wake
of 9/11 and rocketing fuel costs. Serious remedies are urgently required to
prevent further losses to the taxpayer and to the destruction of what
should be a valuable national asset.


                  NEW EDUCATION CURRICULUM AND FET COLLEGES


                            (Member’s Statement)

Adv A H GAUM (NNP): Madam Deputy Speaker, we are satisfied that the
Education department is increasingly meeting the challenge of ensuring that
the implementation of the new FET curriculum will be a success and not a
failure.

Their careful approach is borne out by the fact that there will be a phased
implementation and that schools will be allowed to offer the new learning
areas only if they can demonstrate their ability to do so. Pronouncements
that the new curriculum will require a higher level of cognitive skills
from learners and that the achievement bar will be lifted, not lowered, is
reason for great optimism about the future of our education system.

We also welcome the recapitalisation process of our further education and
training colleges. This will help to create the much-needed emphasis shift
to vocational training that is so vital to meet the needs of our economy.

These colleges should also play a key role in tackling unemployment head-
on. The Minister and the department have to be congratulated on their
thorough preparation in ensuring that the recapitalisation process runs
smoothly, and that the FET colleges become the agents for skills
development they ought to be.

We are particularly heartened by the fact that research is being conducted
to ascertain the needs of the economy, and that appropriate courses will be
designed to meet these needs. I thank you.


                     LACK OF BASIC SERVICES IN KLIPTOWN


                            (Member’s Statement)

Rev K R J MESHOE (ACDP): Deputy Speaker, the ACDP believes that the choice
of Kliptown as the place to hold the 50th anniversary of the Freedom
Charter is unwise and insensitive on the part of government, particularly
because Kliptown is an extremely underdeveloped community. The more than
R500 million the government plans to use for these celebrations should
rather have been used to develop infrastructure, provide basic services and
proper sanitation for all the needy people of Kliptown. [Interjections.]

The dignity of many Kliptown residents is undermined, as they are still
subjected to the humiliating and unhygienic bucket system because of the
lack of sanitation in the area, sadly 11 years after the coming into being
of the new democratic order.

That is why the ACDP cannot, in good conscience, be part of what we believe
is unnecessary and unwise government expenditure in an area that urgently
needs proper toilets. [Interjections.]

We believe that proper basic services and proper sanitation is more
important and urgently needed than wasting taxpayers’ money on a two-day
party.

The ACDP supports the position taken by the Kliptown Concerned Residents
Committee, which has said, and I quote:

  There is nothing to celebrate since their areas have remained
  underdeveloped.


This committee was reported to have given the celebrations a thumbs-down
and is planning to convene what it calls a people’s inspection to publicly
expose what it calls the ``wretched living conditions of the community’’,
and to garner support and solidarity for the community struggles around
basic services.


                        ARRESTS BY POLICE IN GRABOUW


                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr J D ARENDSE (ANC): Madam Deputy Speaker, in the early hours of yesterday
morning, the hard work of the SA Police Service, together with the co-
operation of our communities, led to the arrest of six men in Grabouw.

Police have received information that they were on their way to commit
crime. They were found in possession of four illegal firearms, which were
all taken for ballistics tests to check whether they were used in other
serious violent crimes.

One of the six arrested men has been positively identified as a person who
committed a murder in the Grabouw area earlier this month, and he will be
charged for the crime. The provision of security and comfort to our
families and communities is the cornerstone policy of the ANC-led
government to provide a better life for all our people.

The recent breakthroughs in the investigations and the progressive
reduction in violent crime are because of the close working relationship
between the SA Police Service and the communities.

The ANC applauds the continuing good work being done by the Police and
calls upon our communities to work tirelessly for the realisation of peace
and security for all our people. [Applause.]


             MURDER OF BABY JORDAN AND LACK OF CRIME STATISTICS


                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr R JANKIELSOHN (DA): Deputy Speaker, the brutal and senseless murder of
six-month-old baby, Jordan Lee Norton, in Cape Town and the murder of Larry
Webster, who was tied up with twine and strangled at his home in Belfast,
are but two of many tragic and unnecessary murders that have taken place in
South Africa recently.

South Africans, however, will not know the true reality of crime in this
country until the Minister of Safety and Security releases crime
statistics. The last statistics available are more than a year old. People
have a right to know the type and frequency of crimes committed in their
neighbourhoods. This information should be made available to them on a
regular basis, which will enable individuals and communities to take
precautions against criminals.

The only available information that the public receive on crime in South
Africa is by reading about the gruesome murders and other crimes in the
press, or through their own experiences of crime. Our high levels of crime
such as murder clearly indicate that government is failing in its core duty
to protect its citizens from harm. The very least it can do is inform
people about crimes in their areas on a regular basis so that they can do
for themselves what government is failing to do, namely protect themselves
and their families from harm. Thank you. [Applause.]

                    DEPLOYMENT OF MOBILE POLICE STATIONS

                            (Member’s Statement)

Ms  S  RAJBALLY  (MF):  Thank  you,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  we  take  this
opportunity to applaud the South African Police Service  and  the  wonderful
service they are delivering to the people of  KwaZulu-Natal.  We  understand
that, although this year’s  budget  has  facilitated  better  resources  and
manpower in the sector,  at  the  moment  the  situation  at  stations  need
serious attention.

However,  the  MF  interest  extends  beyond  this,   to   newly   developed
residential areas in KwaZulu-Natal,  where  local  police  are  stationed  a
distance away and therefore unable to address  emergencies  as  rapidly  and
efficiently as it  is  needed.  In  view  of  this  and  our  constitutional
responsibilities to ensure the  safety  of  our  people,  we  call  for  the
deployment of mobile police stations in these areas  to  secure  the  safety
and wellbeing of our people and also deter criminals  from  crime.  We  urge
that the department and House work towards these safety measures  to  combat
crime and ensure safety of all South African citizens, in  every  corner  of
South Africa. Thank you.


                        DEVELOPMENT OF RUGBY PLAYERS


                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr M M DIKGAWCI (ANC): Thank you, Madam Speaker, an English  under-13  rugby
team from Manchester England has donated  R42  000  to  the  development  of
young rugby players of their age from the former disadvantaged  communities.
The donation was given to Diocesan  college  in  Rondebosch  in  Cape  Town,
which  is  responsible  for  developing  the  young   talent.   The   direct
beneficiaries of this donation will be children  from  Liwa  Primary  school
and John Palma Primary, both from Nyanga East.  When  making  the  donation,
the management of the English  team  said,  “We  have  chosen  to  make  the
donation to college because the players  have  demonstrated  natural  talent
despite their backgrounds.”

The ANC applause this material gesture of human solidarity and  we  call  on
business and civil society to join in the people’s contract  to  bridge  the
disparities created by our apartheid past.  Let  us  all  work  together  to
ensure the continual opening of the doors of learning  and  culture  to  all
South Africans. I thank you.


                 ANC’S ABUSE OF FREEDOM CHARTER CELEBRATIONS


                            (Member’s Statement)

MOULANA M R SAYEDALI-SHAH (DA): Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker,  the  ANC’s
attempt to portray the sitting of Parliament in Kliptown,  for  three  hours
next Monday, as a nonparty activity is an abuse of power  and  an  abuse  of
taxpayers’ money. Even the information booklet  on  this  event,  which  was
given to MPs, is printed in the ANC colours of yellow, green and  black  and
the logo used to symbolize this event is taken from the  ANC’s  party  logo.
Madam Speaker, the ANC intends using the Freedom  Charter  in  its  election
campaign later this year. And the party is abusing  its  power  by  spending
far more than five million  rand  of  taxpayers’  money  to  publicise  this
campaign. Therefore, the DA understands  the  significance  of  the  Freedom
Charter and we do not object to the Charter itself, but to  the  manner  and
the purpose for which the ANC has resuscitated it at the taxpayer’s  expense
and to suit its own political agenda. Therefore, the DA was  asked  to  give
this event a veneer of legitimacy by participating in Kliptown, but  instead
we will hold a people’s assembly in Cape Town aimed at hearing  whether  the
promises of the ANC have been fulfilled, especially in terms of the  Freedom
Charter. Thank you. [Applause.]

                      CULTURAL EVENTS IN KWAZULU-NATAL


                            (Member’s Statement)

Ms M M MDLALOSE (IFP): Madam Deputy Speaker, the following  cultural  events
have been held recently in  Durban:  the  Comrades  marathon,  which  is  an
example of human endurance; the Durban Fashion Week, which  focuses  on  art
and creativity; the World Chamber of Commerce Congress as  well  as  several
film festivals. The IFP wants to add its support  of  these  events  because
they encourage development of the  people,  the  economy  and  also  promote
social cohesion and comradeship in KwaZulu-Natal. Thank you.


                      PARLIAMENTARY FILM FESTIVAL WEEK


                            (Member’s Statement)

Ms N D MBOMBO (ANC): The week of 12 to 19 June was Parliament Film  Festival
week. It is the  first  of  its  kind  in  the  world  to  be  hosted  by  a
parliament.  I  congratulate  the  Parliamentary  millennium  project,   the
Department of Arts and Culture and the National Film  and  Video  Foundation
for initiating such a groundbreaking  and  informative  event.  And  to  our
South  African  actors,   directors   and   film   makers   for   portraying
professionalism, class and their significant contribution to the success  of
this project. I thank you, Deputy Madam Speaker.

                            MINISTERIAL RESPONSES

                   BREAKTHROUGH IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME

                            (Minister’s Response)

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Deputy Speaker, there have been some
comments or statements about the police and the issue of crime in our
country. I serve on that Justice, Correctional and Police Services (JCPS)
cluster, and it is one cluster that I know works very hard and very well. I
must therefore commend the hard work of the police. We have men and women
in uniform that we are very proud of as a government. We also commend the
communities who work very closely with our police, to apprehend any
criminals that commit crime.

We as a government will be hard in dealing with crime, as we have adopted a
zero tolerance to crime in our country. We will do everything as a
government to assist the police in their duties in keeping our communities
safe and peaceful. The hon Rajbally, I will pass on your concerns to my
colleague, the Minister of Safety and Security, about the area that you
referred to, where the police station is a little bit further from the
people.

We also commend the police on the breakthroughs that they have made in
curbing crime and in making sure that those who use illegal firearms and
weapons are arrested, and our heartfelt condolences to the family of the
baby who got murdered in Cape Town. Such gruesome acts should not be
happening to young children, neither should they be happening to any of our
citizens. I thank you.


              FET ARRANGMENTS, KZN SCHOOLS, THE FREEDOM CHARTER


                            (Minister’s Response)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION:  Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, allow me to
thank the hon members who have shown the great benefit they derived from
the recent briefing by the Education Department on the Further Education
and Training (FET) arrangements that the department has been working on for
the past few months. I am glad that members have taken on the hard work
that has been done by the department, and I shall certainly convey the
sentiments to them.

In respect of the hon member from the IFP and the statement that the member
made, let me say that we are working very hard to overcome the inheritance
that we received from the mismanagement of education by that party for the
years in which it was in government in KwaZulu-Natal and heading the
education department in that province. You may wave your finger, shake your
head, but we had MECs from that party. The sanitation was not handled at
that time, classrooms were not built and teachers were not adequately
supported. We are dealing with all of that and MEC Cronjé is working hard
to correct the dismal record that is part of what we inherited.

Now, Madam Deputy Speaker, let me say that in this House there are parties
that have no history of struggle worth recording or referring to, but
sadly, Madam Deputy Speaker, there appear to be parties in this House
which, in fact, not only have no history of struggle but they are indeed
ahistorical in their recollection of the history of South Africa.
[Applause.] The statements being made about the Freedom Charter are
absolutely laughable. The notion that the ANC is resuscitating the Charter
is absolutely ridiculous. The Charter carried us, it sustained us through
the struggle, it took us to where we are today, it is reflected in our
Constitution . . . [Applause.] . . . and it has been our rock. [Applause.]

Of course I understand absolutely that parties that had no role in our
struggle for freedom would have no interest in recognising or celebrating
the Freedom Charter. We shall celebrate the achievements of our people and
ensure that it is part of the record. [Applause.] The statements that are
being made that attempt to deny the people of our country their rightful
role in crafting the Freedom Charter merely illustrate that we have parties
here that are haemorrhaging from a lack of strategic ideas or focus.
[Applause.] We shall acknowledge the history of our people, we shall
celebrate our achievements through crafting the Freedom Charter, and we
shall celebrate the fact that we are now free. [Applause.]


                       DONATION FOR SPORTS DEVELOPMENT


                            (Minister’s Response)

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Thank you very much, Chairperson. As
this government we have said it many times in this country that the issue
of sports development is non-negotiable. It therefore is very good to hear
that kit has been donated by the rugby team of Manchester United to the
young people of South Africa, and we really appreciate that. As a
government we have always emphasised that the development of sport,
especially amongst young, disadvantaged South Africans, should be something
that goes on all the time. We therefore appreciate this gesture and hope
that it will go a long way in addressing the representativity of teams in
South Africa.

The march to transformation that we have started as the ANC and as the
government is rolling on, despite the doomsayers over there who want to
stop it. Thank you very much.

                               CHILDREN'S BILL


                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Thank you, Madam Speaker. Madam
Speaker, hon members, the second reading of the Children’s Bill in the
National Assembly is a significant milestone because the process of
developing this Bill started in the year 1996, when it was acknowledged
that the existing legislation was not in keeping with the rights of
children as contained in the Constitution.

Existing legislation also hampered our ability adequately to respond to the
challenging social realities facing children, families and communities in
postapartheid South Africa. The Bill before the National Assembly today
gives effect to the rights of children contained in the Constitution, by
determining principles and guidelines for the care and protection of all
children in this country. It consolidates the laws relating to the welfare
and protection of children and defines parental responsibility and the
rights of children.

The Bill also seeks to promote the preservation and strengthening of
families, specifies the best interests of the child’s standards and
recognises the special needs of children with disabilities. The Bill is
premised on strengthening and developing community structures that provide
care and protection to children and gives effect to the republic’s
obligation concerning the wellbeing of children in terms of the
international conventions that have been signed by our democratic South
Africa.

When passed by Parliament, the Bill will repeal, amongst others, the Child
Care Act of 1960, the Age of Majority Act of 1972, the Child Care Act of
1983, the Children’s Status Act of 1987 and the Natural Fathers of Children
Born out of Wedlock Act of 1997. Also repealed will be section 1 of the
General Law Further Amendment Act of 1962. In addition the Act will
reinforce international standards such as the Guardianship Act of 1993, the
Hague Convention of the Civil Aspect of International Child Abduction Act
of 1996 and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.

In addition, the comprehensive scope of the Bill, the intersectoral nature
and participatory character of the Bill need to be highlighted. The Bill
requires that all sectors and spheres of government, and hence the services
they provide to children, promote child participation in all matters that
impact on their wellbeing and rights.

The Bill before the House contains many far-reaching and innovative
features. The age of majority is lowered from 21 to 18. The acquisition and
loss of parental responsibility and rights are addressed and provision is
made for the signing of parental rights agreement and parenting plans. The
establishment, status and jurisdiction of the Children’s Courts are
specified and provision is made for lay forum hearings and family group
conferences to act in the best interest of the child.

In addition to a child protection register, the Bill enables the removal of
an alleged offender from the home or place where the child resides. Issues
of concern to medical treatment and access to contraceptives are addressed
and certain social, cultural and religious practices are prohibited.
Intercountry adoptions are regulated to safeguard the best interest of the
child and provisions are included to provide the abduction, the sale, or
trafficking of children.

The National Legislative Framework detailed in the Children’s Bill is
groundbreaking and requires new approaches and skills. Important roles are
assigned to the private sector and civil society service providers, with
respect to state resources. The Bill adopts a required principle that
reasonable measures must be taken within available resources by all spheres
of government to prioritise the realisation of the objectives of the Bill.

The passage of this Bill is a significant milestone, not only because of
the imperatives of our Constitution, the challenging social realities
facing children and our consensus on far-reaching innovations but because a
new legislative foundation for the care and protection of children in our
country has been created. The executive branch of government is satisfied
that an appropriate solid basis for further refinements and innovations has
been laid.

I would like to close by thanking the SA Law Commission, the numerous civil
society advocacy groups, the members of the Portfolio Committee, the State
Law Advisors, the staff and management of the Department of Social
Development, other government departments and my colleagues in Cabinet. It
is only by means of your vision, commitment, rigour, hard work, persistence
and spirit of compromise that we have finally reached this turning point in
the care and protection of children in our country.

Our children deserve nothing less and I appeal for the support of members
of this House. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mrs T J TSHIVHASE: Madam Chairperson, hon Ministers, Deputy Ministers, hon
members, ladies and gentlemen, and children of South Africa, our theme is:
“Caring communities protect children”.

It is my pleasure to speak in this debate on the Children’s Bill because it
represents one component of our commitment to the provision of the Freedom
Charter, which says, “South Africa belongs to all who live in it.” This
includes children of our country, and we cannot say that South Africa
belongs to them if we do not provide them with safe and caring environment
in which to grow up and prosper.

We are all aware that this Bill took a long time to be finalised – nearly a
decade. I think that it is vitally important to give a bit of background in
this regard.

Tsha u thoma, vhathu vhothe vha kwameaho vho tendelana u bva mathomoni nga
ha thodea ya vhusimamilayo ine ya amba nga ha zwi kwamaho vhana. [Firstly,
from the beginning, all stakeholders agreed on the need for a comprehensive
legislation dealing with these children’s issues.]

The Portfolio Committee on Social Development, the SA Law Reform
Commission, the Department of Social Development and various civil society
groups were all involved in the drafting of a framework for such children’s
legislation. The SALRC proposed a draft children’s Bill in January 2003.
This was followed by an extensive consultation with various role-players,
which resulted in significant amendments to the draft Bill.

Cabinet approved the Children’s Bill in January 2003 and it was
subsequently sent to Parliament for consideration. For various procedural
and constitutional reasons, the Children’s Bill had to be split into two –
section 75 and 76. This caused a further delay. However, throughout this
process there was considerable dedication shown by all people involved and
this should be commended.

In August 2004, the portfolio committee held extensive public hearings on
the Children’s Bill and a wide variety of issues were brought up at these
hearings. Encouraging developments at these hearings were the diversity of
civil society bodies that made representations. Also, the committee
appreciated that many groups brought the children along to make substantial
submissions themselves on issues affecting them. Well done!

The committee applied its mind to various issues that were brought up in
the public hearings. I can fairly say that these issues had a profound
impact on bringing about the versions of the Bill debated here today. The
committee also had extensive consultations with the various groups and
departments that will be affected by this legislation, namely the
Departments of Education, Justice and Constitutional Development, Health
and others. We had to assure ourselves, and the children of South Africa,
that we are all equally ready to implement the provisions of this Bill.

Finally, after that consultation, we spent hours debating this Bill in the
committee and I am sure that the hon members will agree that we owe a
tremendous debt. Thanks to the officials of the Department of Social
Development, the SA Law Reform Commission, the state law advisers and the
various civil society groups for the long hours they put on this Bill –
together with us.

Vhana vha khou vheiwa khomboni duvha linwe na linwe. Ndi ngazwo Mulayotibe
wo tea u sedza kha masia othe u itela uri ri kone u divha zwauri vha la
mini, vha edela ngafhi, vha ya zwikoloni nga ndila-de, khathihi na sedza
vhothe vha lwalaho na vha re dzidzhele. (Translation of Tshivenda paragraph
follows.)

[Children are placed in dangerous situations every day. It is for this
reason that the Bill has to look at the issue from all angles in order for
us to know what they eat, where they sleep, how they get to school, as well
as providing care to those who are ill and those who are in jail.]

We did all this because we wanted to be sure that this legislation would
really fulfil its purpose, namely to ensure that we give effect to the
South African belief that “your child is my child”, and to establish a safe
and healthy environment in which our children will develop and grow.

Now, allow me to turn to a few of these clauses that we spent so much time
on. The first line on the Children’s Bill preamble reminds us that this
Bill is intended to give effect to certain rights of children, as contained
in the Constitution. These rights are further elaborated upon to include
the right to family or parental care or appropriate alternative care when a
child is removed from the family environment.

Comrade Masutha will deal with the legislative basis for the inclusion of
these rights, but let me deal with the social reasons for such inclusion.
The ANC has always maintained that our children need to be protected and we
remain committed to putting in place the structure, services and the means
for promoting and monitoring sound physical, intellectual, emotional and
social development of children.

We receive reports and observe many instances of children living in
conditions of extreme poverty and deprivation. We also hear consistent
reports about various atrocities committed against our children. This has
to stop. A society that does not take care of children is a society that
will eventually destroy itself. The ANC is committed to the fact that
enacting this law will aid various government departments, communities and
other stakeholders to strengthen and develop community structures that can
assist in providing care and protection of children.

An unfortunate reality in our society today is the number of child-headed
households. This Bill recognises this reality in allowing the child who is
the head of a child-headed household to be recognised as a caregiver and to
be able to access various social grants and services that may be available
to them. However, the Bill also provides for children in a child-headed
household to be declared as children in need of care and protection.
Therefore it triggers access to various other forms of protection. This is
just one example of the many ways in which the Bill seeks to change the way
we protect our children, and my colleagues will discuss the rest.

Maipfi a ndivhuwo a tea u livhiswa kha mirado ya Komiti ya Phothifolio ya

mirado yothe yo di dzhenisaho kha hoyu mushumo une wa vhuedza. (Translation
of Tshivenda paragraph follows.)

[Words of gratitude need to be directed at the former and present members
of the Portfolio Committee on Social Development, the chairperson and
members of the joint committee which looks into issues that concern
children, youth, the disabled, as well as all members who are engaged in
this valuable task.]

All that remains for me to do is to, again, thank all the stakeholders, the
Department of Social Development, other government departments and
everybody who contributed to this Bill. Over the past decade, our
collective message and call to action has been to put the children first.
The protection of children is everybody’s business, and this is to promote
the spirit of ubuntu and the ethic that: “Nwana wavho ndi nwananga” [Your
child is my child], which makes our society strong. Therefore the ANC
supports this Bill. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr M WATERS: Madam Speaker, hon Minister, hon members, it is a great
pleasure and relief to be participating in the Children’s Bill debate
today. The Bill has been before Parliament for three years, and it has
taken the portfolio committee many long hours of hard work to bring it
before Parliament. I would like to thank all the officials whose sleepless
nights have ensured that the Bill beats the deadlines. I commend their
commitment and dedication.

Finally, I would like to thank all the NGOs who are sitting in the Gallery
for continuously lobbying us and giving us all pieces of paper during the
process. Thank you very much.

With a Bill of this magnitude there are bound to be aspects that parties do
not agree with. However, one has to consider the Bill as a whole and decide
whether the positives outweigh the negatives. It gives me great pleasure to
announce that the DA will be supporting the Children’s Bill today.

On the negative side, one aspect of the process that left a bad taste in
our mouths was the incident where the Deputy Minister of Justice and
Constitutional Development and our own Minister invited themselves to the
portfolio committee meeting and ordered the committee to change all its
amendments to the chapter dealing with the children’s courts. The oversight
function of the portfolio committee was severely eroded. The ANC did a U-
turn on the rights of children to legal representation by allowing the
Legal Aid Board to decide whether there is enough money available to
provide it. The DA’s insistence that we need to legislate to ensure
adequate financial resources fell on deaf ears. In fact, the Department of
Justice said that if a child was refused legal representation, the child
could go to the Constitutional Court. What rubbish! If a child is unable to
obtain legal representation for a civil matter in the children’s court, how
on earth are they expected to go to the Constitutional Court to invoke
their constitutional right?  To my dismay, ANC followed the orders of their
Ministers.

In addition, the ANC did another U-turn with regard to guardianship.
Currently, the children’s court has jurisdiction over deciding who the
foster parents of a child should be but does not have the jurisdiction over
a less permanent relationship of guardianship, which is to remain with the
High Court.

Given the Aids pandemic our country is currently reeling under, resulting
in tens of thousands of children with no parents, it makes no sense
whatsoever to expect surviving members of mainly poor families in rural
areas to travel hundreds of kilometres to a High Court in their province,
when they could have accessed the children’s court much closer to home. A
grandmother living on a state pension of R780 per month needs every cent to
feed her hungry grandchildren, not spend that on transport.

It makes perfect sense that if a children’s court can deal with the
appointing of foster parents, they can deal with the issue of guardianship
too.

Despite the Bill having been approved by Cabinet some three years ago, the
costing of the Bill only began a few months ago, and we are all in the dark
as to how much the Bill is going to cost. It amazes us that the department
waited until the eleventh hour before it got its act together. In order for
a portfolio committee to conduct its work in a thorough way, costing a Bill
should be complete before it reaches the committee.

Lastly, on the negative side, the DA would have liked to see the Children’s
Protector retained in the Bill.

There are many positive aspects to the Bill. When I was first elected to
Parliament, I asked the then Minister of Justice whether a Sexual Offences
Register of sorts would be created in South Africa. I am delighted, in fact
I am ecstatic, that we now have a National Child Protection Register. This
is a monumental step in the fight against child abuse. The information on
the register will be used to protect all children from abuse by registered
sex offenders.

In addition, the Bill allows various bodies, which are established and
recognised by legislation, to reach a finding that a particular person is
unsuitable to work with children. It even goes further by stating that in
criminal proceedings a person must be found unsuitable to work with
children where that person has been convicted of murder, attempted murder,
rape, sexual abuse and assault with intent. This clause will apply for five
years retrospectively.

Another safeguard is that any person convicted of an offence with regard to
any child more than once may not be removed from the register. He will
never be able to work with children again. We welcome that as the DA. The
DA will be keeping an eagle eye on the register to ensure that the
necessary resources are allocated to it and that it is properly maintained.

Another long overdue chapter is that on trafficking in children.
Unfortunately, this chapter fails to deal with trafficking in adults –
obviously and particularly that of women. The hon Camerer submitted a
private member’s Bill on this very issue over two years ago and it is about
time that private member’s Bills were evaluated on merit and not on the
party, which the individual concerned belongs to.

According to a Parliamentary reply to my question, last year alone 867
children were reported missing. That is more than two children per day.
This represents a dramatic increase of nearly 22% in the number of children
reported missing between 2001 and 2004.

Human trafficking has become a multi-million dollar industry. Humans,
particularly children, are used as sex slaves, drug mules, used in the
creation of child pornography and as cheap labour. Now, syndicates will
hopefully no longer target South Africa because our children have no
legislative protection.

The rights of unmarried fathers were a topic of much discussion. For the
first time, unmarried fathers who at the time of their child’s birth are
living with the mother in a permanent life partnership acquire full
parental responsibilities and rights. In addition, unmarried biological
fathers who are not living with the mother but who have, according to a
court of law, contributed or have attempted in good faith to contribute to
the child’s upbringing costs for reasonable period will receive full
parental responsibilities and rights. We welcome this.

We hope the next aspect the committee should tackle in conjunction with the
Justice committee will be to address the issue of ``deadbeat dads’’ – those
fathers who refuse to pay maintenance.

Children’s rights have also been strengthened in the area of social,
cultural and religious practices. We welcome this.

Genital mutilation, female circumcision and virginity testing of children
are prohibited, and boys are given the right to refuse circumcision. Anyone
who conducts female circumcision or virginity testing or who circumcises
the child against his will, or anyone who permits such an action on a child
who he or she is obliged to protect, will be guilty of an offence. We
welcome this.

The challenge now is to ensure that children know their rights and that
they can exercise their rights without fear.

The DA supports this Bill. Thank you very much, Chairperson. [Applause.]

Mr M V NGEMA: Madam Chairperson, children are the future of any society
because they provide an important link between the generation into which
they are born and the generation immediately following their own. For this
reason, a wise society must go a long way toward investing in a solid, well-
balanced child, knowing that such investment ensures that a balanced
society is eventually realised.

Children are also the most vulnerable members of our society. Many of them
have their rights violated and are taken advantage of on a daily basis. It
is up to us to provide them with the necessary protection and care that
they need in order to feel safe and enjoy their childhood.

The Children’s Bill is an important piece of legislation that will go a
long way towards protecting the rights of these vulnerable members of our
society. This Bill is greatly needed as South Africa had acceded to various
international conventions, which meant that our legislation also needed
updating and adjusting in order to provide more comprehensive protection
for our children. It has been important that this Bill consolidates all the
other pieces of legislation dealing with different aspects of welfare and
development of the child into one comprehensive piece of legislation. There
has been consultation and interaction with various stakeholders about this
important piece of legislation and a lot of time has been spent working on
it. We therefore hope that the final product will be able to fulfil its
stated objectives.

The IFP, however, believes that there should have been more comprehensive
consultation with traditional communities where, for instance, virginity
testing is part of their culture, in order to find a more human and
respectable manner to regulate this customary practice better. We could
have avoided the double standard that manifests itself in the complete
banning of virginity testing, where no deaths are experienced, while the
preservation of circumcision has been regulated.

The everyday life of many children in South Africa is a constant battle.
They are faced with many threats that increase their vulnerability and also
pose a direct danger to them. One of these threats is the trafficking in
children. It is usually those with little or no education and who come from
poor backgrounds that are most at risk of being victims of human
trafficking. Trafficking in people is considered to be the third-largest
source of profit for organised crime. It is still increasing. Children are
trafficked both internationally and within our borders into a range of
exploitative practices that include labour exploitation, sexual
exploitation, marriage and illegal adoption, among others.

It is therefore significant that this Bill specifically addresses child
trafficking and gives effect to the UN Protocol to Prevent Trafficking in
Persons. It also provides assistance to children who are victims of
trafficking and ultimately aims to combat trafficking in children. This
unlawful and inhuman practice must be stopped as a matter of urgency. We
cannot allow South Africa to become a hub for child trafficking and
hopefully this Bill is the first step in wiping out trafficking in children
and providing the necessary protection that they need.

There are a great number of children who are infected and affected by
HIV/Aids. Their lives are irrevocably changed. Thousands of children have
been orphaned and many more will be orphaned as a result of this pandemic.
This leads to an increase in child-headed households and ultimately further
increases the vulnerability of … [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr M DIKO: Madam Chair, hon Ministers and hon members, the UDM would like
to thank the officials and the NGOs that participated in this process.

The objects of this Bill go to the very core of our Constitution and our
efforts to create a society based on human rights. If we cannot protect the
dignity and safety of the most innocent and weakest amongst us, we cannot
claim to be succeeding as a rights-based society.

Recently, the UDM highlighted in this House the shocking rate of child
deaths as a result of violence in this country. Every year,
1 100 children aged 14 years and younger die due to violence and
intentional assault. A seven-year review of deaths amongst children younger
than 15 revealed that head injuries constituted 42%. A separate study found
that of 1809 child deaths, more than half were unnatural deaths. In this
study, the ages ranged between 1 month and 11 years. What the research has
also highlighted is that victims often had a history of injuries supposedly
sustained from falling accidentally. These are merely the cases that fall
at very extreme end of the spectrum of children’s-rights violations.

The UDM has previously called upon the Ministers of Safety and Security,
Social Development and Health to review the reporting of the investigation
mechanism for suspicious injuries to children admitted to hospitals and
clinics. We are now happy that this Bill creates an environment for such
interventions.

We call upon the Department of Social Development to publish the contents
of this Bill widely, especially to ensure that education; health and police
officials are fully aware and ready to implement this Bill.

The UDM supports this Bill. Thank you, Madam Chair. [Applause.]

Mr T M MASUTHA: Chairperson, first of all I would like to echo the
sentiments already expressed by the Chair and others after her by thanking
profoundly the efforts that were put into this project by the department
jointly with their colleagues in other departments and by the NGOs, which
played a very close role in perfecting this Bill through public hearings
and other processes.

As the Chair has already alluded to, we sought to consult widely through
provincial visits, meeting various communities and visiting various
institutions where children are cared for, to appraise ourselves of what is
actually happening on the ground and actually alerting the community at
large to what is entailed in this legislation.

But before I proceed, I would like to address one or two issues that were
raised by the DA this afternoon. I think it is what borders on political
posturing for hon Mike Waters to accuse the Minister and the Deputy
Minister of having instructed the committee to change the entire clause on
the courts. Of course, you know that the clause you referred to or the
Chapter you referred to was not changed     holus-bolus. The reason why
there was a need for the Minister and the Deputy Minister to come and
address the committee arose in line with the process and the approach which
we as a committee adopted.
That was to ensure that this legislation, because of its multisectoral
nature in the sense that it does not only affect social development but
also health, it has issues relating to justice, it has issues relating to
several other departments - we ensured that throughout the process other
departments affected by this Bill are alerted to the provisions of the Bill
that affect them and are invited to give input because we regarded the
significance of this Bill lying in its integrated approach to addressing
the needs and welfare of children.

No single department can, on its own, take upon itself the responsibility
of addressing the many complex challenges that affect children. So of
course, it was in line with the approach of the committee itself that
Justice came to the committee - not only the Deputy Minister, but officials
of Justice who have invited the Master’s Office to come and address us, who
have invited various stakeholders to come and address us on different
complex issues because of the complex nature of the legislation. So all
that they are saying is completely unfounded.

On the second issue around guardianship, the Department of Justice
indicated to us that they were busy rolling out the new type of court
called family courts, which would seek to integrate different aspects
affecting the welfare of children - issues of maintenance, issues of
domestic violence, all of which were dealt with in separate courts.
Children’s courts et cetera are all magistrates courts, but they are
separate courts and the idea is to integrate the institution so that
eventually you have a well-established family court system.

They requested that because the specific issue of guardianship was a
complex one, it would be ideal for such an issue to be deferred until this
new court system was established - that is, the system of family courts,
which would be better placed to deal with that issue. So it’s not as if it
was just a simple question of refusing to move in terms of ensuring that
all issues relating to children are dealt with by courts which are most
accessible to people, namely the magistrates courts which, in this case,
are children's courts because every magistrates court in terms of the
current law is also a children’s court.

I think it is very important that these issues are explained in context and
that they are not used as political football to score cheap political
points. But having said so, let me proceed and state first of all that the
Bill before us is a product of and a milestone in the long walk towards the
creation of a caring, child centred and child-friendly society that we as a
nation has striven for.

On 16 June 1995 former president Mr Mandela signed the UN Convention on the
Rights of the Child, thereby committing us as a nation to become a child-
friendly society. A year later Parliament passed the current Constitution,
section 28 of which outlines the fundamental rights of children over and
above the rights that children enjoy under the Bill of Rights as a whole.

The section I have just mentioned also enjoins us as a nation to put
children first by stating that in all matters affecting children their best
interest takes precedence. The Bill before us today is in large measure
aimed at responding to these national and international obligations towards
children that we have. This law seeks to integrate a number of laws dealing
with the legal status of children, care and protection of children and the
protection of their interest on the one hand whilst at the same time it
engenders a new ethos that seeks to affirm the role of those who play a
crucial role in the survival and upbringing of children, be they parents,
adoptive parents, foster parents, care givers within or even beyond the
extended family as well as organisations and communities or structures in
communities that care for children, especially those who are orphaned or
abandoned.

The increased number of orphans in our society resulting from the untimely
death of their parents due to various medical causes including HIV/Aids has
exacerbated the ever-increasing challenge of children having to look after
their younger siblings, commonly known as the phenomenon of child-headed
households. This Bill, whilst not seeking to encourage the proliferation of
such incidents, recognises this challenge and provides for measures that
will assist children in such situations to cope with this burden and not be
subjected to exploitation by opportunistic adults through, amongst others,
property grabbing.

Currently three parallel systems regulate the affairs of children, namely
the Common Law, which derives essentially from Roman and Roman-Dutch Law,
Statutory Law and African Customary Law, all of which are recognised under
our Constitution. This creates a situation in which different rules are
applied by different institutions dealing with the same issues.

Children’s courts are confined to implementing the Child Care Act,
traditional courts apply Customary Law and the High Court as upper guardian
of all minor children applies the Common Law over essentially similar
matters regarding children. While this Bill seeks to create a common
standard for the care and wellbeing of children, it also extends the
jurisdiction of the children’s court to deal with some of the matters which
are currently within the exclusive jurisdiction of the High Court, such as
custody over children, which this Bill now refers to as “care for
children”, a much more child-friendly term, as well as access which is now
in this Bill being referred to as “contact with children”.

This, we hope, will alleviate the plight of many poor rural communities,
especially those which have to incur huge travel costs as well as legal
fees to access our high courts. With the increased movement of people
across national boundaries, especially resulting from the re-integration
into the broader family of nations in the case of our own country, we have
become party to a number of international agreements aimed at the
protection of children who find themselves across boundaries of various
countries for various reasons, including adoption or so-called inter-
country adoption, abduction and the trafficking of children – matters which
have already been alluded to this afternoon.

These include the Hague Conventions on Intercountry Adoption, Intercountry
Abduction and various international instruments that prohibit trafficking
in human beings, especially women and children. This legislation seeks to
give effect to these instruments by creating the necessary procedures and
institutions to deal effectively with the rights and wellbeing of children
in such situations. Currently, for example, our law does not provide for
inter-country adoption. As a result of the Constitutional Court judgement
in the Fitzpatrick case in 1998, Parliament is required to close this gap,
hence the provisions in this Bill creating a system of intercountry
adoption for our country.

Child abuse and neglect have always been some of the social challenges that
we have been faced with for some time. You will recall, for instance, the
widely publicised incidence of child rapes that became the talk of the day
in recent years and that prompted this Parliament to, amongst other
measures, hold public hearings two years ago, which saw large numbers of
stakeholders participating and proposing . . . [Interjections.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms C-S Botha): Hon member, I regret your time has

Mr T M MASUTHA: Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Mr L W GREYLING: Chair, the ID believes that this is truly a great day for
children’s rights. This Bill has been in the system for many years, but the
ID feels that all the deliberations have produced a truly revolutionary
piece of legislation that significantly advances children’s rights in South
Africa. It also revolutionises parental responsibilities and rights in
South Africa.

In order for this Bill to deliver on its huge expectations, however,
Treasury will have to make available sufficient funds for provincial
government to employ additional social workers to cope with the extra
demands that we put on the sector. We currently do not have nearly enough
social workers in South Africa and we all have to address this crisis
urgently.

The ID also welcomes the fact that loopholes regarding inter-country
adoptions have been closed and we believe that all efforts must be made to
place children in South African families first. The ID also supports the
criminalizing of child trafficking as contained in this Bill. This is an
international scourge, which South Africa needs to play its part in
eradicating.

The one issue, which the ID has concerns with, however, is the fact that
guardianship issues are still the exclusive domain of the High Court. Many
poor families cannot afford the expensive costs associated with the High
Court and the ID would like to see this issue addressed.

The ID strongly supports the attention given to children with disabilities
in this Bill and notes with satisfaction that the Bill stipulates that
their interests have to be taken into consideration in departmental
planning. We hope that this progressive attitude will now also be extended
to the issue of inclusive education so that more disabled children can
obtain the education they are entitled to.

Finally, it needs to be said that this Bill has to be put within the
context of the grinding poverty that many of our children and families have
to endure. Children’s rights can only be effectively realised if we address
the underlying poverty of our society. The ID therefore, once again, renews
its call to extend the child support grant to all children under the age of
18. This is in keeping with the constitutional definition of children and
it will go a long way in extending the social security net to many
impoverished families. The ID supports this Bill. [Time Expired.] Thank
you. [Applause.]

Mrs C DUDLEY: The ACDP acknowledges and welcomes all the young people in
the gallery and especially those who are with Molo Songolo. They have a
specific interest in the trafficking of children, which this Bill, today,
will criminalize and ACDP supports these clauses in the Bill.

We call, of course, for the urgent implementation of trafficking
legislation, which will be necessary to put a stop to sex tourism in South
Africa, which violates our children. While the Bill before us contains
important measures to deal with trafficking of children and abduction and
includes the Child Protection Register, other clauses give rise to serious
concerns and the ACDP believes they increase the vulnerability of our
children.

The lowering of the age of consent to 12 years with regard to medical and
surgical treatment places an unfair burden on children, making them
extremely vulnerable. Termination of pregnancy without parental consent at
the age of 12 years was made possible in the CTOP Act and this Bill just
confirms this shocking reality.  Once this Bill becomes an Act, provision
of contraceptives to 12-year-olds also becomes law.

In the UK, a 14-year-long study of underage pregnancy has questioned the
effectiveness of policies that increase easy availability of contraceptives
for children under 16. Dr Paton pointed out that an increase in access to
family-planning clinics did not decrease pregnancy rates and even increased
them in some instances because it encouraged people to be sexually active.
A high contraceptive failure rate added to the problem. The impact, of
course, on HIV/Aids is an added concern.

The Bill confirms court findings, which legalise the adoption of children
by same-sex couples. This is a dangerous trend promoting a homosexual
agenda and children should not be guinea pigs in such unnatural social
experiments. Statistics highlight the fact that children who grow up in
single sex parented homes are clearly disadvantaged and the consequences
are often tragic. This is not a solution by any stretch of imagination and,
yes, the ACDP was the only party to vote against the Constitution on this
and other grounds.

Protection is provided in the Bill for surrogate mothers to choose to abort
their unborn children, regardless of the fact that loving parents and their
loving home await the arrival of the child. This clause has compromised
this Bill and undermined any positive impact it may otherwise have had in
protecting our children. On these grounds, the ACDP unfortunately is forced
to vote against it.

The 76 version of the Bill, which is not yet before Parliament, contains
clauses with financial implications for provinces expected to deliver child
protection services. This section 75 Bill is therefore likely to have no
impact until the other half is passed. One of the most critical issues
hampering and eroding effective delivery of child protection services is
the lack of provision for funding of NGOs who actually deliver the bulk of
statutory services. Neither section of the Bill addresses this issue.

Controversial clauses, which prohibit parents from disciplining their
children with a smack, will appear in section 76 as well. The ACDP believes
that parents have a God-given responsibility to raise and train their
children and the state should not undermine parental authority and
responsibility in the home. Thank you. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mrs X C MAKASI: Chairperson, hon Minister, Deputy Ministers, hon members,
comrades and friends, today is a very honourable day in our history. The
ANC is honoured and happy to be leading the government that is finally able
to introduce the first part of our comprehensive children’s legislation.
This day represents another part of the dreams we had when we declared in
the Freedom Charter that: “All shall enjoy equal human rights.” The ANC
knew that even our children would be free to enjoy all the rights we owe to
them.

This has been a long process and we thank Comrade Tshivhase and everybody
who has positively participated in this process. This legislation is
important for all the reasons that have already been mentioned. It makes
provision for the protection of children. It provides for services and
structures that can assist in providing care for children and it gives
effect to some of our international obligation with regard to children.

However, I want to highlight a few specific areas where the new children’s
legislation will have very specific impact. It is clear that this Bill
represents a move away from a common law concept of parental power towards
the notion of parental responsibilities and rights. However, it must always
be remembered that not everything about the concept of parental powers was
detrimental to the child.

As is the case throughout the Bill, those aspects of parental powers that
were in the best interest of the children are retained within the notion of
parental care and responsibilities.

The new formulation of parental responsibility and rights is designed to
recognise the rights and powers of both parents and children. For example,
the rights of parents to discipline or even reprimand their children should
be weighed up against the child’s right to dignity and integrity.

The ANC is very aware that there are various opinions and practices
regarding the notion of corporal punishment of children. However, it is
important for parents to recognise that this right can only be exercised to
an extent that does not conflict with our Bill of Rights and our
international obligation in terms of the Convention of the Rights of the
Child.

Another situation is that this Bill attempts to deal with the changing
nature of the family and how this relates to our children.

Lo Mthetho usayilwayo uzama ukuqwalasela amalungelo abazali nabantwana
abazelwe ngaphandle komtshato.

Kwakhona, ukwaqwalasela iimeko zabantu abanomdla ebantwaneni. Kwisahluko
sesi-3, kwicandelo 18 lalo Mthetho usayilwayo kuthethwa ngoxanduva
kwanamalungelo obuzali. Ungafaka isicelo enkundleni ukuze ufumane
amalungelo obuzali.

Ezi zibonelelo zinika umnyinyiva omkhulu kootat’ omkhulu noomakhulu,
kumaqabane angengobazali kodwa ehlala ixesha elide nabantwana, nakwabanye
abantu ababonise ubudlelwane nabantwana. Xa inkundla inikezela ngamalungelo
noxanduva lobuzali ikhokelwa zizinto ezibalulekileyo ngokubhekisele
kumntwana lowo.

Lo Mthetho usayilwayo ukhankanya ukuba oomathathu amanqanaba karhulumente
kufuneka asebenzisane ukuphuhlisa indlela efanayo nehlangeneyo yokuzisa
iinkonzo ebantwaneni. Oku kungqina ikhwelo likaMongameli elithi onke
amanqanaba karhulumente kufuneka asebenzisane ukuze abe nokuzalisekisa
izithembiso zikarhulumente okhokelwa yi-ANC. (Translation of Xhosa
paragraphs follows.)

[The Bill is intended to consider the rights of women and children born out
of wedlock.

It also considers the interests of children to be of paramount importance.
Chapter 3, section 18 of the Bill stipulates the rights and
responsibilities of parents and rights by order of the court.

The child support grant obtainable from government provides relief to
grandparents and to citizens who temporarily adopt children. It also helps
those who show goodwill towards children who are in need of care. When the
court rules with regard to acknowledging the responsibilities and rights of
parenthood, it considers what is important for the child.

The Bill stipulates that the three tiers of government must work together
for welfare service delivery, particularly for children. This is in line
with the President’s call that all government departments must work
together to fulfil the promises made by the ANC-led government.]

This Bill also gives effect to the ANC’s commitment to put our children
first, in making sure that the different spheres of government are
encouraged to prioritise the care and development of our children, whilst
recognising that there are various competing social and economic interests.
The Bill obliges organs of state to take this noble step to the maximum
extent of their resources to achieve this objective of this Act.

In conclusion, it is the responsibility of every mother, every father and
all responsible citizens of this country to ensure that children are not
neglected, but are cared for and to take action against any form of abuse
towards children. Children’s rights are human rights. I support the Bill.
Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr N T GODI: Chairperson, Comrade Minister, comrades and hon members, allow
me as I rise to support this Bill, believing that its merits far outweigh
its demerits.

I dedicate my speech to the five children who were butchered by the
murderous SA Defence Force on 8 October 1993 in Comrade Sigqibo Mpendulo’s
house in Umtata in the cold, calculated but mistaken belief that they were
attacking an Apla facility. The tree of liberty watered by their blood has
been bearing fruit for the past 11 years and one of them is the Bill we are
passing today.

The passing of this Bill today is timeous, relevant and complementary
because it comes a few days after a meeting under the auspices of the
African Union in Addis Ababa on protecting orphans and vulnerable children.

The meeting, in line with the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of
the Child sought ``to make Africa a place fit for children’’ and declared
that ``children deserve a brighter future’’. The PAC believes that this is
what we seek to do in this Bill for our children in South Africa.

The core or the spirit of this Bill, we believe, is captured in its object
of promoting the protection, development and wellbeing of children and in
making the best interest of the child the basis for all or any decision
taken in respect of the child.

I would be failing in my responsibilities if I did not thank everyone
involved in this process, from our chairperson, Comrade Tshivhase, for her
leadership, to the committee members and the bureaucrats, both
parliamentary and governmental. This is a huge Bill in terms of policy
dimensions, implementation challenges and its cross-cutting nature and
thrust departmentally.

This Bill has been a long time coming precisely because of its cross-
cutting nature and the responsibilities and obligations it entails for
other departments. We hope for the sake of the African child that
implementation will be fast-tracked.

Whilst the staggering of implementation is at times an objective reality,
we certainly would like to counsel strongly against it. Already a number of
aspects have been watered down and any retreat from or procrastination on
what is currently in the Bill will certainly not be in the best interest of
the child. It would be disastrous and defeatist.

We would like for the structures, services and means for the realisation of
the best interest of the child, especially the courts, to be as accessible
and responsive as the realities are on the ground. We must be able to rush
dealing with the challenge of orphans and the need for guardianship in the
context of African realities.

The recent international labour organisation conference in Geneva
identified trafficking, especially of children, as facilitating the scourge
of forced labour. For us in South Africa this Bill helps us to deal with
child trafficking adequately.

We applaud the recognition enshrined in the Bill of children with special
needs. That recognition and consciousness in our society still needs
serious development.  We are happy that those who abuse children, both men
and women, will be barred from working with children. We are equally
satisfied about the strengthening and development of community structures
as an integral part of protecting and promoting the wellbeing of children.

As we pass this Bill we say never again should our children suffer neglect
and deprivation or be robbed of their right to be children by a system of
government as abhorrent and decadent as white minority rule was. I thank
you. [Applause.]

Ms S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Madam Chair. The children of our nation are its
future. Like a well-fertilised garden receiving the necessary nourishment
and care, they shall produce great blossoms. In turn, the care and proper
socialisation of our young shall serve to produce leaders who will take our
democracy to avenues we so desperately strived to achieve. The Minority
Front firmly supports the establishment of structures, services and means
to develop children physically, intellectually, emotionally and socially.

We firmly believe that South African children are the biggest
responsibility we have and we strongly support the development of our
community structures and share their support, care and protection of our
children.

Child abuse is one of our greatest concerns and it is encouraging to note
that this Bill provides for the protection of children from all forms of
maltreatment, abuse, neglect and discrimination in any form.

Children are unfortunately also victims of HIV and Aids, with many being
orphaned by it. The MF is pleased that this Bill serves to institute care
and protection for children in need. These concerns extend beyond our
national concerns and, noting the unanimity in international concerns
regarding children, it is pleasing to note that the Bill also serves to
address our compliance with international obligations and undertakings
committing us to the wellbeing of our children.

The MF is encouraged that the provisions of this Bill shall pave a bright
future for our children if applied effectively and efficiently. I take this
opportunity to thank and applaud the portfolio committee, the departments
and all those involved who  burnt the midnight oil to produce this
auspicious Bill for the children of our nation. We must always remember:
Ingane yakho ingane yami, ingane yami ingane yakho. [Your child is my child
and my child is your child.]

The Minority Front supports this Children’s Bill. [Applause.]

Ms H WEBER: Madam Chairperson, the DA welcomes the co-operation by all
parties serving on the portfolio committee. In the end, this produced a
Bill that the DA largely supports, although there were times when critical
aspects of children’s rights were about to be left out.

My colleague, the hon Waters, mentioned in his speech the intervention of
certain Ministers to ensure that access by children to children’s courts
would be restricted. But the DA is pleased that members of the ANC
eventually agreed with the DA about certain other key aspects of the Bill,
and I refer here particularly to clauses on disability.

Between 3 million and 6 million South Africans have moderate to severe
disabilities, and many of these are children. In South Africa it is
unfortunate that there is a direct relationship between disability and
poverty, malnutrition and discrimination.

Children with disabilities are often not able to defend themselves against
abuse. Sometimes they are ostracised by their communities. Often they are
unable to access youth development programmes and services for which they
are eligible. For this reason the DA pressured the committee into
prescribing in the Bill that courts must give assistance to children with
disabilities and the chronically ill.

The committee’s inclusion of this clause is welcome indeed. We also welcome
the fact that the Bill places an obligation on courts to ensure that they
are accessible to all people with disabilities.

Court visits are difficult, confusing and frightening enough for adults,
all the more so for children. So the requirement that every court must have
a room designed in such a manner as to make children feel at ease and that
every effort must be made to find a person who will take time to interpret
what a disabled child wants to say is a great step forward.

We also support the intercountry adoption clauses. The strict rules that
must now be adhered to in accordance with The Hague Convention will go a
long way in preventing child trafficking, which is something that must be
stopped at all costs. The challenge now is to ensure that South Africa
complies fully with these provisions.

I would like to also thank all the NGOs who were present at all our
portfolio committee meetings. The DA supports this Bill. [Applause.]

Mr B M SOLO: Ngekhe silwe namhlanje. [We won’t be fighting today.]

Madam Speaker, Ministers and Deputy Ministers, hon members, Takalani and
the children out there, gradually and continually we are realising the dawn
of a very new day. Again, the ANC-led government is demonstrating its
seriousness in ensuring that South Africa belongs to all who live in it and
that it meets its constitutional obligations, such as those in chapter 2 of
the Constitution, in particular section 28.

The Children’s Bill is nothing but a tool to ensure the sound foundation of
the caring society we are building. It is an enabling tool to ensure a
bright future for not only our children but for all of us as a society.

In support of all the speakers who supported this Bill and who have already
outlined a number of the provisions of the Bill, it is not for me - and it
is not my intention - to bore this House, save only to illustrate and
emphasise some of the salient points with regard to adoption in its
entirety.

The adoption provisions of the Bill, both local and intercountry, are very
comprehensive. These provisions have formed some of the core discussions in
the committee and public hearings. Any adoption to provide for the
permanent care of a child will be done in terms of a court order in the
best interests of the child. It should be clear that the purpose of
adoption is to protect and nurture children by providing a safe, healthy
environment with positive support, as spelt out in clause 229 of the Bill.

Accordingly, chapter 15 provides a whole range of standards, norms and
procedures to be followed in dealing with adoption, including provisions
with regard to persons who may adopt children, a register of adoptable
children and prospective parents, consent to adoption and postadoption
agreements, including the gathering of information for proposed adoptions.

Chapter 16 deals with intercountry adoptions, apart from the Hague
Convention on Inter-country Adoption. The committee has also formulated
provisions for nonconvention countries, mainly in Africa and other
developing countries. It then becomes important for all South Africans,
NGOs, civic-society organisations, including churches, to not only
familiarise themselves with this particular chapter but to internalise
and/or memorise it like a recitation, because as a society and a country we
are beginning to see how children have been turned into commodities -
trafficking, prostitution, child labour, etc.

Siyavuya ke nokubona ukuba amaqela onke torho ayawuvuyela lo Mthetho
usayilwayo siwuqulunqayo namhlanje apha. Kodwa ke zikhona izinto ekufuneka
sizicacise ezingabekwanga ngendlela efanelekileyo. Ndiyayithanda nale nto
ithethwe leli lungu elibekekileyo, umfana osaze ngobuso elizweni uMnu
Waters, othethe kakuhle kakhulu.

Siyabona noko ngoku ukuba ngenene inguqu iya iba khona kubo bonke abemi
boMzantsi Afrika. Kodwa ke zikhona nje iindawo ekufuneka sizilungisile.
Mhlawumbi zingavakala kabuhlungu xa zibekwe ngenye indlela. Ndiyeza ke
apho.

Enye indawo endifuna ukuyilungisa ke nokuyicacisa yile ibekwe lilungu
elibekekileyo elivela kwi-IFP, yokuba zange kuboniswane nabantu.
Ndandikhona ngokwam phaya KwaZulu-Natal, phaya eNquthu, apho ungaboni
nendlela xa uye kuthetha nabantu. Sasiphelele sonke apho, neenkosi zikhona.
Ndade ndatya nazo, ndabekwa kwisihlalo esiphezulu. Ndafana nazo.

Into yokuba ke zange kubekho kuboniswana nawo noko asiyo nyaniso.
Njengokuba bendisitsho ke, ikhona imithetho ejongene nezinto zasebukhosini,
njengalo kuthiwa yi-Traditional Leadership and Governance Framework Act
owaphunyezwa apha, onika abantu ilungelo lokwenza izinto zabo ngokwendlela
abaphila ngayo.

Ukhona nomnye umthetho owaziwa njenge-Cultural, Religious and Linguistic
Communities Act, onika abantu ilungelo lokuqhuba amasiko abo ngendlela
yabo. Lo Mthetho osayilwayo oshukuxwa apha awusho ukuba izinto ezithile
mazingenziwa, koko ujonge ukukhusela abantwana, ngakumbi abaselula.

Kubhaliwe apha kulo Mthetho osayilwayo kwaye naye angayibona le nto
ibhaliwe apha, ukuba ebewufunde wonke lo Mthetho usayilwayo. Makangafundi
le ndawana ayifunayo kuphela. Kubhaliwe phaya ukuba abantwana abangaphantsi
kwe-18 mabakhuseleke. Abangaphezulu kwale minyaka banelungelo
lokuzikhethela.

Ndibuye ke ndize kule nto ibithethwa apha ngabantu abathi bamele amaKrestu.
Nangona besithi bamele amaKrestu, nam endinguye, kodwa abandimelanga mna.
Bathi ke lo Mthetho usayilwayo awulunganga ngoba uvumela abantwana ukuba
bakhuphe izisu. Andiqinisekanga ukuba ibekwa njani ngesiXhosa, kodwa ngathi
kuthiwa luqhomfo.

Kwakhona, bafundile abanye babo, baneengubo ezimnyama ezinemigca ebomvu
neminqwazi emikhulu. Kuthiwa bafundile. Abawufundanga kakuhle lo Mthetho
usayilwayo ngoba awuthethi le nto bayithethayo. Kwaye soze senze umthetho
ophikisa imithetho eyavunywa yile Ndlu. (Translation of Xhosa paragraphs
follows.)

[I am glad to notice that all parties seem to be happy about this Bill.
However, there are things that we need to clarify. I welcome the young man,
hon Mr Waters’s comments. He spoke very well.

We can see now that there will be changes in every South African citizen’s
life. There are things that we still need to amend. They might not sound
very good. I shall come back to that.

I would like to respond to an hon member from the IFP who said that people
were not consulted. I was at Nquthu in KwaZulu-Natal, where there is not
even a proper road to take you where you need to talk to the people. All of
us were there. Traditional leaders were also present. I had a meal with
them, I was offered a seat among them, and I felt important like them.

It is not true that they were not consulted. I have already mentioned that
there are pieces of legislation that deal with the matter of traditional
leaders, such as the Traditional Leadership and Governance Framework Act,
which was passed here and which grants them the right to live according to
their own norms and standards.

The Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural,
Religious and Linguistic Communities Act gives people the right to practise
their customs in their own way. The Bill before us does not say that
certain things should not be done, but it seeks to protect children.

That is what the Bill says, and had he read the Bill he would have seen
that. He should not just read what he wants to read. It is included in the
Bill that children below the age of 18 should be protected. Those who are
older can choose for themselves.

I would like to come back to the comments made by those who say that they
represent the Christian faith, which I do too, although they do not
represent me. They say that they do not support this Bill. I am not sure
how it is said in Xhosa, but I think they say it is abortion.

Some of them are learned and have black and red graduation gowns, hoods and
caps. They are said to be well educated. They did not study this Bill,
because one can see that they are not quoting the Bill. We would never have
passed legislation to which this House did not agree.]

We are not going to create chaos. We are not going to allow . . .

Asizi kuvumela ukuphikisana kwemithetho apha. Umzalwane makawufundisise
kakuhle lo Mthetho usayilwayo, ngalaa ndlela afunda ngayo ibhayibhile, ade
ayiphuphe nokuba ulele, ambone noYesu engenile entliziyweni yakhe.
Makawufunde njalo nomthetho, angaxokisi abantu ngoba asinto intle noko
ukuba sixokiswe ngabantu abathi bangamaKrestu.

Zikhona ke nezinye izinto ezithethiweyo apha endingafuni kungena kakhulu
kuzo, ngoba kaloku ndiyabona ukuba kukho umoya omhle namhlanje kule Ndlu.
Ndicela nje ukuba sonke sincedisane ukuqinisekisa ukuba abantwana bethu
bakhuselekile, bayawafumana amalungelo abo njengokuba sele kutshiwo apha.

Lo mba wonoontlalontle ekuthiwa abekho asiyo nto ibalulekileyo, ukuba thina
sonke besifaka isandla apho kukho ingxaki khona. Kufuneka singahlali
ebumnandini simane sikhomba phaya, koko siye sonke siye kuncedisa ukwenzela
ukuba sikwazi ukulwa nale ntlupheko.

Abafunda iincwadi ezinkulu ke bayayazi into eya thethwa yenye indoda ethi .
. . (Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[We are not going to allow different pieces of legislation here. The hon
member should read the Bill properly, the way he reads the Bible, and even
dream about it and see Jesus in his heart. He should read it and stop lying
to people because it is not good for Christians to lie to people.

A great deal more was mentioned, but I do not want to dwell on that because
there is a good spirit in the House today. I would like to ask everybody to
work together to ensure that our children are protected, as it has been
mentioned already by a number of people.

The claim that there are too few social workers would not be such an issue
if we all pulled together. We should not relax and only point to problems
everywhere, but we should all roll up our sleeves and partake in their
fight against poverty.

The learned ones would know what a certain man said . . . ]

 . . . let the children come to me and do not stop them, because the
kingdom of God belongs to such as these.

Kuthiwa ke le nto, ukuba uyitolika kakuhle njengokuba ibibekwa apha, ithi,
“ümntwana wam ngumntwana wakho”. Ndiyayivuyela nale nto ibithethwa ngamanye
amaqela apha, yokuba athi ayawuxhasa lo Mthetho usayilwayo ngaphandle
kwalaa mba uthande ukuba yingxaki. Ndide ndizibuze ukuba kanti ubuKrestu
obu yintoni na?

Ndiyayivuyela le nto yalo moya mhle kangaka wokuba sivumelane sonke,
ngakumbi ngale mini yokugqibela. Sonke masiphume apha simxhelo mnye, siye
kukhusela abantwana bethu, ngoba balikamva lethu. Ndiyabulela.
[Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[If all that was said here is interpreted correctly, it would mean that my
child is your child and your child is my child. I am happy that most
parties support this Bill, except for the clause that seems to be a
problem. Sometimes I am even inclined to ask myself what Christianity is.

I have said that I am happy about the positive spirit that exists in the
House today, especially on our last day of this session. Let us all go out
and protect our children, because they are our future. I thank you.
[Applause.]]

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Madam Speaker, I stand here to thank
the House and all the parties for the co-operation that they have given in
ensuring that this Bill sees the light of day. It has taken about nine
years – nine full years – for this Bill to be passed by this House. In that
time, we consulted almost everybody and all the sectors that were there,
because of the complexity of the Bill and the intersectoral participation
that has been needed.

We would like, despite all the comments that have been made, to thank
almost everybody on the issues. In terms of some of the issues that have
been raised, quite obviously cannot necessarily be answered by this Bill.

What I would like to stress is that for this Bill to be a reality in the
lives of our people, it should be accepted by almost everybody so that we
are able to implement it in all parts of our country. It should not be a
Bill only for the urban areas; it should be a Bill for the people of South
Africa as a whole – both urban and rural. I think that in ensuring that, we
would expect the hon members to be part and parcel of that.

Once again, I say thanks for all your comments, thanks for your
participation. I hope that we will be able to work together to ensure that
the principles that are set out in this Bill really become a reality for
all children of South Africa. South Africa depends on those children for
her future. I thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time (African Christian Democratic Party dissenting).

                               POINT OF ORDER

                                  (Ruling)

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, hon members. Before we move to the second Order
of the Day, I would like to make a ruling on what transpired in the House
earlier this afternoon.

During members’ statements, hon Trent made certain remarks which suggested
that the President might have been involved in irregular activities
relating to the arms deal.

Hon Bloem subsequently raised a point of order on the remarks. In response
to Mr Bloem’s point of order, I indicated that I would study the Hansard
and then give a ruling. I have looked at the Hansard and I wish to rule, as
follows: It is established practice that a member who wishes to bring any
allegations of improper conduct on the part of another to the attention of
the House, including the President, should do so by way of a substantive
motion, comprising a clearly formulated and properly substantiated charge
or charges.

Except upon such a substantive motion, it has been ruled previously that
members should not be allowed to impute improper motives to other members
or cast personal reflections on their integrity, or verbally abuse them in
any other way.

The remarks made by Mr Trent are therefore out of order, and I would like
him to withdraw them. Hon Trent? [Interjections.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam Deputy Speaker . . .
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: I am addressing Mr Trent.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Yes, Madam Deputy Speaker, I am trying to
address you. I want to ask, in terms of which Rule you are ruling, if I
may?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: I am addressing Mr Trent. Mr Trent?

Mr E W TRENT: Madam Deputy Speaker, could you just tell us under which Rule
you are ruling, please? [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr Trent, I don’t think I am here running a workshop on
Rules, which I expect all of us to be familiar with. I would like you to
withdraw those words, Mr Trent.

Mr E W TRENT: Madam Deputy Speaker, I stand by my statement . . .
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr Trent, are you going to withdraw?

Mr E W TRENT: I am therefore not prepared to withdraw.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Will you please leave the Chamber? [Interjections.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam Deputy Speaker . . .
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: That matter has now been dealt with. We now move to the
second . . . [Interjections.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam Deputy Speaker, may I ask, you’ve
concluded with Mr Trent . . . [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: On which point are you rising?

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: I am rising under Rule 66, which refers
to reflection on holders of office, like judges, but it is other than
members of government . . . [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr Gibson, what I have done, right now, has concluded
what I wanted to deal with in terms of Mr Trent, and that ends that matter.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Yes.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: If you want to deal with my ruling, and you think my
ruling is not supposed to have been what it was, you know, as one of our
senior Whips in this Parliament, what to do. And you are not going to abuse
your powers in the Chamber. I have made that ruling and I have closed that
matter. The matter is closed.

I now want to call the secretary to read the second Order of the Day.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Well, then you force me to act as you
request. Thank you, I’ll do just that.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: I beg your pardon, what did you just say?

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: I said that you then force me to act as
you request. I will have to go to another authority. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Absolutely, that’s fine. That’s okay.

      CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON JUSTICE AND
     CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT ON THE JUDICIAL MATTERS AMENDMENT BILL.

Order disposed of without debate.

Report adopted.

Agreed to.




                       JUDICIAL MATTERS AMENDMENT BILL


                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Madam Deputy
Speaker, as is the practice with Bills of this nature, the Judicial Matters
Amendment Bill comprises a number of amendments to laws administered by my
department.

The amendments do not require individual amendment to acts; they mainly
address certain problem areas, which have arisen in practice. Because the
Bill does contain some amendments of a more substantial nature, I would
like to use this opportunity to talk about them, particularly those that do
more than just amend various technical provisions.

There are, for instance, some provisions that give effect, in one way or
another, to government’s long-term vision or pave the way for the
implementation of important legislation. The first amendment I would like
to speak about is the amendment of section 9 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act
of 1944, contained in clause 1 one the Bill. This amendment is required in
order to address the ever-increasing occurrence of magistrates who vacate
the office of magistrate and who have part-heard cases to be finalised. I
am heartened by the need for this amendment. Let me expand: The amendment
actually originated because some magistrates have vacated the office of
magistrate on their appointment as judges in our Superior Courts, requiring
statutory sanction for them to dispose of the part-heard cases.

I am heartened, because that shows there is a move towards judges coming up
through the ranks, as it were, and proving that they do not only have to be
appointed from the ranks of the advocacy, as was traditionally the case.

This amendment indicates to me that some old habits do not die hard and
that our vision of a single judiciary is not just a vision on paper. I
welcome this amendment, as it signifies more than meets the eye.

Clauses 2 and 3 of the Bill are intended to ensure that the amendments that
the department promoted in 2003 dealing with the creation of a Chief Master
are taken to their logical conclusion.

Clause 2 consequently extends the definition of Master by stating
unequivocally that a Master of a High Court, who’s appointed by the
Minister, is subject to the control, direction and supervision of the Chief
Master.

Clause 3, in turn, deals, among others, with the relationship between the
Minister and Chief Master. It amends section 2 of the Administration of
Estates Act of 1965 by stating that the Chief Master is the executive
officer of the Master’s offices who will exercise control, direction and
supervision over all the Masters, and is subject to the control, direction
and supervision of the Minister.

What we are trying to achieve is an effective organisational structure in
the component of the department, which is responsible for the Masters of
the High Courts.

Clause 6 of the Bill amends section 13(b) of the Attorneys Act. This
section, as it stands now, requires all attorneys who, for the first time,
intend to practise on their own account or as a partner to complete a
mandatory legal practice management course, approved by the council of the
law society, in the area of jurisdiction.

When consulting the profession on the implementation of this provision, the
profession requested a further amendment to allow for some flexibility in
respect of the attendance requirement. For instance, where a person has
worked in a management capacity in a law firm for years, or has an MBA,
clause 6 gives effect to this request. This amendment will facilitate the
implementation of section 13 (b), which will add value.

I also welcome the amendment brought about by clause 7, which amends
section 4 of the Right of Appearance in Courts Act of 1995. This amendment,
like clause 1, takes the ANC vision, in respect of the legal profession, a
step further, this time by allowing an attorney who meets the requirements
to appear in a High Court, to appear in any court in the Republic - a right
which advocates already enjoy. This will not only enhance access to justice
but will open the legal profession to our lawyers who are crying out for an
opportunity to ply their trade.

Clause 9 of the Bill is significant and is to be welcomed because it will
pave the way for some sections of the Maintenance Act of 1998 which are not
yet in operation to be implemented.

Section 5 of the Maintenance Act provides that the Minister or any officer
of the department, authorised in writing by the Minister, may appoint in
the prescribed manner and on the prescribed conditions one or more persons
as maintenance investigators of a maintenance court to exercise or perform
any power, duty or function conferred on or assigned to maintenance
investigators by or under the Maintenance Act.

The Bill now allows public servants to be appointed as maintenance
investigators as well, obviating the immediate need for regulations to
spell out the conditions and manner of employment. This being the case, the
important provisions of the Maintenance Act dealing with maintenance
investigators can now receive priority attention for purposes of
implementation.

The Bill amends several sections of the Debt Collectors Act. I will
elaborate on some of the more substantial amendments to this Act. It has
been established that some debt collectors refuse to register with the debt
collectors’ council, these debt collectors argue that they provide
administrative functions for an attorney, and that the attorney will then
deal with the processing of the documents and the courts.

In this manner, neither the attorney nor the debt collector is registered
in terms of the Debt Collectors Act and the council has no control over the
activities of such a person, who performs exactly the same functions as the
agent or employee of a debt collector. Thank you. [Time
expired.][Applause.]

Ms F I CHOHAN-KHOTA: Chairperson, hon members, the Judicial Matters
Amendment Bill is traditionally a collage of various amendments that are
required in a host of different Acts to accommodate different aspects in
law, relating in some instances to the clarification of the intention of
the legislature, sometimes providing for new procedures in law, sometimes
even to clean up our laws by removing redundant sections of the law, and
sometimes affecting other technical changes. The Bill before us today
reflects all of these objectives and as such deals with a host of different
legislation. I wish to deal with some of these provisions in my speech
today.

An important amendment affects the Companies Act of 1973. This Act provides
that the Master of the High Court may decline in certain circumstances to
appoint a liquidator chosen by the majority of creditors and may after
certain processes appoint a substitute liquidator. The amendment before us
provides that in this circumstance the Master must now appoint such a
liquidator in accordance with policy determined by the Minister for Justice
and Constitutional Development. The amendment, hopefully, will result in
the more equitable distribution to a range of liquidators and so avoid the
perception of overbriefing, collusion or even corruption on the part of the
Masters’ Offices.

By effecting amendments to the administration of a state’s Act, this Bill
also regulates the concept of a Chief Master, who is to be the executive
officer of the Masters’ Offices and who shall exercise control, direction
and supervision over all Masters of the High Courts. The Chief Master is in
turn subject to the control, direction and supervision of the Minister.

This raised some debate in the committee, because it was suggested by some
that it was an attempt to undermine the existing powers of the Masters.
Part of the problem here is that while our Masters’ Offices have, in the
past, operated with a measure of independence, it is necessary to implement
basic, uniform and transparent practices and policies. The appointment of a
Chief Master in this regard will hopefully allow for a mechanism whereby
such uniform policies and practices may be determined and co-ordinated
without unduly and adversely impacting on existing Masters’ Offices.
Transparency and uniformity and good business practices are essential for a
structure of a department which, some estimates suggest, deal with upward
of R1 billion per year.

Section 5 of the Maintenance Act provides that the Minister may appoint one
or more persons as maintenance investigators of a maintenance court to
exercise or perform any duty or function conferred on it under the
Maintenance Act. Clause 9 has been inserted to allow public servants to be
appointed as maintenance investigators. The lack of maintenance personnel
in our court is a perennial complaint and I am glad that the Minister has
today committed herself and her department to prioritising the appointments
of these individuals.

In terms of the Right of Appearance in Courts Act, certain attorneys were
given the right to appear in the High Court previously by this Parliament.
However, this measure has given rise to many overt and covert practices
designed to undermine the intention of this legislature. Our amendment
today ensures that an attorney who has been given the right to appear in
one High Court may appear in any High Court within the Republic.

The attorneys’ profession had previously suggested that all attorneys who
have been admitted should undergo a further legal practice management
course prior to beginning actual practice as an attorney. The profession
has now requested the power to exempt certain people, such as individuals
who have equivalent qualifications, such as MBAs, or who have appropriate
managerial experience.

We have acceded to their request, bearing in mind the hon Koos Van der
Merwe’s concerns that this management course should be integrated and
incorporated into the board exams that prospective attorneys have to write
and not be a further hurdle for prospective attorneys to overcome. His
comments in this regard are worth noting, and we will certainly be looking
very keenly at how the various law societies implement these provisions.

Quite a few amendments in this Bill are directed at the Debt Collectors
Act. Debt collecting had in the past been fairly unregulated in our country
and many people had been subjected to debt collecting tactics and practices
that infringe on individual privacy and dignity. The establishment of the
Debt Collectors Council has been a marked achievement that has benefited
the debt collector’s profession, as well as the general public. With the
council coming into its own, however, few adjustments to the establishing
Act have now become necessary. It has firstly become necessary, as the
Minister has indicated, to extend the definition of who is a debt
collector.

It must be noted, also, that attorneys are excluded from the Debt
Collectors Act and from the code of conduct of a debt collector. The
committee has now called for a harmonisation of the codes governing
attorneys and debt collectors who are not attorneys, so that a single set
of regulations applies to all who are in the business of debt collecting.
The council of debt collectors is to keep and publish a register of all
registered debt collectors, as well as those whose registration has been
cancelled.

The amendments in the Bill before us regulate publication obligations of
the council, so as to inform the general public about who may or may not
practice as a debt collector. It is noteworthy that the council for debt
collectors has recently embarked on their first prosecutions against
unregistered debt collectors, and we wish them well in this regard. The
council is, through this legislation, given the power to cancel
registration of certain debt collectors upon their own request.

Interest accrued to debt collectors’ trust accounts shall accrue to the
council less any bank charges that the debt collectors may accrue. This is
in line with provisions of other professions running trust accounts, such
as the sheriff’s profession. This provision was necessitated by the fact
that the previous sections that provided that interest accrued in relation
to any amounts collected on behalf of any person be paid to that person,
have proven difficult to implement, as the interest in most cases amounts
to minimal sums and the administrative work involved was time consuming. It
was felt that a once-off payment to the council for debt collectors was
more expedient.

Provision is now made for the council to take interim control of the trust
account of a debt collector immediately, if a debt collector dies, becomes
insolvent and various other aspects which render a debt collector unable to
continue practising. The council will surrender control of the accounts to
a curator bonis appointed by the Master of the relevant High Court, once
such person has been appointed.

Lastly, let me deal with section 10 of the implementation of the Rome
Statute of the International Criminal Court Act of 2002. This Act regulates
proceedings before a competent court after arrest for purposes of
surrender. The amendment in this Act merely clarifies and makes explicit
the intention of the legislature to the effect that upon finding certain
requirements for prosecution and sentencing by the International Criminal
Court and finding that these requirements have been met, a domestic court
must order that such a person be surrendered to the International Criminal
Court and that he or she be committed to prison, pending such surrender.

It is an important obligation on our part and this rather technical
amendment, I believe, will go a long way into us meeting many of our
international obligations in this regard. I do thank members for their
attention. [Applause.]

Mrs S M CAMERER: Madam Chair, this “rommelkas” Bill is a compendium of
amendments to various statutes, none of them particularly sexy, save
perhaps for an amendment to the Promotion of Equality Act to include
intersex, together with sex and gender, as prohibitive grounds for
discrimination. This is reasonable, because intersex is the updated term
for a hermaphrodite and the omission left a lacuna.

None of the amendments is controversial and the DA supports the Bill. We
welcome other amendments, including an amendment to the Magistrates’ Court
Act, to deal with a situation where a magistrate vacates office but still
has partly heard matters; an amendment to the Companies Act to bring it
into line with other legislation regarding the appointment of liquidators
and judicial managers; an amendment to the Attorneys Act, which was
requested by the legal profession requiring attorneys practising on their
own account for the first time to complete a legal practice management
course, which is an excellent development; an amendment to the Right of
Appearance in Courts Act, allowing any attorney who has been granted the
right of appearance in the High Court to appear in any court in the
Republic, which, as the Minister has indicated, is overdue.

There are also several amendments to the Debt Collectors Act requested by
the Debt Collectors Council and protecting the public from irregular
practices in the debt collecting industry and which all appear to be
improvements to the Act, and there are sensible technical and procedural
amendments to other Acts.

I would like to highlight an amendment to the problematic Maintenance Act,
which has suffered as a result of failure to implement properly key aspects
of this legislation. This new Act, which, on paper, was a big improvement
on the previous law, was launched with much fanfare as a new deal for the
literally millions of women in our country who struggle to get maintenance
for their children, and sometimes themselves, from errant fathers and
partners.

The key to its success was to be the appointment of maintenance
investigators at all main court centres. The perennial core difficulty with
getting maintenance was therefore recognised, namely tracing these men –
and it is nearly always men. As I know from the endless stream of letters I
receive from angry and despairing women, the capacity of our courts to
trace and serve process on these men is abysmally low. Even when the woman
and her family know exactly where the man works or resides, and can tell
the court, the court is often ineffectual in reeling him in.

For the first five years after the Act was passed, no investigators were
appointed. Eventually, after many appeals from the DA, other opposition
parties and civil society, in 2004, funds from the Director-General’s
budget were allocated for the appointment of a few investigators on a pilot
project basis. The R35 million needed for a countrywide rollout was not
budgeted for. If this measure to designate officials of the courts in
general or maintenance courts in particular to act as maintenance
investigators is intended to fill this gap in the successful functioning of
this legislation, it is indeed to be welcomed.

As the Minister is aware, our maintenance courts are the busiest courts in
the country, and I would like to appeal to the Minister to implement this
measure as soon as possible so that every maintenance court will have a
competent maintenance investigator assisting with this task. The failure of
the maintenance courts to deliver justice to so many women legitimately
seeking maintenance for their children is the major criticism levelled by
women against our justice system. The women of South Africa deserve better.
Thank you. [Applause.]

Mnr L K JOUBERT: Geagte Voorsitter, ons wysig met hierdie
wysigingswetsontwerp 11 verskillende wette. Ons hoofsweep verwys na hierdie
tipe wetgewing as rommelkaswetgewing. [Chairperson, with this amendment
Bill we will amend 11 different Acts. Our Chief Whip describes this type of
legislation as an omnibus Act.]

The English term of “omnibus legislation” does not quite convey the same
meaning. However, the majority of the amendments are of a technical nature
and would not have been necessary had we applied our minds properly in the
first place.

The amendment to the Right of Appearance in Courts Act was necessitated by
a judgment that completely misinterpreted the intention of the original
Act. The time has come that the deliberations in committees, and especially
the Minister’s address in the Second Reading debate, be given the weight it
deserves in the interpretation of statutes. That, and not a theoretical
exercise, surely more accurately indicates the true intention of the
legislator.

As far as the Attorneys Act is concerned, the provision for exemption from
the attendance of a legal practice management course is again, I think, the
result of not applying our minds properly when the original amendment was
passed. Attorneys write a comprehensive entry exam before being admitted.
Surely, the appropriate thing is that this should be part of the entry exam
and not a post facto requirement. By requiring further qualifications after
admission is like allowing a couple to marry, but not to conceive offspring
without the church’s consent. Kodwa Sihlalo siyavuma.[But we agree, Chair.]

Die HUISVOORSITTER (Me C-S Botha): Baie dankie, agb lid, dat u in twee
minute met sulke wetgewing kon klaarspeel! Die agb Swart, wat net één
minuut het vir hierdie wetgewing, is volgende. [Thank you, hon member, for
disposing of such legislation in two minutes! The hon Swart, who only has
one minute for this legislation, is next.]

Mr S N SWART: Chairperson, section 299 of the Criminal Procedure Act
entitles a victim of crime to have a say when an accused is considered for
parole or correctional supervision, and the amendment to that Act enables
the identity and whereabouts of the complainant to be kept confidential,
and also provides a mechanism for informing the complainant of his or her
rights, and clearly, this the ACDP supports.

We also support the views contained in the report that the issue of
confidentiality should be addressed in the Bill itself and not in
directives, and we think that that is something that the department should
look at.

As far as amendments to the debt collecting legislation is concerned, we
also agree with the amendments and that the department should investigate
the desirability of a single statute covering all aspects of debt
collection. Having looked at the Bill, we support all the provisions, we’re
pleased to say, and I don’t want to repeat what all the other speakers have
said, suffice to say that the ACDP will vote in favour of this Bill. Thank
you very much. One minute gone! [Laughter.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms C-S Botha): Quite an achievement! Hon Pheko, I’ll
give you an extra minute if you want.

Dr S E M PHEKO: Well, with my one minute, Madam Chair, I simply want to say
that times have moved since 1944 and there have been radical changes. It is
therefore logical that the Magistrates’ Courts Act of 1944 must be amended.
[Interjections.] The Judicial Matters Amendment Bill is therefore to
provide for the disposal of part of cases by permanently appointed
magistrates who vacate the office of magistrate.

This Bill is to bring changes also to the Administration of Estates Act of
1965 and many other Acts from 1973 to 2000. This includes the
implementation of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court Act
of 2002. Its purpose is to clarify the provision regarding the surrender of
a person to the International Criminal Court.

Section 1 of the Administration of Estates Act of 1965 is being amended by
the substitution for the definition of “Master”. “Master” will now mean
Master, Deputy Master or Assistant Master or a High Court appointed under
section 2. The PAC supports this Bill.

Since I’ve been given an extra minute, I want to say to you to love Azania.
You love Azania, long live Azania! One day we’ll give you a beautiful poem
about Azania. I just want to say that we should avoid polemics in this
Parliament, because it is a very cheap commodity and we can specialise in
it too when people bring polemics here. Let us be mature members of
Parliament who address issues, not personalities. [Interjections.] Izwe
lethu! Izwe lethu! [Our country! Our country!] Viva Azania, viva!
[Interjections.]

Mr R B BHOOLA: Madam Chairperson, the MF supports a number of Acts that
this Bill serves to amend and that saves the House from the tedious task of
dealing with each amended Act individually. Amendments made to section 9 of
the Magistrates’ Courts Act, Act 32 of 1944, with regard to proceedings are
supported. Appointments made in accordance with the Administration of
Estates Act of 1965 that are amended are accepted and the amendments to
section 276 of the Criminal Procedure Act of 1977 are justified.

The MF gladly supports amendments regarding maintenance investigators of
section 5 of the Maintenance Act of 1998. Provisions made to sections 1,
12, 16 and 20 of the Debt Collectors Act of 1998 are also supported. The
MF, in view of all the amended Acts, voices its support for the Judicial
Matters Amendment Bill. I thank you.

Mr L T LANDERS: Chairperson, clause 1 of this Bill seeks to correct a
serious anomaly in our law, whereby magistrates who are appointed as judges
must or can now dispose of their partly heard cases. A case in point is the
example of a magistrate in KwaZulu-Natal who recently, in the midst of a
long and complicated trial involving some 100 witnesses, was appointed to
be a judge. In terms of the amendment before us, that magistrate can come
back and dispose of the matter before him.

The second point, which I want to make in this particular debate, is the
amendment to the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act, Act 3 of 2000.
The ANC never wanted the code of good practice, which the Minister will now
bring about, to be part of our law, but rather to be a guide, which would
assist administrators to make their administrative decisions. We’re pleased
to note that the amendments provided for in this Bill follow that position
of the ANC.

With those few words, I also support the Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Chair, I think the
House will agree with me that there is overwhelming support, and I thank
the members for the support. We note, of course, some of the concerns that
have been mentioned around maintenance, especially the need to speedily
implement. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

       CONSIDERATION OF REPORTS OF PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON JUSTICE AND
 CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT – MAGISTRATES R AMEER AND M K CHAUKE AND SENIOR
                   MAGISTRATES M S MAKAMU AND M J S NHLEKO

Ms F I CHOHAN-KHOTA: Chairperson, members, today we consider four reports
in terms of the Magistrates Act, Act 90 of 1993, relating to the
provisional suspensions of magistrates R Ameer, additional magistrate of
Pinetown; M J S Nhleko, senior magistrate at Lusikisiki; M S Makamu, senior
magistrate at Benoni and M K Chauke, additional magistrate at Pretoria.

Section 13(3)(a)(i) of the Magistrates Act, Act 90 of 1993, which was
amended in 2003, reads as follows:

    The Minister, on the advice of the Commission, may provisionally suspend
    a magistrate from office if –


      the Commission, after affording the magistrate a reasonable
      opportunity to be heard regarding the desirability of such provisional
      suspension, is   satisfied that reliable evidence exists indicating
      that an allegation against that magistrate
      is of such a serious nature as to make it inappropriate for
      the magistrate to perform the functions of a magistrate while
      the allegation is being investigated . . .


As such, it is the prerogative of the Minister for Justice and
Constitutional Development to provisionally suspend a member of the
magistrates’ profession from office. Section 13(3)(b) reads in part as
follows:

    A report in which the provisional suspension . . . of a magistrate and
    the reasons therefore are made known, must be tabled in Parliament by
    the Minister within seven days of such suspension . . .


Accordingly, and on 13 April 2005, in each of these cases the Minister for
Justice and Constitutional Development tabled in Parliament separate
reports in terms of section 13(3)(b)

Section 13(3)(c) and (d) of the Magistrates Act read together as follows:
    Parliament must, as soon as it is reasonably possible, pass a resolution
    as to whether or not the provisional suspension of the magistrate is
    confirmed. If Parliament passes a resolution as contemplated in
    paragraph (c) that the provisional suspension is not confirmed, the
    suspension lapses.


The reports were referred to the Portfolio Committee on Justice and
Constitutional Development for consideration. As indicated a few weeks ago,
when the House approved the removal of certain magistrates from office, the
committee, which was sitting behind closed doors, enquired into procedural
as well as substantive matters prior to making any recommendations to this
House.

Upon enquiry by the committee, it was established that in all four of these
cases, the magistrates concerned were in fact suspended on a date prior to
the Minister’s decision on 13 April 2005. Mr R Ameer, magistrate, was
suspended by the Magistrates Commission on 16 August 2004; Mr M J S Nhleko,
magistrate, was suspended by the Magistrates Commission on 3 December 2004;
Mr M S Makamu, magistrate, was suspended by the Magistrates Commission on 3
August 2004 and Mr M K Chauke, magistrate, was suspended by the
Magistrates’ Commission on 6 October 2004.

It appears that the Magistrates Commission acted in these matters in terms
of powers afforded to it prior to the 2003 amendment of the Magistrates Act
and accordingly erred in its actions. The committee
considered the possibility of condoning the action of the Magistrates
Commission. However, it decided that this would be legally tenuous and in
any event would not have complied with the requirement of section 13(3)(e)
of the Magistrates Act, which requires that an enquiry commence within 60
days of a provisional suspension.

Accordingly the Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional
Development, having considered the four reports, is of the opinion that the
procedures prescribed by the Magistrates Act of 1993 were not complied
with, and accordingly recommends that the House resolves not to confirm the
provisional suspensions of Mr R Ameer, Mr M J S Nhleko, Mr M S Makamu and
Mr M K Chauke.

We recommend further that the House urge the Magistrates Commission to
urgently finalise the disciplinary enquiries in these matters in order to
bring them to finality. I thank you.

There was no debate.

Question put: That the recommendations of the committee be adopted, namely
that the provisional suspensions of the magistrates in question not be
confirmed by the House.

Question agreed to.

Provisional suspensions of Magistrate R Ameer, Magistrate M K Chauke,
Senior Magistrate M S Makamu and Senior Magistrate M J S Nhleko accordingly
not confirmed by the House.

  Consideration of request for approval by Parliament of agreement between
  the Republic of South Africa and THE Republic of Turkey for the Avoidance
   of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to
                      Taxes on Income and Capital Gains

  Consideration of request for approval by Parliament of Convention between
  the Government of the republic of South Africa and the Government of the
  Republic of Gabon for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention
              of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income

  Consideration of request for approval by Parliament of Convention between
  the Government of the republic of South Africa and the Government of the
  Republic of Ghana for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention
     of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income AND CAPITAL GAINS

  Consideration of request for approval by Parliament of Convention between
  the Government of the republic of South Africa and the Government of the
  DEMOCRATIC Republic of CONGO for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the
        Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms C-S Botha): Before I call the hon Davies to
introduce the report of the committee, I would like to take this
opportunity for this House to congratulate him on his appointment as Deputy
Minister of Trade and Industry – a position I am sure he will fill with
skill and dedication. [Applause.]

Dr R H DAVIES: Thank you, Madam Chair and colleagues, for your good wishes.
I am looking forward to new challenges and this is my last act as
Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Finance. I would also like to
take this opportunity to thank all the colleagues in the Portfolio
Committee on Finance for all the co-operation and for the wonderful working
relationships that we have had in the past. [Applause.]

The conventions or agreements for the avoidance of the double taxation and
the prevention of fiscal evasion have been entered into since 1994 with a
relatively long list of countries from all parts of the world. Generally
they assist in the promotion of economic interaction by assuring that
persons from one country or jurisdiction who undertake economic activity in
the other contracting party will not be subject to tax in both
jurisdictions. They also provide for co-operation between the taxation
authorities of both countries to co-operate against fiscal evasion.

There are two standard models or formats that have governed these kinds of
agreements across the world: one was drawn up by the UN and the other by
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

The agreements that South Africa has been party to have generally followed
the format of the OECD. However, there are always specific variations
depending on the specific circumstances in the countries with whom we are
negotiating. These variations are generally very small but do reflect
specific circumstances in other countries.

Today we are asking the House to approve four such agreements: The first
with the Republic of Turkey, and then three with African countries namely
with the Republic of Gabon, the Republic of Ghana, and the Democratic
Republic of Congo.

The formats of all of these are very much standard agreements. There are
very small variations and the portfolio committee was satisfied with these.
We have pleasure in commending them to the House and look forward to the
support of the House for the approval of these double taxation agreements.
Thank you, Chair. [Applause.]

Agreed to.

   CONSIDERATION OF REQUEST FOR APPROVAL BY PARLIAMENT OF ACCESSION TO THE
    CONVENTION FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF UNLAWFUL ACTS AGAINST THE SAFETY OF
   MARITIME NAVIGATION AND TO THE PROTOCOL FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF UNLAWFUL
 ACTS AGAINST THE SAFETY OF FIXED PLATFORMS LOCATED ON THE CONTINENTAL SHELF


Mr J P CRONIN: Thank you, Chairperson. When I see something that reads
“suppression of”, it makes me very nervous but fortunately this is not a
Suppression of Communism Act. Unfortunately, it is not the Suppression of
Capitalism Act yet but we will get there. [Interjections.] Yes, indeed.

What we have got in front of us today is one international convention and
one protocol. The Convention reads “the suppression of unlawful acts
against the safety of maritime navigation”, basically referring to an
international convention dealing with unlawful acts directed at shipping.
The second protocol, which was related to that, deals with unlawful acts
directed at what is called fixed platforms on the continental shelves. I
think it refers to things like oil leaks and the like.

This convention and this protocol were adopted under the auspices of the
International Maritime Organisation, which is part of the UN family. They
are actually quite old. They were adopted in 1988 in Rome but, of course,
apartheid South Africa at that stage was not participating in the UN family
of organisations, including the International Maritime Organisation.

However, it is very much in our interest as a country to take these kinds
of conventions quite seriously. South Africa has a very long coastline
indeed. Our economy is very dependent on exports and imports, more than 90%
of which are sea borne. We also have very extensive maritime
responsibilities in terms of rescue and surveillance, and so forth. Those
responsibilities stretch far into the South Atlantic Ocean, halfway to
Latin America, halfway to Australia in the case of the Indian Ocean, down
to the Antarctic Ocean. And we also have many responsibilities up our east
and west coast in regard to our neighbouring countries.

In October, the International Maritime Organisation will be convening once
more to consider and to update the convention and the protocol. Therefore,
it’s very important that, out of national interest, South Africa takes an
active part in the proceedings of the IMO in October in London. [Applause.]
That was not applause for the suggestion that we should be active in
participating in London.

The committee has had a close look at the convention and the protocol; the
State Law Advisors advised us that there is nothing in the protocol and in
the convention that in any way contravenes our domestic law. I also had a
close look to see if there is anything that might affect the rights of
workers on ships and on oil leaks and, as far as I could see, there was
nothing of that kind.

Therefore, as a committee we unanimously recommend that Parliament endorses
the proposal that South Africa should accede to this convention and to this
protocol. Thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

There was no debate.

Agreed to.
