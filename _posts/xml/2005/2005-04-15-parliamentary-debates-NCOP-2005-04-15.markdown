                               (Policy debate)

Vote No 18 – Social Development:

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Chairperson, 26 years and 11  days  ago,
South Africa witnessed the hanging of the freedom fighter Solomon  Mahlangu.
On that fatal day Mahlangu left us with  a  message  that  encapsulated  his
love for his people  and  his  commitment  to  the  promotion  of  a  caring
society. This commitment is built into our democratic Constitution,  and  it
is a reaffirmation of this commitment that Budget Vote 18 places  people  at
the centre of the Department of Social Development’s efforts.

I  would  like  to  acknowledge  the  ongoing  work  that  this  House   has
undertaken, especially through projects such as  taking  Parliament  to  the
people.  This  work  enhances  public  participation,  deepens  our   social
transformation agenda, promotes  co-operative  governance  and  reaffirms  a
commitment to the promotion of a caring society. Last week the  Ministry  of
Social Development took a major step  forward  in  the  advancement  of  the
spirit  of  co-operative  governance  by  entering  into  a  memorandum   of
understanding on the administration  of  social  assistance  with  MECs,  as
contemplated by the SA Social Security Agency Act.

The memorandum of understanding will enhance the management of the  delivery
of social grants in the transition to the full operation of  the  SA  Social
Security Agency in the year 2007. We have set aside close  to  R200  million
over the MTEF period to ensure the effective  and  efficient  management  of
the funds allocated for social grants over the MTEF period.

The caring system of social  protection  that  we  are  building  must  also
restore the dignity of all our people. Those efforts  will  be  complemented
by the full operation of the Inspectorate for Social Security.  We  will  be
co-operating with all  national  and  provincial  law-enforcement  agencies,
including the SAPS and the Special Investigation Unit, so as to  ensure  the
establishment of the inspectorate by March 2006.

The social sector continues  to  pursue  the  objective  of  implementing  a
caring and integrated system of social  protection,  primarily  through  the
three pillars of our system of comprehensive social security. To  this  end,
we will in the coming year  extend  coverage  to  an  additional  2  million
children under the age of 14 years.  This  will  result  in  a  total  of  7
million children receiving the child support grant.

We have also embarked on a concerted action to improve access to the  foster
care grant. This takes into account the definition of a  family  as  adopted
by the African Union, and the impact that HIV/Aids is  having  on  children.
The increase in the rand amounts of social grants is intended to  cater  for
the negative consequences of inflation, and to meet the needs  of  the  poor
and vulnerable households.

Budget Vote 18 is a reaffirmation of our commitment  to  putting  people  at
the centre of our development efforts. To adequately provide  for  poor  and
vulnerable households, particularly those that are headed  by  children,  we
must have an appropriate legislative  and  regulatory  framework  that  both
informs our strategic and problematic outlook and enables us to promote  the
rights of these children. To this end, we ought to finalise the  Child  Care
Act in this year.

I would like to repeat my concern and frustration at the  fact  the  passage
of the Children’s Bill in Parliament has been  delayed  for  years  -  about
seven years - because of protracted consultation with  NGOs.  Various  well-
intentioned children’s rights advocacy groups,  lobbying  for  inclusion  of
this or that particular element in the Bill  in  order  to  construct  a  no
expenses spared, be-all, end-all piece of legislation,  have  been  reacting
as if the delay in passing the Children’s Bill was of no consequence.

This is untrue;  the  delay  is  a  hindrance  in  providing  assistance  to
orphaned children  and  child-headed  families.  The  promulgation  of  this
important piece of legislation will enable  my  department  to  enhance  its
contribution to the Expanded Public Works Programme, through  the  provision
of  early  childhood  development  facilities.  It  will  also  enhance  the
implementation of the policy  framework  and  the  strategic  plan  for  the
prevention and management of child abuse.

Already  child  protection  registers  have  been  implemented  in  all  the
provinces. The implementation of these  registers  requires  a  vibrant  and
vigilant civil society sector, that can assist us in  not  only  identifying
alleged abusers, but  also  in  advancing  the  broader  social  development
agenda. With this in mind, we have undertaken a study on the impact  of  the
Non-Profit Organisations Act of  1997,  and  the  extent  to  which  it  has
created an enabling environment for  nonprofit  organisations.  Despite  the
fact that we know that these organisations run into hundreds  of  thousands,
sadly by March 2005 only twenty-nine organisations had  registered  for  the
NPO status.

Our records show that during this period  just  over  2  000  not-for-profit
organisations deregistered and 22 dissolved. The study on the impact of  the
NPOs notes the inadequacy of the financial  resources  allocated  today  for
the implementation of  the  Act,  when  compared  to  the  size,  scope  and
vibrancy of the NPO sector on the one hand, and the complexity  of  the  NPO
Act on the other. The report suggests that the actual benefits  accruing  to
community-based organisations from NPO registration have  been  substantial,
and that these organisations have a limited capacity  to  manage  their  own
coffers.

Although there is an overall acknowledgement that the  enabling  environment
for the sector has improved, the organisations that have tended  to  benefit
are the large ones, and those that are urban- based. This situation poses  a
threat to our efforts to  address  issues  of  social  integration  and  the
sustaining acceptable standards across the  board  and  across  the  sector.
Working together with the South African  NGOs  coalition,  Sangoco  and  the
Southern African Grant Makers Association and other nonprofit  networks,  we
will be exploring ways of establishing new strategic partnerships  with  all
stakeholders  and  role-players  in  the  NPO  sector,  who  can  assist  in
implementing sustainable interventions.

The work being done to improve the implementation capacity of  the  National
Development Agency will assist in  this  regard.  The  NDA’s  five  regional
offices in Polokwane, Mafikeng, Bloemfontein, Durban  and  Johannesburg  are
now in operation and under the guidance of the  chairperson,  Bishop  Melosi
Mpumlwana. The board must ensure that the NDA assumes its mandated  position
as a fulcrum for the partnership between the NGO sector and government.

It should be noted that the NPO sector and community-based organisations  in
particular, will benefit from the revamp of the policy of  financial  awards
to the sector. I’m pleased to inform this House  that  Minmec  approved  the
new policy of financial awards for the service providers and the  department
will soon  implement  this  policy  after  a  final  consultation  with  the
treasury and the other sector minders.

In December last year we offered indemnity to all those illegally  accessing
social grants. I’m pleased to announce  that  over  76  000  applicants  are
presently being processed by our national and provincial staff. Let me  once
again utilise this  opportunity  to  express  government’s  appreciation  to
those honest people that have  decided  that  they  will  not  be  party  to
depriving poor families of assistance. These people  are  demonstrating  the
commitment to the promotion of a caring and loving society.  Their  honesty,
commitment and actions could translate into savings of over  R33  million  a
month.

In order to root out all fraud  and  corruption  the  Department  of  Social
Development has set aside R57,9 million  and  entered  into  a  co-operation
agreement with a special investigation unit. Over  the  next  18  months  we
will train and utilise 200 dedicated staff in the fight  against  fraud  and
corruption, while interrogating the details of each and every one of  the  9
million beneficiaries of our social grants.

As part of the terms of this agreement and in collaboration with  other  law
enforcement agencies, including the SA Police Service and the Scorpions,  we
have already begun arresting and prosecuting public servants,  professionals
and syndicates who have been systematically robbing  our  system  of  social
assistance. We are already in possession of the names of over 41 000  public
servants who are being or will  be  investigated.  Our  work  began  in  the
Eastern Cape as a result of the recommendation of the  Presidential  special
task team on fraud and corruption in the Eastern Cape,  which  was  deployed
in that province in the year 2002.

We will now prioritise the integrity  of  the  disability  foster  care  and
child support grants in Mpumalanga, Limpopo, North West,  KwaZulu-Natal  and
Gauteng provinces. Let me take this opportunity to express my  gratitude  to
MECs  responsible  for  social  development,  who   have   spearheaded   the
verification processes  in  the  provinces,  which  started  with  temporary
disability grants. Through their effort we uncovered 121  000  beneficiaries
whose grants had lapsed since October 2004, thus  saving  us  an  excess  of
R500 million. We expect  that  provinces  will  diligently  continue  on  an
ongoing basis with the work of reviewing grants  to  stop  leakages  in  the
system.

In  addition  to  the  reviews  of  temporary  disabilities  we  have   also
successfully halted over 19 000 cases of  potential  fraud.  For  the  North
West province alone, this has meant  a  saving  of  R154  million,  for  the
Eastern Cape it’s R150 million and in Gauteng R105  million  per  annum.  We
are convinced that if the other provinces increase their capacity, they  too
will yield  similar  results.  Central  to  the  success  of  a  viable  and
sustainable  social  protection  system  is  its  ability  to  enable  those
functioning on the periphery of the second  economy  to  take  advantage  of
opportunities  in  the  first  economy,  whilst  promoting  less  and   less
dependence on the state.

It is in pursuit of this strategic objective  that  we  have  redefined  our
food emergency scheme, so that it  forms  an  integral  part  of  our  broad
social relief policies. All the work  that  is  done  by  the  national  and
provincial departments of social development is  focused  on  ensuring  that
our country achieves the millennium development goals in the context of  the
new partnership for Africa.
I would like to underline the fact that  provincial  departments  of  social
development also have responsibility to implement Nepad-  related  projects.
The realisation of the rights of all vulnerable people and  the  advancement
of the social development agenda  to  restore  the  dignity  of  our  people
requires  collective  effort.  To  this  end,  we  will  not  only  continue
fostering intergovernmental  co-operation,  but  we  will  also  enlist  the
support of all development-orientated agencies and organisations.

The NCOP has an important role to play in ensuring that our  people  are  at
the centre of social development  efforts.  There  are  a  number  of  other
important aspects of Budget Vote 18 that I  have  not  highlighted  in  this
speech. The Deputy Minister, who has been assigned a broad welfare  services
portfolio, including drug and substance abuse, will address these and  other
important changes in her speech.

I’m sure the hon delegates of the NCOP will agree with us that  the  support
is  an  indication  that  we  will  never  forget  and  always  cherish  the
commitment to a caring society. For the past 25 years we stood  for  and  we
continue to communicate a message that encapsulates our love of our  people,
and our country’s commitment to the promotion of  a  caring  society.  Thank
you. [Applause.]

Ms J MASILO: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon Deputy Minister, special
delegates and members of the House, senior officials of the department, the
presentation of the debate on the Budget Vote for Social Development is
always an occasion which this committee and, indeed, all the provincial
standing portfolio committees are always very responsive to. This year’s
budget is particularly important to provinces in view of the huge
structural and administrative changes brought about by the passage of the
SA Social Security Agency Act, Sassa, and the Social Assistance Act.

The aged, the orphaned, disabled persons and sick shall be cared for by the
state, according to the Freedom Charter. That is why we find ourselves in
this committee, especially since the 50th anniversary of the Freedom
Charter, becoming more sensitive to its policy framework, which declares
that all families shall be brought up in comfort and security and that the
aged, orphans, disabled persons and the sick shall be cared for by the
state.

These are principles still guiding us as the ANC-led government. We need to
continually ensure that these principles are still informing us as we
develop our policies. Between the 1999-2000 and 2002-03 financial years,
the Social Development budget grew from R19,4 billion to R31,2 billion.
This financial year it is R56,549 billion, which is a sign of commitment
from our government to fighting poverty. Our government has taken practical
steps to reform the department, and the whole system of social services,
through legislation like the Children’s Bill, the Older Persons Bill and
child care legislation.
The payment of social grants has resulted in the number of people
benefiting from social grants to increase dramatically from 2,6 million in
1994 to over 7,7 million by February 2004, at a total cost of R34,8 billion
per annum.

With regard to older persons, the department has succeeded in promoting the
rights of older persons. The halt-abuse helpline has been given financial
support. This is a toll-free number to facilitate the reporting of the
abuse of older persons and to provide a comprehensive range of services to
the elderly.

The frail care policy has been developed and currently there is
consultation with the stakeholders. It provides for the care of frail older
persons in the communities, as well as those in residential facilities. So,
while provinces have throughout their deliberations on the Older Persons
Bill supported the policy guidelines contained in the Bill, there has been
concern expressed that the requirements might not be affordable as
contained in the Bill. We are, however, working on it collectively to
address the problem.

A child-care register has been installed in seven provinces, and the
process of upgrading and installing the database in all provinces is
ongoing. The draft Policy Framework and Strategy on Child Abuse, Neglect
and Expectation has been completed and is going through the approval
process for its implementation in this current financial year.

Early childhood guidelines are also in the process of being finalised, and
are to be implemented in the current financial year. The department, in
collaboration with the Departments of Education and Health, has
participated in developing a draft integrated early childhood development
strategy. The strategy is planned to facilitate the explanation of ECD
services, including the implementation of the Expanded Public Works
Programmes.

There are poverty relief programmes which help communities to undertake
development for themselves and target women, volunteering youth, the
elderly and people with disabilities. Since 1997 the department has
administered more than R563 million, providing support for over 3 600
community-based projects, NGOs and CBOs.

In relation to the peoples’ contract, the fight against crime and
corruption has always been a task that has bedevilled the Department of
Social Development. Opportunistic, corrupt officials and syndicates have
hampered our delivery of the peoples’ contract. It is, therefore, with an
enormous amount of satisfaction that we see that corrupt officials within
the department have already been arrested in the Eastern Cape and that
arrests in other provinces will follow soon. We applaud the Minister for
this creative method of combating corruption and are heartened by the 76
000 people who came forward as a result.

We went on oversight visits, one in Gauteng and the second in North West.
Carter’s Day Care Centre, in Gauteng, which was established in 1999,
received provincial funding in 2002-03 and 2003-04. They are doing a great
deal of good work for orphans. We also visited Sedibeng District
Municipality in Gauteng. There are numerous and vital NGOs that have been
funded by government. Some of these NGOs’ area of focus is the prevention
and protection of children and families, homes for the elderly, children’s
homes and one home for the disabled, among others, with all of them doing
very good work for the community.

We also wish to commend the entire department in Gauteng for implementing
the Bana Pele Rehabilitation Programme for children. This programme was
launched in November 2004. It provides a package of services to homeless
children such as education, health, identity documents and social services.
It is also important that this House acknowledges and appreciates that the
Bana Pele Rehabilitation Programme is the first of its kind in the country.

In the North West in the Moses Kotane Local Municipality we visited some
paypoints where we discovered that there are improvements. The officials at
the paypoints have cellular phones and laptops for communication, all of
which were budgeted for by the communications department. More than 10 000
chairs have been distributed to different areas, as per identified need. In
addition, tents have been provided where there were no structures. I want
to just mention that R12 million was tendered to address the need for a
shelter in the North West. So we believe that the department is doing good
work in meeting the challenges of the communities.

At Saulspoort paypoint in Moruleng tribal office in North West, there was
evidence of the good work that was done by the department. For example,
they had adequate shading and chairs and the paypoint was fenced. We also
checked and discovered that only the beneficiaries were within the boundary
of the facility, armed guards were visible, and there were no hawkers in
the yards. There were several taps and mobile toilets for the needs of the
beneficiaries. We further wish to acknowledge the reopening of Paballo
Place of Safety for the homeless in Ga-Rankuwa after the intervention of
the select committee. This is one of the other facilities that offer
rehabilitation for children.

In conclusion, our goal is to create a South Africa in which we can enjoy a
good quality life, a human rights culture and freedom of access to
opportunities. We see visible signs of all of these and many other freedoms
and rights. We are conscious that our peoples’ contract to trade, work and
fight poverty is ongoing. We are, however, confident of our successes and
together we can and we will create a better life for all. Ke a leboga.
[Thank you.] [Applause.]
Ms N M MADLALA-MAGUBANE: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon Deputy Minister,
MECs present here, special delegates, distinguished guests, ladies and
gentlemen, the Department of Social Development was allocated R76,18
million in the 2004-05 financial year, and this was 2% of the special
allocation for HIV/Aids. The whole amount was spent and that constitutes
100%. I would like to congratulate the department for good spending
regarding this special project.

I must mention that Gauteng and Western Cape managed to spend 100% of their
full amounts. The special project has three programmes which focus on the
home and community-based care, co-ordination action for children affected
by HIV/Aids, youth and gender. The home-based care is faced with the
challenge of increasing the number of communities, families and individuals
who access services provided through this programme.

I would like to mention that a total number of 116 811 orphans and 5 041
children living in child-headed households have been identified and are
receiving appropriate care and support services. Visits and interventions
to child-headed households are made through which counselling and
psychosocial support services are rendered. School uniforms were
distributed to the children orphaned and made vulnerable by HIV/Aids.

Families who are identified as child-headed are encouraged by the
department to remain in the communities rather than being placed in
residential care. Why? It is because it’s important that they be integrated
within the society as a whole.

The department supports the LoveLife Groundbreaker project by taking
cognisance of three strategies for further HIV prevention, care and
support. The focus is on 20% of young marginalised groupings within the
farm areas and informal settlements. One of the challenges faced by the
department is to strengthen partnership with the implementation agencies
such as NGOs and CBOs. They are at present doing tremendous work by
continuing to care for those affected and infected by HIV/Aids. They need
to be commended.

The more exciting news in the 2005-06 financial year is that there is a
massively increased budget for the HIV and Aids subprogramme, which caters
for the provision of support and care services to individuals and
households infected and affected by HIV/Aids. Nominal allocation for the
subprogramme has increased from R79 million in the 2004-05 financial year
to R1 106 million in the 2005-06 financial year. Such an increase is in
line with the fact that the social, community development and home-based
care conditional grants improved spending from 35,6% in 2000-01 financial
year to 95% in 2003-04.

Through its effort the Department of Social Development successfully
reached a total number of approximately 9,3 million beneficiaries during
the 2004-05 financial year. This amounts to approximately R3,6 billion and
the overall percentage increase between the financial years is 18,85%. The
increase in child support grant payments between the two financial years,
2002-03 and 2003-04, is 31,04%. In Gauteng, the smart province, growth is
29,92%.

I would like to commend the Department of Social Development for its great
effort in uprooting corruption and maladministration in the social grant
administration system. The ANC-led government supports and is behind the
department in its success in uprooting such corruption. The department
should continue its work in eliminating all forms of corruption such as
receiving social benefits in respect of the deceased and persons who do not
qualify for such benefits. It should also look at the conduct of government
officials responsible for the administration or payment of social benefits,
which has resulted in losses and lack of control over payment of moneys
allocated for payments of social benefits.

The department recently offered an indemnity to the people of South Africa
who were receiving social grants fraudulently to come out and stop the
practice immediately. More than 76 000 people came forward and confessed to
the department under the amnesty. The amnesty will save the department
approximately R300 million a year and that will be ploughed back into
supporting the poorest of the poor. We wish the department good luck in
uprooting all the existing criminals and making sure that they face the
full wrath of the law.

Regarding the registration campaign, the department successfully reached a
total number of 9 285 million beneficiaries in 2004-05. This amounts to
R3,6 billion and it constitutes 18,85% growth. Gauteng has increased its
growth to 29,92%.

I would like to say that the ANC-led government is guided by the document
that was adopted in 1955 at Kliptown. That document spells out clearly that
all shall enjoy equal human rights. I therefore urge the public
representatives in this Council to go out and do their constituency work by
conducting audits on the realisation of socio-economic rights within each
community and develop strategies for ensuring that these rights are
progressively achieved.

As parliamentarians, we need to mobilise communities in the fight against
corruption, and work to strengthen the partnership between communities and
the law-enforcement agencies. Thank you very much, Chairperson. [Applause.]

Mr G H AKHARWARAY (Northern Cape): Hon Chairperson, Minister, Deputy
Minister, hon delegates of this House, thank you for the opportunity to
participate in this debate. Let me start off by thanking and congratulating
the Minister on his instructive speech. In the provinces, hon Minister, we
strive to adhere to national policy guidelines and to implement them;
although it is not always easy in a province like the Northern Cape that is
faced with many peculiar conditions and hence many additional challenges.
Despite enormous progress made in the last decade, the Northern Cape is
still a province that is characterised by an unacceptably high rate of
unemployment – with an unemployment rate of 26%. This government, at
whichever level, is committed to addressing poverty and its attendant socio-
economic problems. We cannot fail our people who must of necessity ensure
that, as the new democratic government, we adhere to the principles as
enshrined in the Freedom Charter adopted 50 years ago in Kliptown –
incidentally, my birthplace.

Our mandate is to ensure that poverty-stricken people and other vulnerable
groups are not left destitute, but that a comprehensive social protection
programme is put in place, hence the development of the 10-point plan of
the Department of Social Development. In the Northern Cape, one of our
biggest challenges, which has also been the focus of much media attention
over the last few years, is that of substance abuse. The scourge of drug
and alcohol abuse is one that gives rise to numerous social evils - child
abuse, domestic violence and abuse of the elderly are but some of the more
apparent consequences.

Research done by the department towards the end of last year in the
Northern Cape revealed that substance abusers are as young as 10 years old.
It also revealed that alcohol was too readily available and that there was
a clear correlation between unemployment and substance abuse. These are but
some of the ills that impact negatively on the family structure.
Families are the backbone of any society. Everything we seek to achieve as
an ANC-led government is premised on the basis of a strong family and a
community structure. A society where people can live with dignity and self-
respect is one where the effects of poverty are eradicated; where our
children and women are not subject to abuse; where our elderly people are
respected and cared for; and where our youth are integrated into society in
a meaningful way.

We need to ensure that we strengthen families, if we are to succeed in our
quest for moral regeneration. One way is to ensure that we retain the
elderly within our communities and not ship them off to villages for the
elderly or old age institutions. The elderly are the custodians of social
norms and moral values. Their wisdom is what keeps society intact. In the
Northern Cape we actively promote this, but at the same time we establish
multipurpose day-care centres to meet the unique needs of the elderly who
live at home with their relatives.

The increasing incidence of single parents and child-headed households
needs special attention. Our Isibindi project seeks to create circles of
care that render support to these vulnerable households. This focus was the
result of research done last year in Donkerhoek – an informal settlement in
Galeshewe. The intervention proved so successful that we will extend this
programme to other areas in the province.

The Human Rights Commission recently released the report highlighting
social problems within the Komani San community who live near the Kgalagadi
Transfrontier Park. The provincial government shares this concern and we
have already commenced to plan a co-ordinated multidisciplinary response in
a way that will see the deepening of social services to the surrounding
community, and not only the Komani San.

In addition to our present programmes to address alcohol abuse, we will
embark on a focused anti-alcohol campaign in targeted areas in the
province. Amongst other things, this will entail increasing our support to
specialised NGOs such as Sanca, retraining staff and volunteers to be
antisubstance abuse ambassadors, implementing the “Kemoja. No, thanks, I am
fine without drugs” initiative in targeted schools; as well as piloting an
enrichment programme whereby volunteers work with those grant beneficiaries
who waste their grants on alcohol. These prevention programmes are the
focus of our strategy.

However, we also face the reality of the effects of widespread substance
abuse. We need to treat and rehabilitate alcohol and drug dependence. The
province is in dire need of a rehabilitation centre and we are pleased with
the sympathetic response of the hon Minister to our preliminary proposal
for the establishment of such a centre. Of course, in the near future, we
will present him with a business plan for his concentrated attention and,
hopefully, funding.
A major focus of the department is to provide an effective social security
system for the poor. This is essential if we are to ensure the
sustainability of the family structure. Today we have done well in our
social security intervention. We have brought many deserving people into
the social security net. Thousands of children benefit from the child
support grant, and from our feeding schemes and poverty alleviation
interventions as well.

With the move of this function to the recently established SA Social
Security Agency, we expect the department to be able to focus more
intensively on the effect of the social ills that pervade our society and
keep so many of our young from realising their potential. We will be able
to focus on addressing the issues relating to all vulnerable sectors of our
society.

It is a reality that there is an increasing incidence of orphaned and other
vulnerable children. With the collapse of the family structure and the
increasing prevalence of HIV/Aids, the department faces many challenges
with regard to successfully placing children in alternative care, although
temporary. This is important in our quest to provide a stable environment
for the child to grow up in.

Deriving from the transformation of the child and the youth care system,
the Northern Cape was tasked with piloting a professional foster care
programme. The elements of this were to reconstruct the conditions which
necessitated the removal of the child from the family and to train the
foster parents prior to placement as well as addressing the problem of
behaviourally-challenged children. This has proved to be very successful
and a roll-out strategy has just been adopted for the rest of the province.

We have to acknowledge that, as a society, we are no longer able to
guarantee the safety of our children at all times. A consequence of the
collapse of families and very often the abuse of alcohol has, amongst other
factors, given rise to abuse of children. One part of our strategy to
address this issue is the further roll-out of the Isolabantwana project to
more areas within our province.

We have many challenges. In fact, we have huge challenges, but we are not
afraid to tackle them. We are confident that the preparatory programmatic
work done and the implementation thereof stands us in good stead to face
the future with assurance and certainty.

In the past decade government focused on redressing the imbalances of the
past and the provision of basic needs of the poor. For the next decade the
challenge is to consolidate our previous interventions, but more so to
focus on addressing the mental wellbeing of our society. In short, we need
to intensify our efforts to reconstruct of family life. But we cannot take
on this challenge alone. We need the support of all stakeholders. After
all, it is everybody’s responsibility and obligation to ensure that this
happens, if we are to succeed in our quest for a better life for all. Thank
you. [Applause.]

Mr O M THETJENG: Chairperson, hon Minister and Deputy Minister of Social
Development, and hon members, in 1994 we had seven members in Parliament
and lacked representation in a number of provincial legislatures. We were
called a small party that had no future.

In 1999 we became the second largest party in Parliament as well as in most
provincial legislatures, displacing the now defunct, not so new NP, whose
members have become members of the ANC. We managed to expose to the general
public those issues that under normal circumstances the ANC would not
disclose to them, thus holding you responsible and accountable to the
public.

It is common knowledge that you only tell the public about the good that
you do and never the bad things like travelgate and other “gates” that are
still coming, and the arms deal. [Interjections.] We will see that justice
is done by telling them about both the good and the bad, so that now they
will be correctly informed and in a position to make informed choices for
themselves.

Voters are continuing to watch with keen interest the developments within
Parliament’s walls and will soon change their way of voting in favour of
the DA. Do not be surprised if you are referred to as those who once
governed. If you want to know more, ask your new partners in politics. You
won’t be the first to go this route. Some in this House today are a living
testimony.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE NCOP: Chairperson, on a point of order: I’m under the
understanding that we are discussing social development, not political
development or underdevelopment. So could you please make a ruling to order
that the member addresses the subject on the Table?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Please proceed, hon member.

Mr O M THETJENG: Chair, the ANC cannot dictate when the leader of the DA
should visit this House. He will do so when he has time at his disposal
and, on that day, it matters not who will be debating. Hon member Setona’s
comments yesterday just serve to show how little he knows about my leader.
I will today do what is expected of our party and hold you accountable. The
good that the government is doing will be commended and the bad will be
exposed and condemned.

The DA welcomes the establishment of the SA Social Security Agency. It will
handle and administer all social security grants in all the nine provinces
of our country. This agency will mean the end of all the other agencies
that are used by the various provincial governments. Different standards
and criteria are used in the administration of these grants.

Corrupt politicians became shareholders in some of these agencies, thus
undermining the good intentions of government. The recent amnesty for those
who were illegally accessing social grants must be commended. It will save
the state a sizeable amount of money that can then be used to cater for the
needy.

The unfortunate situation is that women were requested to bring their
husbands’ proof of income. Some found this very difficult to comply with,
because they were accessing these grants without the full knowledge of
their husbands, yet they must now disclose proof of income when they have
to deregister, and have to request proof of income from their husbands.

It may have been a good idea to have had a blanket amnesty, so that the
system could become fully clean and only deserving individuals would remain
as beneficiaries. The antifraud and corruption campaigns should also be
tightened with regard to officials because, more often than not, the
officials are involved, since they are the ones who understand the system
better.

The present system operating in the provinces is open to fraud. I have
classic cases that have come to my attention in Limpopo, of the elderly who
have been fraudulently registered for a funeral scheme with an insurance
company without their knowledge. They got a surprise only when they
received less than what is normally paid to them. On investigation, we
established that individuals known in the community registered them. They
even went to the extent of appointing beneficiaries in this funeral scheme.
In one instance, an old blind lady was forced to sign for such a funeral
scheme, because she was told that if she did not do so her grant would be
withdrawn.

The provincial government was requested to intervene and the response was
that they could not intervene since the contract was between the company
concerned and the individual. How then can you talk of the protection of
the vulnerable individual when the elderly, who are in this category,
cannot be protected?

These private companies administering these grants allow stop orders to be
activated, and I believe this is unfair to the elderly. Minister, I urge
you to deal with these issues because they undermine the very good
intentions of the social security grant.

The Minister and his department must be commended for the food emergency
relief programme introduced to assist the poorest of the poor. Most of the
provinces, including the rural areas classified as the most poor,
underspent on their allocated budget for the 2004-05 financial year. In
Limpopo they had a R41 million surplus out of the R61 million allocated. In
other words, they spent less than what they were actually allocated; the
Eastern Cape only spent 2,42% of the R94 million; the Western Cape only
spent 2,67% of the R20 million allocated; the Free State spent 2,79% of the
R38 million allocated; Gauteng, North West and KwaZulu-Natal tried their
best, though they spent less than 60% of their allocated budget.

Should the poor and ordinary people suffer due to the administrative
bureaucracy created by officials? The other problem that compounds the
situation is that, in some cases, where the food parcels are available for
distribution, councillors are the ones that carry out this task. Officials
and registered NGOs, CBOs and faith-based organisations should take the
responsibility to distribute these parcels. We do not want to be another
Zimbabwe where food is used as patronage for people to vote for the ruling
Zanu-PF. We do not want that situation in South Africa.

HIV/Aids, the ANC’s most tormenting enemy, is raging like an angry bull.
Parents are dying and leaving behind children that need to be taken care
of. Child-headed families are on the increase. So, I urge you to ensure
that these children are taken care of, Minister, because they are our
children. Thank you so much. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms S C N SITHOLE (Limpopo): Hon Chairperson, hon Minister, I first want to
apologise for my MEC, who cannot be here owing to circumstances beyond his
control. I am standing here on his behalf.

As we participate in this important debate we do so with pride based on the
realisation that what our leaders vowed to strive for 50 years ago, namely
a South Africa that belongs to all that live in it, is being achieved. We
have, over many years, consistently pronounced our determination to
contribute to the fight against poverty, disease, underdevelopment and all
other social ills affecting the people of Limpopo.

The service that we offer to those who are poor, vulnerable and distressed
continues to make a real difference in this overall equation. In the nature
of this commitment, it is appropriate and gratifying that we have entered
the new year of our second decade of democracy with a new identity, which
engenders a new institutional environment and a performance culture that
advocates social development rather than a narrow welfare.

Limpopo is not only predominantly rural, but has a high unemployment rate
and is subject to continual conditions of drought. The National Food
Security Programme continues to give hope to more than 62 431 destitute
families. The challenge is, however, the sustainability of the programme.
To address this challenge we have now produced 586 auxiliary nurses, who
were selected from these families and trained, thus putting a plate of food
on the table on a permanent basis.

Children are the future of our society and, as such, they need to be cared
for and nurtured at all times. No child is to be denied admission to early
childhood development centres because parents are unable to pay the
necessary school fees. To make this noble dream a reality, the department
is continuing to give subsidies to more than 1 176 crèches.

In line with the national policy to ensure that youths who are in conflict
with the law are place in safe and secure environment, we plan to establish
an additional secure care facility.

Service to the elderly is another area of concern to all of us. During this
financial year we still focus much attention on addressing challenges, such
as the slow pace of transforming old age homes and representivity on
management boards. As government, we will surely not allow a situation in
which some old age homes are still reluctant to admit people from other
races. We will continue to build and strengthen service centres and
advocacy programmes that seek to address the issue of abuse of the elderly.
We are determined to ensure that our senior citizens get empowered with
such life skills as sewing and knitting from such service centres.

As we join the national department in the establishment of Sassa, we do so
with a renewed commitment of ensuring that grants are provided in time for
those who are entitled to them, and deal with those who defraud our noble
cause. Significant milestones continue to be achieved in the provision of
social assistance services in the province. These include the reduction of
application processing time, the improvement of coverage of payment of
grants to eligible persons, the provision of social relief of distress,
increase in the numbers of paypoints and the improvement of conditions at
paypoints.

As a matter of fact, we have moved from 60 to 30 days turnaround time, in
terms of the application-processing period. We are recruiting additional
personnel, so that we can comply with the national norm of 21 days
turnaround time set out for this current financial year.

Our beneficiary strength currently stands at 1,4 million and is estimated
to grow to 1,8 million beneficiaries during this year. As part of the
process of ensuring an efficient agency and of cleaning the system of
fraud, we are happy to announce that 36 273 illegal beneficiaries have
applied for amnesty and we are continually reviewing all disability grants.
We, therefore, commend the Minister for setting the date for Sassa being
fully operational by April 2007, thus allowing the department the time to
ensure seamless service delivery with the transfer.

In terms of the retention strategy development the department has
implemented the revised salary package for social workers. As a
predominantly rural province the challenge remains that this may not be
sufficient, hence the need for arrears such as rural allowances and other
retention incentives to be investigated.

We remain committed to the fight against HIV and Aids. With the escalating
number of people infected and affected by the scourge of HIV and Aids,
particularly children, the department managed to establish 75 home-based
care sites and 19 drop-in centres. These programmes provide 5 430 children
with meals, laundry and other related assistance, such as schoolwork. At
presently, the number of orphans is approximately 18 361, with 2 160 child-
headed households. The department provides food parcels to the orphans on a
regular basis.

For those 1 047 caregivers involved in this project, the department gives a
stipend of R500 per month. The challenge that the department is faced with
is to align the stipend with those of other departments within limited
budget allocations.

While the department is happy with the budget earmarked for social
security, the same cannot be said for the social development service
budget, because social security consumes 95,3% of the vote and 4,7% is
spent on other social development services. These have an impact on
achieving some of the issues raised by the Minister in the budget speech.
It is, therefore, expected of the sector to engage both the national and
the provincial treasuries to adequately fund social development services.

In conclusion, we would, once again, like to commend the Minister of Social
Development for his able political leadership and guidance in the struggle
against poverty, vulnerability, fraud and corruption.

This is the message of my MEC but, as the chairperson for the portfolio
committee, I would like, from the oversight point of view, to say to this
House that we are happy to say that we have got a department that is very
caring, and we always have co-operation from it in cases where we want to
know certain things from the department. We also want to inform the
Minister that in that committee we have developed enough expertise to be
able to engage the department and hold it accountable to the people of
Limpopo.

The problem that is bothering the committee a little bit is the foster care
grant. I would like the Minister to assist the department in that regard.
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms P MACKAY (KwaZulu-Natal): Hon Chair, hon Minister, hon Deputy Minister
and others, on behalf of the KwaZulu-Natal portfolio committee of social
welfare and population development, I present a few comments. In KwaZulu-
Natal the baseline vote for this budget, which is the welfare budget, was
increased by R3,35 billion this year. This means an increase from R10,25
billion to R13,65 billion in the coming year, and that is almost 30% of the
provincial budget.

This is a massive increase, but it is not an attempt to alleviate the
pressures of Programme, which is the programme that deals with social
security. This programme has been allocated R12,7 billion and that is
93,87% of the department’s budget. This doesn’t leave much for services,
but it is an effort to alleviate poverty and the needs of the poorest of
the poor.

We do note this with concern; but we have noted that the transfer of the
national SA Social Security Agency from provincial to national will only
take place next year in April, and that for this financial year there will
have to be a conditional grant to the department and we have two concerns
with regard to this. In the closing report of 2004-05, the entire R922
million expenditure had taken place as result of commitments to expenditure
on Social Security grants. This happened despite an additional allocation
of 760 million during the 2004 adjustments.

A large part of this will be received from the national government, and our
committee would sincerely like to thank the government for that additional
financing. However, without further financial assistance, we are going to
overspend again - a very serious overspend - for this financial year.

In KwaZulu-Natal we are anticipating an increase of 30% in the uptake of
disability grants, which compares unfavourably to the national norm of 7%.
We have a great concern about this but we have to meet these commitments.
Our provincial department likes to undertake as other provincial
departments, it has a far-ranging investigation into fraudulent
beneficiaries and we hope to improve the overexpenditure through rooting
out the fraud.

We are very concerned that so much fraud was recorded in our province and
the figure that we spent on rooting it out was calculated R80 million. We
are also anticipating an increase of 3,5% in the child support grants
uptake whereas we have been informed that in other provinces the ceiling
has been reached and we have a concern about this. We do acknowledge that
fraud and corruption have to be rooted out. We asked the national Minister
to make sure that the new National Social Security Agency is able to have a
very strong hand in preventing future fraud and corruption.

We are aware that staff will be transferred from province to national but
we hope that some of these officials involved in fraud will not be
transferred along with them and that fraud will really be handled very
firmly. We are very grateful to the hon Minister and Deputy Minister for
the comprehensive retention strategy to improve the social workers’
salaries so that their services will be retained and there won’t be a
constant brain-drain to other countries.

We would also like to applaud our provincial Minister’s being prepared to
increase salaries with from 61% at the starting level, and this is in his
budget for this year. This will go a long way to preventing the turnover of
social workers from the NGO sector to government. But nevertheless; there
is a great concern. The department of welfare in our province’s reports
said that they have over 300 vacancies. I would just conclude then by
saying that we thank the hon Minister for all the support he gives our
province.

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Hon Chair, hon Minister and Deputy Minister and hon House,
thank you very much for this opportunity. Social Development is one of the
leading departments in the government’s effort to reduce poverty and
improve the social wellbeing of our people. It is also a key department in
attempts to mitigate the impact of HIV and Aids on families and
communities.

It is reported that over the last three years there has been a large
expansion of the social assistance system with beneficiary numbers
increasing from 3,8 million in April 2001 to 9,2 million in January 2005.
An area of concern and disappointment is that an estimated number of 37 000
public servants have infiltrated the scheme and are stealing grants
intended for the young mothers, older persons and people with disabilities.
However, it is gratifying that the fraud is under investigation and those
that are found guilty will be dealt with in terms of the relevant
legislation. Because the scheme is also targeting unemployed young mothers,
it is hoped that those who find suitable employment during the course of
time will then be relieved of their grants in order to cut on the rapid
growth of the number of beneficiaries.
At the pay point in the North West province the committee on social
services under the leadership of Mrs Masilo arrived in time to defuse the
potential conflict between the officers of the Pay Master Services and the
Absa Bank officers who wanted to brief interested old age beneficiaries
about the Mzanzi account. It appeared the Pay Master company was opposed to
a banking arrangement, as it would leave them without jobs.

However, the receipt of the grant at a bank is less arduous and therefore
preferable to receiving it at an open-air paypoint. I would recommend that
this banking arrangement should be pressed on with. It is noted that since
the Minister announced the investigation into the payment of grants . . .
The UCDP support the Budget Vote.

Mr Z LUYENGE (Eastern Cape): Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  members  of  this
House, allow me to  greet  you  this  morning.  Before  I  go  on  with  the
presentation that is coming from the Eastern Cape, allow  me  to  tender  an
apology from the MEC for social development, who has not been able  to  turn
up due to problems that have erupted with regard  to  fraudulent  grants  in
one our regions in the Eastern Cape; of which the MEC is part. The  campaign
is that of arresting the thieves that are in our province.

The Eastern Cape department of social  development  functions  and  enhances
service delivery processes within the ambit of the  National  Department  of
Social Development. During the year there were many challenges faced by  the
department. There has been a spiralling  increase  in  temporary  disability
grants and the other major challenge was  the  underspending  on  the  child
support grant.

That underspending reflected the migration patterns of  the  population  due
to the pursuits of employment opportunities in urban  areas.  We  experience
serious budget  pressure  due  to  funding  levels  and  what  is  seemingly
exponential in all grant types.  We have dealt with the problem arising  out
of nonintegration of government data bases. We introduced a  new  management
information system that has helped to quell the fraudulent practices.  As  a
result of that intervention, we have  been  able  to  reduce  the  projected
overexpenditure by R426 million.

All temporary disability grants are being audited regularly in terms of  the
social assistance Act provisions. For the first time in the history  of  our
department, the Auditor-General has given us a clean  bill  of  health,  for
example, the unqualified report status. Indeed this is a matter on which  we
have to improve.

Allow me to reflect on the  current  project  upon  which  we  have  jointly
embarked with the hon Minister, Dr Skweyiya, who is affectionately known  as
Kwebindlala in our  of  province,  because  of  his  championing  the  fight
against poverty. [Applause.]

The President has promulgated the SA Social Security Agency and the  Eastern
Cape  MEC  for  social  development  has  also  signed  the  memorandum   of
understanding with the national Department of Social  Development,  to  give
effect to the birth of this new organisation.

The Eastern Cape government is almost in a state  of  readiness  to  migrate
this function to the national sphere of government,  come  April  2006.  The
reinforcing process of social  security  is  in  progress,  and  it  is  our
understanding that Sassa will provide a better service to  our  communities.
We are in the forefront of fighting corruption processes with the  indemnity
provided by the national Minister.

I am happy to say, we have made a major breakthrough. We have just  launched
the child support extension in one of the localities in  the  Eastern  Cape,
in Lebote, on 13 April 2005. Allow me also to commend the national  Minister
and the President on their bold stances against  fraud,  especially  in  the
grant section of the department. Our Premier is spearheading that  campaign,
and in effect, we have arrested a number of people including civil  servants
at all levels, and that does not exclude some of the beneficiaries.

The introduction of an integrated  approach  by  our  government  that  puts
together both the Department of Social Development, Home Affairs, the  SAPS,
and other relevant departments that  assist  the  beneficiary  to  access  a
grant is tantamount to a number of creatures, many of which  are  living  in
the sea - where millions of such creatures would want to go  back  into  the
sea. But if one person is doing that  exercise  of  putting  such  creatures
back into water, it won’t make a difference to them, but if  we  all  assist
in terms of ensuring that we take these  creatures  back  into  water,  then
there will be a difference. We again commend the national Minister  for  all
the steps that he took to ensure that a difference  has  been  made  in  the
lives of our people since the inception of our hard-earned democracy.

We are known to be one of the poorest provinces  in  this  country,  and  to
that effect we applaud the strides that have been taken by the  Minister  to
ensure that we protect all  opportunities  that  exist  in  this  particular
department to ensure that the poorest of the poor are assisted. Together  we
will fight against corruption. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mrs M VANTURA (Western Cape): Chairperson, Minister, Deputy Minister, hon
members, ladies and gentleman, I am standing in for the MEC in the
province, Mrs Kholeka Mqulwana.

As a point of departure, our department would like to express a great sense
of gratitude for the opportunity to participate in this very important
debate. We also commend the national Minister for his guidance and
leadership in our quest to provide better service and improve the lives of
our people.
It is a sad fact though, that as we sit here at this moment and discuss
matters affecting our nation, thousands of our communities in this province
are reeling from the havoc in their lives, from the recent floods, that
destroyed their homes and their earthly belongings.

Even though we are entering a second decade of freedom and democracy our
people are still struggling to disengage themselves from the clutches of
poverty. Most of them still exist within the frontiers of, or experience
planning and infrastructure and development.

On 26 June this year we will be celebrating fifty years of the Freedom
Charter - milestone that reminds us of the importance of human rights and
equality, lest we forget where we came from. In turn, and in line with our
national counterpart, the Department of Social Services, with a view to
poverty alleviation in the Western Cape has developed a number of
programmes aimed at establishing a net for our communities. These include
establishing strategic partnerships with relevant stakeholders such as the
communities themselves, the private sector, other government departments
and civil society.

At this point we want to add our voice in support of the Minister’s recent
call to the NGO fraternity and other social partners to come on board and
to help fight against poverty and unemployment.

Last week we started a programme of rolling out the first group of doctors,
particularly in poor communities, to speed up the registration of the
disability grant. We are aware that the law demands that every disability
grant applicant must be examined and receive certification from a doctor
within the public sector, before qualifying for this grant. But we find
ourselves in a catch-22 situation, as the number of these doctors is very
small when compared to the number of patients on the waiting list. This has
therefore led to a huge backlog.  We would like to call upon more doctors
to volunteer for this programme and help the physically challenged to
access this grant. We need to end the current backlog of these disability
grants.

The department is also in the process of increasing the roll-out for early
childhood development. We believe that by getting involved in the lives of
our children at a very early age, we will provide proper intellectual and
psychological training for our children. Through this programme we are also
creating job opportunities for thousands of women who look after these
children on an informal basis.

Minister, the number of children roaming the streets of Cape
Town and other areas is still a major concern. The department works closely
with the NGOs and the city on programmes to get children off the streets,
but much more still needs to be done. Family support structures need to be
strengthened. The question is: How can we ensure that those children under
fourteen, who will qualify for the child support grant, do not roam the
streets instead of being at school? The message must go out to these
parents that they will be dealt with if the children are not at school.

Minister, there are still hundreds of grandmothers caring for children
whose mothers receive the child support grant and who do not support the
grannies in that way. That does not contribute towards the care of those
children, and that is another challenge that we have to face.

Let us also commend the Minister on the antifraud campaign, which he
launched throughout the country earlier this year. This drive will
certainly rid our society of the scourge of corruption and ensure that no
administration is dodging the issuing of social grants. Last week the
Minister announced that the number of public servants involved in this form
of corruption has risen.

Hon members, it goes without saying that the theft of public funds, which
currently amounts to R1,5 billion, is a form of the most  unethical
practice by people entrusted with the welfare of our citizens. At this
point we want to reiterate the call to members of the public to assist the
government in bringing an end to fraud and corruption. The national
department has registered a toll-free number and we urge South Africans to
heed this call and participate in the whistle-blowing exercise.
We also applaud the Minister and the Department of Social Development for
establishing the South African Social Security Agency. This important
institution will go a long way in ensuring the eradication of theft and
corruption in the payment of social grants. The agency will also ensure a
speedy delivery and contribute towards the reduction of lengthy queues. We
urge the provinces to support this initiative, as it is a right step in the
direction of the provision of a better life for our citizens.

Once again our department has responded to the call by the national
government and conducted a number of imbizos around the province. Last week
Grabouw, Delft, Saldanha and Matsikama, Thembaletwu and Khayalitsha were
visited, to register parents and children for birth certificates and
identity documents. It is important that recipients are in possession of
these legal documents in order to access social grants.

With regard to the transformation of institutions - old age homes,
orphanages and care centres - the department has just finalised its
assessment process and the standing committee will receive a briefing on
their findings and we will also see to it that we do our oversight visits
once again to those institutions.

Further, to ensure that we translate our slogan into a practical reality
for our communities, we are in the process of signing a memorandum of
understanding with various municipalities. These include Cape Town,
Matsekami, Saldanha, Plettenberg Bay and Beau-fort West. The signing of
these memorandums of understanding will ensure the pooling of our resources
and increase our capacity to deliver better services and reduce the
duplication in the delivery of these services, through the concept of
intergovernmental relations. We are also working with other departments
such as those of health, education, transport and public works.

In conclusion, as we approach the celebration of that historic day when
thousands of brave and patriotic South Africans, men and women gathered on
a cold day in Kliptown, we want to ensure that all our people have a reason
to celebrate this second decade of freedom and democracy. We want proudly
to announce once again that SA belongs to all who live in it, black and
white. I thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Chairperson, hon members,
Minister of Social Development, members of the provincial executive
councils, distinguished guests, leaders and members of civil society,
ladies and gentlemen, let me reiterate what the Minister has said. The
Department of Social Development is committed to the promotion of a caring
society to build strong families and restore the dignity of all people.

This department has made enormous strides in providing a comprehensive
social security system and we are increasingly taking up the challenges of
creating an enabling environment for the attainment of sustainable
livelihoods. We have made progress in building partnerships with NGOs in
implementing programmes for poverty alleviation and community development.
This programme is aimed at facilitating the registration of and support to
NPOs to strengthen their development implementation capacity to meet the
diverse needs of the South African population.

Implementation and delivery are the two major focuses for this second
decade. This means an increased focus on the role of provincial and local
governments, the primary drivers of service delivery. In this regard let me
commend the Northern Cape for developing innovative programmes-accessible
to those who are vulnerable - for the prevention and treatment of substance
abuse. A further challenge for the department as we enter the second decade
of freedom is to improve the services to the poorest and most vulnerable
sectors of our society. Programme 5 in the Budget Vote, which is aptly
named “Welfare Services Transformation”, facilitates the delivery of
effective and developmental social welfare services to empower communities.

A total amount of R7,9 million has been allocated to children, families and
youth development. In case the media thinks I am crying again: There is
just something in my eye. I just wanted to clarify that! [Laughter.] This
programme is aptly named welfare services transformation, which facilitates
the delivery of effective and developmental social welfare services to
empower communities. A total of R17,9 million has been allocated to
children, families and youth development.

A national policy protection register was introduced in seven provinces.
The draft policy framework for the prevention and management of child
abuse, neglect and exploitation has been completed and is going through the
approval process in the 2005-06 budget year; and a central authority for
adoptions is being established.

A priority over the next three years is improving social welfare service
delivery by finalising the social welfare service delivery model,
developing the costing baseline norms and standards for welfare services
and supporting service delivery through provincial departments and the
nonprofit sector. There will be renewed focus on costing and implementing
the policy on financial awards to service providers in the nonprofit
sector; approving and implementing the national policy for victims of
violence and their families; the national strategy on child abuse, neglect
and exploitation; and services to prevent substance abuse, including the
norms and standards that govern the delivery of support services by
treatment centres. The department will also be fast-tracking the expansion
of its home and community-based care to children and households infected
and affected by HIV and Aids and expanding its partnership with the
LoveLife Groundbreakers programme to reach more rural and farming
communities and households.
In its endeavours to enhance the effective delivery of social services, the
department recognises social work as a scarce skill. Some funding has been
allocated for the retention of social workers. This department recognises
that salaries are not the only measure to facilitate the retention of
social and other workers and has developed the capacity-building programme
for the social services professionals jointly funded by our department, the
Department for International Development in the UK and the health and
welfare Seta. In addition, the department has recently inaugurated the
social service professional board and the child and youth care workers
professional board, thereby granting professional status to the latter
category for the first time in South African social services’ history.

The scourge of apartheid has left many scars on our communities. One of
these scars is an unacceptably high level of crime with women and children
bearing the brunt of violent crimes. Progress in victim empowerment
includes the national resources directory to make services accessible to
victims of crime and violence and a costed strategy on setting up and
managing shelters for women and their children. The shelter strategy has
been made available to the provinces, shelter managers and other role-
players that provide services to victims of crime and violence.

The draft policy on victim empowerment is being finalised. Furthermore, one
too many children is in conflict with the law. Along with other relevant
departments, our department leads the challenge of diverting children in
conflict with the law to alternative programmes to assist them to become
constructive members of society.

With regard to the subprogramme on crime prevention, the following projects
have been commissioned: setting minimum standards for diversions, setting
up the professional and standards-generating boards for probation services,
rolling out the home-based supervision programme, appointing additional
assistant probation officers, training and retraining probation
practitioners in restorative justice and evaluating the assistant probation
and crime-buster programmes. The department and the Umsobomvu Youth Fund
plan to train 500 of the unemployed as part of the national youth service
programme to become assistant probation officers for home- based
supervision of children in trouble with the law who are awaiting trial. For
these three subprogrammes R6,9 million, R 5,7 million and R3,6 million
respectively have been allocated for the 2005-06 financial year.

As stated in the NA last week, substance abuse remains a serious concern
for the wellbeing and development of our communities, particularly for our
youth. Research indicates that children as young as eight years old are
admitted to rehabilitation centres. This situation is aggravated by
unemployment and poverty, which act as fertile grounds for marketing highly
addictive and dangerous substances such as methamphetamines, Mandrax and
dagga. Being a resident of the Western Cape, it has also come to my
attention through the media and other people reporting to me, that
methamphetamine, which is the substance called “tik”, continues to be a
major problem. Three years after this drug hit the market in the Western
Cape, the children who have been on it for that period are now trying very
hard to find treatment centres. I trust that our MEC for social services is
looking at the problem.

Alcohol abuse which leads to a high rate of foetal alcohol syndrome in some
of our most poverty-stricken areas remains a serious problem. The drug
master plan, a comprehensive interdepartmental programme for combating
substance abuse, is in the process of revision to improve government’s
ability to combat this societal scourge, particularly as it affects the
poor and vulnerable groups in our society.

With support from the national department, our provinces have developed
mini drug master plans to ensure an integrated approach to service
delivery. Provincial drug forums have been established to ensure an
integrated community-based approach to treatment and prevention. This
should include the expansion of treatment to incorporate social models of
intervention, which will be more sustainable and accessible to the poor and
marginalised. This means integrating existing youth development programmes
in relevant departments for treatment and prevention of substance abuse
with social development playing the leading role.

The policy on substance abuse . . .

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Deputy Minister, your time has expired.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Thank you. I will conclude by
saying, as indicated by the Minister, tremendous challenges remain in
extending social security and services to those who have been most
marginalised. Our department remains determined to realising our
commitments as expressed by government’s national programme of action.
[Applause.]

Mr B J TOLO: Hon Chair, hon Minister and Deputy Minister, hon members,
South Africa is the envy of many nations in the world today due to its
achievements in the last ten years. We can pat ourselves on the back for
the work already done in transforming our country beyond recognition in a
very short space of time. When we cast our minds back to look at apartheid
South Africa and compare it with today’s South Africa, we feel satisfied
with a job well done. Thanks to the organisation of Oliver Tambo, Moses
Mabida, Walter Sisulu, Nelson Mandela, Thabo Mbeki, the people’s
organisation and our organisation, the ANC. We can say without a shadow of
doubt . . .

Ms J F TERBLANCHE: Chairperson, on a point of order: Could the member
please stick to the debate on social development and not make political
statements?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, can you take your seat. I
have not recognised you. I was busy with something. Maybe I must make the
following point, that even if you rise on a point of order, the Chair must
first recognise you. Don’t just speak.

Ms J F TERBLANCHE: Chairperson, I was trying to get your attention. On a
point of order: Could the member please stick to the issue under discussion
and not make party political statements?

Mr J B TOLO: Chair, I hope that will not affect my time. We can say without
a shadow of doubt that we are on the correct path of building a South
Africa based on what the Congress of the People said in Kliptown in 1955 as
set out in the Freedom Charter. We must also say that this path is not
adorned with roses. We are determined not to be detracted from it.

Chair, although we have achieved so much, the legacy of apartheid is still
well and alive and it will be with us for some time to come. The two-nation
theory is still relevant today as it was some years ago - that when you
look at South Africa, you see two nations. Broadly speaking?, one nation is
very affluent with standards of living comparable to those in well-
developed countries in Europe – that is the white nation. The other nation
is characterised by poverty and all the other characteristics of
underdevelopment – that is the black nation. This is an anomaly in a
democratic country like ours. The challenge therefore is to bridge the gap
between the two nations so that we have one South African nation with one
common social feature.

The two-economy theory also addresses itself to this problem. To solve this
problem will not be an event but a long and protracted process. It is for
that reason that government cannot wait for this to happen, but has to come
up with policies that are aimed at intervening to relieve people that are
needy because of the burden of poverty and squalor.

The Department of Social Development is the department at the centre of
these relief programmes. Many of our people out there, especially women and
children, the elderly and the orphaned, the disabled and the sick, are not
sure of their next meal. It is for that reason that the Department of
Social Development came up with several programmes to address this problem.
Here we have in mind programmes like poverty relief programmes, the
national food emergency scheme and programmes that enhance family life, and
others. We want to indicate that most of these programmes are not meant to
be permanent as they will not be sustainable. They are meant to provide
temporary relief while people lock onto other sustainable government
programmes.

We want to congratulate the department for having developed these
programmes as they go a long way in helping our people. I personally have
relatives who have benefited from some of these programmes and who are very
grateful to government.

We must also indicate that there are also challenges associated with some
of these programmes. These programmes are delivered in the main by
provinces through conditional grants. Some of the provinces do not have
enough capacity to deliver on time. This inevitably lengthens the suffering
of the vulnerable people out there. More often than not, we are confronted
with lots of roll-overs. Roll-overs are a cancer that bedevils many
government departments and it is our considered view that if there is
capacity and proper planning, this can actually be avoided. We think that
if there are roll-overs beyond what the PMFA allows in any department, the
accounting officer must be charged with sabotage.

We want to thank this department for its zero tolerance against fraud and
corruption. We wholeheartedly support you, Minister, on the amnesty
campaign for those who have fraudulently accessed social grants. We are
aware that this has yielded positive results and we agree with you that
there are still other moles burrowing elsewhere. We are saying that they
should be unearthed so they can face the full might of the law. We also
agree that public servants who are on the wrong side of the law must also
not be shown any mercy.

We are all aware that the systems used by provinces to disburse social
grants are not without problems. The situation was that each and every
province had its own agency. The systems of these agencies did not talk to
one another. This might have resulted in double dipping where a person
applies for a social grant in one province and does the same in another
province. The passing of the law by Parliament last year that enables the
SA Social Security Agency to be formed will go a long in solving most of
these problems.

Through this agency we are sure to see an improvement in the social
security service delivery system. The disparities in levels of service
delivery will be a thing of the past, as common norms and standards will
now apply in all provinces. We know that this agency is in the process of
being established, and we are looking forward to seeing it being fully
operational in the not so distant future. We commend the department for
this.

As the ANC we are confident that this department will deliver on its
mandate, and we are therefore supporting its Budget Vote.

Mr P GOVENDER (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson, hon Minister, hon Deputy
Minister, hon members, I convey warm greetings to you on behalf of the MEC
of KwaZulu-Natal. The social development of any nation depends, to a large
degree, on the makeup and strength of its social fabric. In commenting on
the 2005 Budget, the March edition of Fast Facts issued by the SA Institute
of Race Relations leads with the caption: “Social Security Grows Fastest”.
The article states that one in four people in South Africa will soon draw
an income from the state in South Africa’s unique welfare system.

The article states:


   Total growth and social security expenditure over the seven years between
   2001-08 is expected to be 172%. Over that same period the other two major
   categories, education and health, will record increases of 74% and 82%
   respectively.


We all know that the biggest single component of social security spending
is social grants. Even though these grants go a long way in reducing the
incidence of extreme poverty, this is not the solution to the problem faced
by this department. The solution lies in creating more jobs, because
joblessness has grown by between 30% and 40% in the past decade.

The President of our country in his state of the nation address stated that
over 9 million South Africans receive social grants, and the vast majority
of them are children. In his Budget Vote the hon Minister has set aside
R6,9 billion in this financial year, and an additional R19 billion over the
Medium-Term Expenditure Framework period, for the further extension of the
child support grant to children under the age of 14. This is indeed a
positive step as children and the aged are the most vulnerable people in
our country.
The Minister needs to be complimented on this and presented with a bouquet,
but, hon Minister, you will know that in any bouquet there is bound to be a
thorn, and a thorn in my side is the high level of fraud and corruption
that is bleeding our system and depriving those who are most deserving. To
make matters worse, it is the personnel who are employed by the department
who are implicated in these fraudulent activities. I am extremely pleased
that the department at the national level and the provincial departments as
well have embarked on a relentless campaign to identify and prosecute those
who are guilty.

In KwaZulu-Natal the MEC for social welfare hon Nkosi Ngubane was praised
by all parties for the strides made by his department in this regard at his
prebudget hearing recently. By the end of the amnesty period, as at 31
March this year, over 6 000 people had come forward and declared that they
were fraudulently in receipt of social grants. This figure of 6 000 has
almost doubled since that time and this augurs well for the province as a
whole. The antifraud hotline set up by the KwaZulu-Natal department of
Social Welfare also played a significant role in giving the public an
avenue to report cases of fraud and corruption.

The Expanded Public Works Programme provides an excellent opportunity for
addressing the joblessness that I alluded to earlier, and I am pleased to
note that your department’s social sector plan has taken advantage of this
opportunity. My appeal, hon Minister, is that these people who are now
being skilled and provided with job opportunities are not abandoned once
this project is completed, because then they will once again find
themselves functioning on the periphery of the second economy without any
hope of finding a place in the first economy.

In KwaZulu-Natal social workers in the NGO sector were extremely pleased to
hear of the revised salary packages budgeted for by our MEC. You are well
aware, hon Minister, that the NGO sector has been losing qualified and
experienced social workers at an alarming rate, and at a conference held by
the SA National Council for Child and Family Welfare a few years back, you
rather light-heartedly stated that the NGO sector was an ideal training
ground for your department to poach from. With the improvement in salaries
for these professionals I am confident that they will want to remain in our
country and serve our citizens; and unfortunately you will not be able to
poach in KwaZulu-Natal very easily in the near future!

Hon Minister, your budget is a beacon of hope for those of our citizens who
live under the clouds of despair. Even though more funds are needed to
alleviate their plight, I am certain that if fraud and corruption is a
thing of the past your department will be able to achieve much more with
the funds available. I wish you well in this campaign. Thank you.

Ms H LAMOELA: Hon Chair, hon Ministers, hon members, “10 years of
democracy”, “a South Africa that belongs to all who live in it - black and
white”, “everyone to share in the riches of the country”, with which I so
dearly agree, are comments I hear on a daily basis. Unfortunately, a dark
cloud of corruption, fraud and financial mismanagement seems to hang over
one of the most needed services in our country, namely social services.

To my mind, accountability is one of the most important values of a
democracy. What is most sickening is that these acts are perpetrated by
people elevated to positions of trust; people who are paid to improve the
lives of the poor and the needy. The perpetrators must now be held
accountable for their deeds. It is mystifying why it has taken so long to
pick up, for example, that people are claiming for children they do not
have or are claiming disability grants, but are still holding full-time
jobs.

Fortunately, such activities are now increasingly being uncovered and
investigated. A big thank you to those uncovering such ruthless behaviour.
It is heartening to hear Minister Skweyiya say that there will be no
amnesty for public servants, because they knew exactly what they were
doing. Well said, hon Minister, because to my knowledge the Social
Assistance Act of 2004 and the South African Social Security Agency Act of
2004 were enacted to facilitate the creation of a coherent system that is
in line with the constitutional injunction to ensure effective service
delivery.
There is thus an urgent need for the effective and efficient management of
resources, including reduction of fraud and corruption in the delivery
mechanisms, in order to alleviate poverty and to enhance self-reliance;
which I sincerely believe the South African Social Security Agency Act will
do very well.

The HIV/Aids pandemic weighs heavily on the Department of Social Services
seeing that the number of children and adults affected and infected by the
disease escalated, and that there are insufficient human resources to cope
with the pandemic. Due to the poverty trail left by HIV/Aids, some families
have become less effective in providing support for their families. There
can be no doubt that the problem of children orphaned by Aids is a crisis
and should be treated as such.

Foster care is also a challenge to the department. The DA would like to
know what the current policy regarding foster care is. Are children still
placed in foster care with the primary objective of this being a temporary
measure, or is foster care viewed as a more permanent solution for taking
care of orphaned and abandoned children?

During our oversight visit to the Eastern Cape it came to our attention
that food parcels were used as election tools for voters. This is
unacceptable, and I urge the Minister to please look into this matter, as
the recipients of food parcels are the most vulnerable, consisting mostly
of rural and women-headed households.

The unreasonably high caseloads of social workers have negatively impacted
on both the profession and standards of service. Salary increases for
social workers are long overdue, and I thank the Minister of Finance who
has made a budget allocation for implementation of revised salary packages
for social services for 2005-06.

State subsidies to institutions such as old age homes, child welfare and
NGOs have been reduced. This is a rather worrying factor, especially with
the cost of living rising on a regular basis. The DA would like to see far
more support for NGOs. They indeed need to be congratulated for performing
many duties that are actually the responsibility of the government.

The establishment of early childhood development centres will form part of
the Department of Social Development’s contribution to the Expanded Public
Works Programme. Is there a policy framework for the establishment of these
services, and what is the level of capacity in provinces to monitor the
standards of programmes offered at such centres across the country? In
conclusion, I would like to quote Charles Darwin when he said: “People do
not care how much you know. People want to know how much you care”. Thank
you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Before I call on the next speaker, I
just want to acknowledge the presence of the learners in the public
gallery. You are welcome to the NCOP. We are now deliberating on the Budget
Vote on Social Development under the leadership of the hon Minister, Dr
Zola Skweyiya.

Mr T M H MOFOKENG (Free State): Hon Chair, hon Minister and hon Deputy
Minister and hon members of the NCOP.

Ke ema mona lebitsong la setho sa komiti ya phethahatso se ikarabellang ho
thekolehelo Free State, Mme Zanele Dlungwane, mme ke se ke ntse ke fitisa
madume ho tswa ho ena, ke re dumelang. [I stand here on behalf of the MEC
who is responsible for welfare in the Free State, Mrs Zanele Dlungwane, and
I forward greetings from her, saying: I greet you.]

Our country and our people are yearning for a bright and prosperous future
that is based on the firm foundations of human solidarity and security. In
line with the broader mission of our government, our work is focused on
restoring human dignity by defeating the elements that undermine the basic
essentials of humanity such as poverty, want, unemployment, HIV and Aids.

We are convinced that our strategies are on course to help in the short
term, while affirming in the medium to long term that our people should be
able on their own to galvanise resources and mechanisms to build an
unwavering network of human security. This is a function of many deliberate
actions as pronounced by the Minister of Social Development in his budget.
I rise to add our voice and impetus in support of the initiatives and
programmes that the Minister spoke of in the Budget Vote of the department
to Parliament on 5 April 2005.

The department of social development in the Free State is witness to the
rolling out of the national programme of creating a social security network
for the people of our country. As a province that is hardest hit by
poverty, we are well aware of the impact that the national programme has
had in changing the lives of our people, giving hope and ensuring that they
also can trace the elements of the restoration of their dignity. Although
it is not easy our department is, however, committed to ensuring that with
limited resources we are able to achieve more with less.

It is also encouraging to inform this House that while more resources are
being mobilised, we are able to harness the efforts of closing down
leakages in the form of fraud and corruption that have, for years, robbed
the state and the poor in the battle for fighting poverty and want. In this
regard we have made significant progress in the efforts of fighting fraud
and corruption in the area of the disbursement of social grants. Our
national campaign has yielded results and has impacted on the effort of
cleaning up government.

The work done by the department in our province is commendable in many
respects, as we have registered about 500 people who are illegal recipients
of social grants. We have handed the list to the national department for
the purpose of data capturing, so that these people can be removed from the
list.

Assessment through our systems will determine whether they fall into the
criteria of our national programme of indemnity. As the Minister correctly
alluded, all is being done to search and find many of those recipients who
did not heed the call and who would still be on the list of recipients.
Accordingly, the full might of the law will have to take its course. We are
indeed supportive of the initiative and would like to see it succeed. This
is while we are ensuring that other government departments and organs of
civil society are involved in helping to clean up the system to ensure its
integrity.

Our department, as is our system of government, is committed to delivering
a safe and secure society through a workable people’s contract. Indeed, our
work in order to succeed goes to the fundamental elements of working
together in a consultative system of government integrated into our
planning and implementation of programmes. We will ensure that this is
visible and supported by the outcomes of the growth and development summit.
In the final analysis we want all to see that our programmes are adding
impetus to the Free State development strategy.

We are at the frontline of building a caring government and delivering a
safe and secure community by taking advantage of a union of possibilities
presented by the first decade of our freedom and democracy. This will
indeed find elaborate expression through the department’s budget allocation
to be tabled soon, outlining key programmes and expenditure projection over
the medium-term framework. Both individually and collectively, our work
should be geared towards maximising the capacity of government to fast-
track the struggle to push back the frontiers of poverty and create a
better life for all.

Rev E ADOLPH: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon Deputy Minister, it is
indeed our obligation to salute the ANC-led government and the ruling party
for their major achievements towards uplifting the poorest of the poor
since 1994. [Applause.]

The ID appreciates and recognises the sizeable contribution made by giving
millions of people access to clean water and also sanitation and houses.
These very basic needs were previously denied them. Whilst we acknowledge
this on the one hand, we have to realise that there is still a lot that
needs to be done. There are a lot of challenges facing the ANC-led
government. The ID wants to declare our solidarity with all the people
suffering in the world and we will also join hands to fight for the
eradication of poverty; not combating it as such, but the eradication of
poverty.

We have to be very honest today, members. Whilst we are grateful and
celebrating, we are also aware of the challenges which we need to address
openly if we want to be true to our people. Women are suffering, especially
rural women. They are illiterate, malnourished and are suffering from the
effects of HIV and Aids. It is sad to note that these women are often
ignored. The Department of Social Development is doing sterling work to
clean up fraud and corruption in our society.

It is an open secret that we are losing R1,5 billion every year as a result
of corruption. It is our collective responsibility to intensify these
campaigns by the department, but we have to ask: How is it possible that
the Govender brothers in King William’s Town are not in jail? They
defrauded the poorest of the poor of millions.

What is really disturbing and unacceptable is the underspending of the
department in terms of the food parcels and food relief programme. We
condemn the fact that only 7% of the R388 million was spent. It is highly
unacceptable at a time when people are dying of hunger. In the Western Cape
2,67% of the R20 million given to them was spent. This is grossly unfair
towards the recipients who are vulnerable and in need of a piece of bread
on the table. We want to know how many households were given food parcels
and whether those recipients received the food parcels. Another serious
concern to us is the fact that the ANC councillors are involved in the
distribution of food parcels.
I want to know from this House: Who determines the criteria to deliver and
distribute food parcels? Shouldn’t respectable community leaders be more
involved in the distribution thereof? What is delaying you from
transferring these moneys to the people who need it that much, Minister? Is
it perhaps incompetent and fraudulent senior managers and officials who
cannot perform and do their work? They must be fired. If it is the national
Department of Social Development that is reluctant and dragging their feet
to transfer the money timeously to the provinces . . .  We support this
Budget Vote. [Time expired.]

Mr S T NGWENYA (Gauteng): Chairperson, I humbly request that it be accepted
that I have observed all protocol as far as salutations are concerned. I am
delivering this presentation on behalf of MEC Bob Mabaso whom I am standing
in for today. If he were here he would have said the following: I am
pleased to stand before you to debate the national budget speech delivered
by our national Minister, Dr Zola Skweyiya, on 5 April 2005.

At the outset, I wish to congratulate our national Minister on this mammoth
task of redirecting the department from social “welfarism” to social
development, in its deep sense, towards the upliftment of our vulnerable
groups. The consultative manner in which he roped in all the stakeholders
to walk the walk and talk the talk is highly commendable.

The anticorruption social security campaign which culminated in many people
confessing and applying for amnesty was so successful because of the
Minister’s will to ensure that the social security system is clear of
fraudsters for the benefit of our authentic beneficiaries. For instance, in
Gauteng there are currently 1,1 million beneficiaries, of which 693 000 are
children, with a total monthly expenditure of R480 million.

On norms and standards the national Minister highlighted that a new era in
grant payments will require changing mindsets, a move away from physical
cash payments and the use of new technology. Gauteng has now migrated more
than 360 000 beneficiaries from cash payments to Sekulula. A further 135
000 beneficiaries receive payments at other banks as well. We are talking
of 495 000 that are now getting their payments in a most humane manner that
restores that self-dignity.

On antifraud and corruption, 7 287 people have applied for indemnity in
Gauteng. With assistance from our legal advisors, we are now perusing these
applications to see who does and who does not qualify.

Regarding Socpen and Persal, this province is negotiating with national
government to get a data set of all government officials in all departments
who are on the grant database and also on the government pay roll. With the
National Special Investigation Unit taking the lead, these cases will be
investigated.

All temporary disability grants in Gauteng have been cancelled as
requested. As from 1 May 2006, this department will commence with a pilot
study for six months in which doctors appointed by the HOD will review
certain high-risk disability grants and also thoroughly screen new
applicants. This six-month project will be run in Soweto and Ekurhuleni and
if successful, will be rolled out across the province.

Good progress has been made with the transition to the SA Social Security
Agency and the department is confident that there will be no disruption of
services. The ring-fencing of social security staff has been completed and
signed off and assets have been separated. The budget is being carefully
monitored.

In conclusion, as our national Minister on a daily basis states that NGOs
are our valued partners in delivering our services, may I also say that
NGOs are our hands, eyes and feet on the ground. However, and
unfortunately, due to the budgetary constraints and the need for government
to address other challenges confronting us in Gauteng especially, we had to
cut our funding to NGOs by about 25%. Our funding for this current
financial year is R250 million. You will realise that, compared to last
year’s allocation of R360 million, the shortfall is R110 million. For this
financial year we have asked for R450 million, but for the reason that I
have already alluded to, we only received R250 million.

This means therefore that as per our request, there is a budget shortfall
of R200 million. Yesterday, I held a consultative meeting with the Gauteng
NGOs where we discussed the consequences of this budget shortfall. I said,
together with them, we will explore other innovative ways and means of
making up for the shortfall by encouraging them to intensify their
fundraising efforts, both nationally and internationally.

I can also add, as the chairperson of social development committee in
Gauteng, that it is not true that we spent only 2,3% on food parcels. I
don’t know where that member gets that. We spent the whole R27 million for
the year that he was telling the members about here. He should get his
facts correct from his members of the DA in the Gauteng legislature.

The second part, as hon member Tolo said, is that this social grant is a
temporary measure and we are aware that for now it is important that we use
this stopgap measure. That is why, in co-operation with the Department of
Social Development, the Department of Labour, the Department of Agriculture
and Land Affairs and the Department of Home Affairs, we are setting up
Setas in our province that will help these people to acquire skills so that
they can be self-sufficient and economically balanced so that most of these
people can be taken out of the social grant services.

The Minister and the department should be commended for the fact that it is
they who discovered this corruption. It was not because of some party – the
DA’s magical muti or something like that. [Laughter.] It is the ANC that
discovered this corruption – 41 000 public servants were discovered. It is
also not true that we only go to voters to tell them what we want. You
heard people from KwaZulu-Natal, the Eastern Cape and the Northern Cape
telling you of the situation they confront around poverty and they are
telling the people that they are going to imbizos. It is not that we are
going there for electioneering; we are there daily.

So, we are not going to be told here that we are using food parcels to get
more votes. We are attending to the serious situation of poverty on the
ground whilst we are seriously attentive to capacitating our people. I
thank you. [Applause.]

Dr F J VAN HEERDEN: Chairperson, I would like to respond to Mr Tolo’s
contribution. If you would like to get promotion in your party, please come
up with original facts, and don’t mislead the House by stating that there
are two nations in this country.

I would also like to respond to what Mr Sinclair said yesterday. Yesterday
Mr Sinclair doubted the unemployment figure, which was raised by another
member here. I am going to quote to you the official figure . . . .
[Interjections.] I don’t come to your rescue, colleague, but it’s just a
matter of being correct in this Chamber. [Laughter.] Mr Sinclair, the
official figure from the Human Rights Commission in this report, one of the
eight reports, is 31,2%. But you said it can’t be higher than 21%.
[Interjections.]

Well, be that as it may, I would like to come back to what Mr Tolo has
said. Mr Tolo, you created the impression that . . . . [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, hon members, order please!

Dr F J VAN HEERDEN: Mr Tolo, you created the impression that all white
people are rich. That’s the impression you created in this Chamber. You are
misleading the House. Let me just give you certain figures. In South Africa
there are 770 000 white families living in either squatter camps, caravans
or in single rooms in the backyards of people. Don’t mislead the House.
These are real figures, Mr Tolo. Don’t mislead the House by trying to get
promotion. Stick to the facts. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, please.

Dr F J VAN HEERDEN. Mr Tolo, if you would like to do this, please stick to
the facts.
Let me say something to the hon Minister. We from the FF Plus . . .
[Interjections.]

Mr E M SOGONI: Would the hon member take a question?

Dr F J VAN HEERDEN: No, Chairperson. I would like to make some positive
contributions for the Minister.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, on a point of order: I just
want to know if it is parliamentary to use the word “misleading”. I think
there have been some rulings in the past on this word, so I think the hon
member has to withdraw it.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, I think if he is saying
that it is misleading, it’s in order. But I will check with the Table
staff, and then I will respond to your question.

Dr F J VAN HEERDEN: Minister, the Chairperson of the Human Rights
Commission correctly stated that you have a huge responsibility in your
department. [Interjections.]

Mr K SINCLAIR: Chairperson, on a point of order: I just want to find out if
in terms of the Rules of this honourable House a member may refer to an
issue that was dealt with the day before or during the previous days. I
have a strong suspicion that it can’t happen.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon members, I think you must allow the
member to say whatever he wants to say, it is his democratic right to do
so. [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: His time is up.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I will guide the hon member on when his time
has expired.

Dr F J VAN HEERDEN: Chair, the Chairperson of the Human Rights Commission
quite correctly pointed out, and I quote:

  The challenge that is situated at the heart of our constitutional
  contract is how we advance social and economic rights, and in so doing
  ensure we advance the interests of the poor and those many who are still
  to enjoy the full benefits of our democracy.

The inclusion of social and economic rights in the Bill of Rights was a
clear articulation that democracy was as much about the right to vote and
of free expression and of association as it was about the right to shelter,
health, etc. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr C N M PADAYACHEE (Mpumalanga): Chairperson, the Hon Minister and Deputy
Minister, MECs and Hon Delegates, firstly I would like to take this
opportunity to apologise for MEC Pasha. He is actually delivering his
policy and budget speech today in the Mpumalanga legislature and could
therefore not be here.

It is a privilege today to be afforded the opportunity to address this
august House. As many of you have already alluded to, this year we
celebrate the 50th anniversary of the people’s manifesto, the Freedom
Charter. In doing so it is important to take stock of what we have done
over the past ten years of freedom and democracy.
The Charter has eloquently spelled out what kind of a society we envisage.

As we embark on this soul searching exercise we need to honestly agree that
for as long as the majority of our people, in particular women and
children, continue to be affected by abject poverty, disease, illiteracy
and underdevelopment we cannot proclaim that we are realising the vision of
the Freedom Charter. However, after the policy speech of the Minister today
it is clear that the Freedom Charter is a living document, relevant today,
and remains a guiding principle of his department and the government as a
whole. That there shall be comfort and security clearly emanates from his
speech today.

We must also support the crusade, as led by our State President, that
poverty remains the single largest impediment towards the restoration of
the human dignity of our people and do whatever we can do to push back the
frontiers of poverty and underdevelopment. Clearly the department, led by
Minister Skweyiya, is spearheading programmes that give dignity to our
people.

We are also pleased, as was spelled out by the Minister’s Budget Speech
here today, that the department has over the past ten years provided more
than 9 million South Africans, many of them in Mpumalanga, with social
grants. It is also worth noting that the majority of the beneficiaries of
these grants were women and children. As alluded to in his speech, the
poverty alleviation impact of these grants can never be ignored or over-
emphasised.

It is therefore disturbing to note that there are people in our society
who, through their immoral and ingenious deeds, defraud our government of
these very limited resources meant for the weak and infirm in society.
Money stolen from the poor limits the capacity of the state to respond to
more urgent responsibilities, especially towards the poor. We therefore
commend all necessary steps and initiatives that have been taken both by
the national and provincial government in fighting fraud and corruption.

Minister, we must commend you on your progress made in fighting corruption
in this regard. We also want to say thank you to those more than 5 million
people in Mpumalanga who, through the amnesty programme, have come forward
and declared that they were illegally receiving some of these grants. We
are also convinced that the establishment of the S A Social Security Agency
will go a long way in providing the necessary checks and balances in the
overall management of the grants.

We are faced with the challenge of ensuring that our social assistance
programme is sustainable and able to respond to the needs of building the
second economy of the Expanded Public Works Programme. It is also worth
nothing that the department has supported over 51 000 orphans and
vulnerable children in the context of the Expanded Public Works Programme.

To this end we welcome the audits, currently being undertaken by the
department, which seek to integrate our support services in the social
cluster. We welcome the R388 million that has been set aside in this
financial year to address the challenges of providing food security for
some of the families and households in our country, especially rural and
woman-headed families. We also support that idea that this project must be
integrated as part of the broader social assistance programme.

In conclusion, in the last ten years of freedom and democracy, we have put
in place firm policy imperatives that must now be implemented to eradicate
poverty and underdevelopment in our society. As President Thabo Mbeki has
said in the ANC Today:

  We must work to ensure that the spirit of Solomon Mahlangu continues to
  define the morality of our cadres and members of our movement and indeed
  the entire nation.

Inspired by that noble spirit they must occupy the centre front in the
struggle against the parasites Minister Zola Skweyiya spoke about and
others who have abused freedoms to steal from the poor or corrupt our
society. Ndiyabonga. [Thank you.] [Applause.]

Nkskz A N D QIKANI: Mphathisihlalo, Baphathiswa abakhoyo namhlanje,
Mbhexeshi wale Ndlu, bameli bakarhulumente namalungu onke ale Ndlu, isabelo
esiphambi kwethu namhlanje singa singanceda wonke umzi ontsundu waseMzantsi
Afrika, ngakumbi uluntu oluhluphekayo.
Ndiza kugxininisa kakhulu kwiNkqubo engunombolo 4 yesi sabelo, ukutsho oko
uncedo ekuhlinzekwa ngalo uluntu. Nangona sisamkela esi sixa-mali
esijongene nabantu abahluphekileyo nabantwana, besicela ukuba urhulumente
aqwalasele kakhulu indlela amaxabiso ezinto axhome ngayo, nto leyo eyenza
le mali ingoneli ngenxa yomthwalo wabantwana nendlala egqubayo.

Simqhwabela izandla urhulumente ngephulo lakhe lokuncothula neengcambu
urhwaphilizo oluqhutywa ngamagosa karhulumente nangabanye abantu,
olungumkhuba ombi. Urhwaphilizo oluqhutywa ngamagosa karhulumente
lunciphisa inani labantu bakuthi abahluphekileyo engebexhamla.

Siyambongoza urhulumente ukuba ze lungabikho uxolelo kubantu abenza lo
mkhuba, kwaye kufuneka babuyise nemali karhulumente abayithathe
ngobuqhophololo.

Wanga uMphathiswa angayiqwalasela indlela yokunikezelwa kokutya ebantwini
abahluphekayo. Kufuneka kukhutshwe ngabameli bakarhulumente, kungakhutshwa
ngamalungu amaqela ezopolitiko.

Okokugqibela, bendicela ukuba urhulumente abonelele abantu abadala
ngemithungo xa bekwiindawo zokuhlawulwa kwezibonelelo zikarhulumente kuba
xa bekwezi ndawo bayatsha lilanga, bayanethwa ziimvula, nto leyo ebangela
ukuba bathi nokuba bebefuna ukuthenga izinto zokutya kuqala, kunyanzeleke
ukuba baqale kwagqirha kuqala. Enkosi, Mphathiswa. I-UDM iyasixhasa isabelo
sakho. [Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of isiXhosa speech follows.)

[Mrs A N D QIKANI: Chairperson, Ministers present today, the Chief Whip of
this House, government representatives and all the members of this House,
the budget that is before us today can assist every African in South
Africa, especially destitute people.

I am going to emphasize particularly Programme 4 of this budget, which
deals with the assistance which people are getting to share. Although we
welcome this budget that is going to help destitute people and children, we
ask the government to pay particular attention to the inflation rate, which
is high. The latter causes a shortfall of money because of the heavy load
of children and poverty.

We applaud the government for this campaign of rooting out corruption that
is committed by government officials and other people, which is a bad
habit. The corruption that government officials are involved in decreases
the number of our destitute people who are supposed to benefit.

We want to plead with the government that there should be no amnesty to
people who are involved in this bad habit and that they have to reimburse
the government for the money they have taken fraudulently.

I wish that the Minister would pay attention to the way in which food
parcels are handed out to the destitute people. They need to be handed out
by government representatives, not by members of a political party.

Lastly, I ask the government to make provision for elderly people by making
available shelter when they are at the pay points for grants; because when
they are at these places they get burned by the sun, they get wet as a
result of the rain, the end result being that even if they would have liked
to buy food first, they would be forced to go to the doctor first. Thank
you, Minister. The UDM supports your budget.][Applause.]]

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Chairperson, hon Minister, Deputy Minister, colleagues and
comrades, we must base our vision and programmes and actions on the
historic manifesto of the people of South Africa, namely the Freedom
Charter. This demands especially of our vanguard movement that we ensure
that the Freedom Charter plays its role in the formation of the new South
Africa.

Our late President, Oliver Tambo, spelled out the meaning of the Freedom
Charter to our country and the people in 1980 in his statement of 8
January. He marked the 25th anniversary of the Charter during what he
proclaimed as the year of the Freedom Charter and said the following:

    The Freedom Charter contains the fundamental perspective of the vast
    majority of the people of South Africa, the kind of liberation that all
    of us are fighting for. Hence it is not merely the Freedom Charter of
    the ANC and its allies, rather, it is the charter of the people of South
    Africa for liberation. Because it came from the people, it still remains
    a people’s charter, the one basic political statement of our goals to
    which all genuinely democratic and patriotic forces of South Africa
    adhere to.


I am standing here today as a member of the ANC in support of Budget Vote
18. The goal of the social security department is to alleviate poverty
through a safety net of social grants to the most vulnerable groups. Direct
social assistance to citizens in need is essential in a society where
poverty is widespread and employment opportunities are scarce.

Although the long-term aim of the government is for all citizens to be able
to participate productively in the economy, in the meantime social
assistance will continue as a direct source of income to many of our
people. South Africa’s social assistance programme is helping to reduce
poverty, contributing to the social cohesion and having a positive impact
on the economic opportunities of households.

The provision of social grants is the government’s biggest poverty relief
programme, paying out in the region of almost R50 billion per annum to over
nine 9 million South Africans. These include old age pension grants, child
support grants, and disability grants, care dependency grants and foster
care grants. According to the research report, the social and economic
impact of South Africa’s social security system, a 10% increase in the take-
up of old age pensions reduces the poverty gap by 3,2%, while the full take-
up reduces the poverty gap by 6,2%.

The extension of the child support grant to 14 years of age, will also
reduce the poverty gap by almost 57%. Both the state old age pensions and
child support grants are associated with improvements in school attendance,
where the magnitude of the grant’s impact is substantial and statistically
magnificent.
Social grants provide potential labour market participants with the
resources and economic security necessary to invest in a high-risk and high-
reward job search. Living in households that receive social grants is
correlated with a higher success rate in finding employment.

The empirical evidence shown above demonstrates that the people in
households receiving social grants have increased both their labour force
participation and access to employment at a rate faster than those who live
in households, that do not receive social grants.
The Department of Social Development provides social grants to over 9
million beneficiaries monthly at a cost of almost R3,3 billion per month.

Social security plays a critical role in the alleviation of poverty for
children, women, and the elderly, and people with disabilities. Benefit
transfers include old age grants, war veterans grants, care dependency
grants, foster care grants and grant in aid.

The three poorest provinces, KwaZulu-Natal, the Eastern Cape and Limpopo,
account for almost 56% of the total number of beneficiaries in social
grants. The total number of grant beneficiaries has increased from 4,6
million in April 2002 to almost 9,4 million in February 2005. This
represents an increase of almost over a 100% over the last four years.

Additional allocations for social grants are primarily to finance the
inflation-adjusted increases in the value of grants, but also for the
rolling out of the child support grants for the ages of 12 to 14. From 1
April 2005 the value of the child support grant has increased from R170 to
R180, and the value of pensions increased from R740 to R780, and the other
foster care grant payment increased from R130 to R560. Of the R74 billion
in additional allocations over the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework, as
much was 30% is added to the social grant programme. We must congratulate
the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Social Development on that
increment. It is welcome. Our people appreciate these announcements.

The child support grant largely accounts for the increase in the number of
beneficiaries. This number of children receiving payment has increased from
1,1 million - the figure from around three years ago - to almost 4,4
million in April 2004.

Some of the challenges still pending with regard to accessing grants are
access to birth certificates for children and the lack of capacity to
implement the extension of the child support grant.

The high uptake of disability grants has taken priority. A study on this
has been undertaken instead. An unprecedented growth in the disability
grants and the care dependency grant programme has led to a crisis in the
national and provincial budgets. At present there are no indications of the
growth rate slowing to the levels being budgeted for. In addition, this
growth also impacts directly on the country’s overall social policy by
limiting the options to extend the grant system, and to provide an increase
in benefits to offset inflation. Therefore a special and urgent initiative
has been established to affect policy and administrative changes at the
national and provincial levels, in order to restore the integrity and a
manageable growth in this system.

The increase in the take-up rate for disability grants has raised concerns
about the high probability of fraud. We all know that the department, as
well as the Office for the Status of Women, are busy paying attention to
this matter. However, we are faced with some of the challenges. During our
oversight visits, while we were visiting some of the provinces, we
discovered that some of the pay points throughout the provinces are not
well equipped. The infrastructure and toilet facilities are not up to
standard. We still find long queues of people waiting for more than three
to five hours before they get their payouts. These are things that we need
to pay attention to, hon Minister. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Madam Chairperson, I would like to
thank this House for the participation and the interest it has shown in
this Budget Vote. The programme that we are going to carry through in the
coming years, especially this year, will definitely need the individual and
collective support and participation of the members of this House and the
National Assembly in ensuring that those that are defrauding the state in
whatever manner are caught, arrested and pay back, with interest, all the
moneys that they have taken, especially public servants. [Applause.]

So far, as I have announced before, we have 41 000 public servants who are
defrauding the state and who are under investigation for defrauding the
state in one way or another through these grants. We also have 76 000
people who have voluntarily withdrawn from taking grants that they were not
entitled to. We still expect more people, because those that have not
necessarily come forward still have the chance not to go and cash the
money. So, we will be able to remove them from the list of people to whom
we give monthly grants after two or three months.

I have been told that at the moment the number of beneficiaries of the
disability grant that we have removed from the lists is 121 000 people.
From now onwards, we are going to be very, very hard and tough on all
people who cheat the state in whatever manner and we would appeal to
members of Parliament to work with us, the NGOs and councillors.

Surely, I know from the ANC’s position that each and every member of
Parliament, whether it be a member of a provincial legislature, the
National Assembly or the NCOP, is supposed to know about all the vulnerable
children in their areas. I know the majority do not know that. But that
what the ANC expects of you. Each and everyone who voted for the ANC
expects an ANC MP to be able to say: We know that there is a problem in
that house. The only way we can help these people and these children in
such a house is to register those people in that house who do and those who
do not qualify for any grant, and the latter should be removed from the
list and told that they have been removed. That is what we expect.

So, it would be a great service when we go to the ANC congress in June and
July, to be able to say I know my constituency and I know these are the
problems that are there and that these are the people that qualify for
grants. There is also a way to assist even those that do qualify but get
nothing by ensuring that those people that really do need grants or
assistance from the state are reported to the department so that they could
be assisted, specifically through the social relief of distress to which
they are entitled. The majority of our people do not know about this
assistance from the state, especially the African people, because it had
never been open to them. That is why we are running around giving food
through this emergency food programme.

Had we known about those homes that were entitled to these grants, some of
the complaints that have been raised here would not have been made. That is
what the ANC expects from each and every councillor. Each and every member
of Parliament or of the NCOP ought to be able to say: I have been to this
house and children go to bed without anything to eat and I, as an MP, can
put my name down and say these people are entitled to assistance by the
state. This must be so, so that we don’t go around standing in corners
giving food, and in between allowing the discrepancies and the fraud that
are taking place in that emergency food programme that we are running. We
have just found that some of the food that is being given to the people is
very old and rotten, and we are going to take action against those people.

You know, the policy of this government is black empowerment. There are
those blacks that come to us and say they are able to distribute food, and
they ask for their tender to be accepted, but they then find that they are
unable to do so. There is somebody sitting there, very, very far away who
takes all the money. We are then left with a poor guy who is running
around. You should not think that he makes money, he makes no money; he has
been used. They money goes to one of the big companies. I think that is not
right.

Secondly, I would like to say very, very clearly that we are looking at the
issue of early childhood development, and we would like this House to
participate with us as we formulate policies with the Department of
Education so that we can ensure what we wish to do, which is to ensure that
all children of school-going age are at school and that we check through
these grants that they are alive and not ghost children. In other words, we
are going to give this grant mostly to children who are going to school.

Furthermore, I would like to appeal to this House to ensure that the
nutrition programme that the government has been running since 1995,
becomes a reality and that members of Parliament and councillors monitor
that, and that those who have won the tender ensure the quality of the
services that they provide and that the food is up to the standard that has
been set by the Department of Health.

These are the issues that I would like to raise with this House. But more
importantly some, such as the issues about nongovernmental organisations,
quite obviously, are issues that we would like to deal with more
systematically than we are doing at the moment. We would like to assist
NGOs, especially those that are in the rural areas, and make them viable
and independent by providing them with the necessary resources and
capacitating them, that is, giving them the capacity to be able to run and
to account for the resources that would be given to them. That is why the
consultation that is going on at present on financial awards needs a little
bit of participation outside the buildings of the institutions of
Parliament, even in our constituencies.

The question has been asked here as to why we are beginning now with this
whole campaign against fraud. Quite obviously, the campaign has been going
on for a long time. I think many of you know about the question of the task
team that had been sent to the Eastern Cape, and which is now in KwaZulu-
Natal. Many provinces have been doing that, but it was done on a provincial
basis. We were unable to run it in a more uniform manner. But since the
beginning of the setting up of the agency and the Social Assistance Act, it
has been centralised at national level. We are now able to say that this is
what we are doing without any political differentiation.

As you know, for a long time some of the provinces were not definitely
under the auspices or rule of the ANC, and there were basic differences
with the parties that were in power in those provinces with regard to
carrying out a uniform policy. But now that we have an agency, we are able
to do that. And of course, the very fact that there are nine ANC Premiers
makes things much easier. [Applause.]

I am saying these are issues that we ought, all of us, to be part and
parcel of. They are not ANC issues; they are issues for all South Africans.

The food emergency plan is a worry to me. It is something that we ought to
be able to look after and we should be able to report and work with the
department, both at provincial and national levels.

We are aware of the issue raised by Ms Sithole regarding discrepancies in
stipends. We are trying to look into that and we will be able to come back
to this House and report quite clearly on what we are doing about that.

On the issue of socio-economic rights, raised by Ms Madlala-Magubane, we
are looking into that, and I think we are working very closely with the
Human Rights Commission on ensuring that the socio-economic rights of all
people, especially the rights of children, are ensured and access to social
grants is improved as much as possible.

On the issue of deductions, quite obviously, this is an issue that we
raised as early as possible. I think this is not the first time we are
talking about that. We have tried to include that and to regulate that by
law - in the Social Assistance Act and in the Children’s Bill. We hope to
be able to do that more systematically. Although we might not necessarily
support it personally, there were the pleas, basically by older people and
more importantly by people from the churches who pleaded with me many a
time that we should allow that to happen specifically for funeral services,
because quite a number of older people invested a lot of money in those
policies. So, we thought that within those regulations that we are going to
put through, we should at least allow such possibilities that have been
asked for by the ordinary people - the clients that the department serves.

On the issue of a blanket amnesty, there can’t be a blanket amnesty. Mr
Thetjeng, the people that defrauded the system know exactly what they were
doing and, for your information, they are very educated people. As a public
servant, you must have a degree or at least a matric. Once you go into
these issues, you must know exactly what the consequences are. We want all
our money back, and we want it with interest! [Applause.]

On the issue of subsidies for old age homes raised by Mrs Lamoela, the new
policy we were talking about on financial awards, with its costing modules,
will address the issue of underfunding of services provided by NGOs in all
provinces. We hope that this policy will also promote uniformity on how
services should be financed. It is a pity that Mrs Lamoela asked this
question, because just before 1994 they privatised almost all old age homes
and I don’t want to read too much into what the aim was. But the question
is that they privatised them and to a great extent, they lie beyond what
government can do because they are private entities. And I think we have to
find ways in which we could make them available to each and every member of
society irrespective of colour, religious beliefs or gender. But anyway, it
is something we have to look into because the people that suffer are our
own people – the poorest of the poor. And I think we should look into that,
especially the portfolio committee.

The issue of social workers, Mrs Mackay, is an issue that is in front of us
presently. We have agreed in principle that it should go. The money is
there. Last time when I heard about it, the unions were doing it and I
think there has been an agreement of some sort. So, we can say it will be
with their directors-general from this month. But of course, we have a
shortage of social workers. We have to find a way in which we can increase
that number. We want to speak to all the universities around here,
especially those in the disadvantaged provinces, in order to be able to
train people in crash courses that would be acceptable to the Department of
Education in general.

Of course, we are also dealing with the issue of NGOs. We hope to be able,
with this new grant system, to be able to resolve some of these questions.

In principle, I would like to thank this House. Mr Van Heerden talked about
squatter camps and whites. [Laughter.] That there are poor whites is quite
obvious, but I have never seen any whites living in squatter camps. I know
that there are many whites who are poor. I have visited them on many
occasions. But they seem to have been sheltered in one way or another as
far as housing is concerned. I know there are some areas in Pretoria where
there are flats where they live. At least there is shelter for them, but
what conditions they live under is something that leaves much to be
desired. But comparing that to squatter camps might be going a little bit
too far. I think we should discuss that more.

In principle, if there are any further questions we can talk about them and
we can discuss them; my office is here in 120 Plein Street, on the 10th
floor. Thank you, Madam Chairperson. [Applause.]
Debate concluded.

The Council adjourned at 12:36.
