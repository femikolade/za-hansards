              INCIDENCES OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND CHILDREN

                             (Draft Resolution)


The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Thank you, Chairperson. I would like to  move
without notice:

    That the Council–


    (1)     notes the increasing incidences in recent times of violence
          perpetrated by men against women and children;


    (2)     expresses its shock and utmost disdain for these heinous anti-
          social and soul-destroying acts against our women and children;


    (3)     further expresses extreme concern over this trend that leads to
          unnecessary loss of life, especially of young innocent children,
          due to uncontrolled adult anger;


    (4)     calls on all South Africans to build on the foundation of
          negotiating through problems, mutual understanding,
          collaboration, collective responsibility, and the ethos of a
          united nation on which this new democracy has been founded in the
          early 1990s; and


    (5)     further urges concerned stakeholders in civil society (churches,
          NGOs, social workers, etc), government and the private sector  to
          increase its collective attention on this problem  and  focus  on
          isolating the possible causes with an aim to finding  sustainable
          solutions  that  would  eradicate  this  trend  from  our   young
          democratic society.


Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                                CHILD LABOUR


                          (Subject for Discussion)
The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Before I call upon the Minister, I  would  like
to acknowledge the children in the gallery who are here today, and who  have
come to listen to the debate. I have had an  opportunity  to  interact  with
them this morning. You are welcome in the NCOP Chamber.

As I told you this morning,  we  take  things  seriously  in  the  portfolio
dealing with children and people with disabilities located in the Office  of
the Presidency and indeed the Minister in the Office  of  the  President  is
going to address this debate today and you will  be  listening  to  him  and
other members of the Council debating.

Hon Minister, there is a small podium here to  make  you  feel  comfortable.
[Applause.]

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Chairperson, hon members of  the  NCOP,  let
me join you, once more, in greeting the children. I also  had  the  pleasure
to meet them this morning. All  I  can  say  is  that  they  ask  much  more
difficult questions than MPs. [Laughter.]

For those of you who are going to participate in the debate, if you are  not
up to scratch for the children, I am going to have to say so - and  if  they
think I am not up to scratch they are going to have to say so.

Hon members, thank you very much for the opportunity to participate in  this
debate on the International Day of the Child. As you  are  aware,  in  South
Africa we celebrate  National  Children’s  Day  on  the  first  Saturday  in
November every year. It is also time for us  more  publicly  to  demonstrate
our solidarity with the rest of the international community  by  mobilising,
advocating and promoting the celebration of International Children’s Day.

Children are not the private property of their parents. They have the  right
to expect support, care and love from their parents, but they also have  the
right to expect other sources of support and care from their government  and
society. It is often said that a government must be judged by the extent  to
which it cares for the wellbeing of its most marginalised and vulnerable  in
society. And in our case that really and truly refers to all  our  children,
but particularly  those  of  our  children  who  live  under  conditions  of
poverty.

The late Oliver Tambo, former President  of  the  ANC,  once  wrote,  and  I
quote:

    The children of any nation are its future. A country, a movement, a
    person that does not value its youth and children does not deserve its
    future.

To be truly deserving of our future we have sought to  ensure  that  in  our
Constitution children have rights, and the state has obligations to  protect
and meet those rights.

In particular section 28 notes, that:

   Every child has the right to basic nutrition, shelter, basic health  care
   services and social services.

For us children’s rights are an integral part of human rights.  By  spelling
out the rights of children in our Constitution we have moved  decisively  in
the direction of the vision for the future of  our  children  so  eloquently
expressed by the late Comrade Oliver  Tambo  who,  speaking  in  1987  at  a
conference in Harare on “Children,  Repression  and  the  Law  in  Apartheid
South Africa”, said:

   We cannot be true liberators unless the liberation we will achieve
   guarantees all children the rights to life, health, happiness and free
   development, respecting the individuality, inclinations and capabilities
   of each child.

The wellbeing and the rights of the South African child  remain  significant
challenges in our second decade of democracy.  Too  large  a  group  of  our
children in South Africa  still  live  under  dire  conditions  of  poverty,
without  access  to  basic  social  services.  We  have   a   constitutional
obligation to make sure  that  we  improve  the  living  conditions  of  our
children, to enable them to develop their talents and  capacities  to  their
full potential.

We recognise that there  are  many  interrelated  factors  that  combine  in
complicated ways to produce children  in  good  health  who  are  confident,
content, competent, resilient and socially responsible  and  ready  to  take
their rightful place as valued and contributing members of our  society.  We
also recognise that  child  poverty  does  not  exist  in  isolation.  Child
poverty is a reflection of family poverty and poverty  and  underdevelopment
in society at large.

Poverty and underdevelopment deplete  the  talents  and  capacities  of  our
children; it robs our children of their rights and their  futures.  Children
must be protected, nurtured and assisted  to  become  beneficiaries  of  and
contributors to the creation of a  truly  non-racial  and  non-sexist  South
Africa – thus our consistent and determined focus on addressing poverty  and
underdevelopment in society.

We are working to provide early intervention and  early-childhood  education
and care services designed to support parents by helping  to  reduce  social
exclusion   linked   to   poverty,   unemployment,   marginal    employment,
disempowerment  and  social  isolation.  Dependable  care  for  children  is
essential  if  mothers  are  to  participate  in  the  labour  force.   Poor
accessibility to adequate child care contributes to  gender  exclusion  from
the workforce  and  to  marginalisation  of  women  across  social  classes.
Without early intervention and early childhood education and care  services,
parents  living  in  poverty  do  not  have  access  to  opportunities   for
education, training or paid work.

Investing in  the  education  of  our  children  is  key  to  providing  the
intellectual and social stimulation that form the foundation of  the  future
success of our children. Improving access to  education  also  improves  the
life quality for our children in the here-and-now. Our government  is  going
beyond basic  health  and  safety  requirements,  to  supporting  children’s
development and learning.

Our programme of action has to be multifaceted and targeted at children,  as
well as adults and families. Undoubtedly,  protection  and  social  security
remain important foci because a significant  number  of  our  children  come
from families living in poverty, and for  whom  social  security  provisions
remain the only means of income. Thus by default, and through  no  fault  of
their own, these children  inhabit  the  second  economy  with  all  of  its
devastating impacts.

Breaking the vicious cycles of poverty and underdevelopment and closing  the
socio-economic distances and gaps between the  first  and  second  economies
are essential pre- and co-requisites  to  improving  the  wellbeing  of  the
children of our nation to  ensure  that  we  meet  our  obligations  to  the
children of our country in general and  specifically  to  girl-children  and
other children facing multiple disadvantages.

We have committed to the extension of the child  support  grant  within  two
years with an additional 3,2  million  children  becoming  eligible  as  the
upper-age limit reaches 14. In the next three  years  we  will  spend  R14,2
billion to help our people to gain access to basic shelter.

We are working to halve poverty in our country by 2014. We are investing  in
the National School Nutrition Programme, including social  mobilisation  for
food gardens. We are developing a plan  for  implementation  with  community
participation in 21 nodes. And, we are committed to ensuring that  there  is
no learner or student learning under a tree, in a mud-built school or  under
any dangerous conditions. We are intensifying efforts to deal with logjams.

By meeting these targets we will  have  made  progress  and  created  better
living conditions for our children. But this is not sufficient.  We  need  a
robust, rigorous monitoring and evaluation framework to track  the  advances
of the wellbeing of our children. Our challenge in the year to  come  is  to
build on  the  capacity  of  local  government  to  deliver  programmes  and
services to children in need.

In the past decade, South Africa has been able to respond  appropriately  to
international instruments that deal with children's issues.  The  Office  on
the Rights of the Child in the Presidency was established with a mandate  to
ensure that our government structures advance the interests of  children  in
South Africa. It also monitors the implementation of the  UN  Convention  on
the Rights of the Child,  which  we  ratified  in  1995.  We  are  currently
completing our second country report to the UN committee.

Let us recall the wise saying “It takes a village  to  raise  a  child”.  So
when our children go to bed hungry and are  not  well  fed;  when  they  are
begging and not in school; when they repeatedly sleep  on  the  streets  and
not at home; when they are malnourished  and  not  healthy;  when  they  are
abused and are not safe, we are all culpable and we are all responsible.  As
communities we have to ask: “What are we doing to support our children?”

As government we put considerable resources into education, health care  and
other programmes that directly  benefit  children.  We  can,  and  do,  pass
legislation to realise the rights of the child and we implement policies  to
protect our children against  all  forms  of  abuse  and  exploitation.  The
Office on the Rights of the Child continues to play a role in ensuring  that
issues  on  the  rights  of  the  child  remain  on  the  agendas   of   the
legislatures, executives and the judiciary.

But if we say that it takes a village to raise a child then  we  must  build
lasting and meaningful partnerships  with  organisations  in  civil  society
that work with and on behalf of children. We must  mobilise  more  community
resources for early-childhood education, care  and  activities  through  the
Expanded Public Works Programme.  We  must  pull  together  to  convert  the
mandate of this government into meaningful  and  measurable  programmes  for
our children.

Indeed, let us all work together and continue  to  develop  a  human-centred
approach to our policies, programmes and our work which put children  first.
Protecting and advancing the rights of children to  develop  and  thrive  in
safe, secure and healthy environments must be a top priority for all of  us.
Let us be mindful of the words  of  Charles  Dickens,  who  wrote  in  Great
Expectations:


   In their little worlds in which children have their existence,  there  is
   nothing so finely perceived and so finely felt as injustice.

We have a collective responsibility to future generations to strengthen  our
measures, to protect and look  after  our  children;  and  in  so  doing  to
prepare them to contribute to the  building  of  a  non-racial,  non-sexist,
people-centred South Africa. I thank you for your attention. [Applause.]

Mr D D GAMEDE: Chairperson, hon  Ministers  present,  hon  Minister  in  the
Presidency, MECs from the provinces, colleagues and comrades, in  the  early
fifties one of the architects of apartheid,  one  oppressor,  one  criminal,
Hendrik Verwoerd, said, and I quote:


   Let us create a system of education that will make a black person  and  a
   black child more inferior than he is,  for  we  only  need  him  for  his
   labour.


One of the greatest leaders in Africa, and in the world, a freedom  fighter,
a liberator and a president, the President of the Republic of South  Africa,
the hon Thabo Mbeki, in his state of the nation address on 6 February  2004,
said:


   We commit ourselves to successfully addressing the  important  challenges
   of, amongst others, the disempowerment of our  children  and  the  proper
   care for our children.


Those are two people speaking from South Africa in  different  contexts.  No
one can get away from the fact that the huge inequalities  that  persist  in
South Africa between the rich and the  poor  originated  in  the  system  of
apartheid. Because of that system, South Africa is still plagued by  a  high
level of poverty amongst the majority of its people.

Poverty has a particularly harsh  effect  on  the  lives  of  our  children.
Poverty causes our children  to  be  less  cared  for.  They  are  not  well
protected and their development and education is  not  what  it  should  be.
Many poor children are forced onto the streets to live and  work  for  their
survival. Here they become vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.

These children often stop going to school and as  a  result  give  up  their
hope for a better future and so continue their vicious  circle  of  poverty.
Many of them are used by adults to do the worst kinds of jobs. This  happens
when they are supposed to be at school where they are safe,  cared  for  and
being educated, and developed to  play  an  important  role  in  this  ever-
developing democracy of ours.

In addition to this, we cannot ignore the fact that the number  of  children
involved in child labour and the number of children living  on  the  streets
is increasing dramatically. One can say it is due to the  death  of  parents
or caregivers or as a result of  HIV  and  Aids.  As  the  ANC  we  are  not
ignoring these problems, in spite of the  lies  spread  about  this  ANC-led
government from irresponsible quarters. Some of these  irresponsible  people
are in this House. [Laughter.] We are  recognising  these  problems  and  we
have programmes in place that deal with them.

No matter how many times one repeats  a  lie,  it  shall  never  become  the
truth. You keep on repeating a lie, a lie, a lie and it shall remain a  lie.
At one stage the lives of the children were ruled by the helicopter and  the
Hippos, and at once stage a certain lance corporal Leon  was  moving  around
in the country, pointing to places where black  people  and  black  children
were  to  be  placed.  [Interjections.]  At  one  point,  children  .  .   .
[Interjections.]

Mr O M THETJENG: Chairperson, I am rising on a point  of  order:  I  request
the member not to mislead the House with the statement he  is  making  about
one of the leaders of the political parties. The statement was made  in  the
House, and I request that the member withdraws that.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! It is very difficult  in  a  debate  for
the presiding officer to differentiate the points put by the members.  I  am
not too sure whether the member is misleading the House. I do not  have  the
background of everything. Hon member, are  you  prepared  to  withdraw  that
statement?

Mr D D GAMEDE: Hon Chairperson, I  referred  to  a  certain  lance  corporal
Leon. I am not sure whether . . . [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: You are  not  prepared  to  withdraw.  Are  you
prepared to withdraw that statement?

Mr D D GAMEDE: If ordered by the Chair, I will withdraw.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Okay, just withdraw and let  us  continue  with
the debate.

Mr D D GAMEDE: I withdraw, Sir.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Continue.

Mr E M SOGONI: On a point of order, Chairperson: The member  said  that  the
member is misleading  this  House.  I  just  want  you  to  rule  if  it  is
parliamentary to say the member is  misleading  the  House,  because  it  is
tantamount to saying that the member is lying.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: No, that is  not  correct.  Many  members  have
also said that in the House. All I am saying is  that  I  am  not  too  sure
whether that statement is misleading. That is why I have put a  question  to
the member. He is not out of order on that point. Continue, hon member.

Mr D D GAMEDE: Hon chairperson, our children are our future  no  matter  how
poor they are, where they live  and  what  conditions  they  live  in.  This
government will do its utmost to ensure that they are  not  taken  advantage
of.

Child labour in South Africa is regulated by the  Conditions  of  Employment
Act, Act 55 of 1998. It is illegal to let children work even if  that  child
needs to sustain him- or herself simply  because  the  parents  are  ill  or
unemployed. The state will come down hard on individuals who take  advantage
of such vulnerable children.

Much  progress  has  been  made  since  1994.  The  ANC-led  government  has
formulated policies and programmes for children through the  Departments  of
Justice, Social Development, Health, Education, and  Sport  and  Recreation,
and many other departments.

The judiciary has been challenged to  rule  on  issues  affecting  children,
such as the Grootboom case. I need to mention that this morning some of  the
questions that we got from the children were where one child said he  is  16
years old and does not have a birth certificate, and another is about to  be
18 years old and does not have the correct surname  in  the  identity  book.
These are the problems that the children face.

An important function of government is the establishment  of  the  necessary
legal framework within which civil society  organisations  can  function  to
protect children.

It is important to reflect on especially  the  difficulty  of  children  and
youth who become involved in criminal activities due to  poverty  and  their
vulnerability. The ANC-led government recognises that their imprisonment  is
problematic.  In  this  regard,  we  were  encouraged  by  the  Minister  of
Correctional Services yesterday that priority is given to  children,  youth,
females and the disabled and the  aged  in  the  categories  considered  for
special remission.

The education of children especially living in  the  streets  is  a  further
problem. While several NGOs and  community-based  organisations  attempt  to
provide some education for them this remains a problem  that  needs  serious
action.  Without  a  consistent  effort  to  ensure  their  development  and
nurturing these children remain vulnerable to being abused in various  forms
of child labour.

I wish all the boys and girls, most of them in the gallery, a bright  future
and to all the caregivers and the hard workers in the NGOs and CBOs, I  wish
to strengthen you by saying that you have  the  support  of  the  government
since you are also supporting the government. It is a  difficult  task  that
needs more hands. We know that it takes  a  whole  village  to  care  for  a
child.

When the Congress of the People said South Africa belongs to  all  it  meant
that it belongs to children also. When the Congress of the People  said  the
doors of learning shall be opened, it also meant that they would be open  to
children and children with disabilities. [Applause.]

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, I don’t want to  take  hon  members’  time.
But I’m rising on point of order. The hon member said hon Gamede was in  the
House when he had said there was a certain  corporal  Leon  who  was  flying
around, pointing to where there were children. But we don’t  know  who  this
corporal Leon is because there are so many Leons in this country.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon member, let’s not open a  debate  on  that.
I’ve made a ruling on that issue. I now call upon the hon Chen.

Ms  S  S  CHEN:  Hon  Chairperson,  hon  Minister  and  hon   members,   our
distinguished guests, ladies  and  gentlemen,  child  labour  and  important
issues such as this should  not  be  reserved  only  for  the  International
Children’s Day. It should be our concern every day; we should pay  attention
to the issue of child labour in our country at all times.

What is child labour? According to the  International  Labour  Organisation,
child labour is work that deprives any person under the age of 18  years  of
his or her childhood and dignity, hinders the child’s access to  educational
attainment, and is performed under conditions  that  are  hazardous  to  the
child’s health and  development.  I’m  certain  that  we  all  believe  that
children should be free to learn and play in an environment in which  threat
and exploitation are minimal, in order to develop their full potential.  Our
legislation reflects this plea and  protects  South  African  children  well
against child labour.
However, there are still challenges ahead that we need to  address.  In  the
year 2003, research commissioned by the Department of Labour found that  36%
of the South African children are involved in child  labour  as  defined  by
the International Labour Organisation.

Poverty plays a crucial role in driving children into  exploitative  labour,
and poverty is certainly  not  a  foreign  concept  in  South  Africa.  Huge
inequalities presently continue in South Africa between the rich  and  poor,
which was created by the system of apartheid before. Poverty  in  particular
impedes  the  care,  protection  and  development  of  children.  Many  poor
children are forced onto the streets to live and work for their survival.

Child labour, therefore,  results  from  a  multitude  of  factors  such  as
economic, political and social reasons. In some  families  children  may  be
expected to pull their weight either in preparation of  their  future  as  a
provider or to contribute to their household’s income. Unfortunately, I’m  a
typical example of such a situation, and had begun my career at the  age  of
13 to support my family. The issue of child labour therefore is  very  close
to my heart.

To  eradicate  child  labour,  the  following  recommendations   have   been
suggested: public education of children and the community of  the  right  of
children to be protected from  child  labour,  and  the  dangers  that  some
working conditions cause to them;  government  developing  and  implementing
locally sensitive and rigorous  legislation,  which  must  be  enforced  and
monitored; the appointment of child labour inspectors  expected  to  monitor
working conditions of employee children, those between 15 and  18  years  of
age, while ensuring that children younger than 15 years  are  not  employed;
provision of good  quality  primary  and  secondary  education  which  teach
children practical skills, as well as their rights;  provision  of  economic
alternatives  through  the  sustainable  poverty  alleviation  strategy,  to
families that are dependent on  child  income  for  economic  survival;  and
finally, funds and resources must be made available to research and  monitor
the extent of the problem of child labour.

Our children are our future and to ensure a bright future for our  beautiful
country, we must treat our children with  love  and  care,  protecting  them
against all harm. Child labour exploits our  children  and  threatens  their
future. This must be stopped. Thank you. [Applause.]

Ms A N T  MCHUNU:  Hon  Chairman,  hon  members,  hon  Ministers  and  other
Ministers who are here, the discussion on  child  labour  has  come  at  the
right time to ring bells about what is happening around us. Children have  a
cause that is equal to their developmental  status  in  society.  These  are
done under the guidance of parents, extended  family  members  or  siblings.
Where a child has no identified parental protection  through  the  death  of
parents or sheer rejection by parents, children experience problems and  are
exposed to the harsh, cold and cruel world.
Wars in Europe caused parental deaths and children ended up in  streets  and
were eventually employed in factories to earn a living. Feeding  and  proper
care of these children were nobody’s concern except that they were tools  of
production. This hard labour produced hard-hearted  characters  who  had  no
mercy for anyone except for the grace of God.

In our country today, we have homeless  children  who  litter  the  streets.
Some children come from cold households that are not homes but just a  house
or a shelter for them to  hide  their  heads.  They  have  never  known  any
bonding or human warmth in life. They have never known  love  and  the  hug,
but are being given any amount of money they ask for to spend any  way  they
like.

Those children have living parents but they  are  dead  in  their  parenting
skills. To these children money becomes the thing in  their  lives,  and  so
they leave school to get paying jobs to buy what they like and  what  is  in
style.

HIV/Aids is  also  a  contributing  factor  with  regard  to  child  labour.
Children experience difficulties after their parents die  of  Aids  and  are
left with no choice but to go and  seek  employment,  especially  for  those
kids who have younger siblings to take care of. Then adults  take  advantage
of their situation and abuse them, making them to do all  their  dirty  work
for them.

Others end up in prostitution and abuse drugs since they  cannot  stand  the
situation they are faced with. And in times of  conflict,  when  communities
become unstable, it is children who leave school  and  their  families,  who
are employed by bosses who use them in  conflict  as  child  labour  to  run
battles or gun  down  opponents.  These  children  are  destroyed  in  their
formative stages as they can never repair their personas  after  being  used
as killing machines.

Child labour of any form hardens  and  destroys  the  growing  person  in  a
child. The destruction of that persona in childhood results in an adult  who
never matures and is never satisfied with anything in life. Poverty of  love
in the midst of  plenty  of  material  goods  results  in  children  leaving
households to do jobs outside.

Families have to be assisted to be nurses of love  and  be  caring  so  that
children become real children in a family setting, doing  what  is  expected
of children till they finish school and get into the adult  world  as  adult
job seekers. Families should therefore  be  able  to  feed  their  children,
clothe them and provide a warm, loving home.

Communities have to provide support to children who  have  lost  parents  or
who appear neglected. Extended families or  childcare  centres  have  to  be
kept to help with nutritious  feeding  of  children  and  general  physical,
mental, emotional and spiritual care.  The  government  is  endeavouring  to
satisfy the needs of children, but this  has  to  be  done  with  the  close
collaboration of parents, extended family members or guardians.  It  is  the
duty of all of us to assist children individually or as organisations.

We love our children. Children belong  to  us.  No  one  should  injure  our
children or abuse them. The world belongs to our loved  ones.  And  I  thank
you for listening to us, and to our children, who  have  already  gone,  but
children are ours and they  belong  to  our  world.  Thank  you  very  much.
[Applause.]

Mr K SINCLAIR: Chairperson, there is an African proverb  that  says:  “There
is no wealth where there are no children.”  When  we  debate  the  issue  of
children and their rights today, we engage one another about  tomorrow,  the
future and hope. Because  of  the  past  of  oppression,  huge  inequalities
presently persist in South Africa between the rich and the poor. Poverty  is
the greatest cause for atrocities against children.

Many poor children are forced into the streets. Here they become  vulnerable
to abuse and exploitation. These children often stop going to school and  as
a result give up hope for a better future, and so they continue the  vicious
cycle of poverty.

The number of children involved in child labour and the number  of  children
living on the street is increasing dramatically due to the death of  parents
or caregivers as a result of HIV and Aids. A  study  which  was  called  the
“Survey of Activities of Young People”  estimated  that  about  3,4  million
children  are  working  in  economic  activities  ranging  from  subsistence
farming and trade to manufacturing.

What is, however, of great concern is the  number  of  children  engaged  in
exploitive child labour. According to the above-mentioned  study,  close  to
250 000 children were engaged in child labour.  I  agree  with  the  Network
Against Child Labour that this is a gross underestimation. It must be more.

The point is,  however,  that  as  a  caring  government  it  is  of  utmost
importance that we must  realise  and  acknowledge  the  problem,  and  also
address it.

The Children’s Bill is certainly a huge step in the right direction,  but  I
want to plead for a more practical approach. Firstly, local government  must
play a greater role regarding  child  labourers  and  other  children  under
especially  difficult  circumstances.  Why,  hon   Minister,   can’t   local
governments assist in ensuring  that  shelters  and  places  of  safety  are
established in communities?

Secondly, schools, teachers, principals and governing bodies are obliged  to
identify children who are absent from school regularly. These  children  are
usually the victims of exploitation.

Thirdly, hon Minister, and for today’s debate,  the  most  important  issue,
there are about 15 million children out of a population  of  43  million  in
South Africa. Given that the number  is  close  to  a  third  of  our  total
population, hasn’t the time arrived that government  consider  a  children’s
Ministry? If we look around in the streets, in the townships, in  the  rural
areas, I really believe that it is necessary.

An intersectoral approach between government, NGOs and CBOs, culminating  in
an overarching policy-driven department, might  be  the  answer.  Maybe  the
words of Kahlil Gibran, when he wrote about children in  The  Prophet,  will
come true. He said:


   You may give them your love but not your thoughts,
   For they have their own thoughts.
   You may house their bodies but not their souls,
   For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you  cannot  visit,
   not even in your dreams.
   You may strive to be like them,
   but seek not to make them like you.
   For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.


I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms F NYANDA: Hon Chairperson, hon Ministers, delegated  guests,  members  of
the House, I am speaking today about the problem  of  child  labour.  But  I
also want to speak about  the  effects  of  HIV/Aids,  poverty,  and  sexual
exploitation, and how it leads to our children becoming  involved  in  child
labour and sometimes crime.

Right at the beginning, I want to say that whilst those problems are  there,
our government has placed admirable safety networks in place to protect  our
children.

Imiphumela   lemibi   lebangelwa   sendvulela   ngculaza   kanye    nengcula

Siswati paragraphs follows.)

[The negative results of HIV/Aids on children need all organisations that
care for children affected by this pandemic to find new and better ways to
deal with the bad aspects of and the great damage caused by this problem.

The economic and social effects of HIV/Aids are hunger, having to move from
place to place, not having a home, or a family, not getting a chance to be
adequately educated and not getting health care. The psychological
disturbances caused by this pandemic include fear, guilt, and emotional
stress, which we call depression, and permanent psychological damage.

The results of the combination of all these things that I have mentioned
above lead to children being vulnerable to things like HIV/Aids,
illiteracy, child labour, and other forms of child abuse.

The first place where children must be protected is at home, by families
and relatives. It happens that when difficulties amongst children become
worse, the communities are able to come in quickly and assist.
[Interjections.]]
The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Hon member,  I  am  just  informed  that
there is a problem with the interpretation. Could one of the  staff  members
please deal with that? Continue, hon member.

Mk F NYANDA: Letinsita letingakahleleki ngito leticala  kucala  kusita  labo
bantfwana labahlukumetekile,  tibe  kantsi  futsi  ngito  letisita  linyenti
lalabantfwana. Kusitwa nguhulumende kanye netinhlangano  letitsite  temango,

(Translation of Siswati paragraphs follows.)

[These unorganised services are the ones that start helping  those  children
who are abused, and they are also the ones that help the majority  of  these
children. Being assisted by the government and some community  organisations
also helps to add where the  community  efforts  have  not  yet  reached  in
helping children that have been abused.

The ANC-led government and the ANC have  made  a  great  effort  in  helping
children who are abused so illegally.]

The economic and social effects  of  HIV  and  Aids  infection  in  children
include  malnutrition,  migration,  homelessness  and  reduced   access   to
education and health care. Psychological effects include  depression,  guilt
and  fear,  possibly  leading  to  long-term  mental  health  problems.  The
combination of those effects on children increases their vulnerability to  a
range of consequences, including HIV,  illiteracy,  poverty,  child  labour,
and other types of exploitation, and the prospect of unemployment when  they
are grown up.

The  first  line  of  support  for  vulnerable  children  is  their  family,
including extended families and distant  relatives,  while  households  that
struggle to meet the  needs  of  vulnerable  children  may  be  assisted  by
members of their community.

These informal safety net  mechanisms  are  responsible  for  the  care  and
support of the majority of  vulnerable  children  in  South  Africa.  Formal
mechanisms, such as those provided by government  and  civil  society,  also
provide services, especially for children living in  situations  of  extreme
vulnerability.

The ANC-led government provides particularly strong support to children  who
are vulnerable to child labour  due  to  their  impoverished  and  unhealthy
conditions. We must recognise that because the scale of  the  challenges  is
so huge, it is necessary for an integrated manner  to  be  followed  in  our
method of struggling against its effects on our children.

Mr  Gamede  referred  to  this  integration  between  different  levels   of
government and with the NGOs and CBOs.

I want to raise the issue of especially a girl-child,  who  is  particularly
vulnerable. Our government was amongst the  122  governments  that  ratified
the Declaration and Agenda for Action of the First  World  Congress  Against
Commercial and Sexual Exploitation of Children, held in August 1996.

After that congress, South Africa adopted a  comprehensive  action  plan  to
combat and prevent the sexual exploitation  of  children  in  South  Africa,
which  the  government  and  NGOs  developed  jointly.  We  put   monitoring
mechanisms in place and have forwarded information to organisations such  as
End  Child  Prostitution,  Child  Pornography,  and  Child  Trafficking   of
Children for Sexual Purposes International.

To add to the aspect of integration  levels  of  governance  and  structures
aimed at ensuring a safety network for vulnerable children, which Mr  Gamede
referred to, I want to refer to other ways in  which  we  ensure  children’s
protection against child labour.

The commercial sexual exploitation of children is a form  of  child  labour.
The government of South Africa has established specialised  sexual  offences
courts,  one-stop  crisis  centres  and  shelters  for  victims  of   abuse,
including  sexual  abuse.  Service  providers,  including  police  officers,
judicial officers, prosecutors,  social  workers  and  health  workers  were
trained especially to ensure the success  of  our  programmes.  We  have  in
place a  national  committee  on  child  abuse  and  neglect  consisting  of
government and NGOs. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Chairperson,  if  you  don’t  mind,  to  the
children, I should like to say that sitting next to me is  the  Minister  of
Health, and if any of you have problems with your health, you  should  write
to her. [Laughter.] And also sitting here are all the  MECs  for  health,  I
think, from all nine provinces. [Applause.]

I am very glad that you slotted this debate in while they are here.  I  hope
that they have taken the opportunity to listen to what we have to say  about
children.

First of all, let me thank all of the  speakers  who  participated  in  this
debate and all those speakers who spoke and paid very special  attention  to
challenges that arise from the use  and  exploitation  of  child  labour.  I
think it is very correct that we need to  continuously  fight  the  use  and
exploitation of child labour.

What I didn’t hear from all the hon members is what they  are  going  to  do
about it. Mr Sinclair says it’s the responsibility of local government,  but
this House is supposed to be responsible for dealing with local  government;
monitoring, evaluating and interacting. Don’t ask me. I think  you’d  better
ask yourselves what you are going to do, what you need to do,  how  you  are
going to do it, how you are going to go to local  government,  and  how  you
are going to go to provincial government and get them to do what  you  think
they should do.

I am really raising this because I think we ourselves  should  ask  what  we
should do, not what someone else is. This Minister will go and  sit  in  the
Union Buildings in Pretoria again. So, I think  it  is  important  for  this
House to ask itself these questions.

In the course of our own work and this critical work around the whole  issue
of implementation of government policies, around the  issues  of  monitoring
and evaluation, around the  question  of,  for  example,  child  labour,  we
should determine what is being done or not  being  done  and  how  we  then,
within the three spheres of government, ensure that government  itself  does
what its own legislation asks it to do. I think that it  is  very  important
that we should do that and I think it  is  very  important  that  we  should
concentrate some of our attention on  the  issue  of  child  labour.  So,  I
really cannot but agree with what has been said here.

Hon Sinclair, I like my job very much and  one  of  the  responsibilities  I
have is that of the Office on the Rights of  the  Child.  If  I  go  to  the
President and say he should create a Ministry for children, I might lose  my
job. [Laughter.] So what I suggest we do is that when my  time  expires,  we
then demand a child Ministry so that somebody else can come  in.  No,  I  am
not going to take this message to the President. I  really  am  not  in  the
business of doing myself out of a job, and if I am out of a job, how will  I
get to come here and address you?

I want to take this opportunity to address the children before  they  leave.
Mr Gamede and the chairperson of the committee from the  National  Assembly,
Wilma, made some promises to the children when we met them this morning.  It
had to do with the issue that Mr Gamede had raised. For  example,  there  is
the 15-year-old who does not have a birth certificate, or the child who  has
the  wrong  name  on  the  identity  document.  What   our   two   wonderful
chairpersons have undertaken on your behalf - I think they have a  right  to
undertake it on your behalf - is to deal with all of  these  questions  that
will be raised with MPs.

The MPs themselves, when they go out and do their constituency work  and  go
out to where they come from, should then  be  sensitive  to  some  of  these
problems that our children are facing.  If  you  heard  them  this  morning,
you’d know they were really very concerned that either they do not have  the
birth certificate because the processes are  perhaps,  in  their  view,  not
sufficiently in place, or if the wrong name is on the ID, it means that  for
the rest of their lives they are going to suffer  some  severe  consequences
because they will not have an ID, which we require for  all  the  things  we
want.

So, hon Gamede, I am just following you, chief, and  I  am  supporting  you,
but you have got to use your power to mobilise because I think it should  be
a very important part of our responsibility as members of  Parliament,  when
we go out, to ensure that people are registered; to ensure  that  those  who
qualify for social security grants get it; to ensure that we  get  into  the
schools and where we are not giving our children,  who  deserve  it,  proper
nutrition, we should take this issue up, so that when we  say  “putting  our
children first”, we mean what we say. So, in our  own  work  as  members  of
Parliament, all of us, myself included, let us in the  course  of  our  work
put our children first.

Once more, Chairperson, as you know, I always find it a very great  pleasure
to come to the NCOP. I like this House  very  much.  Thank  you  very  much.
[Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Thank you, hon Minister. That is  a  compliment
to us, and we also like you to come and address us from  time  to  time.  We
really wish to thank you very much for coming to lead this debate.

Hon Deputy Minister, now you are disturbing me whilst I am  talking  to  the
Minister. He did not hear what I was saying, and now he is leaving.

Debate concluded.


                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                               (Policy debate)

Vote No 16 – Health:

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Just before I call upon the Minister, there  is
one remark, Minister, that I would like to make. I want to repeat this  -  I
said it yesterday - and I am repeating this  precisely  because  I  want  to
drive the message home.

Yesterday I encouraged the MECs that were here when  we  were  debating  the
Water Affairs and Forestry Budget Vote and the Transport Budget Vote, and  I
want to repeat it today. I have been in the Council  for  three  years,  and
one thing I have noticed is that health MECs are the ones  who  attend  when
the Budget Vote is being debated in the Council. [Applause.]

I have calculated that there are six out of nine here, which  is  very  good
attendance. I know that you have busy schedules, but the point I  am  making
is that when the national Minister delivers his or her  budget  speech,  and
MECs are here,  it  makes  great  sense  to  us  as  permanent  and  special
delegates to get the provincial perspective as well.  And,  not  only  that,
the NCOP is a national debating forum that  brings  together  your  national
government, your provincial government and your local government spheres  in
one House for a debate. For us to understand these issues, when we play  our
oversight role and function, we shall have heard both perspectives.

Now I want to congratulate you, and convey the wish that  you  pass  on  the
message to other MECs that they should do the same. I know you are  busy  in
your provinces. It is only once a year that this time comes, and  on  behalf
of the House I really want to congratulate you.

Minister, also to you, I know you wrote to me and raised  the  concern  that
we did not invite you when we went to Umhlanga, especially  when  you  would
really like to participate in NCOP matters. I  have  already  apologised  on
behalf of the Council; we will not forget you next time. We will  definitely
invite you. I want to express appreciation for the concern you  raised  with
me and for the way you love the NCOP in  terms  of  participating  in  these
issues. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Now I call upon the Minister to address us. How you  get  them  all  here  I
don’t know. You must tell us.

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Chairperson, it is because we are  a  winning  team.
[Laughter.]

Chairperson, members of the NCOP, MECs for health, ladies and gentlemen,  we
observed two health days this week. On Monday we held  functions  nationwide
to promote physical exercise.  The  main  event  to  launch  the  “Move  for
Health” campaign was in Alexandra  township,  an  area  designated  for  the
Urban Renewal Programme.

We are encouraging all South Africans, including  you,  to  engage  in  some
form of physical activity – and you don’t have to have a lot of money to  do
this; you can do it in your own offices  –  in  order  to  maintain  optimal
health and prevent various chronic diseases of lifestyle, such  as  diabetes
and heart and cardiovascular diseases.

In fact, we are prepared to work out a programme with you  so  that  we  can
engage in physical exercise. I hope you can appoint one or  two  people  who
will work with the Department of Health so that we can assist  you  in  this
regard. [Applause.]

Yesterday we marked the world No Tobacco Day in the  Free  State,  where  we
encouraged South Africans to keep up the  positive  trend  of  reducing  the
number of people who smoke in our country. I hope amongst you  there  is  no
one that smokes.

Both physical exercise and tobacco control  are  critical  elements  of  our
Healthy Lifestyles programme, which also encourages good nutrition – I  hope
you don’t eat McDonalds and chips and stuff like  that,  and  Nando’s.  This
programme also encourages the responsible use of alcohol.  Mark,  I  am  not
saying don’t use alcohol at all. I am saying there must be  responsible  use
of alcohol – and safe sexual behaviour. What that means I leave to your  own
imagination.

I call on all the members of this House  to  mobilise  their  constituencies
around these key  elements  of  the  Healthy  Lifestyles  programme  and  to
contribute towards reducing the spread of infectious diseases,  high  levels
of non-communicable diseases and the prevalence of violence  and  trauma  in
our society.

As you know, the role of the national department and mine, as  the  Minister
of Health, is to provide stewardship over the national health  system  as  a
whole – both the private and the public sectors. Let me  remind  this  House
again that the national health system consists of two  sectors,  the  public
and the private health care sectors.

Our stewardship role includes the responsibility of the national  Department
of Health to set national policy and to  prepare  national  legislation.  In
this regard, we wish to announce that the President has proclaimed into  law
much of the National Health  Act,  which  was  passed  in  this  House.  The
National Health Act, Act 61 of 2003, came into effect on  2  May  2005  with
the exception of some of its clauses.  This  is  a  major  victory  for  the
national health system, which up to 2 May 2005 was governed  by  the  Health
Act of 1977.

The national department also  plays  a  role  in  supporting  provinces  and
monitoring the  implementation  of  national  policies.  To  this  end,  the
national department and I have visited all  the  provinces  through  various
initiatives during the 2004-05 financial year.

In the past  few  months,  the  Health  Minmec  visited  facilities  in  two
provinces – the Northern Cape and the Free State. In addition, I  have  held
imbizos in Limpopo, KwaZulu-Natal,  Mpumalanga  and  the  Western  Cape.  In
general, we found that most health workers were dedicated to their work  and
provided a good service, sometimes under  very  difficult  circumstances,  I
must admit.

We also found that good management resulted in a motivated  workforce.  This
was true in newly built hospitals in the Northern  Cape  and  at  facilities
like the Kimberley Hospital, as well as  at  various  clinics  in  the  Free
State. I therefore wish to  take  this  opportunity  to  salute  all  health
workers and managers around the country for the  good  work  that  they  are
doing.

We also found that both the communities and health workers faced a range  of
challenges. Communities and patients complained of long  waiting  times  and
of overcrowding in both hospitals and clinics. A lack of shelter  for  those
who arrive early and who have  to  wait  for  service;  insufficient  health
facilities; hospitals or clinics that are too far from homes; a shortage  of
ambulances; and the negative attitude of some of  the  health  workers  were
some of the complaints given by the communities.

For their part,  health  providers  in  some  facilities  complained  of  an
insufficient amount of  personnel  and  heavy  workloads.  There  were  also
specific cases that we attended to outside of this  long-term  programme  in
terms of visiting our facilities and interacting with communities.

We visited two mental health facilities in KwaZulu-Natal – the Townhill  and
Fort  Napier  Hospitals  –  in  order  to  address  reported  cases  of  the
inappropriate treatment of mental health patients. A commission  of  inquiry
we established to investigate these issues has provided  a  report,  and  we
are implementing its recommendations. This was in line with our  efforts  to
implement the Mental Health Act,  which  emphasises  human  rights  and  the
treatment of mental health patients with respect and dignity.

We also visited St Barnabas Hospital in  the  O  R  Tambo  district  of  the
Eastern Cape, where there was an outbreak of  a  parasitic  brain  infection
caused by a tapeworm that infects pigs. Efforts were made to  provide  clean
and safe water and to educate the community on how to avoid  the  infection.
The immunisation campaign  has  also  been  intensified  following  reported
cases of measles in this district.  I  will  come  back  to  this  issue  of
measles later on.

I also visited the farming areas around Utrecht  and  spoke  to  farmworkers
who reported many instances of  abuse.  They  complained  about  a  lack  of
access to safe water and sanitation, health services, land and  housing.  In
one case, a farmer had dumped the carcass of a cow into the only  source  of
drinking water for the community.

I want to assure everyone in this House that this  government  is  committed
to ensuring equity in access to basic services and will strive to  meet  the
challenges presented by  communities,  like  the  ones  that  I  visited  in
Utrecht. We will be revisiting this area later this month  to  address  some
of the challenges that they raised. We will also  be  visiting  the  farming
community in Newcastle on the 11th of this month.

I now return to what will be done this year to  address  the  priorities  as
contained in the strategic plan of 2004 to  2009.  I  will  start  with  the
National Health Act, the provisions of which we are  implementing.  We  have
established and held the first  meeting  of  the  National  Health  Council,
which now replaces the Minmec. So  please  don’t  call  us  Minmec  anymore.
Please call us the National Health  Council.  We  established  this  in  May
2005.

The Act requires that MECs for health  convene  provincial  health  councils
within 90 days of the announcement of the Act. This means that  this  should
be done by the end  of  July  2005.  The  Act  also  requires  the  MECs  to
establish district health councils. These  structures  will  strengthen  the
governance of the health system and provide avenues to improve  the  quality
of care.

The National Health Act requires all levels of  government  responsible  for
health delivery to develop strategic plans. We have developed templates  for
these plans and will require  provinces  and  health  districts  to  develop
coherent, strategic and operational plans for the 2006-07 and  2008-09  MTEF
periods that take into account national priorities as well.

The Act mandates the creation of a national health  information  system  and
the establishment of provincial health  information  committees  by  1  July
2005. All these information systems must speak to one  other.  The  role  of
these structures is to  strengthen  the  collection,  analysis  and  use  of
health information for the planning and monitoring of service provision.

The Department of Health has been working with  stakeholders  to  develop  a
Human Resources for Health Strategic  Framework,  which  is  now  ready  for
consultation and finalisation. Some of the interventions that are  currently
being made in addressing  the  challenges  around  human  resources  include
expanding the community health  worker  programme,  providing  a  rural  and
scarce skills allowance, and providing a well-established community  service
programme covering most categories of health professional.

We will be phasing in community service for nurses  once  the  Nursing  Bill
has been passed by Parliament. In addition,  we  initiated  a  programme  to
train  mid-level  health  workers,  such  as  pharmacy  assistants,  and  we
envisage commencing with the  training  of  medical  assistants  early  next
year. The mid-level health worker will enable us  to  staff  our  facilities
with skilled personnel.
We are going to address the problem  of  the  fly-by-night  nursing  schools
that exploit young people wishing to enter the nursing profession.  This  is
a very serious matter. Most probably  we  will  be  closing  some  of  these
schools. [Applause.]

In  the  2004-05  financial  year  we  had  26  hospitals  in  the  hospital
revitalisation programme that is  meant  to  refurbish  the  infrastructure,
strengthen management and improve quality of care. I am pleased to  announce
that as part of this programme we completed four new hospitals in  the  last
financial year. These are  the  Piet  Retief  Hospital  in  Mpumalanga;  the
Swartruggens hospitals – those from the North  West  know  about  them;  the
Manne Dipico Hospital in Colesberg, Northern  Cape;  and  the  Abraham  Esau
Hospital in Calvinia, which is also in the Northern Cape.

During this financial year we will enrol 16 hospitals in the  revitalisation
programme, and we hope to complete  the  revitalisation  of  four  hospitals
that are currently under  this  programme.  I  have  difficulty  pronouncing
Afrikaans  names,  but  these  hospitals  are  the  Vredenburg  and   George
Hospitals in the Western Cape, as well  as  the  Lebowakgomo  and  the  Jane
Furse Hospitals in Limpopo.

We are concerned about the measles cases and  deaths  reported  in  Gauteng,
KwaZulu-Natal  and  the  Eastern  Cape.  These  cases  continued  despite  a
successful mass immunisation campaign conducted last year.

We have therefore asked for the assistance of the World Health  Organisation
in order to understand this problem. As soon as we obtain the  final  report
from the team of experts that is examining this problem, we  shall  announce
the steps that will be taken to address this matter. In the meantime  it  is
important to continue encouraging every  parent  to  bring  each  and  every
child to our facilities for immunisation.

It is critical that we sustain our  interventions  aimed  at  improving  the
health of women and children, highlighted by the theme of this year’s  World
Health Day,  which  was:  Making  every  mother  and  child  count.  We  are
encouraged by the positive trends in  the  maternal  mortality  rate,  which
decreased from 150 per 100 000 live births in 1998 to 123 in  2002.  We  are
hoping to see this trend continue. This  while  the  infant  mortality  rate
came down from 45,4 per 1 000 live births in 1994 to 42,5 in 2002.  We  hope
we can continue along this trajectory as well.

We are strengthening the TB control  programme  by,  amongst  other  things,
appointing TB co-ordinators in each and every  district;  strengthening  the
laboratory  system;  strengthening  the  implementation  of   the   directly
observed treatment strategy;  and  mobilising  communities  to  ensure  that
patients complete their treatment. We hope that the members  of  this  House
can also assist us in this regard.

The challenges posed by TB emphasise the  need  to  address  the  weaknesses
that still exist in our national health  system  and  the  importance  of  a
comprehensive approach to the management of diseases in our country.

We  are  implementing  the  Comprehensive  Plan  for  Management,  Care  and
Treatment of HIV  and  Aids.  Note  that  it  is  not  a  roll-out  plan  on
antiretrovirals; it is indeed a comprehensive plan for the management,  care
and treatment of HIV and Aids in their entirety with much  more  vigour  and
we are indeed achieving results.

In line with our stated goals, we were able to establish a  minimum  of  one
service point in every district in the country before the end  of  the  last
financial year. Our endeavour in the coming years is to  ensure  that  these
services are  made  available  in  every  local  municipality  in  order  to
increase the accessibility and uptake of our programme.

However, it is important to emphasise in this House that  the  extension  of
services,  as  contained   in   the   comprehensive   plan,   requires   the
strengthening of the national health system to ensure that we  provide  good
quality health services, and that we are not just chasing numbers.

Government’s  efforts  to  reduce  the  price  of  medicines   through   the
implementation of  the  Medicines  Control  Act  have  paid  dividends.  The
removal of perverse incentives and  the  introduction  of  the  single  exit
price for medicines have resulted  in  a  19%  reduction  in  the  price  of
medicines. This translates into a saving of  approximately  R2,3 billion  in
the private sector.

However, the impact of this reduction on the overall cost of  medicines  for
the consumer has been limited owing to  the  lack  of  co-operation  at  the
retail  pharmacy  level,   including   the   introduction   of   unnecessary
administration  fees  and  levies  and  photocopying.  We  hope   that   the
Constitutional Court will rule in our favour so  that  consumers  can  fully
enjoy the benefits of the  reduction  in  the  price  of  medicines  in  our
country.

Now, let me turn to the budget that  has  been  allocated  to  the  national
Department of Health. This budget increased by 11,4% from 2004-05  to  2005-
06. The conditional grants which flow via the national Department of  Health
to provinces grew  by  13,2%.  The  budget  for  HIV  and  Aids  grew  by  a
staggering  45%.  The   hospital   revitalisation   grant   increased   from
R912 million to R1,027 million. Therefore it increased by 12,6%.

Early figures indicate that in total the nine provincial health  departments
spent 98,6% of their 2004-05 budgets. I think we need  to  congratulate  the
MECs and the heads of department on having  been  able  to  spend  98,6%  of
their budgets in 2004-05. [Applause.]

Further good news is that their 2004-05 expenditures grew by 7,5% from 2003-
04. Budgets allocated for the provincial health departments for 2005-06  are
on average 9,4% higher than the previous year.

I sincerely hope that we have  demonstrated  to  this  House  that  the  ANC
government has the capacity and a committed  cadre  of  health  workers  and
managers to achieve our strategic goals and  targets  for  2005-06.  We  are
determined to ensure that we deliver quality services to all  our  citizens,
even  with  the  limited  resources  that  we  have.  We  will  do  this  in
collaboration with other government departments and the private  sector,  as
well as organs of civil society in  order  to  ensure  that  we  attain  the
targets set particularly in the Millennium Development Goals, which  we  are
party to as a member of the international community of nations.

Let me turn briefly to what  we  do  on  an  international  level.  We  have
continued  to  play   our   international   role,   including   our   active
participation  in  the  World  Health  Organisation  and  the  World  Health
Assembly that was held in Geneva last year. Thank you very much to the  MECs
who accompanied me to the World Health Assembly.

During this assembly we successfully mobilised member states to support  our
effort  to  ensure  that  the  World  Health  Organisation   implement   the
resolutions aimed at addressing the challenges of international  recruitment
and migration of health personnel.
Human resources for health is expected to be the main subject for the  World
Health Report to be released by the WHO early next  year  and  will  be  the
theme for next year’s World Health Day. The focus on human resources  should
create an opportunity for African countries in particular to  highlight  the
severe impact of recruitment and migration on our  national  health  systems
on the continent.

We were able to influence strongly the  resolution  on  infant  feeding  and
nutrition, and we are very proud to announce this today especially as it  is
International Children’s Day. This is because what we  sought  to  do  there
was indeed to protect our  children,  and  South  Africa  did  play  a  very
prominent role in the drafting of that resolution.

During the assembly I had an opportunity  to  meet  with  the  ministers  of
health of India and Brazil, when we discussed the ways  in  which  we  could
strengthen health  co-operation  amongst  our  three  countries  within  the
context of South-South co-operation. We will be meeting soon as Ibsa –  that
is India, Brazil and South Africa – to  approve  the  action  plan  for  co-
operation among the three countries.

On the continent we hosted representatives from the Sudan  and  shared  with
them some of the experiences we  have  had  in  rebuilding  our  own  health
system. We are also  working  closely  with  the  department  of  health  in
Nigeria in sharing the  experiences  of  the  development  of  our  National
Health Act. We will be studying their efforts and that  of  other  countries
in establishing social health insurance.

During the assembly I also had meetings with  the  Ministers  of  health  of
Mozambique and Senegal to discuss bilateral  co-operation.  We  are  looking
forward to signing  a  co-operation  agreement  with  Mozambique,  focusing,
amongst  other  things,  on  malaria  control  around  the  Lubombo  Spatial
Development Initiative and the Sasol  gas  pipeline.  The  agreement  should
also deal with the provision of health services  to  communities  along  the
borders of Mozambique and, in particular, Limpopo, Mpumalanga  and  KwaZulu-
Natal.

Recently, we hosted the WHO Commission on Intellectual Property Rights  that
deals with the major issue of balancing patent protection for investment  in
the development of new  medicines  against  the  dire  need  for  access  to
affordable medicines.

The commission was here to brief  us  on  the  progress  in  this  area  and
ascertain our position on these issues. As the members  of  this  House  are
aware, this country is determined to provide access to  affordable,  quality
medicines.

The hon  members  may  be  aware  that  the  chairperson  of  the  Portfolio
Committee on Health, Mr James Ngculu, was admitted to  hospital.  On  behalf
of the Ministry  and  the  Department  of  Health,  we  wish  him  a  speedy
recovery. Thank you very much, Chairperson. [Applause.]
Ms J MASILO: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister, hon Deputy Minister,  MECs  from
the provinces, colleagues, senior  officials  from  the  department:  “There
shall be houses, security and comfort!” The Department of Health produced  a
White Paper that adopted comprehensive primary health care as  the  lynchpin
for the unified health system to ensure access to quality  health  care  for
all South Africans.

It draws its inspiration from the ANC’s health plan and  the  Reconstruction
and Development Programme. Several key health policies and  programmes  have
been developed and implemented. This culminated in the development  in  1999
of a five-year framework for accelerated health  service  delivery  entitled
the  Health  Sector  Strategic  Framework,  1999-2004.  The  ten  priorities
identified in this document were: legislative reform; improving  quality  of
care; revitalising public hospitals; primary  health  care  and  a  district
health system; strategic intervention to  reduce  morbidity  and  mortality;
human resources and management; communication and internal co-operation.

Since  1994,  this  democratic  government  has  set  about   systematically
reconstructing and developing all areas of health  care  delivery  that  had
previously been racist and fragmented. Once we had developed  the  principle
of Batho Pele, it was incumbent of health care providers to not  only  adopt
this principle in theory but to implement it in practice.

However, in reviewing the past ten years of our democracy,  we  have  become
increasingly concerned that those programmes and  policies  were  not  being
embraced or practiced in the way that it was intended. Many  of  our  people
are complaining about the inadequate quality  of  health  services  that  is
delivered to them. These include hospitals that  have  insufficient  medical
stock,  linen  and  food  to  those  who  have  inadequate  and   often   no
infrastructure to speak of.

The 2005-06  budget  takes  place  in  a  crucial  period  which  marks  the
celebration of 50 years of the Freedom Charter and the start of  the  second
decade of our new democracy, and as such we are reminded  of  the  important
role we as a committee play in the government:  ensuring  that  our  people,
indeed, have a better life.

I think we can all agree that the delivery of health services is  a  complex
matter and  as  such  it  requires  all  types  of  strategic  partnerships,
including co-operative governance among the three spheres of government.  In
addition, we need partnerships between community  health  centre  NGOs,  the
community it serves and other sectors in government,  all  working  together
in tandem with our local authorities.

With regard to the strengthening of our  system  of  local  government,  the
Department of Health is promoting integration between provincial  and  local
government with success in some districts in the Eastern  Cape,  Free  State
and Western Cape; has published a  format  for  service  agreements  between
provinces and district municipalities - all 13 rural nodes produced  service
delivery improvement plans for 2004-05; and  has  produced  district  health
planning guidelines  to  strengthen  the  development  of  health  plans  at
district level human resources.

Whilst the select committee applauds the Minister for putting into  place  a
national health human  resources  plan  that  will  give  direction  to  the
planning, development and management of human resources, we know  that  this
is just the first step in trying to overcome the chronic staff shortages  in
our clinics and hospitals throughout the country.

The department’s commitment to implement scarce skills in  rural  allowances
and the training of more community health workers is  another  welcome  step
to redressing critical staff shortages. The utilisation  of  7  000  trained
nurses will  indeed  do  a  great  deal  to  strengthen  the  dispensing  of
medicines at our health  centres.  Each  of  these  endeavours  collectively
demonstrates that the Minister is systematically trying to turn  around  the
low staff rates.

Hopefully,  the   ongoing   discussions   and   negotiations   on   adequate
remuneration packages for the health sector in our health care centres  will
similarly continue to remain a priority with the Minister.

The select committee recommends that, in the  case  of  filling  of  crucial
vacant posts, the department should take at least three months to fill  them
to ensure that  there  is  continuity  and  quality  service  delivery.  The
committee applauds the  implementation  of  30%  gender  balance  in  senior
management and two per cent for people with disabilities.

The select committee has been impressed  by  the  great  strides  that  this
department has made in increasing free access to  primary  health  care  for
children under five years, pregnant women, older persons  and  persons  with
disabilities. Provinces have co-operated to ensure that sub-districts  under
their jurisdiction provide full  primary  health  care  packages,  including
standard treatment guidelines, the essential drug list  and  the  norms  and
standards  for  clinics,  as  well  as  the  standards  for   pharmaceutical
services. According to the department, we are now at  70%  of  our  delivery
rate, which is a good place to be.

The Department of Health commenced with the  accreditation  of  health  care
facilities for the implementation of the  Comprehensive  Plan  for  HIV/Aids
Care, Management and Treatment. A total of 113 health facilities across  the
nine  provinces  were  assessed  during  2004.  The   programme   is   being
implemented nationally.

The select committee has seen the  Minister’s  commitment  to  the  HIV/Aids
Comprehensive  Care,  Management  and   Treatment   Programme,   which   was
successfully implemented in its first year, 2003.  The  programme  has  been
rolled out at 113 sites and 28 786 people were put on antiretrovirals.

The Khomanani mass communication campaign was visible and promoted on  World
Aids Day; a men’s march and  a  range  of  radio  and  television  awareness
campaigns, and also guidelines for nutritional  supplementation  for  people
living with HIV and Aids have been developed. Favourable indicators such  as
increased condom usage by households, declining rates of new infections  and
teenage pregnancy in the younger age groups were observed.

We will go on enumerating  all  the  things  that  have  been  done  by  the
department, but let it be sufficient to say that the  select  committee  can
see many signs of the concerted efforts that the Ministry has put  in  place
to deal with the HIV/Aids pandemic. Perhaps the Minister should work on  the
manner in which she carries over the messages to the media, because  if  one
is to believe the press and some opposition parties, she  is  doing  nothing
to fight HIV/Aids, which is clearly untrue.

What the Minister needs to focus on, however, is the proper  functioning  of
the SA National Aids Council – Sanac. The office of the Auditor-General  was
disturbed  that  they  did  not  seem  to  have  done   much   since   their
establishment.

The Hospital  Revitalisation  Programme  was  able  to  cover  30  hospitals
initially. The projects will increase to 59 over the  current  MTEF  period.
During  the  oversight  visit  to  Pretoria  Academic  Hospital  in  Gauteng
Province, the select committee observed and reported that this new state-of-
the-art hospital has been completed, though it is not yet being utilised.

It is our belief that  the  department  will  fast-track  the  staffing  and
equipping of the new hospital so as to offer  world-class  medical  care  to
our communities and to keep up with the demands of improved  access  and  to
minimise overcrowding in smaller hospitals.

Regulation on the pricing of medicine came into effect in August  2004.  The
select committee applauds the breakthrough in the pricing and dispensing  of
medication in the wake of court cases by certain interest groups.

An oversight visit to Odi Hospital, in the  north  of  Tshwane,  North  West
province and Gauteng cross-boundary area, revealed problems related  to  the
state of the mortuary. Here only two out of five storage places for  corpses
were in good  working  order.  The  same  problem  regarding  the  state  of
mortuaries was observed in KwaMhlanga Hospital, Mpumalanga. It seems to  the
select committee that some of the problems experienced in this regard as  to
who is responsible for the mortuaries could be resolved if that function  is
dedicated to the municipalities.

The select committee acknowledges the key output to improve  women’s  health
and  nutrition.  We  are  happy  to  support  Budget  Vote  16  on   Health.
[Applause.]

Ms P NKONYENI (KwaZulu-Natal): Hon Chairperson, hon Minister of  Health,  Dr
Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, hon Deputy Minister, hon MECs, my colleagues,  hon
members, on behalf of the people of KwaZulu-Natal – the kingdom –  I  hereby
convey our gratitude for being afforded  the  opportunity  to  address  this
august House today.

Now that I am here, I  also  want  to  thank  our  hon  Minister,  Dr  Manto
Tshabalala-Msimang, for the privileged invitation she extended to us as  MEC
- hon MEC Mr Bellot and me – when we attended the 58th session of the  World
Health Assembly in the past two weeks.

Madam Minister, we were very proud to observe that South  Africa  is  indeed
playing a meaningful role in the health sphere. Hon  members,  other  member
states would wait for our hon  Minister,  Dr  Manto  Tshabalala-Msimang,  to
give direction before taking positions on issues. [Applause.]  South  Africa
is leading the African  continent  and  the  world  with  regard  to  health
issues. I also wish to say that the ANC leads! [Applause.] Again, I wish  to
say . . . “Wathint’abafazi wathint’imbokodo, ozokufa!” [You strike a  woman,
you strike a rock!] Finish!

I have also thought it wise to utilise this opportunity to brief and  update
the House on the progress we are making, as  well  as  frustrations  we  are
encountering in our endeavours aimed at creating better health for  all  our
people.

As a province, we have fully embraced  the  Healthy  Lifestyle  Campaign  as
central  to  our  response  to  the  causes  of  mortality  and   morbidity,
particularly  in  the  reduction  of   communicable   and   non-communicable
diseases.  On  5  December  2004,  together  with  the  hon  Minister,   the
Department  of  Health  in   KwaZulu-Natal   launched   our   programme   at
KwaNgcolosi.  It  remains  our  believe  that  once  the  concept  is  fully
understood and embraced by  the  majority  of  our  people,  the  burden  of
disease heaped on our institutions will decrease.

As a province, we are taking the World Health Day theme very  seriously,  as
it pronounces: “Make every mother  and  child  count.”  In  support  of  the
national initiatives in this regard, we have succeeded in creating 31  fully
accredited baby-friendly hospitals.  We  are  leading  the  country  in  the
promotion of these institutions. [Applause.]

We  also  have  established   27   accredited   adolescent-friendly   clinic
initiatives - these  in  pursuance  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals,
specifically the ones  intended  to  reverse  the  incidence  of  infectious
diseases.

I have indicated that we are striving to provide better health for  all  our
people and as such I have to concede that we are still faced with  a  number
of challenges. To start with, we still have a long way to  go  in  attaining
acceptable response time for our people in distress.

Currently, our province only has 450 ambulances and as such cannot meet  the
requirement  of  one  ambulance  per  10  000  people.  In  addressing  this
situation, I can report that in this financial year we  will  be  purchasing
100 more, as well as 121 emergency support vehicles. Of course we deserve  a
big round of applause! [Laughter.] [Applause.]

We are struggling with reducing waiting times for our patients  in  some  of
our hospitals. This is partly because of the infrastructure backlog  in  the
construction of clinics and the refurbishing of the  hospitals.  To  redress
this, we have now decided not to rely on only on the Department of Works  of
KwaZulu-Natal  but  to  also  utilise  the  expertise  of  services  of  the
Independent  Development  Trust,  as  well   as   the   Ithala   Development
Corporation, which is one of our parastatals in KwaZulu-Natal.

The acute shortage of accommodation, especially in  our  facilities  in  the
rural areas, adversely affects  our  efforts  of  recruiting  and  retaining
professionals with scarce skills.

As part of the solution to the above-mentioned problem, I have  to  disclose
that we are in the process of approaching  the  honourable  Premier  of  our
province, Dr S’bu Ndebele and the executive council to allow us  to  convert
the erstwhile Ulundi Legislature into a regional hospital  that  will  serve
our people at  Ulundi,  Nongoma  and  Mahlabathini,  whilst  offloading  the
burden  in  our   existing   facilities   around   Northern   KwaZulu-Natal.
[Applause.]

We have a people’s contract to create work and to fight poverty and also  to
provide a better life for all. As the KwaZulu-Natal  health  department,  we
have decided to allocate 10% of our procurement budget to co-operatives.  In
this venture we are working closely  with  the  department  of  finance  and
economic development in changing the standing procurement policies.

We  remain  committed  to  implementing  the   comprehensive   approach   to
management  of  HIV/Aids,  which  entails   prevention,   care,   treatment,
nutrition and support. We are very determined  to  fighting  and  conquering
this pandemic,  not  only  HIV/Aids,  but  all  diseases  that  are  poverty
related, like TB.

Developing countries have targeted our professionals. They are  deliberately
recruited to work in those countries. The question  is:  Does  that  reflect
the notion that the lives of the poor people  in  developing  countries  are
not as important as those of people in developed countries? I wish that  hon
members could deliberate on this issue because it is a  political  issue.  I
regard it as another form of imperialism, and the  DA  should  pronounce  on
this issue because they are a reactionary  force  that  is  always  used  by
imperialists.

In conclusion, I wish to indicate that we remain committed to efforts  aimed
at improving the health status of our people. I support the budget. I  thank
you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

Ms H LAMOELA:  Hon Chair, hon Minister, hon MECs and hon  members,  the  key
role of the national Department of Health is the development of  legislation
and  policies,  while  provinces  and  municipalities  are  responsible  for
implementation.

Nevertheless, it still  remains  the  key  responsibility  of  the  national
Department of Health’s aim to promote, and protect the  health  of  all  our
people, especially the most vulnerable,  against  illness  and  injury.  The
Department of Health’s chief aims should still be: to  strive  to  ensure  a
caring climate for service users; to create a positive work environment;  to
obtain the  greatest  benefit  from  public  moneys;  to  provide  excellent
training for health workers, and to improve overall health services.

Consistent and regular monitoring of the performance of  the  health  system
is central to the attainment of the aims outlined above.  A  big  thank  you
goes to the Minister for  working  towards  providing  free  primary  health
services  for  children  under  six  years,  pregnant  women,  people   with
disabilities and for those who cannot afford it. Improved access  to  health
services by building of clinics and revitalisation of  hospitals  is  highly
appreciated.

Yet efforts to combat TB and to improve mental health services  need  to  be
intensified. Whilst TB can be  cured,  it  remains  a  major  public  health
problem  and  a  socioeconomic  burden,  especially  on  the  poor  and  the
unemployed.

Ek glo stellig dat werkloosheid en huisloosheid siektes soos TB en  MIV/Vigs
bevorder. Behandeling- en bewusmakingsprojekte vir dié siektes  is  goed  en
wel, maar as omstandighede waarin die pasiënt of betrokkenes hul bevind  nie
verbeter nie, is alles taboe.
Behoorlike behuising of goed-geboude strukture met  goeie  ventilasie  -  en
sommige van dié eenhede huisves tot ongeveer 16 mense – aparte toilette  met
deure wat toemaak, en gepleisterde mure om nattigheid uit te hou, kan  reeds
die staat op die langer duur baie geld spaar.

In die Wes-Kaap ondervind ons reeds uiterste winters en baie van  ons  mense
is werkloos en verarmd. Boonop veroorsaak die geweldige  invloei  van  mense
uit  ander  provinsies,  veral  die  Oos-Kaap,  ‘n  groot  krisis  aangaande
behuising. Longontsteking is aan die orde van die dag, wat  uiteindelik  tot
TB-gevalle lei.

Mense kan  nie  herstel  deur  slegs  medikasie  of  vitamines  te  gebruik,
waarvoor baie mense vanaf die vroeë oggendure by daghospitale moet wag  nie,
maar  wel  deur   ‘n   gesonde   dieet   en   goeie   verblyf   te   geniet.
Lewensomstandighede  speel  dus  ‘n   groot   rol   in   die   herstel   van
geaffekteerdes.  Dienste,  werkgeleenthede,  en  behuising  moet   in   alle
provinsies dus ook op standaard gebring word om te verhoed dat  die  invloei
van mense, veral na die Wes-Kaap, bekamp word.

Die impak op die begroting is oorweldigend en  verhoed  die  departement  om
hul beste, soos belowe in die agb  President  se  toespraak  aan  die  nasie
vroeër vanjaar, te lewer. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[I firmly believe  that  unemployment  and  having  no  place  to  live  are
contributing factors to diseases like TB and HIV/Aids. The treatment of  and
awareness projects for these diseases are all well  and  good,  but  if  the
circumstances in which the patient or persons involved  find  themselves  do
not improve then everything is in vain.

Proper housing or well-built structures with adequate ventilation – some  of
these units house up to approximately 16  people  -  separate  toilets  with
doors that can close and plastered walls to  keep  damp  out  can  save  the
state a lot of money in the long run.

In the Western Cape we are already experiencing extreme winters and many  of
our people are unemployed and indigent. In addition the enormous  influx  of
people from other provinces, especially the Eastern  Cape,  is  creating  an
immense crisis concerning housing. Pneumonia is the order of the day,  which
eventually leads to cases of TB.

People cannot recuperate merely by  using  medication  and  vitamins,  which
many people have to wait for from early in the  morning  at  day  hospitals,
but  by  following  a  healthy  diet  and  having  proper  housing.   Living
conditions therefore play a big role in the recuperation of those  affected.
Services, employment  opportunities  and  housing  must  therefore  also  be
brought up to standard in all provinces  to  avoid  the  prevention  of  the
influx of people, especially to the Western Cape.

The impact on the budget is overwhelming and prevents  the  department  from
delivering its best, as promised in the hon President’s state of the  nation
address earlier this year.]

As far as Aids is concerned, the HIV/Aids epidemic has a  disastrous  effect
on children’s lives, and it  is  indeed  a  growing  cause  of  concern  for
children’s rights. Though  Prevention  of  Mother-to-Child  Transmission  is
offered at some public hospitals and some community centres,  Prevention  of
Mother-to-Child  Transmission  programmes  are  still  considered   as   key
interventions and should be rendered continuously.

There can be no doubt that children  orphaned  by  HIV/Aids  is  a  national
crisis and this should be treated as such. The government should be  ashamed
that South Africa has been named as one of three  countries  lagging  behind
as the World Health Organisation attempts to reach its  goal  of  delivering
antiretroviral drugs to three million people by the end of this year.

Indeed, of the 20 countries  that  have  the  highest  antiretroviral  need,
South Africa fared  the  worst.  We  are  seen  as  a  country  without  the
political will to deal with the pandemic. The daily number  of  Aids-related
deaths in this country will not be reduced if, firstly, the governing  party
continues to fail to meet its own target; secondly, continues to  shift  the
goal posts in a feeble attempt to cover  its  inefficiencies;  and  thirdly,
without a massive and immediate upscale in the dissemination  of  ARVs.  The
results will be catastrophic.

In fact, they already are. Our teachers are dying in  droves,  and  research
shows  that  the  number  of  children  admitted  to  Grade  1  has  dropped
dramatically. Yes, we  are  aware  that  antiretroviral  drugs  cannot  cure
HIV/Aids, but they can do the following: Firstly, prevention  of  mother-to-
child transmission; secondly, extending  the  life  of  the  sufferer  to  a
reasonable age, particularly mothers and fathers, who need to take  care  of
the children. This will reduce the number of  children  that  are  orphaned,
and lift the burden on the state coffers.

Regarding primary health care, the impact of migration from other  provinces
is worst felt on the  primary  health  care  level,  and  the  situation  is
compounded by the shortage of staff. An in-depth  survey  on  patient  ratio
per professional nurse should be done  to  ensure  quality  service  at  all
times. We need to remember that professional  nurses  are  held  accountable
for the patients’ wellbeing while in their care.

Is  the  burnout  syndrome  for  professionals  perhaps   the   reason   for
absenteeism during working  hours?  Or  is  the  persistent  pressure  of  a
shortage  of  staff,  professional  nurses  and  doctors  the   reason   for
immigration to other countries rather than gambling  with  patients’  lives?
Filling of critical posts such as  professional  nurses  and  doctors  is  a
priority that is continuously ignored.

Some hospitals situated in townships still struggle to  compete  with  other
hospitals in attracting and retaining professional  and  skilled  personnel.
Long queues are still experienced by patients as some hospitals do not  have
a booking system and thus  work  on  an  ad  hoc  basis.  Migration  of  our
professional nurses and doctors to other countries remain a great concern.

The department should urgently look  at  ways  to  prevent  our  staff  from
leaving our hospitals and clinics by ensuring that  all  role-players  agree
on a human resources strategic  plan;  review  the  remuneration  of  health
personnel, especially nurses, bringing it up  to  a  reasonably  competitive
level; intensify the training on HIV/Aids  at  primary  health  care  level,
where staff feel overwhelmed and not competent enough to deal with  some  of
the issues related to the epidemic; and urgently upgrade the  infrastructure
at certain institutions.

We need to realise that health professionals are the cornerstone of  a  good
health  system,  and  need  to  be  acknowledged  for  their  opinions   and
experiences. Regarding our health  care  centres,  there  are  a  number  of
hospitals in some provinces like Limpopo  that  are  to  be  converted  into
health centres. These hospitals  are  located  in  areas  where  people  are
generally  poor.  Conversion  means  other  critical  services   cannot   be
provided, and the sick will have to travel long distances for such  services
despite their economic background. Maybe the hon Minister can  explain  what
the rationale is behind this  conversion  of  these  hospitals  into  health
centres.

On the matter of the hospital revitalisation grant, while it is  clear  that
the hospital revitalisation grant poses a specific challenge  to  provinces,
spending in some of the provinces such as  Gauteng,  KwaZulu-Natal  and  the
North  West  province  has  been  particularly  slow  for  two   consecutive
financial years. Currently,  spending  trends  are  of  particular  concern,
taking into account that the administration  of  conditional  grants  was  a
qualification item in  the  2003-04  audit  report  for  the  Department  of
Health.

In conclusion, conditional grants subject to slow spending  are  in  essence
the  ones  that  have  important  implications  for  achieving   the   goals
identified by the President’s 2005 state of  the  nation  address.  I  thank
you. [Applause.]

Dr B GOQWANA (Eastern Cape):  Chairperson,  I  have  already  accepted  your
apology. It is Goqwana. Chairperson, Madam Minister, Deputy  Minister,  MECs
from different provinces, members of the NCOP, ladies and  gentlemen,  I  am
tempted to start off by saying that I think the  MEC  for  health,  uMaMtolo
from KwaZulu-Natal, has actually  displayed  the  relationship  between  the
provinces and the national department. We can see that that relationship  is
very good and I don’t have to go into detail about that.

I just want to make a few comments before I start to represent  the  Eastern
Cape here. I think we started to walk in these corridors in 1994. I tend  to
believe that there were people who were  walking  in  these  corridors  even
before 1994, and some of them are still here. During that time  poverty  was
present and it was worse than it is now.  Yet,  they  now  seem  to  be  the
advocates  of  poverty  better  than  they  were  during  that   time.   The
interesting thing is that HIV/Aids was present even at the time.  There  was
no money that was put aside to fight HIV/Aids. And, as I know now, there  is
no country that gives more money per head of HIV-positive person than  South
Africa. [Applause.]

The other thing that is very interesting is that – coming from  the  medical
profession myself – before 1994 there was very little that  was  said  about
nutrition, even at medical school. I think it was left out  deliberately  so
that we could push the other  pharmaceutical  interests.  Now,  when  people
start to mention nutrition as part of prescription, people have  started  to
say that that should not be done. Yet, that is supposed  to  have  been  the
key and that should have been done long before  it  was  mentioned  by  this
government. I thought I should make those comments before I talk  about  the
Eastern Cape.

The end of the last financial year and the beginning of this  new  one  have
been marked by unprecedented challenges in the provision of health  services
in the Eastern Cape. The outbreak  of  various  preventable  diseases  among
children in rural areas has put our state of readiness to the test in  terms
of resource allocation, flexibility and responsiveness.  Whereas  there  has
been an ongoing  immunisation  programme,  it  has  become  clear  that  the
epidemiological  profile  is  linked   to   the   province’s   socioeconomic
development.

While responding to these immediate threats, which  obviously  call  for  an
increased budget allocation, the reality is that these are part  and  parcel
of the provincial growth and development plan.  The  challenges  facing  the
province cannot be addressed  overnight,  nor  will  increased  funding  for
health services alone create healthy people.

The amount allocated for  health  care  service  delivery  for  the  2005-06
financial year is R6,08 billion. Over the past four years the Department  of
Health has acknowledged that primary health care  services  are  fundamental
to the delivery of quality health care  to  the  uninsured  population.  For
this  reason,  between  45%  and  55%  of  the   departmental   budget   was
consistently allocated to this programme and the ensuing  year  will  be  no
exception, as 45,9% of the budget will be spent on these services.

The gross inequalities in the distribution of resources  in  the  past  have
created unimaginable backlogs in  health-related  infrastructure.  The  past
year burdened us with considerable challenges such as budgetary  constraints
and limitations.  But,  in  spite  of  this,  the  department  has  recorded
tremendous progress in a number  of  areas.  As  a  department  we  are  now
refining our focus and energy so that the service delivery system  necessary
to support the quality of care is in place.

Consequently, our turnaround strategy is centred around, and driven by,  the
following 10 key focus areas  that  guide  and  underpin  our  programme  of
action. The 10-point plan is made up  of  these  points:  strengthening  the
service  delivery  platform,  revitalisation  of  the  health  institutions;
strengthening  the  quality  assurance  system;  promoting  partnership  and
public participation; ensuring compliance across all sectors; improving  and
re-engineering business processes for long-term sustainable  quality  health
care delivery; long-range planning towards a quality public  health  system;
strengthening  the  information  system;  improving  overall  organisational
performance; and effective communication and branding of the department.

Let me just talk a little bit about emergency services. This is one  of  the
areas that is a sore point for most provinces. The department  has  compiled
a status quo report of emergency services and subsequently  put  together  a
breakthrough strategy to reposition the unit, confront  its  challenges  and
tangibly make a turnaround in its  operations.  The  strategy  is  aimed  at
integrating the  emergency  services  into  primary  health  care  and  will
enhance community health through an organised system of  injury  prevention,
acute care and rehabilitation.

Regarding quality health  care  and  assurance  systems,  I  would  like  to
reiterate that our primary focus and in fact our  theme  is  “improving  the
quality of care”. We shall achieve this by addressing the following  issues:
accurate and comprehensive patient records  and  database;  ethical  conduct
underpinned by  Batho  Pele  principles  and  the  Patient  Rights  Charter;
effectiveness of  the  complaint  system;  monitoring  and  evaluation;  and
focusing on disease surveillance and notification.

Concerning  clinical  services,  I  shall  deal  with  five   key   priority
programmes. The first one is HIV/Aids and I am not going to  dwell  on  this
one, except  to  mention  that  we  are  on  track  with  the  comprehensive
treatment and management plan. I am not going further than that.

The second programme deals with TB. All I want to  say  about  TB  is  that,
interestingly, much as I am not going to disclose the time when I was  born,
I think when I was born there was a cure for TB. But up to today, old  as  I
am now, we are still faced with the fact that TB kills our people. It  shows
that there is something that we didn’t put into the equation. The part  that
we left out is the role of poverty.

We rush and say people must be  given  the  treatment  that  can  cure  them
without considering the fact that if those people take treatment, they  must
have food that they are going to eat. That is why we still have TB.  We  are
trying to concentrate on making sure that people have food  on  their  table
while taking this TB treatment.

The other thing that is really hitting us as the friendly  province  of  the
Eastern Cape concerns problems related to circumcision. I am  not  going  to
dwell on that, except to say that we have managed to reduce the  deaths  and
amputations that have happened before. We are  going  to  continue  to  make
sure that this does not happen in the Eastern Cape.

The fourth programme that we think we will concentrate on in this  financial
year is that, as a  department,  we  are  going  to  concentrate  on  saving
mothers and saving babies. Even on this one, I am not going to  dwell  much.
But it’s one of the programmes that we think are going to  be  very  crucial
in this particular budget year.

Regarding the integrated nutrition programme, I have mentioned that you  can
look at your diseases such as HIV/Aids, TB and measles that  are  giving  us
problems, or even diarrhoea, but all of them are related to  the  fact  that
there is poor nutrition and poverty in those areas. That  is  why  we  think
that,  as  the  department  of  health  in  the  Eastern  Cape,  we   should
concentrate on this integrated nutrition programme.

As has been mentioned by KwaZulu-Natal, 25% of our hospitals in the  Eastern
Cape have thus  far  been  declared  baby-friendly,  and  12  of  them  were
declared so in  the  past  financial  year.  Regarding  this,  we  meet  and
subscribe to the standards of the World  Health  Organisation,  and  we  are
monitored by the national department. Thirty-two clinics have  gardens  that
target malnourished children and those people who are HIV-positive. We  also
have nutritional supplement programmes that we give out to the clinics.

Concerning the budget allocation, the single  most  significant  event  that
affected all departments  has  been  the  implementation  of  the  austerity
measures to address the overdraft that most us know we had  in  the  Eastern
Cape. In the spirit of assisting the province and the desire to be  part  of
the solution of this problem, the Eastern Cape department of health  had  to
surrender a substantial amount of its 2004-05 budget, that is R200  million.
This resulted in a year-on-year budget reduction of 0,42% in 2004-05.  Added
to that, the department overspent by R131 million, which is 3% of the  2003-
04 budget. That required the department to make good the overdraft from  the
2004-05 budget.

Needless to say, these two incidents have had a profound impact  on  service
delivery and the finances of the department as plans needed  to  be  amended
to remain within the available budget. The department, therefore,  projected
an underspending of R41 million  to  reverse  the  overdraft  situation  and
start 2005-06 with a positive bank balance.

In summary, despite the  real  increase  of  10,5%  in  the  budget  of  the
previous year, the per capita funding of  the  Eastern  Cape  department  of
health’s budget still lags substantially behind provinces such  as  Gauteng,
Western Cape, Northern  Cape,  Free  State  and  KwaZulu-Natal.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Umhlonishwa  uNgqongqoshe   womnyango   wezempilo   KwaZulu-Natali,   ethula
inkulumo yakhe yesabiwomali sesifundazwe, wathi, ngiyamcaphuna:


   Umsebenzi wezempilo udinga  inqwaba  yabantu.  Ukuze  siphumelele  kumele
   siqinisekise  ukuthi  sinabasebenzi  abakhuthazekile  nabazinikele,  bebe
   benamakhono adingekayo nenani labo libe lenele.


Lawa mazwi wodwa nje afakazela engiqeda ukukusho  ukuthi  amakhono  amaningi
ayasishiya kusale isikhala esingavaleki kalula, abantu bebancane,  umsebenzi
uhlezi emahlombe abo. Abakwazi  ukuhlenga  ngesineke  nangothando  oludingwa
umuntu ogulayo.

Isabelo  sezempilo  kudingeka  sibe  ngesiningi  kunalokhu  ukuze   simelane
nezidingo zalo msebenzi  obaluleke  kangaka.  Okunye  okudinga  imali  ukuze

ukuba  neholo  eligculisayo  kubona  bonke,  kuyo  yonke  imikhakha   eyenza
umsebenzi –  kungaba  ofundelwe,  onobuchwepheshe  noma  ongafundelwe  kodwa
ogculisayo. Izikhalo  abazibekayo  azicutshungulwe  kuhlangatshezwane  nazo.
Izindawo abahlala kuzo mazinakekelwe – leso ngesinye  isikhalo  esisitholile

ngezindawo abahlala kuzo.

Izindawo abahlala kuzo mazinakekelwe noma  zakhiwe  uma  zingekho,  ikakhulu
emitholampilo  esemakhaya.  Abahlengikazi  abakhelwe   izindlu   ezenelisayo

Noma sengiphawule kanje kodwa i-IFP iyasisekela lesi sabelo esithuliwe.
Kodwa futhi angiphinde ngithokoze. Kukhona okusha engikuzwile lapha. Ngizwe

njengoba lucwebezela lunje uLundi luzoba yisibhedlela, hhayi, sonke
siyolala khona. [Uhleko.] [Ihlombe.] Ngiyabonga. (Translation of isiZulu
speech follows.)

[Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Hon Chairperson, hon the Minister and the hon members in
their respective portfolios in this House, today the Department of Health
is faced with difficulties. I am not even talking about the astounding
conditions where nurses come to work wearing nightdresses. It is indeed
difficult. Only a person with neither eyes nor ears can deny this.

The budget allocation for this department that has so many problems is
extremely small, too small to move an inch. Hospitals are extremely full.
Diseases are also posing a gigantic challenge, let alone the question of
HIV and Aids. Experienced nurses are leaving this country. And those who
stay behind have a lot of work to do. The major complaint is that vacancies
should be filled so as to reduce the workload, to enable nurses to work
freely and be in a position to nurse all those who are sick.

During the Budget Vote for the provincial department of health in KwaZulu-
Natal, the hon MEC said, and I quote:

   The health sector is a labour-intensive area. To succeed we have to
   ensure that we have motivated and committed staff with the right skills
   mix in adequate numbers.


These words alone bear witness to what I have just said now that
experienced workers are leaving this country and there are staff shortages,
which are not easy to eliminate, and a lot of work. Thus they cannot offer
the patience and love needed by the sick.

The budget allocation for the health sector should be higher than it is now
so that it could match the needs of such an important task. The other thing
is that all doctors and nurses who are doing such a gigantic task in all
their working spheres should be paid satisfactory salaries, if their work
is satisfactory, regardless of their training or expertise. Their
complaints should be analysed and their requirements met. Their residences
should be taken care of as this is one of the complaints that we received
when we were inspecting their residences at hospitals. They are extremely
concerned about their residences.

Their residences should be taken care of and if they do not have any,
especially at the rural clinics, they should be built for them. Good
residences for nurses should be built so as to encourage them to love the
profession they are in. Places where they are working must be taken care
of. Doctors and nurses should be proud of their work; and should of the
place in which they are working; and also of nursing the sick with care and
love that they feel deep down in their hearts because they are experiencing
satisfaction in their work.

Clinics should satisfy the communities they are situated in. There should
be medicines at the clinics. There should be an ambulance to cater for the
emergencies. There are patients who die waiting because there is no
ambulance available at clinics for emergencies. I, however, did hear my MEC
say they will place orders for ambulances. This is quite good, because I am
in KwaZulu-Natal and I will keep my eyes and ears open.

The Department of Health caters for the health of the people in the whole
country. There is a complaint in this department. There are not enough
clinics in rural areas, where there is still destitution. The budget
allocation for the health sector does not promise to be the one that will
carry out all the work that I have mentioned. There are problems in this
department on top of those it is already faced with.

Notwithstanding my comments, the IFP, however, supports the tabled budget.
There is also something new that I heard here that makes me happy. I heard
my MEC saying that the former Ulundi legislature building would be
converted into a hospital. [Laughter.] [Interjections.][Applause.] I am
therefore saying . . . [Interjections.] . . . well, that’s another matter.
[Laughter.] We clearly need hospitals beyond the Tugela River. The only
hospitals there are the ones built by the old government and the
missionaries. If the glittering Ulundi is converted into a hospital, well,
we shall all be admitted there. [Laughter.] [Applause.] I thank you.]

Ms G RAMOKGOPHA  (Gauteng):  Deputy  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  Dr  Manto
Tshabalala-Msimang, our Deputy  Minister,  my  colleagues,  members  of  the
House, it is indeed my privilege and  pleasure  to  address  this  important
House 26 days away from celebrating 50 years of the adoption of the  Freedom
Charter in Kliptown, Johannesburg.

Just to share with  you  some  of  the  ideals  around  the  health  of  our
forebears, these include a preventative health scheme which will be  run  by
the state, free medical care and hospitalisation which will be  provided  to
all, with special care for mothers and young children.  The  aged,  orphans,
disabled and sick will be cared for by the state.

I think  we  have  over  the  past  11  years  put  together  not  only  the
constitutional framework, but also the  legislative  and  policy  frameworks
that have made sure that when we celebrate these 50 years of the  ideals  of
our forebears, we indeed say we have delivered an improvement in the  health
of our people in South Africa and in our various provinces.

I would like to thank you, hon Minister, for having provided the  leadership
in the last term, in the second term,  as  well  as  continuing  to  provide
leadership in this term.

On Monday, 6 June, that will be next  week,  I  will  also  be  tabling  the
health  budget  vote  for  the  province,  which  is   R9,2   billion,   and
representing about a 4% increase from the previous financial year.  This  is
for about nine million people.

This budget has taken  on  board  the  priorities  of  the  national  Health
Ministry, as well as the provincewide  goals  that  have  been  set  in  the
province, to halve poverty, to halve unemployment, and to reduce the  burden
of disease by investing in our people in the next  10  years,  by  the  year
2014.

We are already in the second year  of  our  third  term  of  our  democracy,
linked to democratic values that we uphold. We also committed ourselves,  as
the province, as the department, to listen, to  communicate  and  work  with
our people. The people’s contract in our department is entrenched.

This is also experienced by our visits, which are quarterly visits  to  sub-
districts in our province. In the last term the visits  were  to  districts,
so we are really getting down and now we are at the sub-district level.

These visits ensure that we understand fully the status of health  services,
and also listen to our people in terms of  making  sure  that  our  services
respond to their needs. This term we are also  focusing  on  a  very  strong
commitment to the Batho Pele service excellence and  quality  of  care,  and
entrenching the Patients’ Rights Charter and  own  service  pledge.  But  we
have also committed ourselves to an  efficient  and  effective  use  of  our
public resources. With respect to healthy  lifestyles  we  acknowledge  that
the first step towards the reduction of the burden of illnesses lies in  the
adoption of healthy lifestyles.

We were very privileged to participate under the leadership of the  Minister
at the Move for your Health campaign in  Alexandra  on  30  May  this  year,
where the message of a healthy lifestyle was driven home.

In our province we communicate quite regularly that our ministry  is  not  a
ministry of diseases and illnesses and injury,  but  it  is  a  ministry  of
health. Our first priority, our primary responsibility, is  to  do  what  is
usually not visible, and that is to promote health and make  sure  that  our
people are not sick, and to contribute to a productive South Africa.

With respect to tobacco control, I am very pleased to share  with  you  that
all our buildings in the department are 100% compliant with  the  provisions
of the current tobacco control policy.

It is also encouraging to learn that there are fewer young people  who  take
up the habit of smoking. This is indeed  proves  that  our  policies  which,
among others, are the most  stringent  and  progressive  in  the  world  are
beginning to bear fruit.

I was disappointed, although I think it was not  deliberate,  that  Sawubona
magazine that I looked at  as  I  was  coming  here,  Madam  Minister,  also
focuses on youth - which is  a  very  important  thing,  but  I  was  a  bit
disturbed - one of the pictures portrays school  youth  as  youth  that  are
smoking. I think that is something that  they  would  take  very  positively
when we give them feedback.

I wish to commend the  Heart  Foundation  and  the  Cancer  Association  who
contribute to working as strategic partners in marketing  healthy  products,
as well as good and  healthy  lifestyles,  in  addition  to  supporting  the
survivors,  and  their  families,  of   diseases   relating   to   unhealthy
lifestyles.

We welcome the publication of the draft regulations regarding  labelling  of
alcoholic beverages;  just  as  negative  results  of  smoking  are  clearly
printed on the cigarette cartons, we also need to  spell  out  the  negative
social and health consequences of alcohol abuse.

Earlier in the year the province held campaigns to warn communities  against
the foetal alcohol syndrome that affects babies whose mothers drink  alcohol
during pregnancy. With  respect  to  mental  health  our  focus  is  on  the
promotion of the mental wellbeing, and the strengthening of early  diagnosis
treatment and support for people living with mental illnesses.

Child and adolescence psychiatry is treated as a priority,  with  a  special
budget set aside to establish an in-patient unit for these services at  Tara
and Chris Hani-Baragwanath Hospitals.

With respect to child health, today in our province we are launching,  under
the leadership of the Premier, a  programme  called  Bana  Pele,  a  Sesotho
phrase for “children first”. This programme is  a  joint  programme  between
the departments of health, education and social development.

It aims at making sure that our commitment to putting children first in  our
country is realised by making sure that the  department,  which  deals  with
children, does not put up unnecessary barriers, but work together in  a  co-
ordinated way so that  children  registered  as  indigent  with  the  health
department can  also  access  services  in  social  services  and  education
accordingly, and will not have to fill in different forms.

We have also launched, today, the third addition of  the  health  guide  for
teachers, of which I have a copy, and I will leave it with  the  House.  Our
schools services have also screened about 150 000  learners  last  year  for
obstacles to learning, when 15 000 learners were found to have problems  and
referred  to  appropriate  facilities.  Also,  2 100  learners  were   given
spectacles. [Applause.]

I want to take up the challenge from KwaZulu-Natal, as well as  the  Eastern
Cape, around the number of baby-friendly hospitals or facilities  that  have
been accredited. We are trailing behind but surely awarding a  further  four
facilities as baby-friendly shows that we will also  be  neck-and-neck  with
you. I take the challenge, that you are ahead of us, as a positive.

In terms of women’s health we have continued to provide cervical and  breast
cancer screening. In the last financial year alone, we  screened  more  than
50 000 woman, which is an over 100% increase over the past five years.

Madam Minister, TB continues to be a burden, even  in  Gauteng.  Whilst  the
cure rate is increasing, over the years the  challenge  still  remains  that
the absolute number of new infections is also on the increase. We  have  set
ourselves a dedicated programme to make sure that we indeed work with  other
stakeholders to reduce this burden.

Eating healthy food and in the correct proportions  are  also  an  important
aspect of maintaining good health. We need to  join  hands  to  ensure  that
every child appreciates  the  importance  of  vegetables,  fruit,  proteins,
carbohydrates as well as of drinking  enough  clean  water.  We  always  say
water is a forgotten nutrient.

Those  who  are  ill  and  have  chronic  illnesses  also  need  nutritional
supplements. Because of unemployment and poverty, many people  with  chronic
and debilitating diseases and children are vulnerable  to  malnutrition.  In
the last year 22 000 adults and 6 500 children benefited from the  nutrition
programme in our budget . . . [Interjections.] Thank you. And in  this  year
R8,8 million has been set aside. We support the  Budget  Vote  and  we  will
endeavour to make sure that in our province the goals  are  realised.  Thank
you. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr K SINCLAIR: The Northern Cape has just concluded a very successful  first
provincial health summit under the theme “The new  dawn  of  health  service
excellence”.

On behalf of the Premier, the hon MEC, who is  unfortunately  absent  today,
and the people of the Northern Cape, we want to thank the Minister  and  the
national department for their  support  and  guidance  with  regard  to  the
inception of the summit.

Currently, the Northern Cape has the second-lowest infant mortality and HIV-
infection rates in the country. Despite the  vastness  of  our  province  we
have been able to create access, particularly  to  preventive  health  care,
for most of our communities on a continuous basis.

Working jointly with the Red Cross, as from last  month,  patients  referred
from the Namaqua district were flown to our tertiary hospital  in  Kimberly,
and 490 patients have already benefitted from this service.

The distance between Kimberly and the farthest  point  in  our  province  is
well over 1 000 km, and we just could not afford the spate of  accidents  we
had in the past as a result of driver fatigue.  The  reality  is  that  it’s
closer to Durban than it is to Port Nolloth, but if I listen to the  problem
that the people have in KwaZulu-Natal, and especially  in  Ulundi,  I  would
rather go to Port Nolloth. [Laughter.]

Ambulances in these areas can now focus  on  emergency  cases.  We  hope  to
introduce this service to other parts of our province in the near future.  I
want to congratulate the hon Minister  and  the  department,  because  every
year the Northern Cape is getting new ambulances and it has done  away  with
these “skorokoros” that also cost our people’s lives.

These are notable achievements, which we certainly  intend  to  improve  on,
particularly based on the outcome of  our  provincial  health  summits.  Our
province appreciates the ongoing  work  that  has  been  done  by  our  home
caregivers. They have  extended  the  ability  to  provide  population-based
health care.

Their contribution has been critical in the realisation  of  the  tenets  of
the people’s contract, and there  are  currently  1 009  caregivers  in  the
province.  We  intend  to  recruit  more  in  the  coming  months,   placing
particular focus on the areas of need.

The foetal alcohol syndrome is a continuing problem in  our  community.  The
problem of the abuse of alcohol presents us with  numerous  challenges.  And
we must break the cycle of destruction.

We  wish  to  thank  the  Minister  for  the  increase   in   the   hospital
revitalisation grant. We  have  already  completed  two  hospitals,  as  the
Minister has mentioned, in Colesburg and Calvinia.

Regarding the  Manne  Dipico  Hospital  in  Colesburg,  a  very  unfortunate
incident  happened  recently  involving  the  hospital  minister.   I   have
requested that the MEC for health in the Northern Cape lodge a  departmental
enquiry regarding  the  issue.  In  terms  of  the  Batho  Pele  principles,
government officials must serve  all  our  people,  black  and  white,  with
dignity and respect. The people using the hospital certainly deserve  better
treatment than they receive form the hospital management.

Over the next two years the hospitals in Upington, De Aar, Barkly  West  and
the mental hospital in Kimberley will be constructed.

What I have just spelled out is what the people who had  no  hope  envisaged
50 years ago, when they accepted the  principles  of  the  Freedom  Charter,
which include accessibility  and  affordability,  quality  health  care  and
comfort. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr S BELOT (Free State): Hon  Chairperson,  Minister  and  Deputy  Minister,
MECs, hon members, thank you for the privilege to participate in the  Budget
Vote for Health. A few weeks before we celebrate  our  50th  anniversary  of
the Freedom Charter, I’m happy to share with this House the achievements  of
the Free State’s department of health, which  are  based  on  the  Alma  Ata
Declaration.

To remind the House, the Alma Ata Declaration provides  for  primary  health
care services that are compatible with the vision of  the  Freedom  Charter.
The primary health care approach is a holistic  and  comprehensive  approach
that seeks to develop the human potential and  eliminate  the  socioeconomic
causes of ill health. Our business is to  ensure  the  delivery  of  quality
health services to the people of the province and I wish to share  with  the
House that in 2004 the Department of the Health was  able  to  see,  examine
and treat more than 7,4 million outpatients at all  our  facilities  in  the
provinces. Of these, 6,1 million people were treated at our  primary  health
care facilities and 789 708  outpatients  visited  the  district  hospitals.
There were 299 954 outpatients at regional hospitals.

I am sharing with the House these statistics in order that  we  could  agree
that  our  people  receive  services  from  our  facilities  and  that   our
government is committed to giving quality health care to our people  in  the
province. The length of stay in our facilities has decreased to 3,5 days  at
regional and tertiary hospitals. The number of  emergency  medical  services
calls that were handled were 131 217 and more than  118  000  patients  were
transported through the planned  patient  transport  to  our  facilities  to
receive the treatment to which they are entitled.

The budget allocated to the department  for  this  financial  year  is  R3,7
billion and these are some of the things  that  will  be  done  during  this
financial year. I need, of course, to put this in context  and  remind  this
House of what our President said in his state of the nation address on  11th
of February this year. He said:


   In  addition,  campaigns  to  reduce  non-communicable  and  communicable
   diseases as well as non-natural causes of death will continue through the
   promotion of healthy lifestyles and increased focus on TB, Aids, malaria,
   cholera and other  waterborne  diseases,  and  generally  increasing  the
   standard of living of the poorest among us.

He further said:

   Broad trends in mortality confirm the need for  us  to  continue  to  pay
   particular attention to the health of our nation. With regard to Aids  in
   particular the government’s comprehensive plan, which is among  the  best
   in the world, combining awareness,  treatment  and  home-based  care,  is
   being implemented with vigour.


It is for this reason that our main focus is to address  the  triple  burden
of  diseases  in  the  Free  State.  That  is  the  diseases  of  lifestyle,
communicable diseases, trauma and violence. Chronic diseases  of  lifestyle,
like  hypertension,  diabetes,  heart  problems,  strokes  and  cancer   are
affecting communities in great numbers. We  therefore  implement  prevention
and health promotion programmes to  address  the  impact  of  these  chronic
diseases of lifestyle.

Health programmes are targeted at mothers, children and youth, the  disabled
and elderly and vulnerable groups  in  all  our  districts.  Initiatives  to
prevent and reduce cervical, breast and  other  kinds  of  cancer,  maternal
deaths,  perinatal  and  genetic  defects  have   been   strengthened.   The
department is implementing and expanding the comprehensive  care  management
and treatment plan for HIV and Aids in all our districts.

All our primary health care clinics have nutritional products  for  patients
who are underweight, malnourished  and  vulnerable.  We  have  ensured  that
there  is  sufficient  availability  of  appropriate  medication   for   all
communicable and  non-communicable  diseases  like  hypertension,  diabetes,
heart problems and lung diseases.

Presently there are  5  600  people  with  disabilities  registered  in  the
disabilities and rehabilitation database that qualify for free  health  care
services. The department will intensify  the  registration  of  people  with
disabilities and also promote awareness among communities at  large  of  the
availability of this service.

Speech and audiology equipment to the value of R1,5  million  and  assistive
devices to the value of R2,7 million have already been  purchased  and  will
be distributed in all districts.  The  programme  for  survivors  of  sexual
assault  and  victim  empowerment  will  be  strengthened   this   year   in
collaboration with other departments and a new victim  support  centre  will
be  established  in  the  eastern  parts  of  the  province.   Post-exposure
prophylaxis is being offered to  all  rape  survivors  presented  at  health
facilities within 72 hours. Our VCCT programme will be extended to  all  our
health facilities because our slogan is: “Know your status”.

An integrated approach on home-based care, which includes  all  chronic  and
terminal  cancer  patients,  is  implemented  in   partnership   with   non-
governmental organisations and home-based  care.  The  department  has  also
ordered 10 000 vials of flu vaccine to be given  to  older  persons  and  to
vulnerable groups.

On  mother,  child  and  women’s  health,   the   department   will   reduce
micronutrient deficiency disorders by providing at  least  78%  of  children
under the age of one year with  vitamin  A  doses  according  to  a  defined
schedule. We also ensure that maternity facilities are  baby-friendly.  This
year six new hospitals  will  qualify  for  baby-friendly  status.  We  will
improve our immunisation coverage by ensuring that  85%  of  children  under
one year are fully  immunised  and  85%  of  children  receive  their  first
measles dose. We are aware of the problem of measles.

With regard  to  cataract  surgery,  we  have  prioritised  this  to  reduce
blindness in the province in the process.  Initiatives  are  implemented  to
improve the cataract surgery rate to 666 per million of  the  population  in
the province. I can share with the House that we  have  thus  far  performed
680 operations. I am happy to announce that we  have  given  vision  to  our
people and now they can see.

With regard to the emergency medical  services,  we  have  strengthened  our
services by purchasing a further 15 new emergency vehicles and we are  going
to appoint inspectors to monitor the utilisation of  our  emergency  service
vehicle in all districts. We are aware of the abuse of this service.  It  is
in this regard that we are appointing these inspectors. I  can  assure  this
House that these inspectors will not stop vehicles when  they  are  carrying
patients for emergency services, but they will inspect them when  they  find
them where they are not supposed to be.

With regard to our clinic facilities and  equipment,  the  clinic  upgrading
and building programme, as well as our  hospital  revitalisation  programme,
has  been  implemented  and  it  is  based  on  the  Expanded  Public  Works
Programme. We are aware that as a department of health we  have  a  role  to
play in the implementation of the Expanded Public  Works  Programme  and  in
creating employment.

As a result  an  amount  of  R5  million  has  been  allocated  to  purchase
equipment for the primary health care clinics in  all  our  districts.  This
will ensure  that  basic  essential  equipment  is  available  for  critical
primary health care services in our province. As I . . . The CHAIRPERSON  OF
COMMITTEES: Hon member, I regret your time has expired.  Mr  S  BELOT  (Free
State): Thank you. I wish to say we support the Budget Vote. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon
Deputy Minister, hon members of the executive  councils  of  our  provinces,
distinguished  special  delegates,  hon  members,  friends   and   comrades,
officials of the  department  under  the  gallant  leadership  of  Mr  Thami
Mseleku, I join the nation in congratulating you on your  appointment  to  a
new workstation. We are confident that your vigour and  energy  will  add  a
new sense of urgency and purpose, like your predecessor, Dr Ntsaluba.

Hon Minister, your budget policy debate takes place at  the  most  exciting,
yet challenging moment in the history of our  country  and  its  people.  It
takes place on the occasion of International Children’s  Day  the  day  when
nations and governments across the globe pause to take stock  of  how  their
policies and programmes have impacted on  the  plight  and  welfare  of  the
children, the very bedrock and foundation of our future. In this  regard  we
must accordingly vow that never shall we allow the graves of our country  to
be littered with the corpses of children who die  of  curable  diseases  and
malnutrition.

It takes place hardly a few weeks before our people’s movement  for  change,
the ANC, in whose hands the future of this country has  been  firmly  placed
by the millions of the electorate, is poised to assemble  for  its  national
general council, which will take stock of the path it  has  traversed  since
its 51st national conference.

This budget policy debate takes  place  when,  in  the  next  24  days,  our
people, united in their diversity, will be poised to  assemble  in  Kliptown
and other parts of the country to celebrate  the  50th  anniversary  of  the
Freedom Charter. This is the vision of hope and the future  for  the  people
of our country under the leadership of their glorious movement, the ANC.

Hon Minister, the invincibility  and  the  unifying  force  of  the  Freedom
Charter, as the only vision that can  rid  South  Africa  of  all  forms  of
inequalities, racial class and gender prejudices, have never been  witnessed
more than in this House  in  the  recent  past.  The  unprecedented  popular
support by the people’s representatives across the party-political  spectrum
in this House has, once again, confirmed to the world and  South  Africa  to
note that there is no other route  to  a  better  future  than  through  the
Freedom Charter.

I think hon Lamoela was just afraid that Mr Tony Leon  would  ban  her  from
the party if she should quote the Freedom Charter, but in  her  introduction
she alluded to the vision of the Freedom Charter. [Applause.]

Today, some amongst us, as the elected representatives of the people,  in  a
naked attempt to advocate the domination of the  rich  over  the  poor,  the
powerful over the vulnerable, have made it loud and clear that  the  Freedom
Charter, which so  many  men  and  women  have  died  for,  is  a  political
manifesto of the ANC and is not the people’s charter for  freedom.  What  an
insult to the fighting history of our people for this freedom that we  enjoy
today.

These are the echoes  of  those  who  stole  the  votes  of  our  people  by
promising them a better life and future; lying to our  people  about  having
broken ranks with the past  of  prejudice  and  discrimination  against  and
exploitation of the poorest  of  the  poor.  One  does  not  need  to  be  a
university professor to understand, in the whole history of our struggle  by
the masses of our people against apartheid  oppression,  that  never  has  a
single programme or vision by any political party emerged that  has  enjoyed
the overwhelming legitimacy and support  of  our  people  like  the  Freedom
Charter.

This is not so because of any cohesion or manipulation, but  simply  because
the people of South Africa, in  their  diversity,  know  that  the  people’s
congress in Kliptown, which adopted the Freedom Charter 50  years  ago,  was
not an ANC congress, but the Congress of the People, who were united by  the
common hatred of racial class, gender, religious  and  all  other  forms  of
discriminations engendered by the apartheid colonial system.

Ms J F TERBLANCHE: Chairperson, on a point of order: We are debating  Budget
Vote No 16 - Health, but Mr Setona is giving us a  lecture  on  the  Freedom
Charter. Maybe he should just stick to the topic, please. Could you rule  on
that?
The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, I do believe  that  you  have  an
understanding that every member has the freedom to speak  on  anything  that
he or she wants to speak on. Continue, hon member.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Chairperson, I am not  addressing  hon
Terblanche. I am addressing the masses of the people who have voted for  the
ANC to expose the lies of the DA, saying that the Freedom Charter is an  ANC
pamphlet.

According to the late President of the ANC, the late O R Tambo, one  of  the
finest architects and icons of our struggle for the kind of society we  seek
to build today, during what he proclaimed the year of the Charter  in  1980,
said:

  The Freedom Charter contains  the  fundamental  perspective  of  the  vast
  majority of the people of South Africa of the kind of liberation  that  we
  all of us are fighting for. Hence it is not merely the Freedom Charter  of
  the African National Congress and its allies. Rather it is the Charter  of
  the people of South Africa for liberation.


  Because it came from the people, it remains still a people’s Charter,  the
  one basic  political  statement  of  our  goals  to  which  all  genuinely
  democratic and patriotic forces of South Africa adhere.


Except the DA.

On the occasion of  the  statement  of  the  ANC  on  8  January  2005,  the
President of the ANC went on to say this:


  These words remain true to this day. The Charter embodies a vision  of  an
  alternative society to  the  society  we  inherited.  It  constitutes  the
  programme of the people of  our  country  for  the  creation  of  a  truly
  democratic, non-racial, non-sexist, united and prosperous country.

We, in the ANC, enter this debate with  a  great  sense  of  pride  for  the
remarkable achievements of government in the transformation  of  our  health
system, to serve all our people. We also  appreciate  and  acknowledge  that
ours is not an easy struggle, one to be warned  by  declaration  and  sweet-
talking in the boardrooms, but a complex and protracted struggle to  undo  a
legacy created over more than three centuries of colonial oppression.

In this regard, the road ahead  to  achieve  the  full  realisation  of  the
vision and the ideals of the Freedom Charter is still long and bumpy.  There
are no readymade formulae to resolve all our problems. Despite these, as  we
celebrate the first decade of our democracy, the people’s government,  under
the leadership of the ANC, has made qualitative strides  within  the  health
sector, in line with the vision of the Freedom Charter.

This includes, amongst others, introducing a sound  legislative  and  policy
framework  in  line  with  our  Constitution  and   the   Freedom   Charter,
deracialising both  the  public  and  the  private  health  sectors  in  our
country, providing free and basic health care services to children from  age
0-6, and pregnant women, expanding health services to the rural  communities
and revitalising our hospitals.

Underpinning our approach to the provision of  health  care  services  is  a
fundamental principle of human dignity and respect for life,  the  principle
that has been at the core of our struggle for liberation.  In  this  regard,
by making  health  care  services  accessible  to  millions  of  our  people
constitutes a fundamental milestone in the struggle to protect the life  and
restore the dignity of an African, which was not worth anything in the  eyes
of those who governed this country before 1994.

I think hon Gcobana, with due respect, has captured  that  in  more  detail.
[Laughter.] When taking our memories  back  to  before  the  27  April  1994
democratic breakthrough, a sense of  agony  and  despair  afflicts  men  and
women who are today widows and widowers because  they  lost  their  partners
due to ailments that could have been cured, but because  of  the  colour  of
their skins  they  were  deliberately  denied  access  to  health  care  and
services. I am not sure whether hon Lamoela was audacious, before  27  April
1994, to talk on behalf of the people who do not have access to health  care
and services in this country. Today he is making much noise, as  if  the  DA
could be a champion of the aspirations of our people.

It is thanks to the Freedom Charter, which proclaims that free medical  care
and hospitalisation shall be provided for all, that this  is  happening.  In
every debate that has to do with health, it is  common  cause  that  the  DA
will always make a noise about the HIV and Aids  pandemic.  In  doing  this,
they seek to project themselves as the solution to  this  pandemic,  in  the
manner in which they usually evoke sensation about  the  genuine  plight  of
our people to win their sympathy for votes.

What they forget is that HIV and Aids is neither a social  nor  a  political
construct that you could easily tackle with a political will,  as  they  are
suggesting. It is a disease that is  so  complex  that  not  even  a  single
developed country has found a cure for it yet.  Unless  they  show  us  -  I
don’t think we as ANC are going to be arrogant -  if  they  can  show  us  a
single country that has an absolute remedy for  HIV/Aids  I  think  the  ANC
will accept it, in the interests of our people. [Applause.]

For us who live amongst and with the poorest of the  poor,  the  section  of
our society  mostly  vulnerable  to  all  forms  of  communicable  diseases,
including HIV and Aids, it is clear that it is due to poverty  and  lack  of
decent housing. The best cure  for  Aids  is  prevention,  as  there  is  no
medical, scientific cure for this dreaded disease.

The ANC will continue to do everything it can to fight the  scourge  of  the
HIV/Aids pandemic, as well as tuberculosis. To this end,  the  Treasury  and
the Ministry have prioritised all activities relating  to  the  control  and
prevention of HIV and Aids, including in the 2001-04 MTEF,  as  well  as  an
initial focus on awareness to more practical activities in  2004  and  2005,
which saw the budget  grow  to  monitor  and  control  HIV  and  Aids  in  a
comprehensive manner.

In this regard,  hon  Minister,  we  will  give  our  full  support  to  the
government’s  comprehensive  approach  to  health,  which  is  anchored   in
prevention, care and control. We do this because we know that no  amount  of
noise from the DA will cure our sisters and brothers who  are  infected  and
affected by this dreadful disease.  For  us  the  pain  inflicted  on  those
affected . . . The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member,  I  regret  you’re
your time has expired.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: The  ANC  supports  the  Budget  Vote.
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER  OF  HEALTH:   Mphathisihlalo,  angiqale  ngokubingelela
ngibonge koNgqongqoshe bezifunda  ngokuba  khona  lapha  ngothi  lwabo  bese
ngibonga   nezikhulu   eziqhamuka    eMnyangweni    kazwelonke    wezeMpilo.
[Chairperson,  let  me  start  by  greeting  and  thanking  the   provincial
ministers for  their  presence  here  and  allow  me  to  thank  the  senior
officials from the national Department of Health.]

It is a great pleasure for me to support the Budget Vote of the Minister  of
Health, Dr Manto Tshabalala-Msimang.

As we enter the second decade of our democracy we have a  responsibility  to
make real the call of our  people  for  a  health  system  that  cares.  The
Department of Health has developed goals, among which I wish to  single  out
the following: to promote equity, accessibility and  utilisation  of  health
services; to extend the  availability  and  ensure  the  appropriateness  of
health  services;  to  develop  health  promotion  activities;   to   foster
community participation across the health sector and to improve planning  of
the health sector, and the monitoring of health status and health services.

The World  Health  Organisation  defines  health  as  a  state  of  complete
physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of  disease
or infirmity.

Good health, like so many things, is  unequally  distributed.  Entering  the
21st century, about half the world’s people have been  left  behind,  unable
to achieve their health potential. There is a  vast  burden  of  preventable
diseases amongst those less privileged, the majority of humankind.  This  is
reflected also here in our own country and  our  policies  are  specifically
aimed to overcome these disparities.

We  are  developing  an  integrated  health  system   integrating   primary,
secondary and tertiary care. If this is to be offered  equitably,  all  must
have equal access  irrespective  of  where  they  live  or  their  financial
circumstances. It  requires  a  transformation  in  the  way  staff  in  our
tertiary facilities see their tasks from being concerned for those who  walk
through the door to having a concern and responsibility for all  the  people
in their catchment area.

When their health fails, people want to be able to access  the  best  health
care available. They want  a  hospital  that  functions  and  is  adequately
staffed, that has appropriate equipment  in  working  order  for  diagnosis,
medicines for  treating  their  illnesses  and  people  who  care.  We  have
prioritised getting our health technology systems in top working  order.  We
will  be  publishing  regulations  that  provide  for  the   licensing   and
registration of medical equipment and service providers.

The regulations will provide for the selection of appropriate technology  to
ensure equity in distribution, affordability and sustainability, as well  as
cover the competencies needed for safe and proper utilisation of equipment.

As part of this process I paid a surprise visit to Pelonomi Hospital in  the
Free State. The visit was to observe and assess a  day  in  the  life  of  a
clinical technologist with a  view  to  proposing  lasting  and  sustainable
solutions. What I found  was  that  despite  the  difficult  conditions  and
budgetary constraints the clinical technicians remain committed  to  serving
our people. We address these issues in a report that recommends  simplifying
procurement processes and addressing personnel and equipment  shortages,  as
well as issues of infection control. This will require partnerships and  co-
operation with other state departments and the private sector to  develop  a
blueprint that would be applicable to all provinces.

The World Health Organisation defines health promotion  as  the  process  of
enabling people to increase control over their health, to  achieve  a  state
of complete physical and social wellbeing. An individual  must  be  able  to
realise aspirations, to satisfy  needs  and  to  change  or  cope  with  the
environment. Health is a positive concept emphasising  personal  and  social
resources, as well as physical capabilities.  Health  promotion,  therefore,
is not just the responsibility of the health sector but goes beyond  healthy
lifestyles to wellbeing.

Health promotion is essentially an intersectoral issue.  We  will  take  our
campaign for healthy lifestyles to all the  spheres  of  government  at  all
levels, as the Minister has said, as well as  civil  society,  to  create  a
culture of taking responsibility for our own health and the  health  of  the
nation.

As we approach  the  problems  of  obesity  and  other  preventable  chronic
illnesses we will benefit from the  knowledge  regarding  socioeconomic  and
cultural factors that compound the problem. We will  partner  with  research
institutions  and  our  universities   to   understand   the   psychological
conditions that provide fertile ground for the exploitation  of  our  people
by the multibillion rand quick weight-loss industry.

This lucrative industry markets their products as fat trappers, fat  burners
or starch blockers with testimonies of unsubstantiated results. To date  the
only effective and scientific method of weight loss is a calorie  restricted
diet and adequate exercise. Vuka, South Africa!  [Wake  up,  South  Africa!]
Eat less, move more.

We will mount our  campaign  to  educate  our  communities  about  safe  and
evidence-based methods of weight loss. We have begun  preparing  regulations
that will help  us  tighten  the  control  around  the  marketing  of  these
products, as well as paying attention to the  labelling  of  foodstuffs.  We
will be working closely with provincial and local  law-enforcement  agencies
to ensure that the law is upheld and that our people are protected.

Last year I spoke  about  mental  illness,  including  depression,  anxiety,
stress and suicide. To understand the problem, we have conducted  the  South
African youth behaviour risks survey, which found  that  suicide  is  common
among our young people with almost half of the cases in the  20  to  34-year
age group.

Some of the  mental  health  stresses  have  manifested  themselves  in  the
increasing incidence of family killings.  Men  are  killing  their  spouses,
their children and themselves. This increase in family  killings  is  linked
to many issues, including poverty, gender inequality, alcohol and  substance
abuse, depression and  anxiety,  social  violence,  HIV  and  post-traumatic
stress disorder. Strengthening the implementation of the Mental  Health  Act
requires looking at issues of training and  staffing  of  our  primary  care
centres. We will improve the  integration  of  mental  health  into  primary
health care. We will campaign to destigmatise mental illness and  strengthen
mental health programmes for children and adolescents.

I am concerned about the capping of benefits for mental patients by some  of
our medical aids. We will ensure that this is addressed as part of a  common
approach to care management and treatment of  mental  illness.  If  properly
managed and treated, mentally ill patients have a good chance of  recovering
and returning to active community life.

We will  be  upgrading  psychiatric  facilities  and  developing  norms  and
standards for in-patient and community services.  This  is  to  address  the
problem, which the Minister of Health has mentioned in her address.

I am saddened and shocked by  the  alleged  ill-treatment  of  mentally  ill
people. Working with our provincial department, we  will  ensure  that  this
comes to  a  stop.  Earlier  this  year  Minister  Tshabala-Msimang  visited
KwaZulu-Natal to investigate  reports  of  the  abuse  of  patients  at  our
institutions and ordered a high-level investigation that will assist  us  in
understanding and addressing this problem that we are  determined  to  stamp
out.

Gun violence puts significant stress on our health resources.  We  therefore
welcome the national effort to reduce the number of guns in  circulation  in
our country.

Violence is also fuelled by alcohol and substance abuse. We  will  therefore
fight these social ills as part of reducing violence and  promoting  healthy
lifestyles.

The health status of our mouths often reflects our general  health.  One  of
the manifestations of Aids is oral thrush, which  occurs  quite  often  when
the immune system has been weakened. The department has  initiated  a  range
of  programmes  to  promote  oral  health.  Five  provinces  have  developed
operational strategies to strengthen oral health services.

We are finalising a national oral health promotion framework, as well  as  a
manual on oral health for community and  home-based  care.  In  August  this
year we will be going to Limpopo to launch our  National  Oral  Health  Care
Month. I  am  looking  forward  to  your  participation  in  this  important
campaign.

This month our country will be commemorating our  youth,  remembering  those
young martyrs who contributed to our struggle  to  free  South  Africa.  Our
healthy lifestyles campaign must be driven by the youth of  our  country  in
the same way as they were able to mobilise for our freedom  from  apartheid.
I am calling on the youth to  mobilise  for  health  and  the  promotion  of
healthy lifestyles with a special focus on sexual and  reproductive  health,
including HIV and Aids.

In dealing with these key priorities we have formed partnerships with  civil
society such as the Planned Parenthood Association of  South  Africa,  which
implements the loveLife campaign. We particularly need such partnerships  in
critical areas of delivery of health care  where  the  state  is  unable  to
reach because of a shortage of resources or  the  inability  of  our  health
system to cope.

The Planned Parenthood Association of South Africa plays an  important  part
in loveLife, South Africa’s  national  HIV  prevention  campaign  for  young
people. They have partnered with government to turn  back  the  epidemic  of
HIV and Aids and related epidemics of  pregnancy  and  sexually  transmitted
infections among our teenagers.

I am concerned with the high levels of teenage  pregnancy.  This  says  that
something is blocking our messages about safe sex and we therefore  have  to
step up our efforts, as  well  as  seek  new  and  more  effective  ways  of
achieving behaviour change.

Our comprehensive plan to fight HIV and Aids is considered one of  the  best
in the world. It involves prevention, care, management  and  treatment.  Its
emphasis on prevention takes into account the fact that there is as  yet  no
cure. It encourages voluntary counselling and testing. It  helps  those  who
test negative to remain free of the virus. It helps those who test  positive
and need treatment to  make  informed  choices,  including  that  concerning
treatment with  antiretroviral  drugs,  which  is  the  only  scientifically
proven, effective form of therapy.

Having  achieved  our  target  of  establishing  service  centres  for  this
programme in all our districts, our task, as the Minister has said,  remains
to expand the service and thus increase access. We  are  stepping  up  these
efforts to improve training and deploy our staff to these sites so  that  we
can reach greater numbers of people who so desperately need care.

There is some considerable confusion, hon  members  and  the  public,  which
does not help people  living  with  HIV  and  Aids  regarding  the  role  of
nutrition and treatment. As reaffirmed recently  by  the  Deputy  President,
who is chair of the SA National Aids Council, and our  Minister  of  Health,
Dr Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, government policy is that good  nutrition  does
not only promote  good  health  but  is  also  a  critical  component  of  a
comprehensive response to this disease.

But, nutrition is not a substitute for appropriate treatment. As members  of
Parliament and the public we  have  a  responsibility  to  communicate  this
message, which is our national policy. We have a  responsibility  to  ensure
that everything possible is done to give more people access  to  information
and evidence-based treatment options.  This is a life  and  death  situation
and we must reach out and use our power and resources to save the  lives  of
our people. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr P UYS Western Cape: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon Deputy  Minister,  hon
colleagues, hon MECs, hon members, I want to congratulate the  hon  Minister
of Health for presenting us with a budget that continues  to  expand  access
to equitable, affordable and good quality health services.

As envisaged in the Freedom Charter, government continues  to  make  quality
health care more accessible to the poor through,  among  other  things,  the
provision  of  new  clinics,  free  health  care,  especially  for  pregnant
mothers, young children and people with disabilities. At the  same  time  it
remains  committed  to  improving  the  services  provided  in  our   health
facilities, through improving training, recruitment and retention of  health
personnel,  improved  infrastructure  and  enhanced  health  promotion   and
awareness.

In supporting this Budget Vote, I want  to  assure  the  Minister  that  the
provincial department will this year not only  take  health  closer  to  the
people by making it more accessible to  those  with  the  highest  level  of
need, but work hard to promote healthy living in our communities.

Saam met ander rolspelers in die nasionale  en  plaaslike  regering  is  ons
gereed om armoede en ongelykheid die stryd aan te sê en om  ’n  nuwe  bestel
tot  stand   te   bring   waar   almal   gelyke   toegang   tot   beskikbare
gesondheidsbronne het. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Together  with  other   role-players   within   national   and   provincial
government, we are ready to start the fight against poverty  and  inequality
and bring about a new dispensation where there will be equal access for  all
to available health resources.]

The association between social and economic conditions  and  ill  health  is
well established, whether socioeconomic  status  is  measured  in  terms  of
income,  education  and  employment  or  housing,  people  living  in   poor
conditions suffer the  worst  health.  Our  care  will  therefore  focus  on
strengthening the frontline of our health  services  by  providing  seamless
primary level services, community-based  care  and  preventive  care,  while
maintaining a core of essential, highly specialised  health  care  services.
We also need to promote  good  health  and  healthy  lifestyles  within  our
communities in line with the national  programme  of  action,  adopt  urgent
strategies to recruit and retain health  professionals,  especially  nurses,
to ensure the future stability of the health services.

In building on the national Budget, we are spurred on by the  goals  set  by
the Minister  in  her  budget  speech.  Those  goals  speak  to  our  health
departments and we need to work to increase  the  impact  of  the  campaigns
against alcohol and substance abuse, smoking, unsafe  sexual  behaviour  and
unhealthy behaviour in general.

It also addresses the important matter of the health of our  women  and  our
children. Much work still needs to be done to provide  women  with  adequate
preventative and curative interventions. In this regard we  will  give  more
attention to the management of rape  victims,  and  screening  for  cervical
cancer. At  the  same  time,  we  will  more  vigorously  tackle  diarrhoeal
diseases and expand the programme of immunisation that impacts  directly  on
the health of our children.

Allow me also to highlight some of  the  critical  areas  in  which  we  are
building on the  Minister’s  budget.  In  the  2005-06  financial  year  the
Western Cape will receive R1,2 billion from the national  tertiary  services
grant to help fund three central hospitals, namely Groote Schuur,  Tygerberg
and the Red Cross Children’s Hospital. A  large  percentage  of  the  health
professions training  and  development  grant  received  from  the  national
department will also go to these hospitals.

Programme wat MIV en Vigs aanspreek sal R82 miljoen van die nasionale
omvattende MIV en Vigs-toelaag ontvang. Dit spreek direk tot die regering
se verbintenis om MIV en Vigs as deel van ’n omvattende program aan te
spreek. Daar word op hierdie fondse voortgebou om ’n totaal van R167
miljoen vir die program in die jaar beskikbaar te stel. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Programmes that address HIV and Aids will receive R82 million of the
national comprehensive HIV and Aids grant. It relates directly to the
government’s commitment to address HIV and Aids as part of a comprehensive
programme. These funds will be augmented so as to be able to make available
a total of R167 million for the programme during this year.]

The treatment of tuberculosis remains a priority and will this year  receive
a total of R70,7 million in the Western Cape,  of  which  R64,1  million  is
budgeted  for  TB  hospitals.  This  is  strengthened  by R4,4  million  for
additional staff and laboratory services at our clinics. An amount  of  R2,2
million is also  made  available  for  the  taking  over  of  two  municipal
hospitals, in Paarl and Malmesbury, and  the  SANTA  Harry  Gumede  hospital
during this financial year.

The  Minister,  in  her  budget   speech,   stressed   the   importance   of
strengthening our mental health services and as result the  amount  of  R4,9
million was allocated for the implementation of the Mental Health Care  Act.
Part of this funding will go towards the Mental Health Review  Board,  which
will play an integral role in ensuring that the rights of the mental  health
care users are protected.

In line with national policy objectives, we have  prioritised  our  hospital
revitalisation  projects.  The  R172  million  received  from  the  national
revitalisation grant will help fund a variety of  projects,  such  as  those
currently in progress in George, Worcester, Vredenburg. Work  at  the  Paarl
Hospital will commence during 2005, while planning  is  under  way  for  the
envisaged hospital in Khayelitsha.

Other  major  projects  include  the  upgrading  of  the  Mowbray  Maternity
Hospital, the Caledon  and  Riversdale  Hospitals,  a  primary  health  care
facility, a new clinic will be constructed at Brown’s Farm  to  replace  the
current container clinic, a new  clinic  will  be  constructed  in  Montagu,
Elsies River will be upgraded as  well  as  those  at  Simondium,  Stanford,
Swellendam and Wellington.

The  department  presently  funds  320  student  nurses,  while  the  higher
education institutions are training 115 registered  nurses.  This,  together
with a further intake of 74 nurse assistants at these institutions, as  well
as the colleges, will mean that more than 500 nurses are in training in  the
Western Cape at present.  This  is  not  enough  but  we  are  committed  to
recruiting and training more nurses in future.

In conclusion, this year will also see the implementation  of  the  National
Health Act, which will have far-reaching  implications  and  challenges  for
the department, in  particular  the  establishment  of  the  provincial  and
district health councils and the provincial health advisory committee.  This
will build on government’s commitment to  increase  community  participation
in health care, the commitment that will also be  visible  in  other  areas,
such as heeding the Minister’s call to work actively  with  our  communities
and our partners in supporting people to take more responsibility for  their
own health.

Furthermore, in bringing health closer to our people,  this  year  will  see
the rapid expansion and  improvement  of  community-based  services  in  our
province. These improvements include a new integrated model  for  home-based
care and also for step-down facilities. So often we forget  that  health  is
about people caring for people, and about us having to care for our  carers.
Today we, as we must do every day, honour our  carers  and  the  noble  work
that they do. [Applause.]

As departement aanvaar ons dat ons by tye alles in ons vermoë moet doen om
die beginsels van Batho Pele uit te leef, waarvolgens die mense eerste
gestel word. Dit gaan juis oor die omgee vir ons mense en deur
gesondheidsdienste te lewer waarop ons almal trots kan wees.
[As department, we accept that at times we have to do everything in our
power to carry out the principles of Batho Pele, in terms of which people
are placed first. It is all about caring for the people and by providing
health services that we can all be proud of.]

Allow me, Chairperson, to thank our hon Minister, our  Deputy  Minister  and
all the staff from the national department, but also in all  the  provincial
departments and local government for the work that they  do  in  caring  for
the people of this beautiful South Africa. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr N S GININDA (Mpumalanga): Chairperson, hon Minister of Health,  Dr  Manto
Tshabalala-Msimang, Deputy  Minister  Madlala-Routledge,  hon  MECs  present
here from different provinces, hon  members  of  this  distinguished  House,
ladies and gentlemen and comrades present here, I feel honoured today to  be
afforded this rare opportunity to address this august House.

This year  we  celebrate  the  50th  anniversary  of  the  Freedom  Charter.
Contained in this historic document is the vision  of  a  society  that  our
people, who gathered in  Kliptown  in  1955,  sought  to  create.  They  had
already said then that South Africa belonged to all who lived in  it,  black
and white, united in their  diversity.  These  people  envisaged  a  society
where the state would play a central and pivotal role in  the  provision  of
key social services to its people.

The people’s charter says, and I quote:

  A preventative health scheme shall be run by the state; and, free  medical
  care and hospitalisation shall be provided for all, with special care  for
  mothers and young children.

The ANC-led government gave an important impetus to the vision as  contained
in the Freedom Charter when it assumed  power  after  the  first  democratic
elections in 1994. Although faced with serious  inherited  apartheid  debts,
which inevitably would constrain any government in its  efforts  to  provide
much-needed social care to  its  citizens,  the  democratic  government  has
reached  commendable  milestones  towards  the  improvement  of  the  living
conditions of our people, thereby restoring their human dignity, which  they
had been denied by the then apartheid state for a very long time.

The health budget that we are to consider has been increased by 11,4%,  with
a further increase in the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework period. We  are,
therefore, confident that this will go a long way towards strengthening  our
capacity to respond  to  all  challenges  in  the  provision  of  effective,
efficient and adequate health services to all our people.

One of these challenges, which remains a cause for  concern,  especially  in
rural provinces such as ours, is the mass  exodus  of  health  professionals
either to urban provinces or overseas countries in what they  call  “looking
for greener pastures”.

Just two months ago in our province we advertised 20 posts for  professional
nurses in two hospitals in the Nkomazi region, which is very rural.  In  one
hospital we couldn’t even get a single application, whereas in the other  we
received just one. This is despite numerous  interventions  that  have  been
introduced by the national department in the person of  our  Minister  here,
such as rural allowances, provision of free accommodation and others.

This  also  happens  against  the  background  of  research  results,  which
actually show that the salaries  we  pay  in  the  public  sector  are  more
competitive than those in the private sector.  We  are,  however,  confident
that through the efforts of our Minister, interacting with countries in  the
developed world, a mutual agreement on this  issue  shall  be  reached,  and
that many of those who left the country will come back and that more  health
professionals will follow them.

We have also made some interventions  in  our  province  by  establishing  a
nursing college at the former Elijah Mango College  of  Education  and  have
increased our student intake from 100 to 300 in the first year.

We are building comfortable  houses  in  the  rural  areas  for  our  health
professionals and we will be looking into many other interventions  that  we
need to make to retain these professionals in our rural areas.

We wish all our health students who study overseas and  within  the  country
everything of the best, and are looking forward to seeing  them  working  in
our rural hospitals after completing their studies.

Our Minister launched the Move for Health campaign  in  Alexandra  just  two
days ago. We support this initiative because we share  the  sentiments  that
say that  the  health  of  each  individual  is  actually  his  or  her  own
responsibility. Accordingly, we will be hosting a provincial launch of  this
important campaign in our province on 10 June 2005,  and  we  are  going  to
cascade it down to all our municipalities in the province.

We also welcome the promulgation of the National Health Act last month,  and
we are convinced that these developments will undoubtedly revolutionise  the
health profession for all our people in the country.

We are pleased that this Act will address two important aspects in  relation
to provision of health care, that is accessibility and affordability.

We are further pleased by the commitment made by  the  Minister  to  provide
free medical care to people  living  with  disabilities.  We  also  need  to
ensure that indeed all of our public institutions are accessible to them.

We would like to commend the progress made with regard to the  Comprehensive
Plan for the Management,  Care  and  Treatment  of  HIV  and  Aids  and  the
provision of antiretroviral drugs. We believe  that  returning  to  God  and
beseeching him to intervene is a prerequisite for the  prevention  and  cure
of the pandemic.

We have also made commendable strides in our province in the  implementation
of  the  comprehensive  plan.  Linked  to  this  intervention,  and  equally
important, are the efforts that must be made continuously to fight back  the
frontiers of poverty, because no matter how healthy you may be, if you  have
nothing to eat, you are obviously prone to diseases and frustrations.

Through all our programmes we need to create work and fight  poverty  so  as
to ensure that the living conditions of our people are improved and that  we
create a better life for all.

We will continue, without rest,  to  work  towards  building  an  efficient,
effective and sustainable public health care  system  in  our  country.  Our
work is more unique than that of any other department in that we  take  care
of people before they are born, we continue to take care of them  for  their
lifespan and we take care of their next of kin, even after death.

Indeed, we care. Siyanakekela. [We care.] We  are  a  caring  and  a  humane
society. Vuka South Africa; vuka Mpumalanga; move forward; move for  health.
Mpumalanga supports the Budget Vote. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr S C SEKOATI (Limpopo):  Thank  you,  Chairperson.  Hon  Minister,  Deputy
Minister of Health, hon members of  the  NCOP,  fellow  MECs  present  here,
officials from the Department of Health, we feel honoured to participate  in
this historic debate when as a nation we are joining  hands  in  celebrating
the 50th anniversary of the Freedom Charter.

Primary  health  care,  which  is  underpinned  by  the   active   community
participation, remains the backbone of our health system. It is through  our
commitment to active participation that we have not only established  clinic
committees and hospital boards in line with the  new  National  Health  Act,
but we have also launched district and provincial health councils.

The governing structures are well positioned to  oversee  the  rendering  of
people-driven and  people-centred  service  delivery  as  enshrined  in  the
Freedom Charter, which remains a guiding document in our quest to  create  a
better life for all our citizens.

We view promotion of healthy lifestyles  as  a  foundation  of  our  primary
health care system. We ourselves, and our  communities,  shall  continue  to
engage in undertaking physical exercise, and to put  a  stop  to  nauseating
habits such as smoking and excessive use of alcohol. We will  also  continue
to highlight our commitment to ensuring that no  woman  dies  of  pregnancy-
related causes and no child dies of  childhood  illnesses.  This  commitment
was demonstrated by the Minister of health, the  hon  Dr  Manto  Tshabalala-
Msimang when she led the community of Turfloop, in Limpopo,  in  a  walk  on
World Health Day under the theme “Make every mother and child count”.

The role of community health workers in providing health promotion and home-
based care to those with debilitating  conditions  is  critical.  We  commit
ourselves to strengthening the Community Health Care  Worker  programme  and
to ensure that these workers are able  to  identify  health  care  needs  of
communities and to refer them to the relevant health services.

We will remain focused on voluntary counselling and testing as part  of  our
annual drive and encourage those tested to lead healthy  lives.  It  is  our
aim to reach more clients with the condom distribution programme, where  our
primary health care facilities are a source of  strength  in  management  of
sexually transmitted infections.

The department’s operational plan for the comprehensive HIV  and  Aids  care
management and  treatment  plan  is  the  cornerstone  of  the  departmental
response to the HIV and Aids challenge. The operational  plan  was  enriched
by eight accredited ARV treatment sites, where  some  10%  of  our  patients
currently receiving antiretroviral treatment are children.

The key element in the treatment is nutrition through a  balanced  diet  and
to this end all patients on ARV  treatment  are  provided  with  nutritional
supplements. The programme is backed by 10 facilities  which  provide  step-
down  services,  as  well  as  324  home-based  care  sites  which   support
approximately  283  000  affected  and  infected  individuals.  The  1   047
caregivers attached to home-based care sites are currently given  a  stipend
per month.

Our  resource  training  centre  is  well   positioned   to   train   health
professionals  on  the  comprehensive  HIV  and  Aids  care  management  and
treatment plan, to add to the current 305  health  professionals  that  have
already been trained.

While we strengthen our efforts to  the  management  of  HIV  and  Aids,  TB
remains a  serious  challenge,  particularly  the  emergence  of  multidrug-
resistant TB. To this end the department continues to  focus  on  mobilising
Dots supporters to ensure compliance by those patients on TB treatment.


Our multidrug-resistant centre is also completed and  will  be  commissioned
during this financial year. Much as we continue to encounter fatalities  due
to malaria, the number of malaria fatality cases  remains  stagnant.  Thanks
to our structured  spray  programmes  we  shall  endeavour  to  improve  and
increase on the number of structures being sprayed in the endemic areas.


The budget of the hospital revitalisation has increased from R106,5  million
in 2004-05 to R212,9 million in this financial year and it  is  through  the
availability of those funds that Lebowakgomo Hospital  is  almost  complete,
while Dilokong at Jane Furse will also be completed later this year.


The department also benefits from  a  provincial  infrastructure  grant  and
some of these funds are utilised to  upgrade  our  clinics  and  to  provide
electricity and a reliable source of water  to  these  primary  health  care
centres.


The shortage of  the  staff  in  both  the  administrative  and  the  health
professionals’ fraternity remains a challenge that will  take  a  number  of
years to bring to acceptable levels.  Our  ability  to  recruit  and  retain
health professionals is difficult to manage because of the rural  nature  of
our province.


The rural and scarce skills allowances introduced over the  past  year  have
assisted us to retain a few more professionals. This was  augmented  by  our
own initiatives on  adjusting  the  entry  salary  levels  for  doctors  and
pharmacists. An additional budget has been set aside for the recruitment  of
additional  staff  where  vacancies  exist  and  is  critical  for   service
delivery.

We have also set aside funds to provide bursaries in an  effort  to  attract
students in critical areas to work for the department  after  completion  of
their studies.


The involvement of our citizens remains an important  part  of  the  way  in
which we conduct our service delivery. The  departmental  imbizos  are  held
throughout the province, where  the  community  is  given  opportunities  to
speak  about  expectations  and  later  to  be  given  feedback  on   issues
discussed.


May I take this opportunity to acknowledge the leadership that the  Minister
has provided in setting strategic priorities  and  targets  for  the  health
services and to congratulate  her  on  the  unique  manner  in  which  these
priorities have been highlighted in her budget speech.


Minister, you can rest assured of our full  support  towards  achieving  the
priorities and we support the Budget Vote. Thank you. [Applause.]

Nk N F MAZIBUKO: Sihlalo, mangibingelele uNgqongqoshe kanye  nePhini  lakhe,
oNgqongqoshe abavela ezifundazweni zonke kanye namalungu.  Ngethemba  ukuthi

Inkulumo yami namhlanje ngithanda ukuyifanisa nenja uma ngabe  ibona  imoto.
Siyazi sonke ukuthi uma imoto imile ingenamasondo, izinja zilala kuyo  futhi

Ngenyanga  kaNhlolanja   ikomidi   lethu   lezempilo   lahamba   lavakashela
izifundazwe ezimbili, iGauteng kanye  ne-North  West.  EGauteng  savakashela

Igumbi labalimele lona lihlale ligcwele  ngawo  onke  amahora  ngoba  abantu
bayasethemba. Uma ngabe ulandela futhi  nalaphaya  okulandwa  khona  imithi,
okuthiwa  phecelezi  “dispensary”,  abalanda  imithi  bangakutshela   ukuthi
kuvukwa ngasikhathi sini.  Kuvukwa  ngehora  lesine  ukuze  ube  ngowokuqala
emgqeni, ngisho laba okuthiwa bayaphinda.

Lokhu  kuyabonisa  ukuthi   kusenesidingo   esikhulu   kwesikwenzayo   kanti
namakhambi  abawatholayo  ayabelapha.  Konke  lokhu  sikwenza  ngoba  abantu
basivotela. Sithi phambili ngempilo engcono! Abanye bona  bayayichamela  uma
ngabe imile,  bajike  bayikhonkothe  uma  ngabe  ihamba.  [Uhleko.]  Iqiniso
ukuthi izinga lezempilo lapha eNingizimu Afrika lisezingeni eliphakeme.

Ezinye  izinselelo  ezikulezi  zibhedlela  yizinkinga  zabahlengikazi   laba
esibaqeqeshayo. (Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[Ms N F MAZIBUKO: Chairperson,  I  would  like  to  start  by  greeting  the
Minister and the Deputy Minister,  the  MECs  from  all  the  provinces  and
members. I believe that it has been mentioned by most people  here  that  on
Monday the Minister launched a project called “Vuka  Ningizimu  Afrika”.  We
saw the Minister on TV, performing her slick dance moves in  Alexandra,  the
real township.

I do hope that most people are going to exercise their bodies.  There  is  a
gym here, but most members have never set foot in  that  gym.  I  hope  that
most members will start to run on  the  treadmill,  while  others  pedal  on
cycles. The Minister has challenged us to co-operate with her department  in
order to avoid being afflicted by heart diseases owing to  the  accumulation
of fat.

I would like to compare my speech today to what happens when a  dog  sees  a
car. We all know that if a car is stationary and has no wheels,  dogs  sleep
inside, sniff it and urinate against it. If it  is  moving,  they  bark  and
chase it. That is what we see  happening  today,  especially  these  smaller
parties that are against progress. On our part, we  say:  Minister,  forward
with a better life. Forward!
In January our health committee visited two provinces,  namely  Gauteng  and
the  North  West.  In  Gauteng  we  visited  the  Natalspruit  and  Sebokeng
Hospitals. Some aspects we observed there were  encouraging  and  some  were
disappointing.  In  short,  there  are  many  challenges  faced   by   those
hospitals.

It’s  not  just  these  two  that  face  difficulties,  particularly   among
government hospitals, because most patients who go  to  such  hospitals  are
poor. Even though some of them do have medical aid, they prefer to  come  to
our facilities in their numbers because they trust them.  When  the  smaller
parties observe these unusual happenings, they bark at this vehicle when  it
moves and urinates against it when it is stationary.

At Sebokeng Hospital  we  observed  that  some  medical  equipment  was  not
working and there was no money for repairs. This hospital has been  upgraded
to level 3, but still needs to be developed. A special  ward  has  been  set
aside to cater for those who are well off, such as  members  of  Parliament.
Members need to support hospitals like these. All this is part of  the  work
done by the  people’s  organisation,  the  ANC.  When  others  observe  this
commendable work, they bark.

Natalspruit Hospital was in the news last  year.  Workers  were  toyi-toying
and claiming that there was corruption. Things are back to normal  now,  and
long queues will always be present in our hospitals. The  casualty  ward  is
always full because people have  confidence  in  this  hospital.  Those  who
collect medicines from the dispensary can also attest to the fact  that  you
have to come very early. You have to be up by 4 o’clock in  the  morning  in
order to be the first one in the queue - I am referring to  those  who  come
to fetch their repeat medicines.

This shows that there  our  services  are  in  great  demand  and  that  the
medicines dispensed really help the patients. We  do  all  of  this  because
people voted for us. We say:  Forward  with  a  better  life!  Some  urinate
against a stationary vehicle, and bark when it is  moving.  [Laughter.]  The
truth is that the standard of health care is very high in South Africa.

Other challenges faced  by  these  hospitals  concern  the  nurses  that  we
train.]

Ms J F TERBLANCHE: Chairperson, I rise on a point of order. I  want  you  to
make a ruling on whether it’s parliamentary to say parties are urinating  on
things, because I think  it’s  unparliamentary.  Would  you  please  make  a
ruling on that?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P Hollander): Are you ordering me  to
make a ruling? I think I’m still the Chair in this  House,  thank  you.  Sit
down. That is not a point of order. You may continue, hon member.

Ms J F TERBLANCHE: Chairperson, on a point of order . . . [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P Hollander):  Will  you  please  sit
down, Ms Terblanche. You said: “Will you make a  ruling?”  Will  you  please
sit down? I will give the ruling now: Will you please sit. Will  you  please
sit down. Thank you. Proceed with your speech hon member.

Nk  F  MAZIBUKO:   Ezinye   izinselelo   ezikulezi   zibhedlela   yizinkinga
zabahlengikazi.  Siyazi  sonke  ukuthi  abahlengikazi  siyabaqeqesha   kodwa
onxiwamali bayabathatha baye nabo phesheya. Uhulumeni  wabantu  uyabaqeqesha
kodwa uma besuka lapho bayayikhonkotha uma  ngabe  ihamba,  bayichamele  uma
ngabe   imile.   [Uhleko.]   Sixoxisana   nezwe   lamaNgisi   ukuze   iningi
labahlengikazi abaye  ngaphesheya  kwezilwandle  likwazi  ukuphinda  libuye,
lingalahlekelwa imisebenzi.

Namuhla siyazigqaja  ngokuthi  sekwakhiwe  imitholampilo  eyi-1  300  ezweni
lonke  kanye  nezibhedlela  ezingama-30  seziphuculiwe,   abakhulelwe   nabo
bayakwazi ukuthola amakhambi ukuze bangedluliseli igciwane ezinganeni  zabo,
nabakhubazekile  nabo  bathola  izihlalo  ezinamasondo  abazithola  mahhala,
njalo   njalo.   Konke   lokhu   sikwenza   laba   bamaqenjana   amancanyana
bengakujabuleli. Isisho  sesiZulu-ke  lesi  ebese  ngisishilo  ngaphambilini
sithi  uma  ngabe  ihamba  bayikhonkotha,  uma  ngabe  imile  bayayichamela.
[Uhleko.]

Kuningi-ke osekwenziwe uhulumeni kaKhongolose  eminyakeni  eyishumi.  Olunye
nje uhlelo  olubalulekile  yilolu  lwezimo  eziphuthumayo  lapho  kusindiswa
khona izimpilo zabantu – lokhu esikubiza  phecelezi,  “emergency  services”.
Yebo, sinesivumelwano nohulumeni  basekhaya,  lesi  esisibiza  ngokuthi  yi-
Memorandum of Understanding, MOU. Lolu hlelo kukaningi luphathwa yibo.

Ngithanda-ke ukwenza isibonelo  salaphaya  engivela  khona  eSoweto  –  nami
sengisebenzela ekhaya njengelungu uDlulane. EDiepkloof kusebenza kuphela  i-
ambulense eyodwa kepha abantu bayizi-100 000.  Laphayana  eJabulani  kunama-
ambulense amahlanu kuphela futhi nawo ajike abheke izindawo  ezinjengo  Deep
Soweto,  eMshayazafe  naseZola  eMabhodini.  EDobsonville   khona   izinqola
zimbili kuthi eSoweto ibe yinye kuphela inqola lena esiyibiza  ngokuthi  yi-
response car. Isebenza kuphela emini kanti ebusuku  ayisebenzi.  Isimo  sibi
kangangoba uma ngabe kuvele  ingozi,  kuphendula  kuqala  izicimamlilo  kube
yizona ezifika kuqala ngaphambi kokuthi kufike ama-ambulense.
Engifuna ukukusho kakhulu ukuthi kubalulekile ukuthi lo mnyango  masiwubheke
kahle futhi siwengezele imali ukuze  wonke  umsebenzi  esiwenzayo  ubonakale
nabantu babe bephephile.

Uma  sengiphetha,  ngithi  isabiwomali  saseGauteng  empeleni  senyuke   nje
kuphela ngama-4% uma ngabe uqhathanisa nabantu  abangama-20%.  Empeleni  uma
ngabe sibhekisisa, sizobona ukuthi iningi  labantu  liye  lilibhekise  eGoli
ngoba  becabanga  ukuthi  kukwandongaziyaduma.  Bashiya   izifundazwe   zabo
ngemuva bephokophele  phambili  kodwa  ngokwemali,  asiyitholi  kahle  ngoba
imali esiyitholayo iba ncane.

Ngithanda futhi nanokuthi uma ngabe  uNgqongqoshe  esebenzisana  nazo  zonke
izifundazwe,  kubhekisiswe  kakhulu   nale   ndaba   yokudatshulwa   kabusha
komasipala.  Le  ndaba  ikhombisa  ukuba  wuhlupho  uma  ngabe  siqhathanisa
nezigidigidi zamaRandi lezi ezinikezwa bona.

Izifo ezithathelana ngokocansi nazo  zisasihlupha  kakhulu.  Zibamba  iqhaza
elikhulu ekubhebhethekiseni isifo seNgculazi. Siyazi-ke sonke ukuthi  alikho
ikhambi eliselaphayo lesi sifo. Okubalulekile ukuthi sizivikele,  kuthi  uma
ngabe siya ocansini, sifake ijazi  lomkhwenyana  kanjalo  nabesifazane  nabo
benze njalo.

Kulesi sabiwomali salo nyaka, ngibone ukuthi kunemali  engangezigidi  eziyi-
14 zamaRandi ebekwe  eceleni  ukuze  kuthengwe  amajazi.  Nokho,  uma  ngabe
ngibhekisisa,  thina  besifazane  asibalwanga  kule  mali.  Abesilisa  bano-
Choice,  ama-Rough  Rider,  ama-Durex  nama-Latex  kepha  thina   besifazane
sinalokhu kuphela okubizwa ngokuthi ama-Femidom.  [Uhleko.]  Kubalulekile-ke
ukuthi siziphathe  kangcono  ngaphambi  kokuthi  siye  ocansini.  Ubeseshilo
noNgqongqoshe ukuthi ukuze siphile kahle  futhi  singabhujiswa  yilesi  sifo
esiwubhubhisane, kubalulekile ukuthi siye ocansini oluphephile.

Maqondana nalawa  abesifazane,  baye  bathi  uma  ngizolisebenzisa  kufanele
ngilifake kusasele amahora ayisishiyagalombili ngoba uma ngabe  ngingalifaka
sekuqhubeka umsebenzi, lizongibangela umsindo.  [Uhleko].  Lawa  awabesilisa
wona bawakhipha masinyane. Masikhumbuleni-ke  ukuthi  uma  ingekho  i-Choice
awukho umdlalo, uma ikhondomu  ingekho  alukho  ucansi.  Ikomidi  liyaseseka
isabiwomali. [Ihlombe.] (Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[Ms N F MAZIBUKO: The other challenges  facing  these  hospitals  relate  to
nurses. We all know that we train nurses here but the capitalists take  them
away to countries overseas. The people’s government trains them.  They  then
bark  when  it  moves,  and  urinate  against  it  when  it  is  stationary.
[Laughter.] We are in discussion with Britain so that most of  those  nurses
who went overseas could return and not lose their jobs.

Today we are very proud that 1 300 clinics have been  built  throughout  the
country and 30 hospitals have been upgraded. Those  who  are  pregnant  also
get medicines so as not to pass the virus on  to  their  babies,  while  the
disabled also receive free wheelchairs, etc. While we do all  of  this,  the
smaller parties do not approve of what we do. As I  have  mentioned  earlier
on, the Zulu have a saying, when  it  moves,  they  bark,  and  when  it  is
stationary they urinate against it. [Laughter.]

A lot has been done by the ANC government in  the  past  10  years.  Another
very important programme is  the  emergency  services,  that  save  people’s
lives.  Yes,  we  have  an  agreement  that  is  called  a   memorandum   of
understanding, an MOU, with the local government. They,  in  the  main,  run
this programme.

I would like to give an example of where I come from  in  Soweto  –  I  also
work from home, like hon member Dlulane. In  Diepkloof  there  is  only  one
ambulance operating, yet  there  is  a  population  of  100 000  people.  In
Jabulani there are only five ambulances, but they  also  operate  in  places
like Deep Soweto, Mshayazafe and Zola in  Mabhodini.  In  Dobsonville  there
are two response cars, while in Soweto there’s only one.  It  only  operates
during the day and not at  night.  The  situation  is  so  bad  that  if  an
accident occurs, the fire brigade responds  first  and  arrives  before  the
ambulance. What I particularly want to say is  that  it  is  very  important
that we look after this department very well, and  allocate  further  moneys
so that the work we do is recognised and people  remain  safe  at  the  same
time.

In conclusion, I think the Gauteng budget  actually  increased  by  only  4%
compared to the population of 20%. In fact, if  we  look  closely,  we  will
note that many people are going to Johannesburg,  hoping  to  get  something
better. They leave their provinces behind and head forward, but  in  so  far
as the money is concerned, we are not getting enough.

I would also like  to  say  that  when  the  Minister  works  with  all  the
provinces, we should look at redefining the municipality issue, which  poses
a threat if we look at the billions of rands that they were allocated.

Sexually transmitted diseases are also troubling us. They play  a  very  big
part in spreading the HIV/Aids infection. We all know that there is no  cure
for it. What is important is that we protect ourselves  by  using  a  condom
when having sex, and so should women.

In this year’s budget I noticed that R14 billion  has  been  put  aside  for
purchasing condoms. However, if I look closely, I see that we,  women,  were
not included in this budget. Men have Choice, Rough Riders, Durex and  Latex
condoms, but we women have only what is called the Femidom.  [Laughter.]  It
is therefore very important that we behave accordingly before we indulge  in
sexual activities. The Minister has already mentioned  that  for  us  to  be
healthy and not to die from this destructive disease,  it  is  important  to
practise safe sex.

With regards to female condoms, they say if I am going to  use  it,  I  must
put it in eight hours before because if I put it in during  the  action,  it
will make a noise. [Laughter.] The males ones are removed  immediately.  Let
us remember, “No Choice, no game” and “No condom,  no  sex”.  The  committee
supports the budget. [Applause.]]

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Sihlalo, mangikusho ukuthi ngiphatheke kabi kakhulu
ngenxa yokuthi ngeke ngikwazi ukuphendula yonke imibuzo, ngoba esikhathini
esithi asibe yimizuzu eyi-10 kufuneka ngibe sengisesikhumulweni
sezindiza.[Chairperson, I would like to state my concern that I won’t be
able to respond to all the questions, because in ten minutes’ time I should
be at the airport.]

I am going to New York for a high-level  discussion  on  HIV/Aids.  This  is
part of a mid-term report of the UNGASS declaration. And  I  must  just  say
that when I get there, I am going to underline a few things, one  of  which,
indeed, because I’ve been asked to speak on treatment, care and  support  on
the panel, is to  underscore  that  there  are  traditional  medicines  that
actually help, that have been proven scientifically.

And we  are  not  talking  unproven  things  here;  they  have  been  proven
scientifically. And, therefore, once the report is  out  and  once  we  have
demonstrated people have been  using  them;  there  are  lots  of  anecdotal
stories about the effectiveness of traditional medicine.

I shall also talk about the importance of nutrition, which is  part  of  our
comprehensive plan. I will also be underscoring the importance of  nutrition
to ensure that we prolong the progression  from  HIV  to  Aids,  because  we
think that that is very important.

I shall also stress that we are not ashamed, Mama Lamoela, that in  fact  we
have questioned the reason South Africa should be blamed  for  the  WHO  not
reaching its three-by-five targets. We were not there when  they  set  these
targets. It is their own targets, and so if they fail  to  reach  them  they
must not use us as scapegoats. It is not correct. [Applause.]  We  have  our
own targets as South Africa, and we will stick to them.

In fact, you do not know that when I was in Geneva I met with the  Director-
General of WHO, who apologised profusely for  the  statements  made  by  his
officials. So I don’t know who you are speaking for when you blame your  own
country, saying that we are not reaching the three-by-five targets. I  don’t
know who you are speaking for. You must tell us  which  passport  you  hold.
[Interjections.]

The  DEPUTY  CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE  NCOP  (Ms  P  Hollander):  Order!  Order!
[Interjections.]

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: No, I don’t want to sit, I want  to  listen  to  you
speak like a  South  African,  and  I  don’t  need  to  see  your  passport.
[Interjections.] I shall be . . . [Interjections.] . . .  micronutrients  as
well, because I don’t think that we should be led up the garden  path,  into
believing that the only thing we must use is antiretrovirals. I  think  that
is not correct.

In the first instance we were told that antiretrovirals  have  very  serious
side effects. Now, when we talk about those side effects, it  is  wrong.  We
were told that you must monitor your patients in terms of  their  CD4  count
and viral load. Now we are being told  that,  “No,  it  doesn’t  matter  for
resource-constrained countries; you  can  just  give  them  antiretrovirals.
Just look at the wellness.” We will not do that.

We will continue to improve the health care system in this country so as  to
reach our own targets that we have set  for  ourselves.  So  these  are  the
things that I will be saying in New York, in support  of  our  comprehensive
plan. I am  going  to  say  it  vigorously  and  clearly  enough  that  they
understand where South Africa stands.

Chairperson, as I say, I am sorry that I am not going to be able to  respond
to all the comments made by hon members. I might  take  the  opportunity  to
write to some of the members, especially those that I have not been able  to
respond to, and tell them where they make mistakes,  particularly  in  their
own comments.

Mama Vilakazi, I am hoping that you listened  to  other  provinces  as  they
talked about the human resource problems that we are facing.  It  seemed  to
me you have not been listening to us as we have been  articulating  some  of
the problems that we face, and what it is that  we  are  trying  to  put  in
place to ensure that indeed we recruit and retain  our  health  workers  and
health professionals. You were not listening.

But in your input you did not give us any suggestions as to what  we  should
do. It is one thing to point fingers, but you must have  suggestions  as  to
how as South Africans we must address these issues. I  think  that  is  very
important.

Hon Setona, thank you very  much  for  reminding  us  where  we  come  from,
because the Freedom Charter is the basis for our  Constitution.  It  is  the
basis for the legislation that we  have  put  in  place,  for  policies  and
programmes in the health sector and in the country generally.

We think that we must continue to educate those who do not  know  about  the
Freedom charter. We must, because you do  not  know  of  any  other  charter
anyway. So the only  charter  that  is  available  to  you  is  the  Freedom
Charter. So I think you must  subscribe  to  the  charter.  [Interjections.]
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P  Hollander):  Order,  hon  members.
Order!  Will  you  please  give  the  hon  Minister  time  to  complete  her
contribution. [Interjections.]

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: So if you don’t know what it is that we  are  doing,
please ask the officials to come and brief  you,  even  about  the  problems
that we are experiencing with the hospital revitalisation  programme.  Don’t
just think that we are we resting on our laurels.
It cannot be that yesterday we were fighting  for  the  improvement  of  the
quality of the lives of our people, and today we are just dumping  them.  It
is a contradiction in terms. It is not possible.

Come  on  board.  Offer  suggestions.  Let’s  work  together.  But  if  your
suggestions do not add quality to what we are  doing,  you  can  keep  them.
[Laughter.]

As I said, I will not respond directly to each and  every  point  raised  by
hon members in this House, but allow me just to express my  appreciation  to
the Deputy Minister, the MECs for health and members of this House who  have
spoken in support of the Budget Vote for Health.

It is only through unity in action that we can achieve our goal  of   better
health for all our citizens. Of course there will always be  detractors  who
will find fault with our  genuine  efforts  to  improve  the  lives  of  our
people. I will not respond to their criticism.
“Engahambi iyachanyelwa; ehambayo iyakhonkothwa.” [Ihlombe.] [The
stationary car is urinated against; the one in motion is barked at.
[Applause.]]

I would rather use this opportunity to congratulate  you,  Chairperson,  and
members of this House for the decision you made to  take  the  NCOP  to  the
people, that is to hold your meetings in the various parts of our country.
We are committed to supporting this  initiative  as  the  Ministry  and  the
Department of  Health.  We  would  gladly  participate  in  this  initiative
whenever we are required and requested to do  so.  Please  join  us  in  our
healthy lifestyles. Vuka, South Africa! Move for your  health!  Vuka,  South
Africa! Move for your health!

During these campaigns we do  something  unheard  of  in  this  country.  We
screen  our   people   for   various   diseases,   hypertension,   diabetes,
cholesterol, cancer of the cervix, cancer of the breast and indeed  prostate
cancer. We think it is absolutely critical to raise  awareness  amongst  our
people so that they know what South Africans suffer from  and  to  know  the
burden of illness in our country. And you can see they come in hundreds.  In
fact, we are overwhelmed by the number of people  who  come  for  screening.
But we just don’t stop there. We also refer them to the facilities  so  that
those who have illnesses are taken care of.

With these few words, I thank this House for supporting the  budget  of  the
national Department of Health. In gratitude for that, may I  invite  all  of
you to a cocktail party in the New Wing  restaurant  immediately  after  the
debate. But unfortunately I will not be  able  to  join  you  because  I  am
already late. I should immediately move  to  the  airport.  Thank  you  very
much. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON (Ms P Hollander): Order! Order!  Hon  members,  order
please!

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL:  Chairperson,  I  want  to  say  two  things,
briefly. Firstly, earlier on  I  indicated  that  we  did  not  receive  any
apology from the hon Rev Adolph. I have since discovered  that  his  apology
was sent directly to the Office of the Chairperson, hence the  Whippery  was
not aware of it.

Secondly, I want to request that the standard of interpreting be looked  at.
In African  languages  there  are  certain  proverbs  which,  when  directly
interpreted,  may  sound  offensive,  such  as  when  you   say:   “Ayihlabi
ngokumisa”. You cannot say: “It does not stand by stabbing.” [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P Hollander): Thank  you,  hon  Chief
Whip. That concludes the debate. Thank you, members. I  want  to  thank  the
hon Dr Tshabalala-Msimang for her presence here today in  our  House.  Thank
you, Minister, for your important input  and  information  regarding  health
services in our country. We  wish  you  well  on  your  trip  to  New  York,
America.

Take care. May you be blessed in your  work,  and  we  thank  you  for  your
contribution to society.

Debate concluded.

The Council adjourned at 17:57.
