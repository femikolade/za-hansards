QUESTIONS FOR ORAL REPLY


Deputy President:




Constitutional and economic implications of changing willing-buyer, willing-
                          seller government policy




1.    Mr JW le Roux asked the Deputy President:

      (1)   Whether she studied the  (a)  constitutional  and  (b)  economic
           implications of changing  government  policy  from  the  current
           position  of  willing  buyer,  willing  seller  prior   to   her
           statements at the land summit on or  about  27  July  2005  with
           regard to this matter; if not, on what research  basis  did  she
           reach the conclusion that  political  considerations  outweighed
           the  constitutional  and   economic   implications   which   she
           propagated at the summit; if so, (i) what implications  did  she
           consider and (ii) why did she reach that conclusion;


      (2)   Whether she has taken any action since the summit to give effect
           to her views; if not, when does she intend taking action in this
           regard; if so, what action?             C211E

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Deputy Chairperson, let me start off by repeating
what I said recently in the National Assembly in reply to a similar
question. The leader of the hon member’s party then asked this question and
I quote from my answer:

   I really doubt if anyone in this House can deny that there are enormous
   problems with landownership patterns in our country. The fact that we
   have these problems is not surprising, given the centuries of wars of
   dispossession and later racially based colonial and apartheid policies
   designed specifically to drive black people off the land. It is as a
   result of this history that by 1994 some 87% of agricultural land was
   owned by white people. I am convinced that no one in this House will deny
   that land redistribution has been moving too slowly. Government has set a
   target of redistributing 30% of agricultural land to the previously
   disadvantaged by 2014. By June this year, only three per cent had been
   distributed. One of the reasons for the slow pace of land distribution is
   the problems experienced with the willing-buyer, willing-seller approach.
   This approach often results in protected land market negotiations and
   grossly inflated land prices. It also limits the land available to what
   is on the market, which in some cases is poor-quality land containing
   failing enterprises. Put another way, the market did not, on its own,
   create the skewed landownership pattern in our country, nor can it be
   expected to change the situation.


In fact, we hardly know of the market correcting itself in favour of
customers, let alone poor customers. The concerns expressed regarding the
willing-buyer, willing-seller principle were shared by the land summit,
which recommended that the state should intervene more actively in the land
market by, amongst others, using expropriation, scraping the restrictions
on the subdivision of land and regulating land use to optimise social
benefits. These proposals are being looked at by the government. Government
will do everything within its power to avoid a situation where people
become so desperate about the land situation that they resort to desperate
means. Let me also assure all the stakeholders that in its endeavour to
address the snail’s pace at which land reform is moving, our government
will always act in line with and be guided by principles prescribed in the
Constitution.

In this regard, let me remind the hon member that the willing-buyer,
willing-seller approach is not something that is specified in our
Constitution. More active state intervention in the land market will not
necessarily be in conflict with the property clause of the Constitution.
The Preamble of the Constitution enjoins us to recognise the injustices of
the past and, in adopting the Constitution, to heal the divisions of the
past. Our Constitution therefore requires us to deal with land
redistribution. [Applause.]

Mr J W LE ROUX: Thank you, Deputy Chairperson. I am Wilhelm le Roux and Mr
Watson is our leader who is sitting over there. Deputy President, thank you
very much for your answer. I would like to say that the fact that the land
reform is not going fast enough, we all agree with you. The fact that only
3% of land is being redistributed is not the market’s fault. It is a lack
of funds from the government’s side and many other reasons. I would like to
ask the Deputy President: Does she not agree that land ownership is paid
market prices?

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Hon member, to begin with, we did not say that we
would only be concentrating on the willing buyer willing seller principle.
We are reviewing everything that does contribute to the slow pace as far as
land reform is concerned. The fact that the issue of land reform is one
that enjoys publicity is because the press and other interested parties
have decided to highlight that, more than anything else. We will do
everything - tighten up our administrative process, and so on. As to you
wanting me to give you a yes or no answer, I think it is a yes and a no.

Mr M A MZIZI: Thank you, Chairperson. Deputy President, the question of
willing buyer and willing seller principle . . .

Ngabe le nqubo akusiyo yini lena esibambezela ukuthi singafiki lapho siya
khona, ngokwempendulo yakho njengoba usho uthi ayikho kuMthethosisekelo?
Ngakho-ke lokhu ukuthi kuvunyelwane ngokuthi ngizothenga ngizothengisa
kudala ukuthi lo othengisayo abize imali engaphezulu, enze lokhu amaBhunu
athi . . . ``hy is bokant my vuurmaakplek’’[it is beyond me.] . . . uze
ungabe usawuthola umhlaba. Ngabe uhulumeni akaboni ukuthi kufanele
siwushintshe lowo mgwaqo? Ngiyabonga. (Translation of isiZulu paragraph
follows.)

[Is it not this principle that is slowing down our pace in achieving our
goal? According to your response, this is not in the Constitution.
Therefore, the principle of willing-buyer, willing-seller results in a
seller demanding an exorbitant price, with the buyer saying it is out of my
league. Is the government considering changing this approach? Thank you.]

IPHINI LIKAMONGAMELI: Ngiyabonga, lungu. Ngiyavumelana nawe ukuthi le nto
yokuqophisana phakathi komthengi nomthengisi yenza ukuthi laba okufanele
ukuthi laba okufanele basithengisele bafune ukusimba eqolo. Uma besimba
eqolo-ke bethatha imali yokuthi bona bakwazi ukudla izambane likapondo
thina sibe sidla izambane likazuka, yenza ukuthi imali le esinayo noma
ingencane kakhulu isheshe iphele ngoba kufanele kukhokhelwe umuntu oyedwa
ngepulazi elilodwa imali eningi. Yingakho nje sizama ukwenza indlela
yokuthi imali siyenze ukuthi isebenzele ukuthi isize abantu abaningi.

Enye into eyenzekayo ukuthi uma sizolinda ukuthi abantu basidayisele, labo
abafunayo ukusidayisela, basinika nje noma yini. Amanye amapulazi amabi
kakhulu angakwazi ukusebenziseka kahle.

Enye into esifuna ukuyenza ukuthi thina njengabathengi, njengoba nomthetho
usivumela ukuthi ukuze sikwazi ukulungisa isimo esitshekile ezweni,
siwathathe amapulazi abantu abangawasebenzisi. Umthetho uyavuma ngakho
asizukwenza into engekho emthethweni. Umuntu uma enesikhalazo akahambe
ayosimangalela enkantolo. (Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Thank you, hon member. I agree with you that,
indeed, the willing-buyer, willing-seller demand causes the prices to rise.
When they increase the prices, they forget that they are rich and we are
poor. That alone costs us the little money we have, and you find that we
have to pay one person a lot of money for just one farm. That is the reason
we are trying to seek ways of putting aside a sum of money that would cover
many people.

Another challenge is that those who are willing to sell to us sometimes
sell us anything. Some farms do not have good conditions for farming.

Another thing that we need to do as prospective buyers is to take all those
farms that are not being used, as the law permits us, so that we can
improve the situation. The law permits this, therefore we will not be doing
anything illegal. Anyone who has a complaint can go to court.]

Responsibilities of Deputy President

2.    Mr A Watson asked the Deputy President:

      What responsibilities have been allocated to her by the President  and
      (b) what steps does she intend taking to restore public confidence  in
      the Deputy Presidency?                  C238E

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Madam Deputy Chairperson, the tasks that have been
allocated to the Deputy President are as follows: Chairing of the SA
National Aids Council; development of the second economy; achieving an
economic growth rate that is above 6% by 2014 – I know that there are
journalists who are making nonsensical statements to the effect that we
think we are going to achieve that this year; linguistic and traditional
matters; the moral regeneration movement; being Leader of Government
Business; aspects of international work, including specific binational
commissions that are pitched at the level of Deputy President; and
assignments, from time to time, as the President may see fit.

As I said when I was responding to a similar question in the National
Assembly recently, in the light of the delegations I have mentioned above,
our priority is to harness the goodwill of all South Africans, in their
organised formations as well as in their individual capacities, to support,
in practical terms, government’s agenda to grow the economy such that we
create jobs and reduce poverty, while we continue to grow the first
economy.

We also want to ensure that government and all our social partners respond
systematically to the issues raised by the Beijing+10 Platform on the
challenges facing women and children, and that we are able to implement
optimally legislation, policies and programmes that we have already passed
in this regard.

As far as the second part of the question is concerned, I do not know what
public confidence the hon member is referring to. As you know, the Deputy
Presidency is part of an integrated presidency and a Cabinet team led by
the President to implement the programmes of government. We will continue
on that path and further strengthen our commitment to responding to the
needs of our people, and thus continue to consolidate the confidence that
our people constantly display in our government.

Lastly, based on the work done by the former Deputy President, I have
inherited very good stakeholder relations and work that is robustly in
progress. Thank you.

Mr A WATSON: Hon Chair, I thank the hon Deputy President for her reply, and
I must say that I am specially pleased to hear that she is going to pay
attention to moral regeneration.

On the point of having already replied to questions in the National
Assembly, I think, hon Deputy President, you must bear in mind that we are
a separate House with our separate sittings, and that we don’t have the
advantage of listening to answers to questions in that House.
[Interjections.] Can I have protection from the floor, please, Chair? ...
Deputy President and not Mr Tolo.

In regard to the second part of the question, again I agree that she’s part
of a team, but I think that there can be no denying that in recent weeks
and months there have been some factions, which remain unnamed, that have
tried their best to attack the person of the Deputy President. However, I’m
more concerned about the Office of the Deputy President being protected.

I’d really like to know what steps you are taking to ensure that the
adverse publicity in the media, especially the aspects that were not
broadcast, is stopped and that the Office of the Deputy President is
protected from now till eternity. Thank you.

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Madam Deputy Chairperson, regarding the manner
in which that Office is run, I have not come across anything that is
untoward and requires me to put in place extra protection measures. I have
a staff, some of whom have opted to leave and some of whom work together
gladly and happily – and they are doing an excellent job. They are
committed to their work. My commitment, like any person who comes into a
new job, is to being a new broom and sweeping clean, and doing my best.
Beyond that, I don’t think that there’s anything extraordinary that I’m
required to do. After all, hon members, we actually work as a team, and I’m
depending on the members of the team, including the staff that I have
inherited. Thank you.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P Hollander): Hon Watson, I want to
remind you that we are two Houses, but one Parliament. Thank you very much.

Mr M O ROBERTSON: Chair, I would like to ask if our hon Deputy President
would agree that the question by hon Watson represents the DA’s desperate
agenda always to send a message of despair by portraying crises where none
exist?

Mr A WATSON: On a point of order, Madam Deputy Chairperson, that is not a
follow-up question.

Mr M O ROBERTSON: . . . I don’t know what the saying is in English, but the
tactic used by the DA is what we refer to in Afrikaans as “Gogga maak vir
baba bang.” [Here comes the bogeyman.]

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: You can always cross, it’s quite nice this side.
That’s an open invitation.

Ms N D NTWANAMBI: Deputy Chair, this is a follow-up to Mr Watson’s question
to the Deputy President. When you were Minister of Minerals and Energy, you
did sterling work in empowering women in the minerals sector. How do you
see yourself accelerating the empowerment of women in the second economy,
seeing that the second economy is one of your main briefs?

Hayi yonke le mibuzo ibuzwa ngabantu abangazi kusisa ndawo. [Not all asked
questions that are not going to take us anywhere.]

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Madam Deputy Chairperson, I thank the hon member.
What we are doing is to build bridges between the first and the second
economies. Maybe I should say to hon members that the second economy is, in
many ways, a euphemism for “marginalisation”.

As you know, the majority of the people who are marginalised are women. If
we were to do work in the second economy without changing the conditions of
women, we would just have to know that we have not even started doing work
in that sector.

The number of women who are registered voters, for instance, is 54%; the
number of women who are domestic workers is more than 90%; the number of
women who live in poverty is more than 50%. Those figures and statistics
tell you that even though women have a major contribution to make in this
economy and are taking their political responsibility seriously, we need to
do more in order to make sure that we bring them up through empowerment.

So in our reviewed comprehensive strategy we are seeking to locate women
very strategically across the sectors. I would hope to share the little
experience that I’ve gained as Deputy Minister of Trade and Industry and as
Minister of Minerals and Energy and to work collectively with the other
Ministers to make sure that in every sector we find an entry point where we
would be able to push women forward.

Furthermore, I hope we will be able to pay attention to the delivery of
social services because, as we know, where there are no social services,
women are the most negatively affected. Thank you.

  Freedom Day celebrations at Schaapplaats requiring financing by emerging
                                   farmers

3.    Ms J F Terblanche asked the Deputy President:

        1)  Whether,  with  reference  to  the  North  West   Freedom   Day
           celebrations  on  27  April  2003  at  Schaapplaats,  where  the
           President handed a farm to five young emerging farmers,  it  was
           required of  these  farmers  to  finance  preparations  for  the
           Freedom Day celebrations to the value of R39  000  from  a  Land
           Bank production loan; if not,  what  is  the  position  in  this
           regard; if so, why;


      (2)   whether any measures are in place to assist the  young  emerging
           farmers to settle this amount; if not,  why  not;  if  so,  what
           measures?                                    C244E

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P Hollander): Hon members, we are
now on question 3. Because the member is not in the House, I will read Rule
236(5), which reads:

   If a member does not rise when a question for oral reply, standing in
   that member’s name, comes up for reply, the question lapses unless the
   person who is to reply to the question elects to reply to the question or
   tables the reply.


We are now going to ask the hon Deputy President if she would like to reply
to that question or not.

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Chairperson, I would like to table the reply.

Reply tabled with leave of House:

The answer to the Question is no, the farmers concerned  were  not  required
to finance preparations for Freedom Day celebrations from a Land Bank loan.

Allow me to set out all the facts of this matter.

The Land Bank, the National Youth  Commission  and  Umsobomvu  launched  the
National Youth Development Programme  in  order  to  assist  young  aspirant
farmers in making meaningful contributions in agricultural  development  and
economic growth.

As part of this  programme,  the  Land  Bank  identified,  consolidated  and
allocated the farms Klippaan and Schaapplaats to young emerging  farmers  on
a lease basis with an option  to  purchase.  Klippaan  and  Schaaplaats  are
properties owned by the Land Bank and were part of an insolvent estate.

The Land Bank granted a medium-term loan  of  R4000  000,  repayable  in  10
years, for the purchase of cows and a short-term  loan  of  R1  000  000,for
annual crop production, particularly sunflower and maize.

A portion of the production loan, that  is  R39  376,90,  was  utilised  for
cutting grass and khaki bush and refurbishing infrastructure  on  the  farm.
These costs coincided with the State President’s visit to the farm  in  2003
but would have been incurred even if  the  President  had  not  visited  the
farm.
The payment was made  with  the  understanding  that  the  Land  Bank  would
reimburse the R39 376,90 incurred by the farmers. Indeed the Land  Bank  has
since reimbursed them for this expenditure.

We are pleased to note that the young emerging farmers planted
approximately 300 hectares of sunflower this current season with support
from a neighbouring commercial farmer who is the mentor for the project. It
is expected that the young emerging farmers will utilise the proceeds of
the sunflower crop to settle their Land Bank production loan. The livestock
sector of the farming enterprise is also on track with approximately 45
weaners to be marketed between August and October 2005.

     Cabinet decision to lend Zimbabwe US$1 billion in taxpayers’ money

4.    Mr G R Krumbock asked the Deputy President:

      Why did Cabinet decide that lending US$1 billion of South African  tax
      payers’ money to Zimbabwe was in line with the mandate  given  to  the
      Government by the voters during the 2004 general election and  (b)  in
      light of protests from various communities  regarding  the  extent  of
      delivery by the  Government,  how  will  the  Government  explain  why
      Zimbabwe’s needs take precedence over the  needs  of  South  Africans?
            C253E

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Madam Chairperson, let me start by clarifying to the
hon member that South Africa has not agreed to lend US$1  billion to
Zimbabwe.

In line with the election manifesto, according to whose mandate the ANC-led
government was elected, we are exploring a way of providing assistance to
our neighbouring countries, including Zimbabwe, as part of our commitment
to SADC. Cabinet, therefore, on 3 August stated that, in principle,
government was open to such assistance – which was not US$1 billion -
including provision of a loan facility in relation to Zimbabwe’s
obligations to the International Monetary Fund.

Our approach on this matter is premised on the principle that such
assistance should be for the benefit of the Zimbabwean people as a whole,
within the context of their programme of economic recovery and political
normalisation. We were also encouraged by the IMF and other international
bodies to assist wherever we can. We want to contribute to the resolution
of the challenges that that country is currently facing and also to protect
South Africa and the people of Zimbabwe from the consequences that would
result from the collapse of the Zimbabwean economy.

It is incorrect and misleading to say that the needs of Zimbabwe take
precedence over the needs of the South African government’s priorities, as
contained in the national Budget and Medium-Term Expenditure Framework,
which remain fixed and will not be amended or reprioritised midstream. In
fact, we always increase rather than decrease allocations to programmes
when there has been an unforeseen and unexpected expenditure midstream.
Hypothetically, if any loan was granted in any case it would not result in
a reprioritisation of government programmes or affect delivery of services
to our communities. Thank you.

Mr G R KRUMBOCK: Madam Deputy President, you are correct. The loan has not
yet been agreed to. But, as confirmed by the Minister of Finance yesterday,
you are, of course, still negotiating the amount, structure, financing and
the conditions of the loan and, of course, the collateral. So you are
clearly talking about it.

If you look at the latest statistics taken from the South African survey,
they will indicate for example that, as of July 2002, an amount of 6,4
million South Africans or 14,2% of our population are living with HIV/Aids.
Another example: As of March 2003, 43% of South African households do not
have access to free basic water.

These are pretty basic needs and indicate the very dire circumstances that
many South Africans find themselves in. Under those circumstances, how can
we even be considering to give this money to Mugabe when the need in our
own country here is
clearly so much greater?

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: If the situation were to be worse in Zimbabwe, it
would also be worse in South Africa. So it is actually shortsighted to
think that by burying our head in the sand we are going to be able to
protect and insulate ourselves from the effects of a changing and declining
economy in Zimbabwe. [Applause.]
Mr J B TOLO: In the spirit of Nepad, is South Africa not obliged to help
other countries in dire need, especially given that all those countries did
not say that they had to look at their situation first before they helped
us during the time of the struggle?

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: I can only concur with the member.


Minister


New question:


                   Safety guidelines for school transport


1.    Ms D Robinson asked the Minister of Education:

      (1)   Whether, in light of the bus accident in Cape Town on 25  August
            2005 in which four people died, including three  learners,  she
            will ensure that  all  provincial  education  departments,  and
            schools falling  under  those  departments,  follow  prescribed
            safety guidelines regarding  the  use  of  buses  to  transport
            school children; if not, why not; if so, what are the  relevant
            details;


      (2)   whether such guidelines will  include  that  (a)  bus  companies
            subject their buses to quarterly roadworthy checks, (b) a basic
            roadworthy check is carried out by  a  designated  educator  or
            education official who has received the necessary  training  to
            do so and (c) the bus  driver  undergoes  a  breathalyzer  test
            prior to departure; if not,  why  not;  if  so,  what  are  the
            relevant details;


      (3)   whether any other measures  to  protect  the  safety  of  school
            children will be considered; if so, what measures?      C243E

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Deputy Chairperson, the reply to the question is
as follows: I am, along with all members of the public, as well as members
of this House, very concerned about the number of accidents involving
learners in our country. Our department is looking at developing safety
guidelines, which, I hope, will assist educators in ensuring that buses or
vehicles that transport learners to various destinations are in compliance
with the National Road Traffic Act.

In response to question 2(a), (b) and (c), it’s my view that the guidelines
will only assist educators in determining whether such a bus or vehicle has
been issued with a valid roadworthiness certificate disc, and whether the
driver has been issued with a driver’s licence relevant for that class of
vehicle, as determined by the Act.

Unfortunately, my department cannot serve as an enforcement agent. Hence,
we cannot administer roadworthiness tests or breathalyser tests. It is not
within the ambit of the function of our department to administer
breathalyser tests and roadworthiness tests, etc.

I would hope, of course, that educators, when using various transport
services, would be able to examine – themselves - the condition of a
vehicle. And if indeed, in their view, it is in a very bad state, they
would determine not to expose our children to the hazard of travelling in
such a vehicle. Of course, if a driver who has a valid driver’s licence is
clearly inebriated and unfit to drive, I hope that the educators will
insist that children not board a bus driven by such a person.

Essentially, what we hope is that all of us will become more concerned and
active in ensuring that we protect our children.

With respect to the third part of the question, once guidelines have been
developed, schools will be issued with a pretrip checklist which, I hope,
they will use in order to determine whether the bus or driver is fit for
the trip.

I will also be engaging in discussions with my colleague, the Minister of
Transport, to find out how we can have tighter rules and regulations in
this area, because I do think that we need to take far more stringent
measures to ensure that we protect our children.

Ms D ROBINSON: Thank you, hon Minister, for the comprehensive answer.

I would just like to know whether you can give us the assurance that these
measures are going to be implemented as fast as possible, and that measures
will be laid down for the school authorities when arranging trips like
these, so that they can ensure that safety will be taken into account, that
we have got the skills, safety, roadworthiness and so on, and that it is
not a matter of awarding contracts to people that you may know or be
related to so that there is no element of favours for friends. Thank you.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Deputy Chairperson, with respect to whom you
hire, it is very difficult for us to ensure that you hire a person who is
totally, objectively removed from the school. That would be a function of
the school authorities, school principals or the teachers arranging the
travel.

But I hope that, with these key lists that we will provide, for every
school trip, we will have a record that particular steps and guidelines
have been followed so that we begin to lift the bar of protection and
safety for our children because, at the moment, there is nothing. In many
schools, we don’t even see the signing of indemnity forms, for example;
parents’ permission is not always sought. So we really need to raise the
bar of care much higher.

I think the first step is these sorts of regulations that I am talking
about. I believe my department must act with haste so that we enter 2006
with a set of guidelines in place, which indicate that we are taking this
matter as seriously as our country and ourselves as authorities should.

I would like to see stronger action. I would hope that the forces that are
involved in traffic, monitoring and so on, as well as our police services,
whenever they see a bus on the road, would be encouraged to give much more
attention to it. They should also pay attention to the speed at which the
person is travelling, whether indeed the rules of the road are being
observed and so on, because we have to stress the need to be far more
concerned about protecting our children than we actually see occurring at
the moment. So, we will try to be as speedy as possible. It’s an area of
concern that we must attend to.


Question standing over from Tuesday, 23 August 2005



                  Presidential urban nodes in Western Cape


4.    Ms  N  D  Ntwanambi  asked  the  Minister  for  Provincial  and  Local
      Government:

      What  gains  have  been  achieved  by  the  two  nodal  points  (names
      furnished) in the Western Cape in terms of  (a)  economic  empowerment
      and development and (b) growth  and  revenue  to  the  Western  Cape’s
      economy?                                           C216E

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION (on behalf of the Minister for Provincial and
Local Government): Chairperson, in reply we answer as follows: With respect
to (a) in the question, the response on economic empowerment and
development is as follows: There are two presidential urban nodes in the
Western Cape and they are located in Khayelitsha and Mitchells Plain.

Since the inception of the Urban Renewal Programme, numerous projects have
been implemented in these two nodes by the various agencies of government.
All of these projects are aimed at improving the socio-economic conditions
of communities in the nodes.

In Khayelitsha, one of the significant projects is the Khayelitsha Central
Business District. This project represents more than R500 million of
investment into this previously neglected area through a partnership
between all spheres of government, the private sector and the community.

The Khayelitsha CBD was established on a 70-hectare site that is now the
home of quality social facilities, social housing, public transport
facilities and a large retail complex. Departments such as home affairs,
justice, social development, sport and transport were all active partners
in the creation of this exciting project. I, the Minister of Justice and
Constitutional Development and the Minister of Home Affairs went to see the
court the other day and it is a very lovely facility, which is well
appreciated by the community.

In Mitchells Plain significant public and private investment is changing
the lives of this community. A few of the projects, which one can
highlight, are the upgrading of the central business district as well as
the building of the prominent retail centre, which is 51 000m² in size. We
will also have new taxi facilities, a new bus terminus and an informal
trading market.

Within these two urban nodes, all government’s spheres and agencies have
shown commitment to investing in improving the lives of these previously
neglected communities. In the area of growth and revenue for the economy of
this province, the areas in question fall within those parts of South
Africa which under apartheid were reserved for the less privileged people
of our society.

This government introduced the nodes for purposes of redressing the
imbalances of the past. Thus, the two nodal points will, in the short term,
probably not have a significant impact on the Western Cape’s economy.
However, we believe that the enormous investments made into social
facilities, housing, transport and public spaces, will, in the long term,
stimulate economic growth and wealth creation in the Western Cape as a
whole.

Ms D ROBINSON: Chairperson, the Look Out Hill Centre site is something that
was looked on with great excitement and pride when I was still the city
councillor and I know that a great deal of money was spent there and it was
something that we all looked forward to. But I have heard and, on a fairly
recent trip, I discovered that there has been quite a lot of vandalism and
that many of the improvements that have been made there had been destroyed,
in a sense.

I feel very sad about this and I am just wondering what is being done to
try and encourage people to protect what has been achieved so that we can
have pride in the achievements.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chairperson, it is a new question really, but
let me say that part of the response to acts of vandalism and lack of
attention to protection of new facilities is, of course, the community
involvement that is so much a part of especially the Khayelitsha CBD
development.

I think we really would have to ensure that as sites are developed, the
Khayelitsha community actually takes an interest in ensuring that these are
protected. So, both in Mitchells Plain and Khayelitsha, and throughout our
country, community support and community care for facilities that are for
the community are extremely important and it is probably part of an
acquired behaviour  that we have to inculcate.

But I think added to this is the need to ensure that facilities are
provided for all inhabitants in the particular communities because what you
sometimes had with the initial developments were that you were developing
shopping areas rather than recreational facilities. So, at times when
people were seeking recreation, they would go to the new business
development site and spent a lot of time running down the facilities.

The integration that we have seen between our administrative facilities,
business facilities and recreation is a very positive development in this
regard. So, I hope we will see more. I will ask Minister Mufumadi to look
at Look Out Hill and see whether there is something that could be done to
address the decline that you have referred to.

New questions:


           Irregular municipal loans at Steytlerville Municipality


2.     Mr  J  W  le  Roux  asked  the  Minister  for  Provincial  and  Local
      Government:

      (1)   With reference to his reply to oral Question 5 on  7  June  2005
           regarding unauthorised loans  of  R169  186,94  to  members  and
           officials of the  Steytlerville  Municipality;  what  (a)  total
           amount remained to be repaid by these members and  officials  to
           the municipality as at  31  July  2005,  (b)  is  the  name  and
           position of the person or persons  who  issued  the  cheques  or
           money to these members  and  officials  and  (c)  was  the  date
           contained in the letters of demand whereby the loan amounts  had
           to be repaid;


      (2)   whether the letters of demand were followed up with legal action
           in respect of those members and officials who  have  not  repaid
           the full loan amounts; if not, why not; if so, with what result;


      (3)   why have criminal charges not been pursued against the persons
           authorising the loans?


The MINISTER OF EDUCATION (on behalf of the Minister for Provincial and
Local Government): Chair, in response to the question, the answer to the
first part is as follows:

The total amount to be repaid by former members and officials, as at 31
July 2005, is R169 186,94. The names of the people who were responsible for
these loans and advances are Mr S M B Spogter, the former mayor of
Steytlerville TLC, and Mr W Ross, the former treasurer of Steytlerville
TLC.

The answer to the third part is that no date of repayment had been
indicated on the letters of demand that were received with respect to this
debt. However, it was mentioned in those letters that arrangements for
repayment had to be made before 26 November 2004.

In two, the answer is that legal advice was sought from the lawyers
representing the concerned members and officials. They informed this
council that the debt should be written off since a period of three years
had lapsed without this debt being enforced. Council’s legal advisers
concurred with the lawyers of the concerned members and officials.

In the third part, advice from the provincial departments of housing, local
government and traditional affairs was sought after this stalemate was
reached, and we are still awaiting their response.

Mr J W LE ROUX: Chair, I want to thank the hon Minister for her reply.
Minister, it’s obviously not your responsibility and you are working very
hard. We do all feel very sorry for you. But the fact is that this issue
has now been dragging on since 2000, and it is the taxpayer’s money that’s
being wasted in this way. I think it is totally disgraceful. I would like
to ask the Minister if she could possibly assist us to get this whole issue
behind us, because it reflects very badly on the governing ANC. Thank you.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chair, the hon member knows that I’m trying to
introduce no-fee schools, because I don’t wish to be a debt collector. So,
really, as the Minister for Provincial and Local Government has indicated,
his department has sought answers from the province and we hope an answer
will be forthcoming.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P Hollander): The next question is
by the hon Terblanche. She asked a question to the Minister of Correctional
Services, but seeing that neither of them is in the House today we are
going to apply Rule 236.

Mr A WATSON: Deputy Chairperson, on a point of order: We have had
communication from the Minister’s Office that he is unavailable to be here
due to a death in the family, but that he will submit a written reply
directly to Ms Terblanche’s office.

    Separation of mining inspectorate from the Department of Minerals and
                                   Energy


   4. Mr A Watson asked the Minister of Minerals and Energy:


      Whether her department intends to hive off the inspectorate of mines
      health and safety to a self-funding body or self-funding public
      enterprise; if not, what are the relevant details of the long-term
      planning in regard to mines health and safety; if so, (a) what are the
      details of the planned separation of this inspectorate from her
      department, (b) by what date is it envisaged that this will be
      effected and (c) what is the future position of the staff of this
      inspectorate?                           C254E

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Deputy Chairperson, the answer
to Question four is as follows: The decision to separate the mine
inspectorate from the Department of Minerals and Energy was made by Cabinet
in 1999. This decision calls for the integration and consolidation of
occupational health and safety laws and institutions. The Mine Inspectorate
will, in terms of this decision, ultimately become part of an integrated
national institution, which will be housed or associated with the
Department of Labour.

The Department of Labour is the lead department for this process and the
Chief Inspector of Mines has participated in the development of the policy,
draft law and business case to give effect to this decision. The Department
of Labour is to finalise and submit these documents to Cabinet at a date in
the near future. Ringfencing of health and safety activities within the
department in which they are currently situated is a necessary precursor to
this decision and to the process going forward.

In the Department of Minerals and Energy this involves consideration of the
activities of both the Mine Inspectorate and the Mine Health and Safety
Council, which is already a public entity and for which the Chief Inspector
of Mines is the accounting officer.

With regards to (a) the reply is: The separation of the inspectorate from
the Department of Minerals and Energy, and into the public entity already
established to house the operations of the Mine Health and Safety Council,
depends on the availability of funding and the support of mining
stakeholders. This is a consolidation process consistent with the
integration process. A detailed timeline is still to be developed and is
subject to the outcomes of the current Medium-Term Expenditure Framework
process.

The timeline will provide for consultation with the tripartite partners,
that is, labour, government and the department as required by the Mine
Health and Safety Act and for the necessary amendments to the Act. The
consolidated Mine Health and Safety Public entity is an interim structure
that will ultimately be incorporated into the new national structure at the
appropriate time.

While this entity is still associated with the Department of Minerals and
Energy, it will be possible to take stock of the functions that support
mineral development and promotion which are currently undertaken by the
Mine Inspectorate and establish appropriate mechanisms to ensure these
functions continue to be done on a sustainable basis.

The response to (b) is as follows: The date for establishing an integrated
national occupational health and safety institution is not known at this
stage and is dependent on Cabinet approval of the business case, policy and
draft Bill and thereafter, Nedlac consideration of these issues. Once the
Nedlac process is complete, the Bill will come before Parliament for
enactment. The current health and safety laws would need to be repealed at
that point. Only at that stage will the new integrated institution have a
formal legal mandate.

The response to (c) is: No major changes are anticipated by the Mine
Inspectorate staff in respect to their roles and responsibilities. The
physical location of the interim and final institutions may result in some
changes in their daily routines. Once the final institution is established
the staff of the Mine Inspectorate will report to the Department of Labour.
Thank you.

Mr A WATSON: Madam Deputy Chair, Minister, thanks very much for a very
comprehensive reply to my question. I really appreciate it. May I just ask
that you please also supply me with your answer in writing so that I have
it on record? Just a small follow-up: Do I understand you correctly in
saying that the old associations like Nosa, which was also associated with
labour and the other bodies around the Department of Labour, and the
Chamber of Mines Safety Division; will that all be incorporated into one
body, or will it just deal with mine safety and health?

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Chair, my response will be
recorded in Hansard. Regarding his second question on the participation of
different NGOs: The mining industry in particular, and also the trade union
movement, all participate in Nedlac and therefore will have full exposure
to the Bill and the processes. They will also be invited to make their
inputs. Thank you, Chair.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P Hollander): We then move to the
next question. The hon S Chen is not here. We will apply Rule 236. Question
6 to the Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism has been withdrawn.
We then move to Question 7.

Mr G R KRUMBOCK: Chair, on a point of order: This House, in terms of the
Constitution, represents the provincial interests. This is a question
coming from the province, and one of the most important aspects of our role
here is the oversight role.

This question was put to the MEC for Environmental Affairs in the KwaZulu-
Natal legislature in May and has been followed up by follow-up letter. We
have had no response, hence the question to the national Minister. If we
cannot get an answer from any Minister at any level of government, what are
the people of Oakley Avenue in Umngeni conservation area supposed to think?
What are the residents of Siphumelele Township supposed to do? I need to
get an answer for my question.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P Hollander): Hon Krumbock, can I
call you to order, please? It is not on my Question Paper here and your
question has been withdrawn. Can we then follow up? [Interjections.] Why
are you shouting?

Mr G R KRUMBOCK: [Inaudible.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I think this House has a
constitutional right to perform oversight over the executive. If there is
anything that the member feels did not go according to procedure, I think
that matter can be investigated in a very orderly manner instead of taking
this House and changing it to make it look like a stokvel, shouting and
doing all those things.

I really agree that the question will have to be followed up so that the
constituency that the member is serving gets the relevant answers to that
particular question. May I propose that the matter be investigated outside
this House? Thank you.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P Hollander): Question 7 is also
from the hon Mzizi to the Minister in the Presidency. The Minister in the
Presidency is not here, hon Mzizi. We are therefore going to apply Rule
236.

              Court Process Project objectives and performance

8.    Mr M A  Mzizi  asked  the  Minister  for  Justice  and  Constitutional
      Development:
      Whether the Court Process Project has met the intended objectives  and
      the expectations of her department; if not, why not; if so,  (a)  what
      are the relevant details and  (b)  how  is  the  performance  of  this
      project being measured?                 C258E

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Hon Deputy Chair,
the reply is as follows: Yes. The court process project has met the
intended objectives and expectations of the department. These objectives
and expectations were to demonstrate that automation could successfully be
applied to the judicial process and by doing so in a pilot format. Thus
when the pilot project was established to test the development of an
integrated solution with regard to functionality and interaction between
the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development, the Department of
Safety and Security, the Department of Social Development and the
Department of Correctional Services, it was indicated that this could also
be used to reduce case cycle times and backlogs. It could also address the
question of lost dockets, which you know is a problem, improve the
efficiency of the processes, improve identity verification and all this
must be done whilst maintaining a high level of security.

The performance of this project is measured in terms of the benefits it is
bringing to all Justice officials as well as society at large and these
include, inter alia, improved administration and tracking of dockets and
case files, reduced delays leading up to trials, reduced number of lost
case dockets, reduced postponement of cases due to misplaced files or
exhibits, improved docket or exhibit administration, improved
administration of prisoner admissions and releases, timely notification of
events, improved access to information, reduced duplication of data entry
and verification of identities.

It is clear from the following information provided by the Clerk of Court
in Durban that this project is performing very well. We have information
here that indicates, for example, that 166 dockets have been recovered to
date and in fact 41 of this number this year, 2005, and about 98% of all
cases on the roll have been entered into the system. Almost no cases are
being postponed because of administrative issues. Almost a million pages
have been scanned since 2003. Almost 10 000 biometrics have been taken and
in 2005 this was 2,5.

The Department of Social Development has made use of the system to prepare
reports on minors and the Department of Correctional Services has used it
to improve the administration of prisoner admissions and releases.

The system is now integrated into the work processes of the clerks of the
courts. It is possible to give attorneys and other interested parties
access to relevant case information without exposing the physical files,
and I think this is really a great improvement, if one considers where we
come from. The system is important and key in the modernisation of the
Department of Justice and Constitutional Development.

Mr M A MZIZI: Chairperson, I want to thank the Minister for the answers
that he has given.

Minister, the reason that this question has been put is that on oversight
visits we often get asked such questions. When these projects were launched
we all welcomed them, especially the movement of prisoners from where they
had been incarcerated, to make sure that the movement is known right
through. Despite that fact we still have escapees; such as people going to
court and never coming back. This is because of incorrect record-keeping.

When these questions get asked to the authorities personally when we are
there in the prisons department, you often hear an answer that says: Yes,
it was intended, but we do not have enough finances to continue with the
project. We do not know exactly where the truth lies, because more often
when you get reports from the department you find that the information you
get there always differs with what you get when you go out into the
prisons. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: What is the follow-up question?

Mr M A MZIZI: The follow-up question, Sir, is: How effective is it? When we
go to the prisons when we are making oversight visits, the authorities
would tell that it was intended, but that they did not have enough finances
to continue with it. Now where does the problem lie?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Yiyo leyo inkinga, baba uMzizi. [This is a
problem, Mr Mzizi.]

The problem is that we do need to invest more money in the project. If you
recall, in my input I did mention that this was a pilot project. Now I am
saying that the pilot project is working and that if you are talking about
transformation of the justice system as a whole, this also has to do with
modernisation, with improving efficiency, and this is one pilot project
that indicates that we can address all the problems across the whole
cluster system, so we do need, in fact, to begin to move towards rolling
out and we need to review the outcomes that we have before us of the pilot
project - this KwaZulu-Natal programme. So I do agree with you that perhaps
we have to move with speed towards a roll-out.

         Development of the property industry transformation charter

9.    Mr C J Van Rooyen asked the Minister of Public Works:

      Whether any progress  has  been  made  with  the  development  of  the
      transformation charter for the property industry; if no; what  is  the
      position in this  regard;  if  so,  what  are  the  relevant  details?
                                                         C260E

The MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS: Deputy Chair, the answer is that the progress
in the development of the property industry transformation charter is at a
final stage. The property sector transformation process committee has
submitted, to the Minister, the final draft charter document, which she has
studied and made comments on.

The draft document has been referred back to the aforementioned committee
for further discussion and debate. Once these discussions and debates have
taken place, the final draft document will be submitted by the Department
of Public Works to the Department of Trade and Industry, for acceptance and
gazetting. Thank you.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Before I call for the follow-up
questions, may I bring members’ attention to the fact that members must
make follow-up questions, not statements. That is in line with our
procedures and rules, and also in the interest of time. I therefore call
for follow-up questions to the hon Minister of Public Works.

Questions transferred from written to oral reply upon request of the
relevant member (Rule 239):


          Electoral Commission’s recruitment and selection strategy


 1.   Mr D A Worth asked the Minister of Home Affairs: [Written Question No
     94]

     (1)    Whether the Electoral Commission (EC)  takes  the  cultural  and
          language profile  of  local  communities  into  account  when  it
          appoints personnel in specific voting  districts  for  (a)  voter
          registration and (b) election campaigns; if not, (i) why not  and
          (ii)  what  factors  are  taken  into  account  in  making   such
          appointments; if so, (aa) what specified factors are  taken  into
          account and (bb) what weighting is given to each specified factor
          when deciding on the appointment of personnel;




     (2)    whether EC personnel whose  cultural  and  language  profile  is
          different from the majority of voters in the area in which  these
          personnel are posted are given any (a) training,  (b)  guidelines
          and/or (c) policy directives to assist  them  in  overcoming  any
          cultural and/or language barriers; if not, (i) why not  and  (ii)
          how are such problems overcome by these officials;  if  so,  what
          are the relevant details in each case;




     (3)    whether all EC officials are  required  to  attend  training  to
          ensure that they are fully  conversant  with  any  policy  and/or
          guidelines in this regard; if not, (a) why not  and  (b)  who  is
          required to attend such training; if so, what  are  the  relevant
          details;



     (4)    whether returning officials are given any specific training in
          how to manage problems relating to language barriers, religious
          criteria and/or any other cultural matters; if not, why not; if
          so, what are the relevant details?       C203E


The DEPUTY MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Thank you. Chairperson, in regard to
(a) and (b), in terms of the Independent Electoral Commission’s recruitment
and selection strategy, amongst the underlying factors that should
determine the recruitment of all voting officers are that they should be
familiar with the area where they will be working and that they speak the
predominant language of that area.

Fluency in minority languages used in that area is an additional
requirement. English proficiency is also required, as all training and all
IEC legislations; regulations, training material and communications with
IEC structures are in English.

With regard to number two, due to the recruitment policy to recruit persons
from the community in which they will be working, no specific training is
offered in terms of culture and language. The training of officials is
geared to ensuring that staff is competent to manage the election or
registration as prescribed by law.

Staff is also trained to ensure that in the performance of their functions,
members of the public are treated with dignity and respect.

In relation to question number three, all staff involved in the recruitment
of voting station staff is familiarised with this strategy.

The answer to the fourth question is: in so far as returning officers are
concerned, the IEC does not have returning officials as part of its
structures. Apart from the point two above, presiding and counting
officials do not receive training in respect of religious criteria and or
other cultural matters. Thank you.

Mr D A WORTH: Thank you, Deputy Chair. Yes, I would like to ask the hon
Deputy Minister, in light of the constitutional requirements that the
electoral commission be impartial and exercise their powers on functions,
without fear, favour or prejudice, what mechanisms have been put in place
to ensure that all personnel, whether permanent or temporary, understand
and meet this requirement?

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Chairperson, in terms of section 2 of
the response we gave, I would like to quote again:


   The training of officials is geared to ensuring that staff is competent
   to manage the election or registration as prescribed by the law. Thank
   you.


Ms H LAMOELA: Chair, I just want to know from the Deputy Minister: if a
person is an active member of a political party, may that person be
appointed as a presiding officer at a voting station?

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Deputy Chair, the question doesn’t
arise from the question which we were provided for, because in the
Department of Home Affairs, we do not appoint members of the IEC or staff
and personnel of the IEC. We would need to find the specific reference of
the person to which the question is referring; we would need to find the
specific answers from the IEC. In that regard, I cannot stand here, and
pull out my hair, which I don’t have, to try and figure out who exactly is
this member of a political party to whom the hon member is referring.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you very much, hon Deputy
Minister. I will therefore make a ruling that the question does not
constitute, in any sense, a follow-up question, but it is a new question.
The hon member is at liberty to direct that question through the relevant
processes.

I will then proceed to the Minister of Correctional Services. Nobody is
standing in for the Minister. In the light of that, can I be allowed to
rule that we defer this question? It should be a written reply to the
member concerned. Can I do that thing with the member’s consent? Thank you
very much.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I will therefore proceed to the
question of Mr Thetjeng to the Minister of Health. Is there any one
standing for the Minister of Health? Mr Thetjeng, will you allow me to rule
that you will get this question as a written reply?

Mr O M THETJENG: Chairperson, can we have it stand over until the Minister
is available, if it is acceptable? Thank you.


    Government Printer owed money by provincial and national departments


   5. Mr O M Thetjeng asked the Minister of Home Affairs: [Written Question
      No 99]

      (a)Which provinces and national departments owe the Government Printer
      money, (b) how much does each owe and (c) (i) how and (ii) by when
      will the money be recouped?                              C208E
The DEPUTY MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Chairperson, all nine provinces owe
money to the government printer. The national departments owing money to
the government printer, alphabetically, are; Correctional Services,
Defence, Education, Finance, Foreign Affairs, Health, Justice, National
Intelligence Agency, National Treasury, Office of the President, Social
Development, the SAPS, Trade and Industry, and Transport.

Other organs of state that owe money include the Auditor-General, the
Central Computer Services, Cipro, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue,
Gauteng Sars, Parliament of the Republic of South Africa, SA Management
Development Institution, the Seta, Statistics SA, and the Unemployment
Insurance Fund.

Other state institutions owing money include municipalities, schools,
universities and statutory bodies.

To list, per province, departments and institutions, how much they owe, may
take me some time. I would request that the hon member allows us to give
him the written reply, but safe to say that the total owing is R106 404
542,78.

The government printing works is a trading entity operating on regular
business principles. Its financial viability depends on its ability to
generate sufficient revenue from services rendered, to defray all
operational and capital expenditure. Consequently, its ability to collect
monies due from services rendered is paramount.

Unfortunately, as a result of inefficiencies and deficiencies within the
government printing works, there have been difficulties in terms of
obtaining payments from departments and other debtors. Consequently, the
debtors’ book started accumulating until the balance was significantly high
and difficult to manage and collect. It has taken time to establish and
implement effective and efficient steps for debt collection.

To address the challenges of inadequate capacity, a debt-collection manager
was recruited with vast experience in debt collection, to manage the debt-
collection section, and to ensure the reskilling of current personnel
within the component. Subsequent to this appointment, 12 new posts have
been created, five of which have already been filled, whilst the seven
outstanding will be finalised by the end of September 2005.

This has the effect of significantly improving the management procedures
and the collection patterns to such an extent that the GPW for the past two
financial years, which ended 31 March 2005 and 2005 respectively, had
closed the periods with favourable bank balances, as opposed to the bank
overdraft position of over R100 million, for the past four years, as
indicated below.

By the end of September 2005, the government printing works would have
developed all internal processes and capacity issues with regard to
collection of outstanding debts, and by July 2006 it would have recovered
long overdue amounts from provinces and national departments.

As I have said, the details of the response is contained in the written
text. Thank you.

Mr O M THETJENG: Chairperson, I just want to say that I will appreciate
having that response in writing. I would also like to check whether he can
assure us that all the monies owed will be collected, so that we do not
have any money owed to this institution. Thank you.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Chairperson, a politician would never
miss an opportunity to speak. The assurance that we can give is that the
government printing works, in its totality, is being transformed. We are
building new capacity, as well as new leadership. Therefore the problems
that led to the accumulation of the debtors’ book in the past are being
addressed. The debts that are owed are being collected. So, to that extent
we do have the confidence that we are creating capacity sufficient for us
to collect these debts, so that by July 2006 we have moved drastically
towards collecting all overdue debts.


                  Staff shortages of skilled social workers


7.    Mr O M Thetjeng asked the Minister of Social Development: [Written
      Question No 101]

      Whether his department is experiencing any staff shortages of skilled
      social workers; if not, why are there long queues at the service
      points; if so, which skills are affected?          C210E

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Chairperson, in reply to this
question, the answer is yes. There is a general shortage of skilled social
workers in the department. In the provinces, the shortages range from 15%
in the case of Gauteng to 45% in KwaZulu-Natal.

The professional skills of this occupational class are affected. Social
workers are multiskilled professionals and are identified as having a
scarce skill. The Department of Social Development is currently addressing
the matter through the development of a retention strategy that aims to
retain social workers within the country and the profession. The department
has implemented the first phase of the said strategy, which addresses the
regrading of salaries. I thank you.

Mr O M THETJENG: Thank you for the response and the fact that you are
developing plans in terms of retaining those particular skilled members
that are there. The situation of the shortage of staff is a great concern
because during lunch time, in those institutions where services are
provided – service points, the shops are closed and members are sent out
and told to come back an hour later. So I just wanted to know whether Batho
Pele is, as in this situation, part and parcel of what is being done to
address service at these particular service points? I thank you.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Deputy Minister, I am not sure
whether you would like to respond to that, but I sensed that it is a new
question altogether because it deals with the question of what
interventions the department is making in the light of the shortage of
staff. That is something you have alluded to but you are at liberty to
respond if you want to.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Chairperson, I agree with you
that this is a different question about staff, because the initial question
was about social workers and their particular skills. I thank you.


Debate concluded.

The Council adjourned at 15:16.

      (c)   Various environmental issues within the park; and
      (d)   The role the park plays in the upliftment of the local and
           surrounding communities, especially with regard to the
           objectives of creating new jobs for previously disadvantaged
           people and the local communities.

      2.    Delegation

      A multiparty delegation, under the leadership of the Chairperson, Rev
      P Moatshe (ANC) included Mr CJ Van Rooyen (ANC); Ms BN Dlulane (ANC);
      Mr RJ Tau (ANC); Ms HF Matlanyane (ANC); Mr A Watson (DA); Mr F Adams
      (NNP) and Mr AA Bawa (Committee Secretary).


      An attempt was made to obtain a valued balanced view with input from
      various sources, senior officials from the Department, Executive
      Director, Heads of Departments, Managers as well as Regional Managers.

      B.    Overview of the report

           The report sets out the findings and recommendations of the
           delegation as it emerged from the presentations by the various
           officials and on-sight tours of the facility. It also provides
           an analysis of issues and problems identified at Kruger National
           Park and recommendations put forward by the committee.

      C.    Overview of the KNP

         1.1     Core functions and mission statement

           The core functions of the Kruger National Park are to ensure
           biodiversity and wilderness tourism while its mission statement
           is to maintain biodiversity in all its natural facets and
           fluxes; to provide for tourism and other human benefits and
           build a strong constituency; and to preserve as far as possible
           the wilderness qualities and cultural resources associated with
           KNP.


           Its constituency building focuses mainly on communities within
           the park and other stakeholders and economic development looking
           also at communities outside the park. The whole theme around
           constituency building in KNP is getting people involved, making
           them understand what is going on around them, making them aware
           of how they can benefit by looking after their natural
           environment and how they can ultimately benefit, also through
           learnership programmes where students are more actively
           involved.

           KNP receives approximately 1 million visitors per annum.


         1.2     Location and Sections within the Park

                 The KNP is situated in Limpopo and Mpumalanga and consists
                 of Municipalities, 30 Tribal Authorities, and 68 Wards with
                 community forums. Of the 1 800 people employed by the park,
                 80% are from the local communities. Since 2003 the park has
                 also trained approximately 506 people from local
                 communities to work in KNP as receptionists, game warders
                 and rangers


                 Management of the park is sub-divided into various sections
                 such as corporate governance; infrastructure maintenance;
                 finance; human resources; public relations and corporate
                 investigation services not only for the park but for the
                 entire SANPARK.

         1.3     Size of the KNP and its species

                 The geographical size of the Kruger National Park (KNP) is
                 roughly 2 million hectares 19 000 km2 with 1 800 permanent
                 workers. It has 1 982 plant species; 404 woody plant
                 species; 224 grass species; 147 mammal species; 517 bird
                 species; 119 reptile species; 52 fish species (including
                 three exotics) and 35 amphibian species.


         1.4     Net Operating Income

                 The Net Operating Income (NOI) of KNP is divided into four
                 regions, namely the Far North Region, Northern Region,
                 Central Region and Southern Region.


                 The table below indicates the Net Operating Income for the
                 four regions:

|Region                     |Amount expressed in millions  |
|Far Northern Region        |R   4 092m                    |

|Central Region             |R 15 322m                     |
|South Region               |R 66 262m                     |

                 The Northern Region and Southern Region are the two biggest
                 earners within the KNP borders. The Far Northern Region is
                 operating at a negative amount and for this reason the
                 management is thinking of joining the Far Northern Region
                 with the Northern Region so that they can be managed as one
                 region.


                 For the year 2004/5 KNP has enhanced SANPark’s Integrated
                 Community Development and Constituency Building Programme,
                 such as Kids in the Park and cultural mapping.


                 KNP is also BEE compliant: 40% of all their procurement is
                 from BEE-compliant suppliers. Currently they are busy re-
                 organising its management structure with an aim to
                 establish SANParks as a preferred employer and also
                 consolidating the HIV/Aids initiatives into a comprehensive
                 HIV/Aids management strategy.


                 The Italian Government has made an undertaking to assist
                 the park with its Aids Programme, because there are a
                 shortage of clinics within the park as well as a lack of
                 proper equipment.


                 A study is currently underway to give authorities a clear
                 indication as to how serious the Aids epidemic is at the
                 park so that a plan of action can be formulated to address
                 the problem.


         1.5     Employment Equity

                The park is ahead of target when it comes to Employment
                Equity and is currently revising the Employment Equity Plan
                so that they remain compliant.

         1.6     Land claims

                A land claim is the biggest challenge facing the park. Some
                claims have been settled and others are yet to be settled.
                See Chart Below

|Name of communities lodging land claims     |Size of the land|
|The Makuleke                                |  25 000 ha     |
|Four Ba-Phalaborwa Tribes                   |179 069 ha      |
|Mathebula (Makhuva)                         |100 000 ha      |
|Hoyi Community                              |       984 ha   |
|Ntimane (Phabene)                           |    3 541 ha    |
|Makahane-Marithenga                         |   89 773 ha    |
|An additional 27 land claims lodged against |Not available   |
|Pretoriuskop, Nambi and Dunnel Farm         |                |

                The only claim settled thus far is the Makuleke claim of 25
                000 ha, but it is now a contractual park which is still run
                by KNP and privately owned.


                According to the officials, contractual parks are not easily
                managed because the idea of nature conservation may differ
                between the two parties concerned.


                The biggest problem with the claims, especially the Ba-
                Phalaborwa claim, is that it will literally cut the park up
                into various sectors and create too many contractual parks,
                making it unmanageable. Ultimately, the claims could cause
                the Kruger National Park to cease to exist.


                There is a misconception amongst some people claiming land.
                This is that if they own a piece of KNP land, they will
                become instant millionaires. That is why the option of
                remunerating people for the land is being looked at, because
                it solves a host of geographical problems.


                The KNP has, in conjunction with neighbouring communities,
                set up a Community Economic Empowerment Council that aims to
                assist the local communities to sell their produce /
                products inside the Park. All structures in the park, such
                as restaurants and shops, are encouraged to buy goods from
                these communities in an attempt to uplift them and create an
                environment of better understanding between them.


         1.6     Decline in international tourists visiting the park

                 The other gaps or challenges that face the KNP is the
                 decline in international tourists visiting the park. This
                 is linked to the strengthening of the rand and the decrease
                 in revenue the park receives from concessionaires within
                 the park.


                 The park is also in need of an immediate revamp to improve
                 its facilities in order to compete with other private
                 operators and wishes it to be graded under the new grading
                 system. Currently, they cannot start the process because
                 they will not receive a favourable grading with which to
                 attract tourists. There is an urgent need for more funds to
                 upgrade the park’s facilities, making it more appealing to
                 tourists as most of them stay outside the park and come in
                 as day visitors.

         1.7     Staff leaving the KNP

                 KNP is currently losing many expert and experienced staff.
                 Most of them are accepting better positions with higher
                 salaries in the provincial departments and private sector.
                 Funds are also needed to keep marketable salaries that are
                 in line with other sectors so as to avoid resignations of
                 these experienced staff members.


                 Research and marketing of the park also require a financial
                 boost if they wish to increase the number of people
                 visiting the park. KNP wishes to upgrade its facility in a
                 manner that offers value for money, which would make the
                 park accessible to everybody, especially those from
                 previously disadvantaged communities.

         1.8     Skills Development

                 The KNP, in conjunction with Department of Trade and
                 Industry, have undertaken a programme called Community
                 Public Private Partnership (CPPP), where DTI will assist
                 the local and surrounding communities with skills
                 development, to empower them in becoming entrepreneurs.
                 This is aimed at improving relations with the outside
                 communities through various forums to make them better
                 understand how they can benefit from the park.

         1.9     Medium-term Strategy

                 Its strategy looks at a number of aspects and how they are
                 being improved, such as: financial sustainability;
                 increased and expanded tourism revenue; wildlife sales;
                 fundraising; biodiversity conservation management; working

         1.10    Veterinary Wildlife Services

                 Veterinary Wildlife Services (VWS) forms an integral
                 function of the Kruger National Park (KNP), because it is
                 responsible for: restocking of new parks (translocation);
                 game sales; policy and strategy management (animal disease
                 control); problem animals; treatments and research.


                 One of the main functions of the park is the
                 restocking/relocating of game, especially big game, to
                 other parks. Most of the newly formed parks lack huge game
                 populations whereas the KNP has a huge big-game population
                 due to the moratorium banning the culling of animals. The
                 KNP not only translocates animals to neighbouring and sub-
                 Saharan countries but also exports animals internationally
                 to countries such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand,
                 Singapore and the USA.


                 The money received from the sales of animals is used
                 primarily to buy more land to expand the park and create
                 new parks. It is also used to fund various projects and
                 conduct research. It is the responsibility of the
                 Veterinary Department to facilitate the capture,
                 examination, wellbeing and transportation of the animals.


                 The translocation of animals into Limpopo has been taking
                 place since 2001. The last translocation under the trans-
                 frontier programme to Limpopo took place in October 2004,
                 when an entire herd of elephants was captured, fitted with
                 radio collars, transported and released in Limpopo. These
                 elephants were monitored by means of their radio collars to
                 see where they had gone and how they had adapted to their
                 new home. Some of them managed to find their way back home
                 to the KNP, whereas others stayed and made a new home.


                 SANParks is the South African implementing agent for four
                 areas, namely the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park, the Ai-
                 ais/Richtersveld Transfrontier Conservation Area, the
                 Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, and the proposed
                 Limpopo/Shashe Transfrontier Conservation Area. SANParks is
                 also involved through Golden Gate Highlands National Park
                 in the establishment of the Maloti/Drakensberg
                 Transfrontier Conservation Area.


                 The most recent estimates of the numbers of mammals are as
                 follows:


                 |Name of mammal             |Number                          |

         1.11    Role of Veterinary Department

                 The Veterinary Department is also responsible for the
                 control of diseases when new and foreign animals are
                 introduced to the park because this ultimately affects
                 conservation and livestock living within the park. It also
                 takes care and assist with problem animals within and
                 outside the park as well as in other game parks. It is
                 responsible for the treatment of injured animals due to
                 human contact or natural injuries.


                 Most of the department’s emphases are on research and
                 getting more people involved in the wildlife veterinary
                 field. Because veterinary studies are very long, intense
                 and costly most people do not enter this field of study and
                 if they do, they specialise in treating domestic animals,
                 which is why the KNP assists with various training
                 programmes nationally and internationally.


                 The park has created a veterinary intern position where
                 students can work while they are studying. This is aimed at
                 exposing them to this field of study to generate interest,
                 especially amongst black students, whom they want to
                 attract to this field. There are also plans to create an
                 internship programme for veterinary technologists with the
                 aim of achieving their objective of having students from
                 all races enrol and complete their studies within five to
                 10 years.


                 This Department has over the years developed a highly
                 specialised operations wing that deals with the capturing
                 and transportation of wildlife, especially dangerous big
                 game. This wing consists of highly skilled people operating
                 very specialised equipment. Some of this equipment was
                 designed by the staff in the park to accommodate their
                 needs to facilitate the capturing and transporting of
                 animals, causing the least amount of harm and stress to the
                 animals, such as elephants and rhinoceros.


                 South Africa has two of the biodiversity hot spots of the
                 world, with more than 20 000 plant species, and is regarded
                 as one of 17 mega-diverse countries of the world, like
                 China, Brazil and Indonesia. KNP collectively holds 66% of
                 the world’s biodiversity. Unfortunately only 5% of South
                 Africa is officially protected, SANParks making up 53%,
                 provincial nature reserves 34% and private nature reserves
                 13%.


         1.12    Outsourcing of camps
                 Most of the rest camps have been outsourced recently and
                 private concessions are given to understand that nature and
                 the natural habitat should not be disturbed as far as
                 humanly possible, when people live in the bush in tents to
                 experience the outdoors or when going on hiking trails.

         1.13    Fences along KNP borders

                 The management team of KNP is in the process of changing
                 the current zoning act to comply with the new Protected
                 Areas Act. The fence along the KNP borders poses a unique
                 problem because these fences were initially designed to
                 keep diseased animals from entering KNP. The fence belongs
                 to the Department of Agriculture and has not been properly
                 maintained for a number of years, leading to certain
                 problems such as animals leaving the park and entering
                 surrounding neighbourhoods, causing property damage and
                 sometimes death, which becomes the problem of KNP. Poaching
                 of elephants and rhino for commercial gain is also a major
                 problem as poachers enter through the broken fences.

         1.14    Current projects

                 One of the current projects that KNP is busy with is the
                 removal of the fence separating KNP from Limpopo National
                 Park. Approximately 20% and 20km of the fence has already
                 been removed, but progress is slow because it is very
                 costly to remove the fence.


                 The artificial supply of water was also reversed to a
                 situation where nature once again takes care of itself, but
                 the introduction of fire breaks was necessary due to the
                 increase of man-made fires threatening the natural habitat
                 of the park and the introduction of alien plant life. The
                 other project is the translocation and sale of some of KNP
                 animals, but since the moratorium banning the culling of
                 elephants, their numbers have grown dramatically, posing a
                 major threat to the natural vegetation and endangering the
                 survival of other animals. In certain areas, such as the
                 Amboseli Park, elephants have destroyed virtually all the
                 natural vegetation and forest, impacting heavily on the
                 wildlife of that area. The potential for human conflict has
                 also increased with a number of deaths having already
                 occurred.


                 Because of huge tourist potential, local communities
                 approached KNP management on the issue of not wishing to
                 claim land but rather to annex land as part of KNP and be
                 taught how to run these lands as conservation parks.


                 The park allows people from the local communities to sell
                 locally produced goods inside the park and run a car-wash
                 project, both of which have been a success. The KNP
                 management encourages the participation of local
                 communities in any developments happening in the park, such
                 as getting local people to help fix the fence on the
                 eastern boundaries and perform basic maintenance, also
                 educating and training local people to apply for tenders
                 inside the park and in other sectors of government as a
                 means of upliftment.


                 The park has also tendered safaris and game drives, which
                 are outsourced and are very expensive. The park has now
                 decided to have their own safaris and game drives which
                 will be run by people from the local communities at a
                 reasonable rate with the intention of attracting more
                 people from South Africa and neighbouring countries.


         1.15    Accessibility to the park

                 Accessibility to the park plays a major role in
                 constituency building and does cater/allow for locals who
                 wish to perform cultural rituals in the park.


                 Local communities are also taught about invasive plant life
                 and endangered plants and how they impact on the natural
                 vegetation and, with the help of local communities, alien
                 plants are being eradicated, ensuring the survival of rare
                 plants. Medicinal nurseries are also being established
                 inside the park so that people do not have to go into the
                 park itself but rather to those areas where they are being
                 grown and collect whatever they need from there.


                 With regard to tourism, recent statistics show that of the
                 number of people entering KNP, not many people are staying
                 overnight. This is a direct result of the state of the
                 accommodation at KNP, which has not been upgraded for a
                 number of years. There has also been a decline in
                 international tourists because of the strengthening of the
                 rand and not all local visitors find KNP affordable. To
                 remedy this, the park has decided to have a different entry
                 fee for international visitors and local visitors, with the
                 intention of attracting more local visitors.


                 The park has also decided that whoever enters the park with
                 these outsourced game drives and safaris will pay the
                 international entry fee into the park.


         1.16    Challenges facing the KNP


                 From a marketing point of view, the biggest problem facing
                 KNP is the poor state of the accommodation. In order to
                 attract visitors and tourists to stay, the accommodation
                 has to be upgraded and maintained to meet acceptable
                 standards. The park is now marketing itself locally, trying
                 to inform people as to what it is all about and what they
                 can experience by visiting the park.

      D.    On-site visits

            The Committee took an on-site tour of the compound and the
            following were their findings:

            1.   The guest accommodations and campsite used by campers are
                 in need of major upgrading.


            2.   Not enough accommodation suitable for individuals who are
                 wheelchair based/physically disabled.


            3.   No proper drainage system in place in the campsite.


            4.   Ablution facilities are inadequate and need upgrading.
                 Seven ablution facilities servicing 84 campsites had no
                 proper lighting and are not accessible to those in
                 wheelchairs.


            5.   People use KNP as a short cut to cross to neighbouring
                 countries. Most of them overnight in the park and this also
                 bring revenue for the park. It was suggested that an extra
                 fee should be charged to haul heavy vehicles through KNP
                 and such fee will contribute to road maintenance.


            6.   No adequate housing complex for ground staff. To address
                 the problem, proper infrastructure is needed to accommodate
                 the staff.


            7.   One clinic situated near the staff quarters is not enough
                 to service all the staff within the park.


            8.   Prices charged at shops inside KNP were exorbitant,
                 putting local tourists at a disadvantage.


            9.   The tendered contract period for businesses like
                 restaurants and gift shops are too long and this
                 disadvantaged local communities from taking such
                 opportunities.


            10.  Many services were outsourced and local communities are
                 not given opportunities to offer those services.

      E.    Conclusion and Recommendations

           Having noted the shortcomings relating to insufficient housing,
           lack of proper sanitation, infrastructure upgrading and
           accessibility, lengthy contracts,  outsourcing of services,
           inadequate clinic facilities, exorbitant prices and salaries,
           the Committee concludes and recommends that:


           The management of South African National Parks should during the
           third term of the Parliamentary Committee Programme be invited
           by the Committee to brief members on mechanisms to be put in
           place to address the above-mentioned shortcomings.

1.    The Speaker and the Chairperson

      Report of the South African Parliamentary Delegation to the 18th
      Plenary Assembly Session of the Southern African Development Community
      Parliamentary Forum, held at Ezulwini, Swaziland from 29 May to 3 June
      2005.

      The full report is available from office of Clerk of the Papers.

      Executive Summary of the Report


      Introduction

      This report constitutes the report of South Africa’s parliamentary
      delegation to the 18th Southern African Development Community
      Parliamentary Forum’s Plenary Assembly held in Ezulwini, Swaziland
      from 29 May – 3 June 2005. The delegation comprised of the following:

            • The Hon Speaker Ms B Mbete (Head of the Delegation)
            • The Hon Ms F Hajaig
            • The Hon Ms M Madlala
            • The Hon Mr W J Seremane
            • The Hon D J Sithole

      Support staff included: Ms A Barnard, Ms G Constable, Dr F Khan and Ms
      N Mpuntsha.


      The theme and main focus of the 18th Plenary Assembly was ‘Challenges
      in the implementation of SADC Protocols’.


      The meetings were attended by the Presiding Officers and
      representatives of 11 of the 12 Member States of the Southern African
      Development Community Parliamentary Forum (SADC-PF or the Forum).


      Opening Session – Addresses


      The host Speaker, Hon S’gayoyo Charles Magongo, highlighted the
      commitment of the Parliament of Swaziland to the Principle of the Rule
      of Law, good governance and the promotion of gender equity and gender
      mainstreaming.


      The Chairperson of SADC-PF, Hon Amusaa Mwanamwambwa highlighted the
      fact that SADC celebrates 25 years of progress this year, which
      presented an opportunity to take stock and measure the extent to which
      the quality of life had improved in the region.


      The Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Swaziland, the Rt Hon Absalom
      Themba Dlamini noted that for 25 years, SADC has acted as a forum to
      discuss problems and matters of common interest in the region – it
      could thus be a shining example to the rest of Africa.


      In her Vote of Thanks, the Speaker of the South African Parliament,
      the Hon Ms Baleka Mbete, stated that the destinies of Swaziland and
      South Africa are linked, in many instances, through family ties and
      that integration among the countries of the region was important
      despite the artificial boundaries imposed by colonial history.

      Executive Committee Meetings – Key Issues


           • The Legal Sub-Committee considered the admission of the
             Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to SADC-PF and recommended
             that the DRC be admitted.
           • The Steering Committee on Human Resources facilitated the
             appointment of seven professional staff members to the
             Secretariat.
           • The Chairperson of SADC-PF reported on a courtesy visit paid
             to the President of South Africa, His Excellency, Thabo Mbeki,
             at which the issue of the establishment of a SADC Parliament
             was discussed.
           • The Secretary–General reported on the election observation
             programme, in accordance with which elections will be observed
             in Mauritius and Tanzania this year, and in Zambia, Angola and
             the DRC in 2006.
           • The Treasurer reported that, in order to cope with rising
             expenditure, annual mandatory contributions from Member States
             would be increased to R858 000 p.a. Member States were also
             urged to pay their current contributions and settle their
             arrears before June 2005.


     Standing Committee Meetings – Key Issues


            • The Committee on Democracy, Gender and Conflict Resolution /
              Peace-building noted that:


                  o SADC-PF Chapters should be established at national
                    Parliaments.
                  o In terms of election observation, while the principle of
                    sovereignty would be upheld, it was nonetheless
                    important to continue the practice of observing
                    elections in Member States.
                  o While Country Reports showed a trend towards greater
                    gender sensitivity, there are still many gaps in the
                    implementation of the SADC Declaration on Gender and
                    Development.
            • The Committee on Inter-parliamentary Co-operation noted that:
                  o There were inadequate lines of communication and
                    exchange of information between the Forum and other
                    regional (such as the Pan African Parliament – PAP) and
                    international parliamentary bodies.
                  o National Parliaments should create awareness of the work
                    and importance of the Forum.
                  o SADC Heads of State need to be sensitised about the
                    importance of establishing a SADC Parliament.
            • The Committee on Regional Integration noted that:
                  o National Parliaments should play a decisive role in the
                    approval of loans and that parliamentarians should
                    reinforce their oversight role and ensure that loans are
                    used for their stated purposes.
                  o There was insufficient information about NEPAD and that,
                    in order for the contribution of parliamentarians to be
                    more effective, there needs to be more consultation at
                    both grassroots and parliamentary levels.
            • The Committee on HIV and AIDS noted that:
                  o Despite all the interventions and programmes detailed by
                    the various Country Reports, the infection rate is on
                    the rise.
                  o The proposed Action Plan, which addressed the problems
                    identified, should be implemented.
            • The Committee on the Regional Women’s Parliamentary Caucus
              noted that:
                  o Advocacy and lobbying missions to encourage greater
                    women’s representation in national Parliaments will be
                    undertaken to Mauritius, Zambia and Angola this year.
                  o While women’s representation rose from 17,9% to 19,2%
                    during the 1997 - 2005 period, the levels of
                    representivity remained below 15% in most Member States.


                   Plenary: Thematic Session – Key Issues

  The theme of this session was ‘Challenges in the implementation of SADC
  Protocols: The role of parliaments in the management of cross border
  natural resources’. The key points made were:

            •  There  is  concern  over  the  slow  ratification  of   SADC
              Protocols.
            • The latest three Protocols to be ratified all deal  with  the
              management  of  cross-border  natural  resources,  viz.   the
              Revised Protocol on  Shared  Watercourses;  the  Protocol  on
              Fisheries; and the Protocol on Wildlife Conservation and  Law
              Enforcement.
            • The objective of  these  Protocols  is  to  establish  common
              approaches to the conservation and sustainable utilisation of
              cross-border natural resources on a basis of equity,  and  to
              assist with the effective enforcement of laws governing those
              resources.
            • Common challenges for all  the  Protocols  include:  lack  of
              political will; limited financial and human  resources;  high
              poverty levels.
            • Parliaments need to  play  their  role  in  facilitating  the
              ratification and implementation of SADC Protocols.


Another theme dealt with in this session was the implementation of the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It was noted that:

    • The MDGs set a number of goals and targets for monitoring human
      development by 2015.
    • Few Less Developed Countries (LDCs), which include some SADC
      countries, will meet these targets by 2015.
    • The attainment of the MDGs will not succeed without a very significant
      increase in both resources and effort.
    • The attainment of the MDGs is inextricable from the attainment of
      larger freedoms such as peace and security; good governance; human
      rights; effective socio-economic policies.

                    Plenary: Policy Session – Key Issues

    • The establishment of a SADC Parliament:
         o A decision is required on the establishment of a SADC
           Parliament.
         o The concerns of some Heads of State, to the effect that the
           expenses for this institution would be a drain on the region’s
           resources, should be addressed through the provision of more
           data on the budget required for its establishment and operation.


               • Application by the DRC:
            o The Plenary Assembly unanimously approved the application by
              the Parliament of the DRC for admission as the 13th member of
              SADC-PF.
                  • MDGs:
            o Unsatisfactory progress is being made by the region in
              attaining the MDGs.
            o Funding for measures to attain the MDGs should be reflected
              in the budgets of national Parliaments.
    • African Debt:
         o Parliaments should initiate relevant constitutional and
           legislative reforms to ensure that their role in the debt
           contraction process is further enhanced and institutionalised.
         • HIV and AIDS:
      o A plan of action for national Parliaments (which covered prevention,
        treatment, discrimination, cultural practices and the care of
        Orphans and Vulnerable Children) to address the continued increase
        in the rates of HIV infections was approved.
           • Future Plenary Sessions:
         o The 19th Plenary Session will be held in Botswana in December
           2005 and the 20th in Mozambique in June 2006.



Issues for the South African Parliament to follow up:

    • Submit Country Reports for all five Standing Committees.
    • Submission of reports on the Global Fund showing amounts accessed to
      date; utilisation of such amounts and problems encountered.
    • Consideration and finalisation of the draft Protocol on the
      Establishment of the SADC Parliament.
    • Submission of a report on the ratification of all SADC Protocols to
      date.
    • Submission of a report on the establishment and support for a national
      woman’s parliamentary caucus.
    • Submission of a report on action taken at a national level on SADC’s
      Norms and Standards of Elections, the SADC Principles on Democratic
      Elections, and South Africa’s electoral laws.
    • Submission of a report on action taken at a national level on the SADC
      Declaration on Gender and Development.
    • Submission of a report on action taken at a national level on NEPAD
      initiatives.
    • Submission of a report on action taken at a national level on PAP
      initiatives.

      on the Defence Account Amendment Bill [B 15-2005] (National Assembly -
      sec 75), dated 7 September 2005:

        The Select Committee on Security and Constitutional Affairs, having
        considered the subject of the Defence Account Amendment Bill [B 15-
        2005] (National Assembly – sec 75), referred to it, reports that it
        has agreed to the Bill.

2.    Report of the Select Committee on Security and Constitutional Affairs
      on the Armaments Corporation of South Africa, Limited Amendment Bill
      [B 14B-2005] (National Assembly - sec 75), dated 7 September 2005:

        The Select Committee on Security and Constitutional Affairs, having
        considered the subject of the Armaments Corporation of South
        Africa, Limited Amendment Bill [B 14B-2005] (National Assembly –
        sec 75), referred to it, reports that it has agreed to the Bill.

3.    Report of the Select Committee on Security and Constitutional Affairs
      on the Judicial Matters Amendment Bill [B 2B-2005] (National Assembly
      - sec 75), dated 7 September 2005:

      The Select Committee on Security and Constitutional Affairs, having
      considered the subject of the Judicial Matters Amendment Bill [B 2B-
      2005](National Assembly – sec 75), referred to it, reports that it has
      agreed to the Bill.


      The Committee wishes to report further, as follows:


      Regarding clauses 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 of the Bill as referred to the
      Select Committee, dealing with various amendments to the Debt
      Collectors Act, 1998, the Committee has taken cognisance of a letter
      of Black Sash addressed to it and the report of the Portfolio
      Committee on Justice and Constitutional Development, requesting the
      Department of Justice and Constitutional Development to investigate
      the viability of all debt collectors, attorneys included, falling
      under the ambit of a single statute, that is the Debt Collectors Act,
      1998. The Select Committee wishes to endorse the sentiments expressed
      in the letter of Black Sash and the Portfolio Committee in this regard
      and requests the Department to finalise its investigation as soon as
      possible and to report to Parliament on the outcome of this
      investigation.


      Clause 12 of the Bill amends section 12 of the Debt Collectors Act,
      1998, among others, by requiring the Debt Collectors Council to
      publish the register containing the names and particulars of all
      registered debt collectors on the website of the Council and to make
      the register available for inspection by members of the public at the
      places and times which are determined in the regulations to this Act.
      The Committee, while agreeing with these amendments, requests the
      Department, when drafting the regulations required under this
      provision, to bear in mind that not all members of society,
      particularly marginalised members of society, have easy access to
      websites, Government Gazettes and even national newspapers - mediums
      which are proposed in these amendments.  The Committee consequently
      requests the Department to make sure that the places which the
      register is available for public inspection, include places which are
      accessible to as many people as possible.  The Committee also requests
      the Department and the Debt Collectors Council to explore ways of
      making the activities and aims of the Debt Collectors Council known as
      widely as possible so that members of society who are confronted with
      what they consider to be abusive practices by debt collectors know
      what their rights are and what mechanisms are in place to which they
      can take their grievances for investigation or where they can find out
      whether the debt collector in question is in fact a registered debt
      collector, falling under the jurisdiction of the Council.  The
      Department, in conjunction with the Council, must report back to this
      Committee as soon as possible with a plan of action on how this is to
      be achieved.


      Report to be considered.

COMMITTEE REPORTS


National Council of Provinces

1.    Report of Select Committee on Social Services on Oversight Visit to
       the Northern Cape 08 – 12 August 2005, dated 13 September 2005:

       BACKGROUND

       The Select Committee on Social Services undertook a study tour to the
       Northern Cape Province from 08 – 12 August 2005. The purpose of the
       study tour was for the Committee to exercise its oversight function,
       as mandated by the Constitution. The primary objectives of the
       provincial visits included:

          • To conduct oversight over the management and quality of
            services rendered in respect of social development, health and
            home affairs.
          • To inspect various health, social development and home affairs
            facilities, in order to determine the state of physical
            infrastructure and equipment.
          • Identify progress made and challenges that are being
            experienced by all the stakeholders.

A.    Meeting with MEC and HOD: Social Services and Population Development

      Foreword by the MEC
      The Select Committee on Social Services met with the Member of the
      Executive Council (MEC): Social Services and Population Development,
      Mr Ackerwaray, on Monday 08 August 2005.

      The MEC informed the committee that the presentation to be given is
      not to analyse the Department but to ascertain how the activities were
      implemented. The department, the MEC stated, took a strategic approach
      to look at the internal environment, i.o.w. its capability. The
      department also had to take a look at the external factors, including
      the policies, that affects the department. The service delivery
      structures had to be looked at, e.g. social workers, to address the
      vacancy rate, the physical needs (e.g. availability of computers, fax
      machines etc.). The devolution of authority will form an important
      part of this process, and managers will have to take responsibility
      for their actions.


      The MEC noted some specifics as well. These include: the number of
      backlogs with regard to the grant processing of grant applications was
      reduced from 16 000 to 2 000; the turn-around times, which includes
      the appropriateness of facilities, where the department, as stated by
      the MEC, has done very well.


      The MEC stated that the finances have stabilised, backlogs have been
      eradicated and staff are motivated.


      For 2005 the MEC noted that the infrastructure will have to be in
      place when the SA Social Security Agency (SASSA) becomes operational
      in 2006. Focus will be placed on intervention programmes e.g.
      substance abuse. The state of the department and NGOs will have to be
      looked at. The department also increased the subsidy to NGOs to 50% to
      enable them to do their work effectively. The department will also be
      looking to minimize internal fraud and corruption.


      1. Presentation by Ms Y. Botha – HOD: Social Services and Population
      Development


      The HOD gave a brief summary on the vision and mission of the
      department.

      The HOD highlighted that the challenges faced by the department are
      many and diverse, and in saying this, the department made a concerted
      effort to roll out programmes to the rural and vulnerable communities
      of the Province.

      Human Resource and Management and Development

      The HOD stated that 100 persons were appointed in Social Auxiliary
      Work Learnerships. The Department started giving stipends of R500 per
      month to the 289 volunteers in their Victim Empowerment Programmes,
      Isolabantwana etc. The department has also implemented the Social Work
      Retention Strategy and 22 Probation and Assistant probation Officers
      have been appointed in their social crime-prevention programmes.

      Social Assistance Grants


      The HOD noted that backlogs in grant processing of grant applications
      have been reduced from about 16 000 to 1 721 and the processing of the
      huge backlogs in appeal cases have been reduced to about 90 cases.

      Achievements include:
         • The province’s professional foster-care programme is rated as
           the best practice model in the country for family preservation.
         • The Isobalantwana Project and the Neighbour-Helping-Neighbour
           Campaign has been rolled out to several towns in support of
           vulnerable children.
         • An additional 15 early childhood development centres have been
           registered and the subsidy has increased by 30%.
         • Funding for services for the aged increased from R78 per person
           to R120 per person.
         • The development of a Mini Drug Master Plan.
         • An Elder Persons forum has been established in the Pixley-ka-
           Seme region.
         • Resources have been allocated to start the first multi-purpose
           centre at Resthaven.

      Development Implementation Support Services


      The HOD stated that the focus areas of the department for the 2005/06
      financial year included the following:
         • addressing the socio-economic problems leading to unemployment,
           poverty and HIV and Aids.
         • The facilitation and implementation of the poverty relief
           programme.
         • The establishment of new community-based economical projects and
           the strengthening of existing ones.
         • The implementation of new poverty relief initiatives.
         • The provision of social development services to women, children,
           youth, disabled persons, orphans and children infected and
           affected by HIV and Aids.


      Food Security

      The HOD stated that the major focus of this programme would entail:
      Food-parcel distribution and food gardens, where the targeted group
      will be 9 550 households.
      Drop-in-Centres, and at these centres there will be HIV and Aids
      awareness and the provision of nutritious meals. Another targeted
      service will be the provision of nutritious supplements, the payment
      of stipends and the establishment of child-care forums.

      Children/Youth Awaiting Trial

      The number of young people entering the criminal justice system in the
      province range between 279 – 290 per month. Probation Officers in the
      different magisterial districts are assessing all these young people,
      in order to determine appropriate placement options.


      The HOD informed members on the statistics regarding the referral of
      young people who are being assessed:


      Residential-care placement is being implemented as a last resort and
      emphasis is being placed on community-based intervention options in
      terms of life-skills development and support to young people and their
      families.


      The HOD stated that there are currently 12 child-headed households in
      the Pixley-ka-Seme Region.

      Issues raised

         • The department responded on the issue of the facilities at pay
           points and stated that at all pay points there are ablution
           facilities, cover (tents) for the beneficiaries and water and
           these points are in a 5km radius from the beneficiaries. The HOD
           stated that the department is currently busy upgrading pay
           points further and they are working with local government and
           the churches in the various areas. The department also provides
           the disabled with wheelchairs (if they need one) or the Service
           Provider provides them. The department stated that on the day of
           the payout to beneficiaries, the payouts begin at 08:00 in the
           morning and by 11:00 all pay points are finished with payments.
         • There are 228 pay points in the province. There are security at
           these pay points, they are fenced and CPS are present. Community
           volunteers are present and they are trained in customer care,
           which are provided for by the service provider and at the end of
           the year a year-end function is held for these volunteers. The
           MEC stated that SAPS have also been asked to drive around at the
           various pay points on the day of payments, since this is a
           visible form of crime prevention. The HOD stated that the only
           people within the fence are the service provider and the
           beneficiaries, with the result that any other person must do his
           business outside (e.g. Mzansi).
         • The department stated that beneficiaries are advised that grants
           are paid on different dates. The MEC stated that beneficiaries
           had a choice and these were: that they can take the cash payment
           or load the money on to the smart card. The MEC reiterated that
           it was all about choice.
         • The HOD stated that a grant-abuse communication strategy was a
           priority for the department: strategies included going from door
           to door and reporting abuse in the system to the department and
           where the department would come up with strategies to curb this.
           The HOD stated that this was very difficult since many of the
           people were illiterate.
         • With regard to the food parcels, the HOD stated that the
           province did provide food parcels, but not as many as they used
           to. The HOD further noted that the department had to link up
           with the Department of Agriculture, but this never materialised.


         • The HOD stated that the department wanted to see a smooth
           transition of the personnel to the SA Social Security Agency.
           She noted that there was an increase in the number of disability
           grants, the reason being that of the increase in asbestos-
           related cases, the high risk of TB, etc.
         • The HOD stated that SOCPEN did indicate which beneficiaries’
           benefits would expire and these beneficiaries were informed
           three months before it expired. The MEC stated that the
           department was committed to make payments on time and not to
           delay the process.
         • The Chairperson enquired whether or not there were any rollovers
           and the MEC stated that the department was spending accordingly.
           The MEC further noted that the department frequently met to
           discuss the patterns of spending of the department; to determine
           early warning signs in the system. The MEC said that the
           department spent 100% of its budget (R1, 2 Billion).
         • The HOD stated that the department dealt with the backlogs and
           that there had been a significant increase in the number of
           backlog cases.


         • Recommendations
         • That the Department implements the Grant Abuse Communication
           Strategy, because of the many cases of fraud and corruption.
         • That the Department links up with other departments, e.g. talks
           with the Department of Agriculture will have to resume.


2.    Meeting with Regional Directors: Social Services – Northern Cape and
      North West

      Kgalagadi district is a cross-boundary municipality and the Committee
      met with the two district Regional Managers of Social Services of the
      Northern Cape and the North West.

      Northern Cape

      The Regional director informed the committee that the district was
      served by 51 workers: 27 permanent staff members, 6 contract workers
      and 18 learnerships.


      Kgalagadi District is served by eight permanent personnel. The
      Regional Director stated that with the establishment of the SA Social
      Security Agency (SASSA), some thinking needed to be applied regarding
      the transfer or absorption of the personnel.
      It was stated by the department that beneficiaries served in the area
      amounted to 2 562, compared to 9 340 in the district.


      The department stated that certain factors influenced the access to
      grants and these include:
         • Foreign documents: in the cross-border areas, this is very high
         • Lack of IDs: In Deben an ID campaign was conducted and more than
           500 people without IDs were found in four days. This could be
           contributed to the limited access to Home Affairs services.
         • Farms that did not have access to Home Affairs services.


      The seven pay points serving the Kgalagadi area are well equipped with
      the necessary amenities required for payments. Only one was too small
      for the beneficiaries, namely Deben community hall.


      The Welfare/Pension/Cash Pay Committees at all pay points are managed
      by volunteers of six to 10 people per pay point, with name tags
      showing their status. At the end of the year, the department, with
      CPS, shows them gratitude in the form of money (R400) and/or a food
      hamper - this differs from year to year.


      The Regional Director informed the committee that priority was given
      to low-income households who spent less than R200 per person per month
      and divisions per town were determined by population size and poverty
      status in the area.


      The Regional Director stated that other institutions such as NGOs,
      clinics, hospitals, SAPS, Schools, DOTS, home-based care workers and
      municipalities were involved in one way or the other to help with the
      food distribution in the form of storage of food, transport, use of
      telephones etc.


      Complaints which the department received included: maize distribution
      was small, leaking of cooking oil, damage to hampers, assessment not
      fair and volunteers victimized.


      The Regional Director stated that the challenges regarding the food
      security includes:
         • The needs exceed the supply of hampers
         • “Duplicated” services by the departments of Health and Social
           Services
         • Inevitable lengthy explanations to people as to why they do not
           qualify
         • Limited transport for delivery
         • Portuguese communities of Dingleton felt left out
         • Enforced list of beneficiaries from community leaders


      The department stated that the future of the programme would be to
      establish drop-in centres for feeding those who do not have food at
      home, and that these were being piloted. With regard to the Integrated
      Social Development Services Grant (ISDSG), this programme used “funds”
      amongst the beneficiaries of social grants to start investments into
      poverty-alleviation projects.


      The Regional Director informed the committee that the department
      relied on NGOs to render specialised services, which included:
      Substance-abuse service, services to people with disabilities, Early
      Childhood Development Centres (ECDs), services to Older Persons,
      Victim Empowerment Services.


      The Regional Director stated that services to youth awaiting trial are
      one of the department’s early intervention service functions. He
      further noted that statistics differed from month to month and in most
      cases only parental care and secure care facilities were being
      utilised. Youth awaiting trial in the Kgalagadi district had the
      privilege of being diverted into life skills and educational
      programmes at Moffat Mission, Kuruman, have been funded by the
      department for this purpose. The probation officer of Kathu also
      serves the Kuruman Magistrate office and works cross-border in this
      part of the Northern Cape. Re-assessment of youth in prison is being
      done on request and according to statistics and lately it is only
      children from the North West province who were in the Kuruman prison.


      With regard to Mental Health Services, no organisation exists for this
      service and no exploration is underway to assess the degree of the
      need because of a shortage of personnel.


      Statutory services


      Foster-care placement: the Regional Director informed the Committee
      that the number of finalised cases were – Kuruman (72) and Deben/Kathu
      (40); the number of children benefiting – Kuruman (150) and
      Deben/Kathu (82); and there were no backlogs in either of these
      regions.


      Services to children and families


      The department is currently busy with the formation of a programme
      called - Isolabantwa (Eye on the child) where an interest group of
      stakeholders is formed to establish a structure focusing on the
      protection of children.


      New emerging NGOs


      Through the Presidential Nodes projects, the Kuruman office is
      facilitating three organizations towards independent status as NGOs.
      These projects receive once-off funding staggered for three years.


      Challenges


      The department stated that the challenges included the following:


         • Planning for the absorption of the Northern Cape workers after
           the end of the cross-border arrangement
         • Difficulty of accessibility to Home Affairs services
         • Resolve the tricky issues of foreign documentation for IDs and
           accessibility to grants
         • The poverty level, which overwhelms such approaches as income-
           generating projects, food hampers, soup kitchens, etc.
         • Stability of experienced, skilled workers to help with the
           establishment of NGOs
         • The slow establishment of strong NGOs that can make a difference
           in helping to manage the social problems the department faces
         • Businesses exploiting people in terms of the smart cards.
      Issues raised


         • Mr Sulliman enquired regarding the use of the smart card. The
           Regional Director stated that the problem in the Northern Cape
           (NC), i.t.o. its Service Level Agreement was that it had to come
           up with value added service. The department has the task to
           educate people on the use of the smart card. The department must
           do more regarding training and informing people. With regard to
           businesses exploiting this system, the regional director stated
           that it was difficult to get affidavits from people to identify
           who these businesses were. He further noted that the SAPS were
           visible at the pay points.
         • With regard to grants, there are no long waiting periods. There
           were backlogs, but now the department is on track and people are
           working hard to eradicate the backlogs. The district also has a
           good relationship with the judiciary.
         • Ms Lamoela enquired whether there were any shortages with regard
           to social workers. The Regional Director stated that social
           workers were a scarce skill in the region. The district did not
           have a policy in place to deal with the issue. He proposed that
           these social workers be provided houses in the remote areas.
         • The Regional Director stated that 18 auxiliary workers have been
           trained in the area and bursaries had been given to exceptional
           persons. A major concern for the region is that when jobs are
           advertised the department receives very few applications.
         • Ms Vilakazi wanted to know whether the department had any link
           with the Department of Home Affairs (DHA). The Regional Director
           said that due to the fact that DHA had a shortage of staff, the
           mindset of officials and the vast area made it difficult for
           DHA. The district had a campaign regarding this issue and there
           are mobile units (one in Upington and one in Kgalagadi) and this
           must improve.
         • The Chairperson raised the issue of drop-in centres and NGOs.
           The Regional Director informed the Committee that there were no
           drop-in centres in the region, but now the province decided
           where the need existed to establish these centres. Previously
           this was done by the national department. He further noted that
           there were two in the province (one at Upington and one in the
           Namaqua region).
         • With regard to NGOs the regional director said that the NGOs
           were not skilled enough, and there was the need for these NGOs
           to be sustainable, the reason being that it was risky if these
           NGOs were dependent on the state.
         • The Chairperson also enquired regarding the food parcels. The
           department stated that the whole process was done through tender
           (nationally) and provinces just had to distribute the food
           parcels.
         • The department informed the committee that grants were processed
           on time and the waiting time now is three months.
         • The Executive Mayor stated that the district had many enquiries
           regarding burials. The department stated that they used to fund
           burials to those who could not afford it, but now there were no
           more funds available to render this service. The Committee
           undertook to take this issue up with the National Department of
           Social Development.


      Recommendations


         • The SC on Social Services stated that they would take up the
           burial assistance to the poor with the national department.


      Department of Social Services - North West


      The Regional Director stated that the challenges in the Moshaweng
      Service Point was that the shortage of staff hampered service delivery
      and that a normal ratio was one social worker to 5 000 people. This
      was the same in Gasegonyana Service Point.


      With regard to office accommodation, there is a lack for Moshaweng
      Service Point and efforts taken to secure a building were and are
      still unsuccessful. Both service points are still accommodated in one
      building, and as result there is overcrowding of personnel who have to
      share offices.


      In Moshaweng there is one subsidised early development childhood
      centre and in Gasegonyana four.


      Children in conflict with the law


      The presenter stated that in the social worker never received requests
      for pre-trial reports for children awaiting trial for both service
      points.


      Food security
      During the 2003/04 financial year, Moshaweng food parcel allocation
      was 8 000 and Gasegonyana 5 000. In the 2004/05 financial year,
      Moshaweng received 1 250 food parcels and Gasegonyana 750.


      The reduction in the food parcels hampered the programme in terms of
      reaching the majority of the vulnerable people. The Regional Director
      stated that there was no synergy between the Departments of
      Agriculture and Social Development.


      Integrated Social Development Grant (ISDSG)


      The Kgalagadi District has been identified as an area to start a drop-
      in centre. The Regional Director stated that children were identified
      in order to be assisted with school uniforms: in Moshaweng 28 children
      and Gasegonyana 28 children.


      NGO funding


      The Department is presently working hand in hand with community-based
      organisations (CBOs), as there are no NGOs in the North West part of
      the district. The department further noted that all CBOs and projects
      have affiliated with the CBO network which was launched last year.


      Challenges
         • Shortage of staff
         • Shortage of office accommodation
         • High influx of applicants for disability grant
         • Foster-care backlog
         • No appointed probation officers for both service points. A
           social worker focuses on both generic work and probation work
         • A serious turnover of staff due to the fact that there is no
           retention strategy for people to stay in the area.


      Issues raised
         • The committee enquired what the number of people applying for
           indemnity in the region was. The presenter stated that there
           were quite a lot of people applying for indemnity, but she was
           unable to give the exact figures of how many applied.
         • The food-parcel distribution was a challenge for the district,
           but they had local committees to monitor the whole process. On
           the issue of the decrease in the number of food parcels, the
           district stated that this was due to a decrease in the budget.
         • With regard to facilities at pay points, e.g. shelter and
           chairs, a tender was awarded to a company where the department
           ensured that local contractors were appointed to deliver the
           services. At pay points the department makes provision for
           people in need of wheelchairs.
         • The department stated that there was a shortage in foster care
           due to the shortage of social workers and a submission has been
           made to the province to fill these positions.


      Recommendations
         • That the shortage of social workers be addressed in the region.


      3.    Meeting with the Regional Director: Social Services (Frances
           Baard District)


      The Regional Director began his presentation with the pay-point
      development in the region. He stated that there were 51 pay points in
      the region and that one pay point had been developed and that 12 pay
      points needed upgrading and another 11 existing structures needed to
      be upgraded.


      He further mentioned the challenges w.r.t. social security in the
      region:


         • The high demand for disability grants due to the high
           unemployment rate within the region
         • Resources are limited
         • Problems with CPS machines at shops where they (shopkeepers)
           provide loans and the beneficiaries remain in debt
         • The rise in disability grants because of the rise in HIV/Aids
           cases
         • There is a big demand for food parcels as a result of
           unemployment
         • The abuse of social grants


      The department noted that there were 118 cases of HIV and Aids in the
      region. A number of 435 care givers received a stipend of R500 per
      month and 372 food parcels were distributed to child-headed households
      and the social-relief programme also supported them. The Department
      has also given burial assistance to 41 HIV and Aids-affected families
      from April – June 2005.


      The number of cases handled by social workers increased from 117 242
      cases and the children’s court is booked up to November for foster-
      care placements. The NGOs have a serious shortage of social workers
      and in nearly every NGO there is a social-work post vacant. Then it
      becomes the responsibility of the department to render a service in
      this vacant area. Another challenge is the shortage of vehicles for
      social workers to render an effective service.


      Social Assistance Grants
      The presenter stated that the total amount of beneficiaries receiving
      grants in the region were 52 572 people.


      Food Parcels
      With regard to the food-security parcels, the region distributed 1 850
      food parcels. The target group for these food parcels are: orphans and
      young children, youth, people living with HIV and Aids, vulnerable
      families infected and affected by HIV and Aids, women and people with
      an income of less than R200 per month.


      Child-Headed Households


      In the region there are 114 child-headed households. The department is
      assisting families and child-headed households to access birth
      certificates and grants. The department is also trying to link and
      place children/youth in mainstream schooling. Youth are placed in the
      Adolescent Development Programme (ADP) to restore self-worth and self-
      esteem and parenting education to teenagers who are heading
      households. The department will also assist in the establishment of a
      community food garden in order to teach subsistence farming to young
      people and families.


      In the Frances Baard region there 81 children awaiting trials -
      39 at Molehe Mampe Secure Care Centre and 42 at Lorato Place of
      Safety. There are nine children in prison.


      NGO funding and services


      The Frances Baard region has twenty (20) NGOs with a monthly funding
      of R16 822 and R2 018 688 annually. The presenter stated that the
      department relied mainly on non-profit organisations to render
      specialized services, which included substance abuse, services to
      people with disabilities, etc.


      In the Frances Baard region there are 46 child and family
      organisations, 27 Homes for older person’s, six children’s Homes, 179
      ECD centres, one shelter for children on the street, five protective
      workshops, three residential facilities for people with disabilities
      and 21 service centres for the elderly and disabled.


      Issues raised


         • The presenter stated that the abuse of grants was a major
           problem in the region and that the region did not have a
           specific unit that dealt with this abuse and that the need
           existed for a dedicated team to deal with this issue. There are
           volunteers in the region to assist the social workers with their
           already huge caseloads.
         • With regard to burials of people who cannot afford it, the
           department stated that they tried to assist where there really
           was a need. The department makes provision for this in the
           conditional grant for burials, which are HIV and Aids related,
           but it is a dilemma. The presenter stated that the
           municipalities were supposed to budget for this service. The
           department further noted that they were educating and
           encouraging people to take out burial policies.
         • The presenter stated that the region was trying its very best to
           cope with foster care in the region and they were able to do
           only that much. The department spends a lot of time on each
           individual case before it goes to court. The department stated
           that they had an excellent relationship with the Department of
           Justice and that they also had a Child Forum, where they met to
           discuss problems and bottlenecks with the Department of Justice.
         • On the issue of orphans, the presenter stated that the
           department was trying to speed up the process and that there
           were volunteer workers who assisted the department well, with
           the result that the social worker only did investigations. The
           aim was to place the child as soon as possible.
         • With regard to people living with HIV and Aids the presenter
           stated that the region had done data research on, for example,
           what was needed to assist those living with HIV and Aids. The
           aim is also to speed up assistance to people who are terminally
           ill.
         • The presenter stated that the physical infrastructure at pay
           points needed minor attention, e.g. fixing toilets, tiling, etc.
           If any developments were to take place at these pay points, the
           department involved CPS and the local municipality and the
           department had a healthy relationship with municipalities. The
           presenter also informed the committee that payouts at the
           various pay points only happened till 14h00 and if payments were
           done after 15h00 the department had a service-level agreement
           with the service provider to provide the beneficiaries with
           food.
         • The presenter stated that regarding the CPS machines in shops,
           the last option was to remove them from shops. He further noted
           that it was the people themselves who abused the system and at
           the end of the day the department would be responsible. The HOD
           stated that another problem was that the shop owners themselves
           abused the system by hiking the prices in their shops and they
           also kept the smart cards of beneficiaries.
         • With regard to probation services in the region, the department
           has what they call the Home-based Provision Programme, which is
           only in the Frances Baard district. They are planning to roll it
           out in other regions. The children are trained in life skills to
           assist them and to keep them busy while they are waiting to go
           to court. The monitoring is done by the assistant probation
           officers and they also have people assisting them. The presenter
           stated that this programme started as a pilot but now the region
           could not do without it and they were becoming indispensable.
         • On the issue of food-parcel distribution, the department looked
           at various factors, e.g the number of people in a household, the
           number employed in this household, etc, and this is when the
           department intervenes. The presenter stated that the department
           was making a concerted effort to assist the needy, the poor and
           the vulnerable in the region.
         • The presenter stated that the department tried their best to rid
           the department of corruption. For example, when beneficiaries
           cannot write, they take the thumbprint of the beneficiary and
           they make sure structures are in place to minimize corruption.
         • With regard to the amnesty process in the region, the presenter
           stated that the process is ongoing.
         • The presenter stated that the department was moving away from
           old-age homes and they made sure that they are multi- purpose
           centres.
         • The presenter stated that more needed to be done to assist NGOs
           in the region and the issue of subsidies to NGOs needed to be
           addressed as well.
         • The department stated that there was a relationship with the
           religious organizations in the region, but these relations must
           be further strengthened and improved. Many of the soup kitchens
           in the region are run by faith-based organisations and without
           them the department would be truly lost, as the presenter
           stated.


      Recommendations
         • That the department has to minimise the abuse of grants and that
           they will have to develop a strategy to deal with this abuse of
           the system.
         • The SC on Social Services stated that they would address the
           burial assistance to the poor with the national department.
         • To speed up the process of foster care in the region, they have
           to liaise with the Department of Justice to alleviate the
           situation.
         • The provincial department must get the assistance of the
           national department w.r.t. the establishment of NGOs in the
           region. They must strengthen the relationship with the faith-
           based organisations.


      4.    Visit to Ethembeni Community and Trauma Centre – De Aar


      The centre was initiated in May 2002 and registered as a NPO in 2004.
      The objective of the centre is the provision of a comprehensive 24-
      hour service for vulnerable groups, which include children, woman and
      men in the community.


      The core functions of the centre include:
         • Children on streets
         • Soup kitchen - the presenter stated that they also provided food
           to older persons if they were sick and the previous month (July)
           they had 307 people whom they were feeding, including unemployed
           people.
         • Home-based schooling - the emphasis is on the street children
           and the centre teaches them how to deal with various problems
         • Drop-in centre - they applied for funding
         • Trauma centre – to be used for counseling purposes, because the
           police refer people to the centre.
         • Shelter and other services


      The presenter stated that the centre received little assistance from
      the Department of Health.


      The challenges of the centre include:
         • Resource allocation – the presenter stated that at one stage the
           centre had 10 administrative ladies assisting them, but people
           leave because they do not receive any salary/stipend. There are
           no money to deliver services to older people
         • Sustainable source of income
         • Additional and sustainable volunteer basis
         • Medical practitioners and forensic services
         • Strong broad-based partnerships
         • Assistance from the Department of Health
         • Repair of essential infrastructure and equipment (electricity,
           washing machines, stoves, windows and burglar bars)
         • Upgrading and renovation (paint, flooring, clean up)


      Commitments from the Department of Social Services and Population
      Development include: funding for two development workers and one
      coordinator. The department also envisages funding in the current
      financial year for a list of needs as indicated by the centre.
      The HOD stated that the department of Social Development is
      responsible for the running costs of the centre.
      The presenter stated that Spoornet owns the building which the centre
      is occupying and the children at the centre is receiving no funding.


      Recommendations
         • The committee emphasised that the Department of Health will have
           to come on board and assist with the centre.
         • The committee went on a tour through the centre and found that
           the kitchen, stoves, etc are in bad condition and that the
           department will have to link with other stakeholders to better
           the situation.
         • Because the building is old, many repairs will have to be done,
           e.g painting, broken windows, etc.


      5.    Visit to Resthaven Old Age Home – Kimberley


      The Select Committee on Social Services visited the Resthaven Old Age
      Home on Friday 12 August 2005.


      The presenter stated that Resthaven had been identified as a pilot
      project for a multipurpose centre to initiate a comprehensive one-stop
      service centre for older persons. The new facility will host a basket
      of services, e.g. service centre, frail care, day care, transport and
      laundry services, meals on wheels, information centre, health and
      beauty, etc.


      The facility has bed occupancy for 48 residents and there are
      currently 25 frail and 23 independent residents who are taken care of.
      The facility is in receipt of a monthly subsidy of R48 487.60 from the
      Department of Social Services and Population Development.


      The management board comprises of 10 members and meetings are held on
      a monthly basis. The management committee consists of volunteers who
      are elected every two years. Monitoring and evaluation is the
      responsibility of the Department of Social services and Population
      Development.


      Funding has been allocated for the following:
         • a 25-seater bus of R485 000
         • office equipment of R34 000
         • renovation of the home and the construction of a 200-seater hall
           to the amount of R2 million.
      This forms part of the transformation of services to the elderly and
      people with disabilities to provide infrastructure for the
      implementation of community-based services.


      The challenges of the home include:
         • Implementation of proposed organogram, i.e. Sub-directorate for
           Special Needs
         • Promotion of community involvement
         • Strengthening of partnerships, interdepartmental as well as the
           private sector
         • Research on needs of older persons in communities
         • Training for management and staff
         • Awareness campaigns in communities
         • The frequent change of committee members affects the
           organisation negatively, and consequently the organisation is
           continuously confronted with labour-relations issues.


      The committee enquired from the one sister who worked at the centre
      and she informed the committee that the following were some of the
      challenges faced by the centre:
         • That the infrastructure of the centre was not created for an old-
           age home and that the centre was originally built as a centre
           for the abused and neglected.
         • In the centre currently there are more frail patients.
         • She noted that the current staff members needed extensive
           training to deal with frail patients, because there was huge
           strain on the current professional nurses
         • The centre needed a sluice room, because currently they were
           improvising
         • The centre needed a sick bay


      Recommendations include:
         • Liaison with the department of Public Works in order to address
           infrastructure challenges
         • They must revisit the staff establishment of the facility
         • Budget allocation will have to be reviewed


      6.    Visit to Mohele Mampe Place of Safety
      The types of intervention at the centre include:
         • prevention, which includes outreach programmes
         • early intervention services
         • sport and recreational programmes
         • educational programmes, etc.


      Challenges at the centre include:
         • infrastructural challenges
         • the budget allocation
         • lack of computerized tracking system to link with continuum of
           care services
         • Recidivism of young people


      Issues raised
         • Members enquired whether submissions had been made regarding the
           budget. The presenter stated that the senior management of the
           Department of Social Services was making allocations and that
           the centre would have overspending and the issue was being
           addressed.
         • The presenter stated that the overcrowding was “artificial”. He
           stated that the centre was seasonally overcrowded, i.e. over the
           Christmas and Easter season.
         • The presenter stated that the some of the dormitories had been
           vandalised and that the Department of Public Works would be
           coming the following week to do maintenance work on the
           buildings.


      Recommendations from the Committee:
         • that the strategic plan of the centre must include the budget as
           well
         • that partnerships will have to be formed with other various
           departments, e.g. Public Works


      Tour of Mohele Mampe Centre
         • The committee observed that the dormitories differed in size,
           e.g. one bed, two beds, four beds
         • Some of the dormitories are vandalized.There are 10 dormitories
           and six are vandalised
         • There are telephones available for the children to phone their
           family members
         • There is a woodwork workshop, which belongs to the provincial
           Department of Education, where the children can do welding, etc.
         • The centre also supplies the boys with clothes
         • In the laundry the machines are old but still in a working
           condition. The sewing machine is broken down.
         • The boys receive breakfast at 7am, lunch at 1pm, supper at 5pm
           and a snack at 8pm.
         • In the principal’s office there are screens from where the
           principal can monitor the movement of the boys.


      7.    De Aar Clinic


      The committee visited the clinic on 08 August 2005.


      Tour of clinic
         • The presenter stated that PMTCT was a pilot project at the
           clinic
         • The members noticed a waiting room - this was where patients got
           the date and time for their appointments. On the day of the
           visit the waiting room was not packed and the presenter stated
           that it was seldom packed and that there were no long queues and
           waiting time at the clinic
         • There is an administration office which is occupied by sisters,
           since there are no administration staff.
         • No TOP is performed at the clinic, and this service is referred
           to Kimberley
         • The presenter stated that they see about 120 – 180 patients per
           week
         • The consultation rooms are open from 07:30 – 16:00
         • The presenter stated that the equipment of the clinic was
           satisfactory, but that they were acquiring more
         • The clinic performs general primary health care
         • Doctors visit the clinic twice a week
         • Number of staff at the clinic: one professional nurse, one nurse
           and three councilors


      B.    Meeting with MEC and HOD of Health


      The MEC stated that the province had increased its number of ARV sites
      from five to nine and they hoped to increase this number further. The
      department envisaged the accreditation of other sites and also to
      strengthen other sites.


      The province is in the process of training caregivers who earned a
      stipend of R500. On completion they would receive a stipend of R1 000.




      The MEC stated that the conditional grant of the department was
      currently R48 million.


      1.    Presentation by the HOD of Health


      The HOD stated that w.r.t. Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission
      (PMTCT), the antenatal clients undergoing HIV testing for 2004/05 was
      79% and for 2005/06 70%. With regard to Voluntary Testing and
      Counselling (VCT), the numbers for 2004/05 was 71% and for 2005/06 87%
      attending clinics. He further noted that the Northern Cape had the
      second-lowest HIV prevalence by province among antenatal clinic
      attendees in the country. The HOD stated that according to statistics
      the tuberculosis incidence in the Northern Cape is 361/100 000 people
      in 2003.


      Comprehensive Plan
      The HOD stated that the department envisaged a comprehensive service
      at every consultation and that this should be integrated with routine
      services provided for by the department. This can be done if the whole
      health system is strengthened. VCT services will be broad based as
      well. This will lead to a quality service, as stated by the HOD.


      Community Health Workers
      There are currently 1 009 community health workers in the province and
      these health workers, as stated by the HOD, must be trained on this
      comprehensive service. A 59-day training will commence in August 2005
      and an accredited service provider is doing this and the curriculum is
      nationally approved. The HOD said that there was limited support for
      orphans and vulnerable children, but the department was doing what
      they could for these children, e.g. provision of nurses, diapers, etc,
      but the department’s involvement was limited.


      With regard to the ART programme, the HOD stated that there were 5 200
      patients who had been assessed (registered) and 2 400 of these were
      not requiring ART yet, and 2 800 requires ART and of those requiring
      ART 1 600 are on preparation and 1 200 on treatment. The HOD stated
      that it was a major challenge to get doctors and nurses to the rural
      areas to be able to increase the number of sites and another challenge
      was the transport, because of the vastness of the province.


      Strategic Priorities
      The HOD stated that the strategic priorities of the department
      included:
         • Awareness and prevention – to prevent people who are HIV
           negative from becoming infected, to promote the health of people
           living with the virus, etc.
         • Care and support – to implement effective community-based and
           home-based care as part of the comprehensive plan, supporting
           compliance for life for those on treatment
         • Treatment – providing appropriate, evidence-based ART and
           managing the implementation of care packages in a responsible,
           accountable, transparent manner
         • Human rights – to respect the privacy and confidentiality of the
           clients and to provide integrated HIV and Aids care through the
           Employee Assistance Programme
         • Monitoring and Evaluation, Research and Surveillance – to
           provide appropriate, evidence-based information for action and
           to monitor quality and evaluate performance through standardized
           annual surveys and strategic academic partnerships.


      Health Infrastructure


      The HOD stated that the Hospital Revitalisation Programme was making
      good momentum. Two level one facilities, in Colesburg and Calvinia,
      have been completed and current revitalization Projects include:
      Specialist Mental Health Facility (R250m), Barkley-West Hospital
      (R40m), Upington Hospital (R230m) and De Aar Hospital (R200m).


      The HOD further stated that a number of new projects were under way in
      the province.


      Issues raised
         • Members raised concern regarding the retention of staff in the
           Northern Cape. The HOD stated that it was difficult to retain
           professional staff because of the migration to other provinces.
           He stated that if, for e.g., the Northern Cape (NC) were to
           increase the salary of professionals, other provinces (e.g.
           Gauteng) would increase theirs too, with the result that the
           Northern Cape could not compete with the other provinces. He
           noted that the department had to look at other incentives, e.g.
           looking at the environment people are working in, i.o.w. look at
           “softer” issues.
         • On the question of whether there are clinics that offer 24-hour
           services, the HOD stated that there were none thus far and that
           this was never implemented. The reason for this is the shortage
           of personnel.
         • With regard to security at hospitals and clinics, the
           department’s expenditure is R18m a year. The Committee said that
           they will take up the issue regarding security at clinics with
           the National Department of Health.
         • With regard to the Infection Register, the department stated
           that they had these registers at the hospitals and clinics. The
           HOD noted that specimens were taken quarterly and nurses were
           trained for this purpose. Kimberley Hospital has a unit
           dedicated to dealing with the infections at the hospital.
         • Members raised concern regarding the number of ambulances in the
           province. The HOD noted that 30 new ambulances had been bought.
           These were fully equipped and personnel had been trained as
           well. The HOD stated that a further 55 new ambulances would be
           received by the province, which would include eight 4x4s.
         • The HOD further stated that because of the vastness of the
           Northern Cape it was envisaged that the department would make
           use of helicopters to fly patients to hospitals. This would be
           much cheaper than what is currently operational, where these
           long distances are being driven.


      Recommendations
         • That the department looks at implementing clinics on a 24-hour
           basis.
         • That the department undertook a study on the feasibility of
           utilizing helicopters in the Northern Cape.


      2.    Meeting with Regional Manager of Kgalagadi District: Northern
           Cape


      All primary-health-care (PHC) facilities are run eight hours a day,
      five days a week and negotiations are in place to extend the clinic
      hours.


      The VCT uptake in the region for the last three months is: 1 081 pre-
      test counselled, 1 036 tested and 358 were positive (34,56%) and 293
      (27%) were self-referred.


      The TB cure rate for the first quarter of 2004 was 54.16% and the
      treatment completion rate 13.88%, the failure rate 1.38% and the
      transfer-out rate 8.32%.


      With regard to PMTCT, in the first quarter of 2005 the antenatal (ANC)
      first visits was 333, HIV tests done on ANC clients was 178 (53%), ANC
      clients HIV positive 41 (23%), Nevirapene dose to ANC positive 30
      (73%) and live birth to women who are HIV positive 23.


      Termination of Pregnancy
      The presenter said there was only one professional nurse trained in
      TOP in the region and no TOP was being done at present because of the
      lack of infrastructure and TOP is currently referred to Kimberley.


      NGO sector


         • Aganang – This is a home-based care and health Education group
           and 28 trained volunteers are assisting
         • AnCRA – this is a land-rights organisation and their operational
           area is the Kgalagadi district (cross boundary)
         • Aids foundation (funding for stipends) – they fund Dingleton and
           Van Zylsrus CHBC


      Challenges
      The presenter stated that the challenges included:
         • Infrastructure
         • Office space
         • Transport
         • Emergency medical services, ambulances and trained personnel
         • The effect of HIV and Aids on health services
         • Lack of equipment
         • Budget and expenditure
         • Shortage of logistics
         • Governance and community participation
         • Implementing normal deliveries at all PHCs


      Kuruman Hospital


      The presenter also gave a brief overview of the Kuruman Hospital. She
      stated that there were 64 beds in total and occupancy rate of 98%.
      Ward A is the maternity and surgical; Ward B is medical and surgical
      and there is a casualty ward and an infection control room. Also at
      the hospital is a operating theater, radiology department and a
      pharmacy.


      The HR of the hospital are as follows: Hospital Manager (vacant),
      Chief Medical Officer (one), permanent doctors (three), community
      doctors (four), pharmacist permanent (one), pharmacist community (two)


      All doctors do primary health care on a weekly basis.
        Issues raised
         • The presenter stated that there was no staff who were interested
           in being trained in TOP and the regional department tried to
           motivate people to go for the training.
         • There is one ambulance serving Van Zylsrus (110km gravel road)
           and one ambulance for Dingelton and two for Kuruman. There are
           two paramedics to assist in severe accidents, but two more are
           still in training. The presenter stated that Kimberley said that
           they would supply more ambulances, but the region was still
           waiting.
         • There are no primary-health-care facilities which operated 24
           hours, and there is no security at the clinics, only at the
           hospital. The presenter stated that the district was looking at
           extending the working hours, but they needed the infrastructure
           to do so. Dingleton has the infrastructure to do so, because
           they have three professional nurses at the clinic.
         • The presenter stated that, with regard to infections control,
           two staff members had been trained in July – one at PHC and the
           other at Kuruman Hospital.
         • The Chairperson enquired regarding the infrastructure at the
           hospital and clinics. The presenter stated that the department
           looked at upgrading Kuruman Hospital, but they found that it was
           not going to be adequate to do so. The district is in the
           process of upgrading the clinics.
         • Mr Sulliman enquired what the conditions were like at the HIV
           and Aids testing sites and Ms Lamoela enquired on hospital
           management and governance at hospitals. HIV and Aids testing is
           done at PHC level and it is a normal visit and counselling is
           done as well. With regard to hospital management and governance,
           she further stated that there were measures in place for
           community participation, but currently there were no community
           committees yet, but there is a health forum in which the
           department partakes.
         • With regard to Human Resources, posts have been advertised and
           Kimberley has done the short-listing. The presenter stated that
           what was needed for these professionals are accommodation and
           the rural allowance. The presenter further noted that the
           province was busy looking at a retention strategy.
         • Ms Vilakazi enquired with regard to the kilom/eters travelled to
           clinics. The presenter stated that the only mode of transport
           for patients to clinics was public transport (taxis) and they
           were expensive for somebody who cannot afford it. The presenter
           also stated that the province had patient transport: if the
           patient was referred from the PHC, then transport would be
           available.
         • A major problem in the district is that of private doctors.
           Patients from these doctors stay in the public hospital, and the
           doctor receives his money from this patient while he/she is
           staying in the public hospital. There was resistance from the
           private doctors when the provincial department stopped this
           “practice”.


      Recommendations
         • The region has taken up the situation regarding the availability
           of ambulances with the provincial Department of Health
         • That the TOP service is an important service and this service
           has to be available in the region and that the Department of
           Health should make a concerted effort to rectify the situation.
         • The operation of clinics 24 hours a day has to be looked at
         • The region has to look at a strategy to attract and retain
           personnel


      3.    Meeting with Regional Director Kgalagadi District – North West


      Primary Health Care Facilities
      There are 23 facilities in the district providing comprehensive PHC
      services, including maternity services. Two facilities are open 24
      hours, seven days a week and four facilities render service 12 hours a
      day, seven days a week and 21 facilities render services eight hours a
      day, five days a week.


      The cure rate of TB in the region is 71%. All clinics provide VCT.


      Management and quality of services


      The Regional Director informed the committee that the clinical and
      admin management team was in place. Programme Managers are at
      Assistant Director level. Facility managers are in place for clinical
      supervision. Quality-assurance structures are in place in the hospital
      and patient and staff satisfaction surveys are being done. A Batho
      Pele indaba was held in the subdistrict where the community
      participated and where the community was encouraged to critique the
      department. The department is also looking at various complaint
      mechanisms.


      Human Resources
      Human Resources for the district are: approved 289, filled 216 and
      vacant 73.


      Governance
      The Regional Director stated that six governance structures were de-
      established on the 3rd of September 2004.


      Finances of hospital
         • The hospital/PHC management is delegated to authorise purchases
           up to R50 000 and items on tender/contract no limitation.
         • Authority up to R100 000 with district Bid committee
         • Minor maintenance budget with hospitals


      The PHC services for 2004/05 expenditure were R30m and the allocation
      for 2005/06 is R42m. For hospital services, the expenditure for
      2004/05 was R42,6m and the allocation for 2005/06 is R35m, but the
      Regional Director stated that it will be around R45m.


      Termination of Pregnancy
      Patients receive appropriate counselling from trained staff. This
      service is available on request at the hospital and PHC services. An
      average of 21 TOP per quarter are performed.


      Challenges
         • The physical structure of the hospital
         • The attraction and retention of skilled personnel and (cross
           boundary) of professional nurses
         • Slow progress of capital projects
         • Equipment for upgraded clinics
         • Emergency Medical Services (EMS) have only two vehicles
         • The road infrastructure is not good for the life span of the
           vehicles
         • Vehicle Replacement Plan
         • Accommodation for nurses is a major problem
         • Maintenance of buildings


      Issues raised
         • Ms Lamoela asked whether the district had a strategy to retain
           and/or attract skilled staff and also enquired regarding the
           issue of infections. The presenter stated that the issue
           regarding the retention and attraction of professionals was
           three-fold:
         • those doctors who are doing community service, if they are
           medical officers, to promote them to, for example, Chief Medical
           Officer.
         • Training all professional nurses to dispense
         • Improving the accommodation and providing basic furniture to
           professionals.
         • On the question of how CBOs are monitored, the presenter stated
           that these organisations were required to submit evidence on how
           they spent the money given to them by the provincial Department
           of Health.
         • With regard to infection-control mechanisms in the clinics, the
           presenter informed the committee that all institutions had
           policies and standards in place and last quarter no infections
           were detected, despite the poor infrastructure at some of these
           institutions.
         • The Executive Mayor stated that the district had been promised
           two-roomed clinics, but nothing was delivered. Even when she
           tried to intervene, still nothing was delivered. The department
           stated that the two-roomed clinics would come in the 2006/07
           financial year.
         • With regard to the revitalisation programme, the presenter
           stated that he was not able to say where the new hospital would
           be built, but that the funding had been approved and that they
           (provincial department) only had to decide where to build the
           hospital.


      Recommendations
         • The region has to look at a strategy to attract and retain
           personnel.
         • The issue of the two-roomed structures will have to be followed-
           up with the provincial Department of Health.
         • That the department takes up the issue of the hospital boards.


      4.    Meeting with Regional Director of the Frances Baard Health
           District


      Management and quality of services
      Six PHC clinics in the Sol Plaatje Municipality render a full package
      of PHC, and two are due after training to commence in ANC (antenatal)
      services. Four clinics have been identified to provide 24-hour service
      and staffing plans are under way. A new clinic is also going to be
      built in Barkley-West. Clinic supervisors are to be appointed to
      enhance quality management. Other clinics will also be providing
      health services beyond 18 hours a day. One community health centre
      provides 24-hour maternity services for the population of Sol Plaatje
      Municipality.


      Human Resources
      The presenter gave a breakdown of each of the three municipalities
      regarding its human resources and it was clear to the Committee that
      there is a shortage of staff in the region.


      Facility Infrastructure
      The representative of the department noted that most clinics “can do”
      with revitalization.


      Termination of Pregnancy (TOP)
      The Regional Director stated that the service was provided at the
      Galeshewe Day Hospital (CHC). The presenter stated that from February
      2005 to July 2005 an average of 246 people per month requested TOP. It
      was stated that persons who were over 12 weeks pregnant were referred
      to Kimberley Hospital.


        Challenges
         • Unsuitable PHC facilities, where buildings are too small to
           handle the daily patient load
         • The cross-boundary issues at Hartswater and Jan Kempdorp, where
           60% of PHC clients at clinics are from the North West province.
           The presenter informed the Committee that previously the North
           West (NW) gave one nurse, and her salary was paid by the NW. In
           July, the NW took her back and now the Northern Cape wants to
           continue with the agreement as it was before July
         • Functional integration – challenges of dual management:
           confusing and conflicting messages
         • Insufficient vehicle allocation to PHC services and shortage of
           mobile units to render PHC services in some grey areas
         • Inadequate and inefficient patient transport management
           especially in the Vaalharts area. The presenter stated that the
           budget for vehicles had to be addressed.
         • The poor community participation, where very few facilities have
           functional clinic committees. They must begin to start setting
           up hospital boards.
         • Recruitment and retention of professional nurses for rural
           areas. The presenter stated that the scarce skills allowance
           that the staff received was taxed, with the result that they
           received very little after it had been taxed.
         • Platfontein is a challenge – the department tried to put two
           youngsters from Platfontein through nursing, but the whole
           experience was a “cultural shock” for the two of them, and they
           did not finish the course.
         • Clinics are not getting empty, but the department is busy with
           health promotions.


        Issues raised
         • With regard to TOP the department stated that they had two
           nurses performing TOP, but not anymore. The nurses did not want
           to perform this service any longer and one of the reasons was
           that they had to perform this service to a particular young girl
           about three times. The presenter stated that provision was made
           for pre-counselling before the training began.
         • On the question of the relationship between the department and
           traditional leaders in the region, the department stated that
           they had a summit in July where it was envisaged that the
           department and the traditional leaders be brought together and
           that this was still an ongoing process. He further noted that
           the traditional leaders were involved in STIs, TB, etc.
         • The presenter stated that TB is a major problem in the region.
           One of the factors contributing to this is the fact that many of
           these patients are seasonal workers who contract TB, the clinic
           treats them and after this they disappear. The department stated
           that they have had talks with farmers to assist the department
           and this is ongoing.
         • On the issue of the two-roomed structures, the department stated
           that the Northern Cape had containers as clinics, which were
           serviced by mobile clinics, and in the region there were two.
           The department would want to have more, but the budget was not
           sufficient.
         • With regard to the hospital boards, the department stated that
           in July they had discussions with politicians in the region to
           assist the department with the nomination of people to sit on
           these boards, and positions were advertised as well and they
           also hoped that this would cascade down to clinic committees as
           well.


        Recommendations
         • That the TOP service is an important service and this service
           has to be available in the region and that the Department of
           Health make a concerted effort to rectify the situation
         • That the relationship with the traditional leaders be
           strengthened
         • That the region develops a strategy to deal with patients not
           doing the full cycle of the TB programme
         • The department take up the issue of the hospital boards


      5.    Tour of Galeshewe Day Clinic


      The Select Committee on Social Services visited Galeshewe Day Clinic
      on 11 August 2005. The management of the clinic took the committee on
      a tour of the clinic.


         • In the foyer of the clinic, the committee noticed that there was
           a suggestion box
         • At the entrance was a registration section, which indicated to
           patients where they should go
         • Management stated that the provincial Department of Health was
           busy revamping the clinic
         • Management informed the committee that there were no fax
           facilities at the clinic, and if they wanted to fax documents
           they had to go to Kimberley Hospital to do so
         • One of the major problems at the hospital is the shortage of
           staff
         • The post of manager at the clinic is advertised and they hope to
           fill the position soon
         • Maternity section
         • There is a waiting room for family members
         • In the first stage there are three beds, in the labour ward four
           beds and in the post-natal ward nine beds
         • There is a shortage of staff in this section
         • In this section there are two nurses per shift, but the need is
           for three sisters, and there is one student midwife
         • The section is operational 24 hours per day.
         • The TB room is confined
         • Management stated that a ARV and ART site still had to be
           identified, and the first ARV room that was identified was too
           small.
         •
        Termination of Pregnancy (TOP)
         • There is one sister for performing TOP and she is trained and
           registered
         • This sister is assisted by two students
         • If the pregnancy is over 12 weeks, the patient is referred to
           Kimberley Hospital
         • In this section there is information on the wall
         • The clinic has a paediatric department
         • Information regarding breastfeeding is on the walls
         • Management stated that there were two doctors: one every week
           and now and then two, sometimes three per week


        Dispensary
         • The supply of medicines is not good, with the result that there
           are shortages
         • There is only one fridge in the dispensary
         • The storage room is opposite the dispensary
         • There is one pharmacist
         • Three assistants assist the pharmacist
         • The clinic has only one phone, which is in the clerk’s office.
           If the clinic wants to fax documents, they have to go to
           Kimberley hospital.


      Recommendations
         • That the SC on Social Services will address the issue regarding
           the telephones and fax machines with the Department of Health.


      6.    Visit to Manne Dipico Hospital – Colesberg


      The visit to the Manne Dipico Hospital was not on the programme of the
      committee, but the committee decided to go and see the revitalization
      programme of the Department of Health, and the committee did not
      regret visiting the hospital, even though it was out of their way.


      Manne Dipico Hospital is a 45-bed hospital situated in the centre of
      Colesberg. This is a centre of best practice with multiskilled staff,
      who are able to render all the services that are being rendered by a
      level-one hospital around the clock.
      All the registered nurses are trained in primary health care, so when
      they are on duty, the sorting and assessment of clients at the
      casualty department is done by a clinical nurse practitioner.


      The hospital is committed to preventing the spread of infectious
      diseases as well as foetal alcohol syndrome, which is a major
      challenge in the province.


      The hospital renders rehabilitative services from the very first day
      of patient admission till the discharge date by talking to the
      patients and referring them to the relevant sources, e.g. social
      worker, psychologist etc. Physiotherapy as well as occupational
      therapists is available at the hospital on a three-weekly basis.


      There is a pastor in the hospital who serves as a counsellor and is
      available four hours a day for four days a week for spiritual as well
      as counselling needs. A female counsellor is available if patients
      choose to be counselled by a female.


      Forensic services are also rendered by the hospital. The forensic room
      is situated next to the casualty entrance so that patients who have
      been molested maintain their privacy and dignity by not walking
      through long hospital corridors to be seen by everybody. There is one
      forensic nurse available 24 hours per day, failing which the casualty
      nurse on duty will contact the relevant people for attention.
      Patients are seen in the forensic room, examined and all the necessary
      tests are done there. Even the police statement is taken in the same
      room by police, patients are then given a chance to bath and they are
      given a consolation box with underwear, soap, face cloth and a
      perfumed powder.


      All patients are urged to go to the primary health care centre first
      before coming to the hospital with their problems. At the primary
      health care centre they are seen by a doctor if needs be and then
      referred to the hospital. Patients who are by-passing the clinics are
      going to be charged a fee and a casualty fee. If a patient comes in
      for X–rays, be it private or public, an X-ray form must be filled in
      properly by the referring doctor.


      The management team of the hospital consists of:
         • A hospital manager
         • HR Manager
         • Finance Manager
         • Nursing Service Manager
         • Medical Officer


      An information corner is identified which will help people with any
      information they want about the hospital and the services rendered.


      An overnight facility is available at the hospital to accommodate
      people who brought their families to hospital or for people who are
      involved in motor-vehicle accidents as the area is a high accident
      zone because of the N1 road.


      For the staff, the hospital has a district psychiatry co-coordinator
      who is also excellent in the rendering of stress-related counselling
      as well as physiotherapy. Alternatively, the hospital manager is a
      trained trauma debriefer and she introduced an open-door system for
      people who feel like talking to her. Once a month the staff get
      together for a casual gathering, where there is an open floor for
      staff to talk about their problems, be it work related or otherwise.


      Tour of Manne Dipico Hospital
         • This is a level one, 45-bed hospital (35 public and 10 beds of
           choice)
         • In the high-care centre there are seven beds and there is a
           trauma centre and the manager informed the committee that the
           hospital is mercury free
         • The rates of the hospital are calculated according to the income
           of the patient
         • The manager stated that if a patient was not critical, he/she
           would be treated by the hospital, but if he/she was critical,
           he/she would be referred to either Kimberley or Bloemfontein
         • The hospital has five ambulances, which are all fully equipped,
           because of the many accidents that occur on the N1 road.
         • In 2005 the hospital was awarded the Premier’s Service
           Excellence Award
         • There is a staff room and a tea room
         • The committee observed that the equipment of the hospital is
           well equipped and that the hospital is very clean
         • One sister has undergone training in TOP in Kimberley and she is
           now busy with practical training
         • The theatre is equipped with new equipment
         • The committee also observed that suggestion boxes are visible
           through the entire hospital
         • The nurses station is near to patients to tend to them
         • The hospital is busy with the construction of a further 10 beds
           of choice

           mortuary, all in working order.
         • The autopsy room is also being utilized by SAPS


      Recommendations
      That the Manne Dipico Hospital (Colesberg) be used as model by the
      Department of Health for their revitalization programme across the
      country.


      7. Kimberley Provincial Hospital


      Background


      Kimberley Hospital has rapidly grown from a level-two facility to a
      level-three facility, rendering a variety of specialist services.
      With this expansion in service, the demand for upgrading and expansion
      of the physical infrastructure was inevitable.  This has lead to
      various portions of the building being upgraded to meet the demands in
      space and physical work areas.


      Recent infrastructure upgrading
         • The main theatre block was upgraded in 1999 in order to maximize
           activity flow and increase efficiencies in operations.
         • In 2001 major upgrading was done to the main hospital building
           and included the following areas: front gate, main reception,
           pharmacy, main hospital passage, specialist clinics and the
           establishment of a hospital radio station.
         • Soon after this, private wards were constructed, allowing all
           clinical disciplines to admit private patients and thus increase
           the opportunities for revenue generation.
         • In 2003, three new lifts were installed in the older section of
           the hospital.
         • A short-stay ward was constructed in 2003 as part of the
           accident and emergency unit.
         • A sound booth for hearing testing was installed in 2004 as part
           of the speech therapy and audiology unit.
         • Radiology department was upgraded with the installation of a CT
           scan in 2003 and a MRI in 2005.
         • Satellite pharmacy was built in 2004 to serve the specialist
           clinics.
         • Expansion of the main theatre block to five theatres.
         • Establishment of a head and neck unit, including the following
           services: ENT, Maxio-facial surgery, dentistry, Speech and
           Audiology.

      QUALITY ASSURANCE
      The Quality Assurance Department was established in 2001 after a need
      was identified to improve service delivery at Kimberley Hospital
      Complex. The receiving of numerous awards, including two Premier’s
      Awards, is evidence of success.  The activities of the department are
      as follows: -


      COMPLAINTS PROCEDURE
      Patients/clients or relatives are encouraged to “tell us their views”
      by means of either a written or a verbal complaint or compliment.
      These are posted in complaint boxes, which are strategically placed in
      every department and are collected on a daily basis, sorted out and
      acknowledged within seven days as per protocol.  All the
      complaints/compliments are handled in line with the complaints
      procedure.


      The complaints are a mechanism of the institution to encourage
      criticism or compliments from the community.  Batho Pele principles
      and the Patient’s Rights Charter are workshopped to patients and staff
      on a regular basis and are strategically placed in all the departments
      for everyone to see.


      RADIO TALK SHOWS
      Community involvement and development are imperative in this
      department and as a result radio talk shows are conducted twice weekly
      with two radio stations, viz Radio KHC, which is institutional, and
      the national radio, which is Radio Motsweding.  Experts on subject
      matter are deployed to deliberate on topics as per the National Health
      Care Calendar.


      PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT


      Ongoing in-service training is carried out on Quality Assurance
      continuously and training needs as per gap identification is addressed
      by means of in-service training with close liaison with Human Resource
      Development.


      QUALITY IMPROVEMENT
      Each and every department has a Quality Improvement representative
      acting as a resource and policing quality care issues in their
      respective units.  All these individuals are part of the Quality
      Improvement Team that is responsible for overseeing Quality
      Improvement in the Institution.  Planned inspections and spot checks
      are done randomly in the Institution at regulated intervals.


      OTHER ACTIVITIES
      The other functions that are carried out are the following: -
                 -     Clinical Audits
                 -     Patient’s Satisfaction Surveys
                 -     Process Mapping
                 -     Staff Satisfaction Surveys


      These are all carried out as a form of research to ensure that the
      department is still functioning in line with the expectations of the
      National Policy on Quality Assurance.


      C. Visit to Department of Home Affairs Office in Kuruman
      1. Northern Cape
      The Provincial Manager gave the committee a short presentation on the
      Department of Home Affairs in the Northern Cape:


      Introduction
      The Northern Cape is the largest province, but it has the smallest
      population (984 327) of all nine provinces in SA. The Northern Cape
      (NC) is divided into two subregions, namely Kimberley and Upington.
      The province has an approved establishment of 172.


      ID Status
      The presenter stated that with regard to the ID status, the number of
      IDs collected are 14 432, uncollected IDs 3 768 and the department in
      the NC travels on average 65 267km per month.


      Distribution methods for uncollected IDs
         • Posting IDs direct from Head Office(HO)
         • Priority mailing from offices to clients
         • Over-the-counter handing over of IDs to applicants
         • Door-to-door deliveries when mobiles re-visit areas e.g.
           Saturdays
         • Stakeholder cooperation through availing of distribution lists
         • Maintaining database of cellphone numbers, if available, to
           introduce SMS to clients in August 2005


      Birth on-line registration
      This service is available at Kimberley Hospital, Kuruman Hospital,
      Central Karoo Hospital (De Aar), Gordonia Hospital (Upington) and Dr
      Van Niekerk Hospital (Springbok).


      ID Campaign
      The presenter stated that five mobile units were deployed within the
      province. The Department also has relationships with various media
      sources in the NC, which include newspapers, TV, radio, etc.
      Stakeholder relationships include various political parties, e.g. ANC,
      DA, UCDP, ACDP, FF, PAC, etc., different organs of state (departments)
      and others, e.g. farm unions, Nicro, SALGA, traditional authorities,
      etc.


      Flexihours
      The Provincial Manager stated that the province embarked on a project
      ensuring that the Home Affairs Offices become more accessible to the
      public through the extension of their operational hours. He noted that
      all offices in the NC will be open to members of the public from 07:30
      until 15:30 and offices are also open on Saturdays from 08:00 until
      13:00. These working hours are all done on a voluntary basis and no
      overtime is being paid.


      Achievements include
         • Five hospitals online for birth registration
         • Counter corruption successfully – seven officials suspended
           since April 2005
         • Four multi-purpose community centres operational
         • Upgrading of IT equipment


      Challenges
         • Managing flexihours with limited staff
         • The vast distances peculiar to the Northern Cape
         • Huge vacuum in management, especially the sub-region Kimberley
           (Deputy Director, Assistant Director, three Senior
           administrative officers vacant in Kimberley)


      Northern Cape Immigration Services
      The Provincial Manager indicated to the Committee that the Northern
      Cape borders on two SADC countries namely Namibia and Botswana. The
      region consists of 12 port-control offices. The region consists of
      five internal tracing units responsible for internal tracing,
      investigations, repatriation/deportations and prosecutions.


      The Provincial Manager gave the committee a breakdown of the
      operational background of the 12 port-control offices indicating where
      they are situated, their operating hours, traveller’s statistics
      (South Africans and foreigners).


      Issues raised
         • The members raised concern regarding the deportation process.
           The provincial manager stated that the department did it
           directly, where they arranged with Botswana and Namibia. He
           further noted that if they deported to Zimbabwe, they take them
           to Lindela, from where they are deported. If the deportee is a
           Lesotho citizen, they take him/her to Bloemfontein, and from
           there to the Maseru Bridge, from where they take him/her to
           Lesotho.
         • A concern of the committee was the availability of mobile units,
           because of the province’s vastness. The Provincial Manager
           stated that the mobile units were launched in June 2004 and Head
           Office did not award any to the Northern Cape. The provincial
           manager stated that the department wanted to open a satellite
           office in Postmasburg and in Prieska, but the budget allocation
           was totally inadequate and they asked for R3m additional funds.
         • Security is done centrally from Head Office and the department
           had problems in Kimberley, but it has been solved.
         • The presenter stated that photographs remained a problem in the
           rural areas and he further noted that the department procured
           cameras, but according to the Treasury people still has to pay
           for their photographs.


      Recommendations
         • That the issue of the mobile units in the Northern Cape be
           raised and discussed with the top management of the Department
           of Home Affairs.
         • The issue of photographs is taken up with the department.


  2. Presentation by the Regional Manager: Department of Home Affairs –
     Kuruman Offices


      The presenter informed the committee on the strategies that they use
      to distribute IDs


         • They advertise their visit in the local newspaper on a weekly
           basis
         • They hold community meetings/imbizos
         • Mobiles – door to door delivery of IDs
         • Submit a list of IDs according to places to stakeholders


      The state of unclaimed IDs in the region are: Kudumane Rural Areas
      (North West) 506 IDs and Kuruman (NC areas) 427 IDs.


      With regard to the quality of service delivery, the Regional Manager
      stated that a vigorous campaign was being launched to the rural areas
      regarding the identity-document campaign. This included:
         • Proactive approach is being implemented
         • The involvement of various stakeholders
         • The distribution of the list of unclaimed IDs
         • Opening of the satellite office in Postmasburg to serve the
           surrounding areas.


      Human Resources
      The office establishment personnel structure makes provision for a
      staff component of 17 officials. The office has two teams for mobile
      units (two officials per team).


      Physical Infrastructure and equipment
      The office relocated to a new building in 2004 with new furniture, new
      vehicles and equipment. Of the new vehicles received, two are 4x4s,
      which will be used for mobile units because of the bad gravel road.


      Information Technology
      New PCs replaced old PCs. The office received 12 new PCs and eight
      printers.


      Challenges
         • The unavailable infrastructure, for instance no accommodation,
           telephone and electricity, especially in the Kudumane region
         • Places without water and toilets are not served
         • Places served by Social Services for payment are not utilized by
           Home Affairs
         • No camera films for the Lokisa Ditokomane Campaign
         • Shortage of staff
         • Shortage of user IDs for the interns


      Issues raised
         • On the issue of the relationship between the departments of
           Social Services and Home Affairs, the presenter stated that in
           cases where the mother of the child was not in possession of a
           valid ID (mother is awaiting her ID) and the grandmother had
           one, the department of Social Services would assist. The
           relationship was previously that Social Services accompany Home
           Affairs when they went out with the mobile units.
         • The Regional Managers stated that there was sufficient security
           at the offices, e.g. alarm system.
         • The presenter further noted that the staff was made aware of the
           risks involved in fraud and corruption and they have regular
           meetings to discuss these issues.
         • The office constantly monitors the time spent in the queues and
           all officials at the four points cover most of the services
           rendered by the department. In the office there are “floor
           workers” as well, who assist patrons to ascertain what services
           they require.


      Recommendations:
         • That the relationship with the department of Social Services has
           to be strengthened again. That the Regional Manager and her
           counterpart in Social Services must begin talks and starts
           implementing strategies.
         • With regard to the number of Ports of Entry, the committee
           stated that it was up to them to make a proper study if
           necessary to determine whether this number of Ports of Entry is
           really needed.


      3. Meeting with Department of Home Affairs Offices – Kimberley
      The Regional Manager stated that the office is ideally situated in the
      CBD and close to a taxi rank. The office operates on a daily basis
      from 07h30 – 15h30 and on Saturdays from 08h00 to 13h00. The office
      opened a fixed service point in Galeshewe and this is a fullyfledged
      office.


      The presenter informed the committee on how fraud can occur and the
      prevention of fraud methods on the following: marriages, identity
      documents, passports, migration, and finance/face value.


      With regard to risk management, staff are rotated every year to curb
      officials manipulating the system to their advantage. Staff is
      continuously exposed to training. The applicant must collect the
      identity document personally and if that is not possible, the
      applicant must give written permission that the bearer of the letter
      can collect the document.


      The presenter stated that the office has five vacant posts and six
      posts of which the officials are on suspension. Two of the clerk posts
      are permanently placed at the Galeshewe Safety Centre. She further
      noted that the remaining staff must be applauded as they are
      performing their duties and the vacant and suspended officials’ duties
      on a daily basis without complaint. The proposed office in Prieska is
      in the pipeline and the staff establishment was allocated, but the
      funding is still awaited.


      Information Technology
         • All the old mainframe computers were upgraded to new systems and
           a total of 13 systems were received.
         • There is an IT technician that assists all the offices as far as
           Springbok. Previously the office had to contact Head Office and
           wait for a technician to be called out.
         • Six officials in the office has access to e-mail facilities
         • The department moved over to a new system regarding user IDs and
           this is the log-on system for every official open for the
           mainframe.


      Challenges
         • The suspensions of officials place a heavy burden on the office
         • The low staff morale after the arrests and subsequent
           suspensions
         • No overtime is paid to officials


      Issues raised
         • With regard to the registration of births, the department stated
           that, because many of the people cannot give the names of the
           children in the hospital (where they have to consult with other
           family members) these mothers are given a return date to
           register and they pre-complete the form.
         • On the issue of foreign marriages, the presenter stated that
           they first bring the couple to the immigration officer to
           conduct an information session and after this an intensive
           interview is held at the residence of the couple. Every year the
           immigration officer checks to make sure that the couple is
           living together. If the Department is not happy with the
           situation the couple are de-registered. The presenter stated
           that the rate declined after the suspension of the officials.
         • The presenter stated that six officials were suspended and more
           than 20 people were arrested. The marriages of those people
           involved were declared null and void. The presenter stated that
           Pakistanis and Bangladeshis were mostly involved in these
           fraudulent marriages. There were under-cover police at the
           office to collect evidence.
         • Officials were bought from Upington to assist in Kimberley for
           two months. The presenter stated that during the winter the
           situation was worse when, for example, up to nine people were
           off sick on a particular day. She further noted that the office
           had five Senior Administrative Officers and now has only one and
           the office is trying to get stability.
         • The presenter stated that there was no compromising of user-IDs
           in the Kimberley District Offices. Officials in the Kimberley
           Office are rotated and multiskilled.
         • With regard to the mobile unit in Prieska, the Provincial
           Manager stated that a lot had been done and a memo has been sent
           two months ago and reminders have been sent as well.
         • The Provincial Manager stated that officials worked voluntarily
           on Saturdays. The officials are rotated every week and at the
           counters they perform all functions.
         • The Provincial Manager stated he was not assisted by, for
           example, a Deputy Director to manage the Northern Cape.


      Recommendations
         • That the issue of the mobile units be addressed with the
           Department of Home Affairs.
         • That officials working overtime be raised and discussed with the
           Department of Home Affairs.
         • The issue of middle managers be taken up with the department
         • The issue of no assistance to the provincial director (Deputy
           Director)


      WAY FORWARD


         • The committee will undertake follow-up visits to the province,
           in order to provide oversight and monitor progress made with
           regard to some of the challenges raised by stakeholders during
           the oversight visit.
         • The committee will take up some of the issues raised with the
           Department of Health and will continue to provide oversight on
           departmental strategic plans to ensure that the relevant issues
           are taken up in strategic and operational plans.


      Report to be considered.
