The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon members, I am informed that we won’t have
motions today. I will therefore ask the Secretary to read the first Order

                             APPROPRIATION BILL


                    (Consideration of Votes and Schedule

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon members, I have been informed that there

Vote No 15 – Education – put.

Declarations of Vote:

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I propose that we conduct the
business of declarations like we did the previous year for time management
purposes because it’s not a long speech. We agreed to this in the
multiparty Whips, meeting. It will take two minutes, which we can make in
record time from the seats where we are seated so that we don’t move up and
down to the podium. That’s the suggestion.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I think that is agreed. You can address us
from where you are, Mr Thetjeng.

Mr O M THETJENG: Chairperson, education prioritisation shows poor planning.
A sizeable number of schools across the country do not have adequate
facilities to qualify to be called schools. The President has requested in
the state of the nation address that classes conducted under trees and in
unacceptable structures like mud huts and shacks must be eliminated as a
matter of urgency. This was not achieved despite money remaining unspent.

Teachers across the country continue to be employed on a temporary basis,
up to ten years or even more. The ANC-controlled government has passed
labour laws, which they failed to implement, thus denying these wonderful
teachers job security. Where are the teachers’ unions that claim to
represent them; or have they become part of the ANC government, forgetting
about their members? “Phiri ya mekoka mabedi e pharoga noka!” [A double-
minded man will never succeed!]

This will eventually knock on the door of the ANC-led government, sooner or
later. To whom should these laws apply; to private companies only or both
private and public entities? “Hupfi li takala li tshi koka lingwe didingwe
li tshi kokwa li ri mavhala anga!” [They say one enjoys harming someone
else, but when the same is done to one, one complains.]

Who is fooling who, and for what good reason? The DA will not support this
Budget Vote. Thank you, Chairperson.

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Chairperson, I think I rise in support of this Budget Vote
on Education - just to say that it reminds me of what happened before 1994.
Before the ANC came into power we had a very fragmented education system in
South Africa. We had almost 19 departments of education and when we were
elected into power it was then, of course, our responsibility and duties to
make sure that we have a nonracial and nonsexist society in South Africa.
We are in the process of transforming South Africa even as far as education
is concerned.

It makes sense to me today here that the DA is very uncomfortable with the
progress that we have made as far as education is concerned. With these few
words the ANC supports this Vote with a big smile on its face. I thank you.
[Applause.]

Vote accordingly agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the
Constitution.

Vote No 16 - Health – put.

Declarations of Vote:

Mr O M THETJENG: Chairperson, the story of beetroot, cabbage, garlic, olive
oil and many other vegetables being branded every day as the most needed
nutrition in one’s body has been taught throughout the ages by our
teachers. Every person who has gone through school is well aware of this;
if not, then you must go back to the classroom and be properly taught.

These products and the vitamins promoted by Matthias Rath of the Dr Rath
Health Foundation cannot replace the antiretroviral drugs. The DA has never
propagated a story that says these drugs cure HIV/Aids, but they can extend
the life of the sufferer thereby ensuring that infected mothers and fathers
are able to take care of their children much longer and avoid making them
orphans at an early stage of their lives.

These drugs will prevent the spread of HIV/Aids from the pregnant mothers
infected by this dreaded disease to newly born babies. This will cut the
number of children infected by this disease.
We call for the full roll-out of these drugs in all the corners of this
country, and that infected pregnant mothers be prioritised.

Hospitals such as the Pretoria Academic were constructed without proper
planning. As of February 2005, this hospital stands completed, without
equipment. Therefore, the DA will oppose this Budget Vote. Thank you,
Chairperson.

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: The IFP, though it supports the Budget Vote, has these
declarations to be noted: Firstly, the Department of Health is faced with
many challenges, which are daily crippling and strangling the quality care
supposed to be given to all patients.

Secondly, the highly qualified hospital staff members leave the country in
droves to serve other countries abroad for better salaries and other
privileges experienced internationally. We need more resources to curb this
erosion which destroys our hospitals’ smooth functioning on a daily basis.

Thirdly, hospital equipment needs more resources for maintenance, upgrading
and old equipment to be replaced to facilitate work performance. Fourthly,
the HIV/Aids pandemic, to be managed well, needs more funds for better home-
based care facilities, ARV roll-out and so on. Finally, better salaries and
incentives to overpressured, hard working hospital staff, doctors and
nurses, including all paramedics.

The Health budget presented is too far from achieving all these essentials.
Thank you, Chairperson.

Mr T S SETONA: Chairperson, the 27 April 1994 democratic breakthrough
marked a new chapter of ridding our society of all forms of human
deprivation, including the deprivation of the right to health.

The World Health Organisation has declared health to be a fundamental human
right. In this regard the ANC-led government, in the pursuit of this
international principle and the vision of the Freedom Charter, has
succeeded to make the provision of free medical care and hospitalisation
available to vulnerable sections of our people – children and pregnant
women.

Through the comprehensive strategy against HIV/Aids, the department has
allocated more resources to ensure that prevention, care and support for
the ongoing research for the cure of this disease is intensified.

We further welcome the department’s aggressive programme of promoting a
positive lifestyle that will go a long way in preventing many diseases that
continue to inflict our people. I therefore rise on behalf of the ANC to
support this Budget Vote. Thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

Vote accordingly agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the
Constitution.

Vote No 17 - Labour – put.

Declarations of Vote:

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: The IFP, though supporting the Budget Vote, has these
declarations: Firstly, unemployment is high in this country – about 40%.
More money is needed to create employment opportunities to the masses of
unemployed people; and secondly, demonstrations by unions show instability
as more workers lose their jobs when some firms close down or when workers
are retrenched.

These demonstrations also scare away would-be investors and business
companies who are interested in creating work opportunities in this
country.

The budget for this department will not be able to achieve all the above-
mentioned. Thank you, Chairperson.

Ms P M THEMBA: Chairperson, . . . “ngisukuma nekusekela ibudget yeLitiko
Letemisebenti. Uma ngabe . . . “  [I rise to support the budget of the
Department of Labour. If . . .]

If the hon member from the IFP was a member who attended meetings, she
would recall that yesterday we were briefed on the strategic plan of the
department, and if she were there she could have understood that the Budget
Vote will be in a position to solve all that she is raising, and that the
plans are about what she is expecting. Thank you, Chairperson.

Vote agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution
(Democratic Alliance and Freedom Front Plus dissenting).

Vote No 18 - Social Development – put.

Declarations of Vote:

Me H LAMOELA: Mnr die Voorsitter, die Departement van Maatskaplike
Ontwikkeling is een van die sterkste pilare van hulp en verligting vir
armes, tog ook een van die mees korrupte. Die baie hoë persentasie van
korrupsie, veral onder amptenare van die departement, is betreurenswaardig
en dit is skokkend om te vind dat dit juis dié persone wie in posisies van
vertroue geplaas is om die armes se ellende te help verlig, die grootste
sondebokke is.

Die NRO’s is in die lewe geroep om armoede te verlig en ‘n beter lewe aan
werkloses en armes te bied. Die regering se aksie van vermindering van
toelaes aan NRO’s kan in hierdie stadium ‘n rampspoedige uitwerking hê op
die bewerkstellig van ‘n beter lewe vir betrokkenes.

Welsynwerkers, wat gegradueerdes insluit en een van die baie belangrike
bronne van die Welsyn Departement uitmaak, gaan steeds gebuk onder karige
salarisse en werksomstandighede wat die beroep geensins aantreklik vir
belangstellendes maak nie.

Toelaes vir kinders onder 13 jaar is die beste aansporing vir  jong  meisies
om verwagtend te raak. Waarom ontneem die  staat  die  verpligting  van  die
betrokke vaders wat hierdie kinders verwek  het,  om  self  hul  kinders  te
onderhou? ‘n Basiese inkomste toelae sal ‘n groter bate  vir  kinders  wees.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Ms H LAMOELA: Mr Chairperson, the Department of Social Development  is  one
of the strongest pillars of support and relief for the poor,  yet  also  one
of  the  most  corrupt.  The  extremely  high  percentage   of   corruption,
particularly among officials in the department, is  regrettable  and  it  is
shocking to find that it  is  precisely  these  people  who  are  placed  in
positions of trust to help relieve the suffering of the  poor  who  are  the
greatest scoundrels.

The NGOs were called into existence to help relieve poverty and  to  provide
a better life for the unemployed and poor. At  this  time  the  government’s
actions of reducing grants to NGOs could only  have  a  catastrophic  effect
with regard to achieving better life for all those concerned.

Social workers, which includes graduates, who are one of the very  important
resources of the Department of Social Development,  are  still  burdened  by
meagre salaries and working conditions that do not in  the  least  make  the
occupation attractive to those who are interested in it.

Grants for children under 13 years are the best incentive for young girls
to fall pregnant. Why does the state take away from the fathers, who begot
these children, the obligation to support their own children? A basic
income grant would be a greater asset for children.]

The DA does not support the Budget Vote. Thank you, Chairperson.

Ms J MASILO: Modulasetulo, difofu ga di bone; di batla dithobane tse tshweu
gore di bone tsela mo Lefapheng la rona la Katlaatleloloago le
Tekanyetsokabo ya lone. Re e ema nokeng go tlala seatla. [Chairperson,
blind people cannot see, they need white walking sticks so that they can
“see” the road. We support the Department of Social Services and its
budget.]

South Africa cannot realise the goal of peace and stability whilst the
masses of the population – women and children in particular - are subjected
to hunger and whilst the few live with an abundance of resources.

Our comprehensive social security programme rolled out by the Department of
Social Development through a myriad of grants is amongst the best in the
developing countries.

We welcome the initiative by the Minister to call for amnesty for people
who voluntarily declared – more than 60 000 of them – receipt of grants
whilst they were not entitled to them. This has saved the department lots
of money that can be directed to rightful beneficiaries. The social
security agency will go a long way in creating efficient and integrated
management and delivery of grants.
The ANC fully supports the Budget Vote with a smile. Thank you,
Chairperson. [Applause.]

Vote accordingly agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the
Constitution.

Vote No 19 – Sport and Recreation South Africa – put.
Vote agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution
(Democratic Alliance and Freedom Front Plus dissenting).

Vote No 20 – Correctional Services – put.
Vote agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution
(Democratic Alliance dissenting).

Vote No 21 – Defence – put.
Vote agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution (Freedom
Front Plus and Democratic Alliance dissenting).

Ms A N T MCHUNU: Chairperson, I am rising on Vote 21 – Correctional
Services. A while ago the Department of Correctional Services experienced
problems regarding overtime coupled with remuneration . . .
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Are you rising on a point of order, hon
Chief Whip?

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, on a point of order: We have
already gone beyond Vote 21. We would advise that parties be vigilant so
that they exercise their constitutional right to make declarations of vote
or objections, or call for a division at the appropriate time, because once
you slip through your breakfast and you wake up during lunch-time you
cannot then demand that your breakfast be put on the table.

Vote No 22 – Independent Complaints Directorate – put.
Vote agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution
(Democratic Alliance dissenting).

Vote No 23 - Justice and Constitutional Development – put.

Declarations of Vote:

Mr M A MZIZI: Chairperson, we support the Budget Vote. We know that the
problems we have had in the past regarding magistrates’ salaries are
receiving attention. However, I would like to hear whether the department
is going to be in a position to shoulder the burden of the magistrates’
merit awards. The reason is that the policy regarding these awards has not
been repealed, and therefore we would like to know how are we going to go
pass that hurdle. Thank you, Sir.

The CHAIRPERSON OF NCOP: I hope that is not a question, but a declaration
of vote.

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, I want to express my appreciation for the
support of the IFP. They were not just making a statement; they supported
this Budget Vote.

It is of note that our Bench, some years back, was lily-white, but now it
reflects the demography of this country. Any person can now approach any
magistrate and get the same treatment, regardless of his colour or race.
So, on that note, having been supported by the IFP, the ANC supports this
Budget Vote. Thank you.

Vote agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution
(Democratic Alliance dissenting).

Vote No 24 - Safety and Security – put.

Declarations of Vote:

Ms S J LOE: Hon Chair, as the official opposition the DA finds it
impossible to support this Vote while serious crime remains at unacceptably
high levels.

The notorious Resolution 7, which has led to police being redeployed on the
basis of race, has led to added stress amongst members of SAPS. It has also
led to even poorer service delivery to the public. Police members who have
found themselves in a strange police station are understandably lacking in
local knowledge. Very often, simple communication is a problem because no
thought has been given to the fact that some police cannot speak, read or
write in the language of the communities they have been redeployed to
serve.

Poor pay obviously now also leads to low morale and poor service delivery.
There still exists either shortages of vital equipment in SAPS or a poorly
managed allocation of resources, such as response vehicles and bulletproof
vests. Individual police members still attest to the fact that if they
don’t personally repair their state vehicles - which they can’t do, it’s
against regulations, but they do - there would be even less cars available
to them.

Forensic laboratories, child protection units and detective services are
understaffed and undertrained, therefore, they underperform. In the case of
forensic laboratories, they are simply unable to process evidence quickly
enough and this leads to acquittals and low conviction rates.

Lastly, there is still an ongoing battle to get annual crime statistics,
which should be readily available to the public, out of the government.
Therefore, the DA does not support this Vote.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, on a point of order: The hon
member made reference to an official opposition, which we don’t have in the
House. That statement will have to be corrected.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Yes, actually we don’t have an official
opposition in this House, Ms Loe. Just say DA.

Ms S J LOE: I did say DA as well.

Mnu M A MZIZI: Sihlalo, yize i-IFP iyixhasa le voti yesabiwomali soMnyango
wezokuPhepha nokuVikela kodwa kukhona okuncane okusalayo esifisa
ukukuphawula. Uma sizwa ngamahebezi, kukhona inkulumo ethi uphiko lwe-
Scorpion luzodidiyelwa ndawonye namaphoyisa emnyangweni kaNgqongqoshe.
Inkinga ye-IFP ukuthi amalungu ophiko lwe-Scorpion ahola iholo eliphezulu.
Uma le nkulumo iphumelela, udaba lwamaholo luyoba yinkinga. (Translation of
isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[Mr M A MZIZI: Chairperson, although the IFP supports this Budget Vote of
the Department of Safety and Security, we still want to make submissions on
a few outstanding issues. We heard rumours that there is a proposal to
integrate the Scorpions with the department of the hon Minister. The
problem of the IFP is that the Scorpions are earning high salaries. Should
this move be a success, the issue of salaries will be a problem.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, on a point of order: In reality
there is a commission, which is still investigating whether the Scorpions
have to be integrated, restructured or stand alone. So, it is a matter that
is still sub judice, and I think it is not in order or parliamentary for us
to make statements in the House about rumours which are circulating in the
media.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Well, I don’t think it’s sub judice because
it’s not before the courts. It’s a commission, but you can make a
statement.

Mnu M A MZIZI: Ngiyabonga sihlalo ngokungivikela. Uma ngabe kwenzeka-ke
lolu daba luqhubeka, kungenzeka kuze kufikelele ekutheni kusiwane
ezinkantolo. Besithanda-ke ukuthi sikhulume kusemanje ukuthi akuhlinzekelwe
lokhu uma ngabe kwenzeka ukuze singangeni enkingeni. (Translation of
isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[Mr M A MZIZI: Thank you, Chairperson, for your protection. If this matter
continues, there is a likelihood of having it going into litigation. We are
therefore encouraging debate at this stage so that we could find a
mechanism to address this problem when it occurs in order to avoid further
problems.]

Mr Z C NTULI: Chairperson, firstly, I would like to say that transformation
is a process; transformation is not an event. So    “. . . mayelana nalezi
zinto ezikhulunywa u-Shirley Loe, okokuqala akayi emihlanganweni yekomidi
kodwa ufika nje ngalelo langa uma ezwa kuthanda yena.” [. . . in relation
to what Shirley Loe said, in the first place she does not attend committee
meetings, although she comes once in a while when she likes.]

So, whatever we discuss, she is not there and I’m surprised that the DA is
delegating her to represent them . . .

. . . ngoba angazi noma bayazi yini ukuthi akezi emihlanganweni yekomidi.
[Uhleko.] Okwesibili, baba uMzizi, uphiko lwe-Scorpions lungaphansi
koMnyango wezobuLungiswa nokuThuthukiswa koMthethosisekelo okwamanje.
Mhlawumbe bekuzoba ngcono ukuba ufake lesi sikhalo sakho kuwona umnyango
hhayi lapha eMnyangweni wezokuPhepha nokuVikela. Ngiyabonga Sihlalo. I-ANC
iyaseseka isabiwomali. [Ihlombe.] (Translation of isiZulu paragraph
follows.)

[. . . because I do not know whether or not they know that she does not
attend committee meetings. [Laughter.] Secondly, hon Mzizi, the Scorpions
fall under the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development . . .
Constitution now. It would have been better if you had lodged your concern
with that department, not with the Department of Safety and Security. Thank
you, Chairperson, the ANC supports this Budget Vote.] [Applause.]]

Vote agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

Vote agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

Vote No 27 - Environmental Affairs and Tourism – put.
Vote agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

Vote No 28 - Housing – put.

Declarations of Vote:

Mr G R KRUMBOCK: The DA supports the principle of subsidised state housing
for the poor and the marginalised of our communities. However, it is a
cause of profound disquiet when increased budget allocations do not result
in increased housing delivery, which has been the case for a number of
years now.

The department and other housing agencies have disclosed that there are
numerous housing projects across the country dating as far back as 1996
that have yet to be completed, which seriously calls into question the
department’s statement that they have delivered more than 1,6 million
houses.

Even though more than 1,6 million subsidies have been paid, it is clear
that the number of subsidies paid out does not correspond to the actual
number of houses constructed. This is, after all, why the Minister has
launched yet another audit in what she coyly calls “blocked projects”.

The mooted increase to the NHBRC warranty scheme to above 1,3% is a
crippling blow to home owners who will have to absorb even higher costs
caused by bad building practices. Instead of ensuring that bad builders are
penalised, this cost is being passed on to all home owners to the benefit
of the banking industry. The DA does not support the Housing budget.

Ms A N T MCHUNU: Chair, goals have been set to address the problems of
housing in this country. There is no doubt that the department has suffered
a lot with structures being built halfway or not completed and tenders
disappearing, causing housing backlogs.

We are faced with three problems: firstly, people who needed houses had to
go to Thubelitsha; secondly, people on the waiting list also had to get
houses; thirdly, people were evicted by banks, because they no longer had
subsidies, and they were stranded. Is this budget going to be enough to
meet all of this? Thank you.

Mr Z C NTULI: Chairperson, I think it is a pity and embarrassing for the DA
and the IFP, in the first place, to make such declarations. Perhaps it is
important for us to remind them that during the Budget Vote debate they in
actual fact supported the Vote. It seems that they suffer from selective
amnesia. [Laughter.]

Perhaps it is important for those who object to the Vote to remember once
more that South Africa is different today. Today life is different;
millions of our people have houses that have been built, they have got
sanitation that has been provided and proper infrastructure that has been
put in place.

It is a pity that Mr Krumbrock, even during the briefing by the department
on their strategic plan, was not present. As if what we have done is not
enough, our Minister has informed us of government’s vision for 2014. She
announced a human settlement plan. The fundamental objective is to do away
with informal settlements in order for our people to live in dignity, and
of course that particular dignity must be restored, since it has been
destroyed by the DA during their apartheid era governance. [Interjections.]

In any case, I’m not surprised by the attitude of the DA, to them it is
important for our people to be housed in shacks; to them it is important
for our people to live far from their workplaces. [Interjections.] It is
obviously painful for the DA to see progress in regard to housing provision
in our country. [Interjections.] Our people are tired of living in ghettos;
our people are tired of using ghetto communal toilets; our people are
tired, of course . . . [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Give the member time to speak please!

Mr Z C NTULI: Chair, may I take the opportunity to invite the DA leaders to
Phuthanang settlement in Galeshewe, where people have recently been given
houses; to Donkerhoek, where our people have just recently been given
houses; to Mataleng, where all the people living in poor areas have
recently been given decent houses - and let them go and tell our people
that the ANC has not delivered. I don’t think that they will last there for
even more than a minute, because our people will never agree with them.
[Interjections.] Therefore, as the ANC, we support the Budget Vote.

Declarations of Vote:


Mnu M A MZIZI: Sihlalo, kuseyikho lokho ukuthi i-IFP iyalixhasa iVoti
lezokuThutha. Kodwa kubalulekile ukuthi sithumele umyalezo kumnyango ukuze
lokhu kungasileli emuva, ngesimo leso phela esazi kahle ukuthi siwudaba
oluwundabuzekwayo – uhlelo lwe-recapitalisation.

Kuwudaba olwaziwayo ukuthi lo mkhankaso uzothatha imali eningi ngenkathi
izikorokoro ziphindiswa kuhulumeni, ezithenga. Kodwa okukhulu kakhulu
ukuthi nezinqola ezisezintsha nje impela kuthiwa zizolinganiswa naleyo mali
yezikorokoro. Lokho-ke kungase kudale ukusuka komkhulu umsindo uma lolu
daba lungabuyekezwa kahle ukuze wonke umuntu aneliswe ngoba phela inqola
entsha nendala ngeke zilinganiswe nje bese kuthiwa abantu bazonikwa imali
eyi-R50 000 ngokulingana.

Yilokho esikubonayo ukuthi kungahle kususe umsindo. Ngakho-ke sicela ukuthi
uma lolu daba lucubungulwa, lubuyekezwe kahle ukuze imali yanele
ukukhokhela bonke laba bantu. (Translation of isiZulu speech follows.)

[Mr M A MZIZI: Chairperson, as usual the IFP supports the Budget Vote for
Transport. It is important to send a message to the department so that this
matter, the issue of recapitalisation that is mostly talked about these
days, is not left out.

It is well known that this campaign will cost the government more money if
the government buys scrapped vehicles. It does not sound right to equate
the price of scrapped vehicles with that of new vehicles. This will lead to
confrontation if this matter is not addressed and reviewed to the
satisfaction of everyone, because one cannot equate new vehicles and
scrapped ones by giving R50 000 across the board.

This is what we suspect could cause chaos. We therefore ask that this
matter be reviewed and properly addressed so that money is made available
to pay these people.]

[Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson, the ANC supports this budget. Although the ANC
supports it, this is not the only issue about which there are negotiations
between the ruling party and the public transport sector concerning the
recapitalisation process in the taxi industry. However, this will only be
successful if the two bodies could reach consensus. For this reason it is
not for us to oppose what the negotiations are all about. The ANC supports
this Budget Vote wholeheartedly.

  CONSIDERATION OF APPROPRIATION BILL AND OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE OF
                               FINANCE THEREON

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Thank you very much, Chairperson, hon Members. I
have observed how the acceptance of the Second Reading debate and
Appropriation Bill has gone. I think it is necessary to ask members of this
House to look into themselves and ask what the most appropriate way of
engaging in this debate is. Sure, this is ritual; but if the appropriation
of resources in this country is left to ritual then I think we have failed
democracy fundamentally.

Of course, the one route is that we can just carry on like we have done
today and divide the House, and the other is a more constructive engagement
that I truly would plead for. The fact of the matter is that as we stand
here now, some 62 days into the new fiscal year, the key question before
the members of this distinguished House is how the money is going to be
spent.

And then again, there are two routes you can take. The one route is to wait
until the Auditor-General has reported on the spending for the current year
and that report would probably be available maybe in the beginning of 2007.
By then nothing would have happened in the lives of people, and members of
this distinguished House can be satisfied that they have waited until the
Auditor-General’s report has come.

The other route is, of course, to be more engaging on the issues. I have
heard what members have said about the adequacy of finances, I heard the
hon member from the IFP speak on a number of Votes. You see, money helps;
it doesn’t cure problems. Problems are cured by oversight. Part of what we
have in South Africa is an arrangement where members of Parliament have
more information available than in almost any other country in the world.

On a monthly basis we publish, in terms of section 32 of the PFMA, actual
expenditures. With great respect, hon Chairperson, I don’t know that this
House, actually . . . the hon Ralane is where? Oh. I don’t know that this
House takes due care and attention about actual expenditures; not waiting
until the fiscal year has passed. We have allocated resources, we have
reported. This is the NCOP, I think I should ask all of those members who
objected here, all of those members who have made declarations, all of the
members who voted, all of the members who have acted in the way that they
did because they have exercised their democratic right here today, what
enquiries they have taken on the reports that we have placed before this
House on underspending on infrastructure in the provinces?

It is not for the press, it is for this House. It is for the NCOP that
ignores, time and again, the information that they have at their disposal.
My pleading is for more direct engagement with the Budget. We all have
constituencies, wherever they may be. The hon member from the DA can talk
about the shape of school buildings, wherever the schools aren’t being
built - where you are, sir, look in the mirror and say: I have a problem.

Because you are a member of Parliament, you have an oversight
responsibility. Your oversight responsibility is the same as that of
members of the ANC. We favour this House, from time to time, with a lot of
detailed information. I am going to come here time and again. I am going to
get up and complain about the fact that the information that is generated
is not to keep public servants busy, but so that this House can exercise
its oversight function. It is not being used by this House.

I will do it time and again. I will face their wrath and members will say
bad things about me. If I can’t do it the Deputy Minister will do it. But
we will come here time and again and say, my comrades, my friends, my
colleagues, where are you? That is your responsibility. That is your
oversight responsibility. That is the relationship that we must have
between you as members of the legislature, and ourselves as members of the
executive.

One of these days we will come to this House with an intergovernmental
fiscal review. That IGFR which we’ve brought here, every year since 1997,
will speak to this House again, not just to fill the nights when people
can’t fall asleep, but to ask members to have the information, to use the
information, to exercise their rights so that we can see that democracy
functions.

When we come, please don’t treat it as a surprise. Please don’t treat us as
though you would like us to be out of the House as soon as possible because
we stand between you and the other things that you might do. Please, treat
that intergovernmental fiscal review with the seriousness that it deserves.
I think that our people deserve the best democracy, and we plead with
members of this House to exercise it.

This passage of the Appropriation Bill Second Reading debate here this
afternoon is an important part of that, but it is all of the other details
that happen between now and the next Budget, which will serve, probably, on
24 February in the National Assembly 2006. It is what happens in the
interregnum that determines the quality of democracy that our people have.
Thank you very much, Chair. [Applause.]

Mr M C GOEIEMAN: Chairperson, it’s so difficult to speak after the
Minister. The select committee has noted the following: That the present
South African government under the guidance of the ANC delivered its 12th
Budget on the 23 February 2005.

The economy grew by 3,7% in 2004 and it is set to grow by 4,3% in 2005. The
2005 Budget takes us up on another rung of the ladder of the social and
economic progress. Additional expenditure on social services, such as the
child support grant, education, land restitution, health and housing is
unprecedented.

The early announcement of transfers by the National Treasury to local
government and municipalities is a fine demonstration of our continual
involvement in intergovernmental fiscal relations. Housing is an
environment that supports social cohesion and access to transport linkages
and other basic services. We need to reduce the level of crime,
particularly violent crime, so that communities can feel secure and
confident to go to school or work.

The 2005 Budget is noted for its redistributive character because it
channels more resources to the poor through rising social grants, and
higher spending on municipal and social services and community
infrastructure such as water and sanitation, school, clinics, multipurpose
centres, police stations and roads.

In order to provide the Freedom Charter with tangible legitimacy, members
of this House must be serious in exercising its oversight responsibilities.
The Select Committee on Finance will inspect the following intensely: the
monthly reports of actual revenue and expenditure with regard to the
national revenue, quarterly reports of provincial treasury, annual reports
and strategic plans of national and provincial departments, reports of the
Auditor-General and midyear budgetary assessment reports of municipalities.

Moreover, an oversight responsibility calls for an examination of
performance against measurable objectives. Reports submitted by the
departments and municipalities must not leave information to the
imagination of the reader. Reports should provide details such as project
name, location, and type of structure, number of units, project duration,
completion date and project cost. The monitoring processes adopted by the
departments and municipalities will also be questioned.

The select committee therefore congratulates the National Treasury of South
Africa, once again, for fulfilling with distinction, not only its
constitutional responsibility, but also its mandate. The select committee
therefore recommends that this House endorse the 2005 Appropriation Budget
Vote. I thank you, Chairperson.

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Thank you very much, Chairperson and hon members.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the report be agreed to.

Declarations of Vote:

Ms D ROBINSON: Hon Chair, hon Mr Manuel, and members, one of the greatest
challenges facing South Africa today is its high rate of unemployment. Ten
years into our democracy, more than eight million people - more than 40% of
the workforce - are looking for work, or, having failed, have given up
trying. Now many of them have take to the streets in protest.

Because of this national crisis the DA indicated its support for the Budget
in the Appropriation Bill because it appeared to be redistributive and
expansionary. We welcomed the personal and corporate tax cuts, which should
lead to further increases in consumer spending.

The stronger infrastructure of spending R6 billion at national, provincial
and municipal levels added to the expansionary thrust. This is without
deviating too much from the accepted deficit level of 3% of GDP. This
deficit, however, was calculated prior to the additional revenue windfall
of R10 million, produced two weeks after the Budget, which reduced the real
deficit to about 1,6%.

Given this lower deficit level, it has become clear that the Budget should
have included bolder tax reforms, particularly in respect of an effective
tax rate on companies. Instead of having ad hoc adjustments to the
corporate tax rate, government should set a target corporate tax rate of
say 25% and a time period over which it should be implemented. This would
have an immediate and powerful effect on investment and therefore the
creation of jobs.

We also repeat our call for further incentives for large-scale job creation
at the lower end of the skills chain. Noting that provinces and
municipalities spent only 46% of their capital budget last year, we urge
the state to increase their capacity for infrastructural expenditure.
Private sector capital should be mobilised to help persuade the market that
the state is serious about harnessing the efficiency and service delivery
credentials of private enterprise.

This is entirely in keeping with the possible new paradigm shift presented
in the ANC’s recent discussion document, “Development and
Underdevelopment”. This is a pragmatic document, which places DA economic
policies at the heart of South Africa’s political economic discourse and
proposes interventions, which would set the preconditions for market-led
growth.

The implementation of these policies will fuel economic growth and will
help to create employment. This also proves the value of having a strong
opposition, which has provided constructive alternatives.
Thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

Mr K SINCLAIR: What we have experienced in the recent past when discussing
this Bill was not just about appropriation, money or figures; it was about
hope, aspirations, dreams, and about delivering on the mandate.

During this debate one important aspect came to the fore: Where does a
political party stand on the principles of the Freedom Charter, and what is
reflected therein? A very unfortunate incident happened recently when a
senior leader of the DA apparently said, and I quote “The Freedom Charter
is a party-political pamphlet”. That remark is a politically naive,
politically disgusting and it is bizarre to think that any senior
politician in South Africa doesn’t understand the dynamics of the politics
in this country. He should know that it is the will of the people that we
are conceptualising in the first place, but secondly, that its
implementation is only taking place 50 years after the document was
accepted.

So, what we are experiencing is either you are for the Freedom Charter
principles, or you are against it. The NNP, because we support the
principles of the Freedom Charter - but also with the principles of the
Constitution -  supports the Bill. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr T RALANE: The freedom of an economy, which meets the needs of
the people in an equitable manner, goes back to the Freedom Charter of
1955. This vision we articulated in the Reconstruction and Development
Programme of 1994 and it is also embodied in our Constitution. These
documents must be viewed as the continuation of the Freedom Charter albeit
within a more detailed context. The Freedom Charter did not end with its
adoption in 1955. In fact, it is the beacon for further struggles and
serves as a standard by which to judge our performance.

The redistributive character of the 2005 national Budget and its spending
on social services, which benefit the poorest segment of our population,
gives legitimacy to the claims of the Freedom Charter. The ANC calls on the
NCOP to endorse and support the 2005 Appropriation Bill. I thank you.
[Applause.]

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.


                          SPECIAL COMMITTEE MEETING


                               (Announcement)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Thank you very much. I think members are
very much aware, as indicated on the programme, that we will have the
committee of the whole House immediately after the plenary and this will
not take long either. It will just be for a record period of time, like we
did with the Appropriation Bill. The Chairperson of Committees will handle
it, together with her deputy. So members are requested to remain within the
Chamber so that we can conclude the other business of the House. Thank you.

The Council adjourned at 15:12.
