<p>First Order read: Adjourned debate on motion for Second Reading, &#x2014;Publications and</p>

<p>Entertainments Bill, to be resumed.</p>

<p>[Debate on motion by the Minister of the Interior, upon which an amendment had been moved by Mr. Durrant, adjourned on 29 January, resumed.]</p>

<speech by="#potgieter">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before the debate was adjourned yesterday, I accused the United Party of always travelling in <span class="col_431-432" refersTo="page_0230"/>reverse gear when we have important legislation before the House. In the case of this legislation too which is regarded on all sides as being necessary and which should have been passed by this House a long time ago, the United Party is again moving in reverse after having made a swift about-face. The United Party members on the Select Committee assisted in passing a unanimous resolution that there should be control over undesirable publications and that steps should be taken in this regard. Now the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) has stated that there is a world of difference between that unanimous resolution of the Select Committee, namely, that action should be taken against undesirable publications, and this measure. Let us take it that that is so, that they accepted the principle that action should be taken against undesirable publications and that they support it wholeheartedly, but that they cannot agree with the details of the measure which is now before the House. If it is true that they accept the principle and only differ in regard to the details, I ask myself why the United Party has moved an amendment which seeks to kill not only this measure and its details but also its principle which they adopted unanimously on the Select Committee? Why are they now running away from the principle which they accepted and supported, seeing that they want to tell the public that they do support the principle of control? I say that they cannot take it amiss of me if I say that they are still travelling in reverse gear. The logical action of the United Party should be to support the Second Reading of this Bill, because we are dealing with its principle, a principle that they accepted and supported in the Select Committee, and at the Committee Stage, when the details are discussed, to come forward with logical arguments to try to amend the Bill so that it will appeal to them and so that it will be a better measure than this one. They cannot make the excuse that they have not had the time to frame the necessary amendments. They have had six months to do so&#x2014;long enough&#x2014;but they have not done so. They are following the easy but dishonourable way of completely rejecting for the sake of convenience a principle which they wholeheartedly supported. The United Party can therefore not take it amiss of me when I say that they are now rejecting a principle which they supported earlier on and made no secret of the fact. They are now seeking to deceive the public. They say that they are in favour of the principle but they do not agree with the details and then they move an amendment which, if adopted, will also cause the shipwreck of the principle.</p>

<p>What principle are you talking about?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#potgieter">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. member still does not know what the principle is which is embodied in this measure, then we are quite correct in our assumption that they have not read this Bill and that they do not know what its contents are. I contend that the United Party did not want control right from the start. They supported that principle in the Select Committee to make the public believe that they wanted control but all the while they were wondering how they could avoid that principle and frustrate that resolution, which they have now done in this House by means of the amendment of the hon. member for Turffontein. I do not know why they are always trying to evade the issue, hoping to throw the public off the scent. They are always raising ghosts and creating mirages which simply amaze one. According to the two United Party speakers the <i>status quo</i> must be retained; the courts are there to ensure that undesirable literature is not distributed. This attitude of the United Party has once again been true to type. In connection with every necessary piece of legislation they say: The courts are there so why should there be legislation? It was precisely the same with the anti-communist measures. We know from experience how impracticable the proposals of the United Party are. We know that it can happen that these court trials can be prolonged indefinitely by all sorts of excuses. In other words, it is merely a covert way of frustrating the purposes of this measure and other measures. Mr. Speaker, if the public felt inclined to bring every case of undesirable publications and objects to the attention of the courts, our administration of justice would have time for nothing else but would have to give all its attention to these cases.</p>

<p>What will be the position if this measure is adopted and applied? The control board with its panel of assistants will consider undesirable publications, and anybody who feels aggrieved will have the right of appeal to the courts. Nowhere in the world will you find such a democratic and just measure as this one now before the House. I predict, however, that when this measure is applied, few people will go to court because firstly, the board will consider every case expertly and carefully, and secondly the publishers will very soon realize that this board is a body which is reliable in its judgment and decisions.</p>

<p>That brings me to the next mirage created by the United Party. The hon. member for Turffontein made the Board members out to be saboteurs of and fighters against literary and creative art. I hope that he is ashamed of himself for making the public suspicious in advance of those people who have to help in freeing South Africa from undesirable publications. I do not want to do him injustice. I think that he said yesterday that those works of art must now be judged by a group of &#x201C;cranks&#x201D;,</p>

<p>You are wrong again.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#potgieter">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>I say that it is a very reprehensive thing to cast suspicion at this stage upon people with outstanding qualifications&#x2014;and we know from experience that the Minister will not appoint cranks&#x2014;and to say that these are people who are out to make <span class="col_433-434" refersTo="page_0231"/>war against our artists. I think that it was a very unfortunate choice of the United Party to make the hon. member for Turffontein its first speaker because his speech proved one fact conclusively, namely that the hon. member was completely unqualified and unable to distinguish between the aesthetic and plain, vulgar pornography, between art and animal lust. I think that the attitude of the hon. member in the House yesterday and the reaction of the United Party to what he said compels me to apply Kant&#x2019;s definition of tragedy to him! He so much wants to but he cannot! The hon. member is also very worried about the Shaws and the other great writers in our literature who will now apparently be destroyed by this measure. The hon. member is apparently not aware of the fact that if a Willem Kloos cries out in ecstasy: &#x201C;Ik ben een God in&#x2019;t diepst van mijn gedachten&#x201D; (I am a God in the depths of my thoughts), it has a high aesthetic value, but place those same words in the mouth of a brawling street urchin and they become blasphemous. The board members will immediately be able to distinguish &#x2026; [Interjection.] Complaints do not help. The whole plea of the hon. member yesterday was that we wanted to destroy everything in our literature; that we wanted to appoint inquisitors, and I want to prove that they do not know what is going on. As I said, the board will immediately be able to distinguish&#x2014;and I want the hon. member for Turffontein to listen carefully to this&#x2014; between the Skoppensboer of a man like Eugene Marais and a literary effort on the part of the hon. member who seeks to make the same expression. I want to mention another example. The Vogeland Park in Oslo is the life&#x2019;s work of the greatest sculptor in Norway. Prim visitors there will immediately forget that they are looking at naked images because that sculptor is so great that on the contrary one forgets completely that one is looking at naked images and one immediately notices the attitudes and the straining muscles symbolical of what is finest and greatest in man.</p>

<p>[Inaudible.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#potgieter">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, Mr. Speaker, cast your pearls before swine. No one would ever dream of branding that great work of Vogeland as being indecent or undesirable. On the contrary, it is one of the finest and most valuable cultural treasures of Norway.</p>

<p>The hon. member alleged further that this legislation proves the decadence of our moral views and the refining influence of our churches because he asked repeatedly: Is it because our churches are powerless in this connection that they have not succeeded in their purpose and so our moral level has dropped? I take the greatest exception to that reprehensible remark. The hon. member should rather leave our churches and our moral views out of the tirades he holds in this House. It is precisely because our moral instincts and the high calling of our churches revolt against those undermining influences that this measure is now so necessary. It is precisely because we want to protect it, because we realize what that high calling of our churches is, because our moral views are on such a high plane, that we refuse to allow our spiritual treasures to be eroded. Mr. Speaker, a farmer who makes a fire-break is not considered to be unwise, to be of a low moral standard; he is not accused of retrogression but is praised for his great devotion and sensible preparedness in respect of those things which he owns and which he holds dear. He wants to guard and protect his treasures against those things which will destroy them. The hon. member for Turffontein does not want to take precautions. No, he wants that fire to flare up across the whole of South Africa and he does not care how scorched the spiritual aspects of our people become. The United Party is also very concerned about the liberties of the individual. This measure will now curtail that so-called freedom of the individual and we will be made to look ridiculous in the eyes of the world. They want everyone to be able to say and do what they want to; it makes no difference if they have a tendency towards the superficial. In my humble opinion the greatest and the really only valuable individual liberty in a civilized country is the inalienable right of every citizen and child to stand his ground without his morals and spiritual strength being exposed to erosion. That is a freedom of which we can be proud. However, freedom means absolutely nothing to the hon. member and he will rejoice if we permit that licentious freedom which he envisages to destroy this one valuable freedom. I say that it is the duty of this Government&#x2014;and it considers it its duty&#x2014; to protect that freedom of the people and therefore this measure is before the House now. True to type, the United Party is opposing this measure. Mr. Speaker, I do not know whether hon. members opposite realize how this sort of publication, pornography, has already left its mark upon a large number of our people, and I do not know whether they realize that it is easier to prevent that erosion than to try and rehabilitate someone who already carried that mark on his soul. A measure such as this should have been introduced in the early 30&#x2019;s. I was teaching on the Rand in the early 30&#x2019;s and in that particular school there was a class which was simply incorrigible. The woman teacher taking the class had a nervous breakdown. The principal was not able to control that class and as a last resort the desks in that classroom were examined and we discovered that, without exception, each of those desks contained pornography of the worst kind. When the parents were spoken to individually they were amazed that their children were in possession of such things and after inquiry and investigation it appeared that one girl was responsible for the degeneration of that whole class.</p>

<p>About 14 or 15. It was discovered then that one girl was responsible for the degeneration of that entire class, and this proves that the hon. member for Turffontein and the United Party were hopelessly wrong when they tried to prove yesterday that things were not so bad, when the hon. member wanted to prove from the Cronje Report that only a limited number of books were banned. That one girl ruined a whole class. I say that we cannot allow even one girl to be influenced by these things which we are trying to avoid. During the recess I tried to ascertain&#x2014;which the hon. member did not do; he did not do his homework&#x2014;how widespread these articles were in certain centres, and anyone knows that in our large centres one can walk into any caf&#x00E9; and find pornography of the worst kind amongst the soft-cover books; anyone can buy them. One need not read a book to know what its contents are; one merely has to look at the first page to have an indication of what can be expected. I was standing near a cafe to see how many of those books were sold, and I was surprised. I came across a photographic album and according to what I was told, it is fairly widespread&#x2014;a photographic album of naked figures&#x2014;but it was very clear that the photographers did not have as their aim an exhibition of the beauty of the human body; the most sensual details were emphasized and anyone knowing anything of art realized it immediately. Must we allow this type of thing to be distributed amongst our people? A hotel-owner in Durban showed me a package of photographs.</p>

<p>I hope that the public, not only the Afrikaans-speaking people but also the English-speaking people, will note the attitude and the views of the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn). This hotel owner contended that the book was widely distributed for sale in the bars of Durban at a considerable price. The unfortunate thing is that some of those photographs find their way to some of our school children, and now the hon. member for Yeoville wants to joke about it.</p>

<p>I did not take it from a bar. The hon. member should have been listening. I said that a hotel-owner told me about it and showed me the photographs, but the hon, member is so little interested in the spiritual welfare of his nation that he does not even take the trouble to listen; he wants to joke about it. I appeal to the Opposition not to sow suspicion outside in connection with this matter. We must look after the children of South Africa because they are the responsible citizens of to-morrow. It is the bounden duty of this Government and I think it is also the duty of the Opposition to consider this matter in a more serious light. I do not think that the hon. Minister or anyone on this side will contend that this measure is perfect; far from it; but I say that it is at least a start to prove our goodwill and determination to keep South Africa clean. If we experience difficulties in the future it is also the right and privilege of the Opposition to bring them to the attention of this House and if those proposed amendments are generally accepted, they will become part of this measure. No one is perfect. But the Opposition must not come along here with this attitude where we are making a start, an honest effort after so many years to give South Africa something to protect our nation against this foreign and degenerating influence.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>When we were on the Select Committee we received a very large number of memoranda, in all up to about 50, and I do not think there was one single memorandum, whether it came from the Institute of Race Relations, the Society of Newspaper Editors or the Dutch Reformed Church, which did not advocate that there should be a law against obscene publications, and when, as the hon. member indicated, the United Party voted that there should be a law against such publications, that is all that our vote meant. It meant no single whit of approval for this particular Bill before the House. In fact, we were appalled at this Bill from the beginning. We found that this Bill when it came before us the first time was even slightly better than it was when it emerged ultimately from the Select Committee, after certain changes had been made by the Minister himself.</p>

<p>This particular Bill is supposed to deal with undesirable publications. Sir, if ever there was a publication printed in the Republic of South Africa which was undesirable, it is this very Bill before us to-day. It is a shabby and a sanctimonious measure. It is another surrender by the Government to the prejudice and the ignorance of the iconoclasts and the suppressors of free speech and enlightenment in our country. Mr. Speaker, this Bill is a bad Bill for three main reasons. First of all, most censorship is inherently bad and in this Bill the bad features overshadow the good; secondly, much greater powers than in the past&#x2014;most of them unnecessary&#x2014;are given to the Minister and his powerful new board, a secret cabal of inquisitors and snoopers into the private actions of the country&#x2019;s citizens.</p>

<p><span class="col_437-438" refersTo="page_0233"/>Thirdly, Sir, this Bill offers no solution to existing problems in regard to censorship such as the abundance of restrictive laws, the overlapping of administrative bodies administering these laws and also the different norms and the different definitions of &#x201C;undesirability&#x201D; in these different Acts.</p>

<p>Sir, with your permission I should like to test this Bill against the background of these defects I have mentioned. Firstly, I stated that this Bill was bad because most censorship is bad. There is no need for me to mention instances in history where censorship has led to wars, to difficulties, to internal unrest, from the time of the Roman Emperors, through the Middle Ages, under the Stewarts, and in Russia to-day. Censorship does not bring peace, censorship does not bring satisfaction. Too many of the ancestors of those of us who sit here to-day had to fight for freedom of speech in past centuries, and many of them died for that principle. Sir, censorship is of three kinds. There is political censorship, there is religious censorship and there is censorship directed against obscene publications. Unfortunately this Bill does not stress the third one but it does contain important aspects of the first two, that is, political and religious censorship.</p>

<p>You are talking nonsense.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Let the hon. member read Clause 5 (2) (c) and (d) which state that a publication &#x201C;shall be undesirable if it brings any section of the inhabitants of the Republic into ridicule or contempt, or is harmful to the relations between any sections of the inhabitants of the Republic &#x201D;. Sir, why should ridicule be outlawed? Surely ridicule is a legitimate weapon of political controversy. Quite often the object of ridicule is itself so ridiculous, like the Nationalist Party and the Government, that the weapon of ridicule need not even be used; only the facts need be used in describing them. Sir, are cartoons in weekly papers to be censored under this Bill? Sir, may I read to you a statement by a very important Afrikaans writer, Mr. Bartho Smit in <i>Dagbreek en Sondagnuus</i> of 27 January. This, of course, is the paper of which the hon. the Prime Minister is the chairman of the Board of Directors. Mr. Bartho Smit says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Ek persoonlik glo nie dat &#x2019;n verant-woordelike sensuurraad die skrywer of die uitgewer minder vryheid sal toelaat as wat hy vandag geniet nie. maar is &#x2019;n wetsentwerp wat soveel moonthke gevare inhou werklik nodig? &#x201D;</block>

<p>Then he goes on to sav&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Ook wonder &#x2019;n mens of eerlik-bedoelde nasionale selfkritiek of selfspot&#x2014;waarsonder geen nasie geestelik gesond kan bly nie&#x2014;nie dalk onwettig kan wees omdat dit .&#x2019;n bevolkingsdeel van die Republiek belaglik of veragtelik maak nie. Sulke oorwegings kan as gevolg he dat ons hele literatuur in die praktyk aan voor-publikasiesensuur onderwerp word.&#x201D;</block>

<p>This is an important South African writer, who expresses these views. Sir, when it comes to the provision in the Bill that a publication can be forbidden if it is harmful to the relations between sections of the inhabitants, I can think of no more legitimate object for banning than this Government itself which by its own measures, introduced over the past 15 years, has done nothing whatsoever to improve relations between the different sections of the inhabitants of this country. This Bill, I believe, aggravates political censorship which already exists in this country. We do not believe in such censorship.</p>

<p>I claim that this Bill also sins in that it is open to being used for the purpose of imposing religious censorship. (Clause 5 (2) (b) defines undesirable publications as including those which are " offensive to the religious convictions or feelings of any section of the inhabitants of the Republic &#x201D;. Now, Sir, this too can have an extremely wide application. Would a butcher or a restaurant advertising meat for sale and consumption on a Friday not be offending the susceptibilities of Roman Catholic supporters? Would somebody who advocated the playing of tennis or golf on a Sunday not be offending the religious susceptibilities of certain people in South Africa? May I ask in all sincerity whether the writings of honest rationalists, humanists and free-thinkers are to be banned, simply because of people like Bertrand Russell who occasionally attacked existing relations? Can a Native witchdoctor object to a treatise against polygamy? Sir, this is not far-fetched. Already prominent writers have expressed concern on this score. May I again read to you what Mr. Bartho Smit, an important South African writer said on this issue&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Hierbenewens is die definisies van baie van die ongewensthede so vaag dat dit 'n onhoudbare toestand vir sowel die skrywer as die uitgewer kan skep.</block>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;In Suid-Afrika met sy meer as 2,000 kerkgenootskappe en godsdienstige sektes kan daar tog kwalik van 'n skrywer of uitgewer verwag word om te weet wanneer &#x2019;n publikasie vir die godsdienstige oortuigings of gevoelens van enige bevolkingsdeel van die Republiek aanstootlik sal wees</block>

<p>This Bill can be misused for religious censorship. We must remember that in our country, under this present Government, censorship is already in very bad odour&#x2014;even under existing legislation. This Bill does not improve the position, it worsens it. The law is made more stringent, the power of the blue-stocking brigade is intensified in this Bill. Under the present measure, Sir, we already find that works of such famous authors as Dostoyevsky, Turgenev, Tolstoy, Zola, Sartre, Truman Capote have been banned. Recently Fracoise Sagan&#x2019;s Bonjour Tristesse was banned in the English but not in the French version, presumably on the grounds that people who read French are more moral than those who do not. The classic instance was the banning of the book, with what I <span class="col_439-440" refersTo="page_0234"/>suppose they regarded as a suggestive title, &#x201C;Black Beauty&#x201D;. They found out later that &#x201C;Black Beauty&#x201D; was a horse and that the book was an animal one.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, do you realize that there is such chaos in the censorship department that the hon. the Minister does not even readily know what books and what periodicals have been banned? In 1959 I put a question to the hon. the Minister asking him about certain American periodicals which were banned in this country. I asked him which weekly, which fortnightly and which monthly American periodicals were banned. He replied that his records were not kept in such a way as to enable him to reply to me in that form. In reply to another question of mine he told me that books were filed under their titles and not under the names of the authors. If that is the case we might indeed find one day the gentleman who wrote a book about Ulysses, called Homer, being banned instead of the other writer of Ulysses and not James Joyce. We might perhaps find that the book of some or other professor or geography is banned because the title of that deals with, say, the Tropic of Cancer or the Tropic of Capricorn. Sir, it seems to me that the hon. the Minister has an Index Expurgatorius, but the thing has not got an index. He cannot find out what he has banned.</p>

<p>My second objection is that vast new powers are taken under this Bill. It threatens Press censorship, whatever the hon. the Minister may say. It is true, as provided for in the Bill, that newspapers belonging to the Newspaper Press Union are excluded from its provisions. But there is a host of smaller newspapers, weekly newspapers, who do not belong to the Newspaper Press Union which are faced with all the terrible implications of this Bill. They are not excluded. They have not got a Press Board as the large daily newspapers will have. Although, Sir, I might say in parenthesis, that I sometimes doubt the value of this particular Press Board. In September I laid a charge before the Press Board, with an affidavit and a cheque, against the <i>Transvaler,</i> and I have not as yet received a reply as to what was decided.</p>

<p>My concern is for the weeklies who are not members of the National Press Union, dozens of useful publications performing a necessary function in a country where there are so many separate special interests in matters of politics, labour and race. They will come under the full force of the ban. I, my self, write two weekly political articles in a political weekly called <i>Weekblad,</i> which is not a member of the National Press Union. Am I to be censored for bringing the National Party and the Nationalist Government and the hon. the Prime Minister into ridicule&#x2014;which I hope I succeed in doing? If so, he and his whole censorship cabal can. in the American expression, &#x201C;go jump in the lake&#x201D;, I do not. for a moment think that the Government have given up their obnoxious plans against the Press. The statements made by hon. members opposite in the past are too menacing, too clear, to allow of any doubt on that score. I have a few of them here. On 1 August 1961 the hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Eric Louw, stated (he referred to a Press report that the managing director of an Athens newspaper and two of his assistants had been sent to jail for causing alarm and despondency)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I wonder whether the time has not come for us in this country to follow the Greeks&#x2019; example.</block>

<p>On 2 September 1961 the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On 18 October, on election day, a mandate will be sought to take the English Press by the throat.</block>

<p>Is this Bill the result of that? The Minister of Bantu Education, Mr. Maree, said in September 1961 in Natal that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It was clear that there were serious objections to the role of the Press. Readers are being indoctrinated in favour of liberalism.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, part of the great powers to which I object in this Bill is contained in the wideness of the very involved, fog-bound definition of what is undesirable or harmful to public morals. In Section 6 the courts are given no discretion. They are told when to decide when a publication or object is objectionable. For instance &#x201C;if it deals in an improper manner with murder &#x201D;. How does one deal in a proper manner with murder, Sir? &#x201C;If it deals in an improper manner with lawlessness&#x201D;, then it is objectionable. I can think of many measures improperly dealing with lawlessness in the Transkei for instance, measures which will fall under this particular clause of the Bill. If it deals in an improper manner with tippling or drunkenness then it can also come under this ban. Even worse. Sir, Clause 6 says that &#x201C;in determining whether any matter is harmful to public morals no regard shall be had to the intention of the person who produced it &#x201D;. The hon. member for Vryheid (Mr. D. J. Potgieter) spent a large part of his speech drawing a distinction between, for example, Eugene Marais&#x2019; Skoppensboer and Skoppensboer if written by a member on this side. The Bill itself says that the board must take no cognizance of the intention itself. Let me read what Mr. Bartho Smit said in this connection. He said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Daar word uitdruklik verklaar dat die doel van die persoon wat &#x2019;n ongewenste produk gemaak of uitgegee het moet nie in aanmerking geneem word nie. Die artistieke waarde of regverdiging van byv. &#x2019;n ongewenste woord of paragraaf word gevolglik geheel en al buite rekening gelaat. Want in tecnstelling met die Britse Wet wat bepaal dat &#x2019;n boek in sy geheel oorweeg moet word, kan &#x2019;n publikasie volgens ons wet verbied word as dit. of &#x2019;n deel daarvan, as ongewens beskou word.</block>

<p><span class="col_441-442" refersTo="page_0235"/>Such a publication or object can be censored solely if, in the opinion of the Court, &#x201C;it is likely to be disgustful&#x201D; to persons who are likely to read or see it. Sir, if Mother Grundy&#x2019;s little Nats see a nude study in an art gallery and they find it &#x201C;disgustful&#x201D;, must all decent people who can appreciate art be precluded from seeing that particular painting? Even the hon. Minister himself could have got into some difficulty in the past when a nude statue was erected on the Population Register Building, apparently with his original approval. Only after some person, some predikant or other, had found it &#x201C;disgustful&#x201D; was it decided to remove that particular statue. The Bill speaks about &#x201C;disgustful &#x201D;. I do not know why it cannot be &#x201C;disgusting &#x201D;. I do not know whether there is such a word as &#x201C;disgustful&#x201D; in the dictionary.</p>

<p>I said the definition is wide. Look at it, Sir. You will find separate definitions of what is objectionable and undesirable. You find those in Clauses 5, 6, 10 and 12. Do you know, Sir. how many categories of undesirability I counted in this Bill? Not ten, not 20, there are no less than 97 categories of undesirability in this Bill. You may ask what I propose, Sir. We gave our solution in the Select Committee. We deemed that a short definition of &#x201C;undesirability&#x201D; would prove to be the best. Let me read how Clause 5 (2) should read in plain and simple language: &#x201C;A publication or object shall be deemed to be undesirable if it is indecent or obscene or is offensive or harmful to public morals.&#x201D; After that it should be left to the courts to decide what the scope of those words are.</p>

<p>Let me mention to the hon. the Minister the example of what Britain has done. In 1959 the British Houses of Parliament passed the Obscene Publications Act. That was after an old Act had become obsolete, an Act which was passed in 1857. This Act contains only five simple sections. Where the Minister's Bill needs 800 words to define what is obscene and undesirable the British Act does it in less than 70 words. Let me read it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Obscene Publications Act, 1959: For the purpose of this Act articles shall be deemed to be obscene if its effect is, if taken as a whole, such as to tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely, having regard to all relevant circumstances, to read, see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it.</block>

<p>Why must we have this very wide definition in this Bill? Why could not a short and simple definition have sufficed? Why the rambling verbiage and mental garbage of this Bill&#x2019;s definition? Sir, I am not alone in condemning the wide ambit of the defining clauses. I have here a leading article from a prominent newspaper not unknown to this House. I read from the leading article which appeared in the <i>Burger</i> of Monday, 30 April 1962, in which reference is made to certain definitions in the old Bill, which are also contained in the new Bill&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Daar is die omvattende beskrywing van wat alles as ongewenste publikasies beskou kan word. Dit is plek-plek ontstellend vaag. Om een voorbeeld te noem: wat alles moet nie val onder &#x2019;n publikasie wat, vir die betrekkinge tussen enige bevolkingsdele van die Republiek skadelik is&#x2019; nie? Veral noudat koerante uitgesluit word, kom dit voor asof die wetsontwerp doeltreffender gemaak kan word deur die net nouer te span en meer bepaald te konsentreer op aanstootlikheid in die gewone sin van die woord &#x2026;&#x201D;</block>

<p>And not these 97 different things. Then the <i>Burger</i> continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Die versoeking wat in kwessies van hierdie aard weerstaan moet word, is om van die klaarblyklik af te dwaal en te probeer beweeg op terreine wat alleen stryd kan wek. Al wat hierdie wapen stomp kan maak sou &#x2019;n poging wees om hom te wyd te gebruik. Teen hierdie gevaar kan die Parlement help waak deur aan alte wydlopigheid in die bewoording van die wetsontwerp te snoei.&#x201D;</block>

<p>I therefore ask the hon. the Minister to cut the definition in this Bill. If he does not wish to listen to me let him listen at least to the <i>Burger,</i> even if it is a Cape and not a Transvaal paper. Let me read the words of another promiment South African in the publishing business, Mr. J. J. Human. He wrote this in <i>Dagbreek&#x2014;</i></p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Ek is gekant teen enige vorm van sensuur waar daar die geringste gevaar bestaan dat dit willekeurig en buite die geregshof toegepas kan word; ook teen &#x2019;n wet wat die geleentheid skep dat mense wat liewer aan die veilige kant wil bly &#x2019;n toestand kan skep waar vooraf-sensuur beoefen kan word. Die vae en omvattende terminologie waarin die sensuurwet opgestel word, kan alleen tot onsekerheid lei en veroorsaak dat &#x2019;n uitge-wer alles wat hy ontvang eers aan die raad voorle&#x2014;nie omdat die wet dit van hom vereis nie, maar bloot om veiligheidsredes. Soiets kan &#x2019;n bitter ongesonde toestand skep.&#x201D;</block>

<p>That is a prominent publisher in the Afrikaans publishing field said that, Sir.</p>

<p>We also object to the heavy penalties under this Bill. We object to the fact that the courts are told that they must impose a minimum penalty. We do not object to a maximum penalty, we object to a minimum penalty.</p>

<p>My third objection to this Bill, Sir, which I stated originally, is that it is no cure whatsoever. no acceptable substitute, for recognizing the ills in existing legislation and existing measures. What are these ills? We all agree that we already have too many laws imposing censorship and restricting free speech in our country to-day. There are no less than 15 important Acts and Ordinances dealing with the matter on our Statute Book. Only two significant ones are repealed in this particular Bill. And what do we have in their place? The present Bill&#x2014; which is much worse! In other words, the <span class="col_443-444" refersTo="page_0236"/>writer has, when he puts his pen to the paper, to consider whether, even if he escapes under this Bill, he cannot still be prosecuted under the Native Administration Act of 1928, the Electoral Act of 1946, the Suppression of Communism Act of 1950, the Public Safety Act of 1953, the Criminal Procedure Act of 1955, the Riotous Assembly Act of 1957, the Defence Act of 1957, the Post Office Act of 1958, the Prisons Act of 1959, the Children&#x2019;s Act of 1960 and the Sabotage Act of last year. Small wonder that well-known Afrikaans writers, such as the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker) are cracking under the strain. Perhaps they should, like the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze) stick to translation only, but indeed even in that case the hon. member for Standerton might find himself in difficulties. He has made an excellent translation of &#x201C;Hamlet&#x201D; into Afrikaans, but I should like to check how accurately he translated the following words &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I shall leave that point, Sir. The point I am trying to make is that there so many measures on the Statute Book to-day, apart from this, which already deal with censorship and which already give the Government wide powers in regard to obscene and undesirable publications, that indeed to have a Bill such as this, in addition, is unnecessary.</p>

<p>The second ill that this Bill does not cure is the fact that we have far too many norms, far too many standards in all these different Acts. For instance, when the Post Office confiscates a certain publication, it does so under a particular section in the Post Office Act. When the Customs official holds back a paperback, he does so under the Customs Act. When the Censor Board or the Publications Board, as it is misnamed, acts under this Bill, it does so under the norm to end all norms, the definition to end all definitions. Sir, this Bill contains not only one norm, it contains three different norms, norms to be applied by the one board. Clauses 5 and 6 lay down what is objectionable in regard to publications and objects only. Clause 10 says what is objectionable in regard to films&#x2014;and the two differ widely A film which depicts in a so-called offensive manner &#x201C;scenes of violence involving White and non-White&#x201D;&#x2014;like Joe Louis knocking out Max Baer&#x2014;cannot get its certificate, though a book describing the fight would. A. film may not even depict in a so-called offensive manner &#x201C;controversial politics&#x201D; while writers, such as the editor of the <i>Transvaler,</i> may do so. In addition to the two separate norms, there is still a third one, that for public entertainment, under Clause 12. Under this a producer may not stage a play which, I quote again, &#x201C;may have the effect of bringing any section of the inhabitants into ridicule or contempt&#x201D;, That, Sir, may indeed spell the end of some of the excellent stage revues we have had in South Africa during the past years. The problem of separate standards is indeed aggravated by this particular Bill. Very little is improved. Even the avenues of appeal against the decision of the board remain different. An author can appeal to the courts, but the film industry can only appeal to the Minister.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>At their request, I admit, Sir. But even if that is the case, the fact that the film industry prefers it that way cuts little ice with me. I believe, Sir, that this provision has been used by the film industry to keep some really excellent, particularly Continental films, out of this country. I would rather see the film industry settle this issue in the court and bring these excellent films to South Africa.</p>

<p>Hardest hit of all has been the book trade. I have not the time to go into the monumental stupidity of banning a book because it costs less than 50c, unless the Minister, of course, allows that book to go through. It is no use the Minister telling me, as he probably will, that reputable publishers of paperbacks will be excluded. There are reputable publishers who publish things which I may not regard as pornography but which the hon. the Minister does. I believe the Penguin Books are bringing out an edition of Lady Chatterley&#x2019;s Lover &#x201D;. I believe that Henry Miller&#x2019;s &#x201C;Tropic of Cancer&#x201D; is appearing in a paperback edition in the United States of America, published by a very reputable publisher.</p>

<p>In this connection I want to say that the Minister has treated the book trade in a highhanded&#x2014;and I am sorry to have to say it&#x2014; in a discourteous manner. Some months ago the Book Traders&#x2019; Association sent a deputation to see the hon. the Minister of Finance on the Customs Act, which is also dealt with in this particular Bill, probably in regard to the importation of books. They were courteously received by the Minister of Finance; they were given a good reception and a fair hearing. At the end of the discussions, the hon. the Minister of Finance thanked the deputation for the assistance it had given him. Then the book trade, expecting the same assistance, tried to approach the hon. the Minister of the Interior. Naturally they expected equally fair treatment. They drew up an outstanding and scholarly memorandum based on wide experience and they submitted it to the hon. the Minister in July 1962 with a special request that the Minister should meet a deputation from the Book Traders&#x2019; Association so that they could explain their difficulties in regard to this Bill. That request was refused. A request was made a second time; for the second time the book traders were refused. The Minister&#x2019;s excuse in the first instance was to the effect that there was no point in his seeing the deputation then; he first had to study the whole problem more fully. At that stage, I believe, he had already tabled the third version of this particular Bill &#x2014;and he still needed time to study it! When the hon. the Minister was approached once more in September by the Book Traders&#x2019; Association, <span class="col_445-446" refersTo="page_0237"/>they received a reply in November&#x2014;I admit that is about par for a Government Department to reply&#x2014;that the hon. the Minister was on holiday. The letter was sent to the Department in September; was the hon. Minister on holiday in September as well? I should like to know. He was probably visiting the Interior, Sir.</p>

<p>The book trade was however assured that a new draft Bill would be tabled in January, containing amendments and that he would then consider a memorandum from them. Well, Sir, this Bill has been tabled. The changes made are of very little moment to the book trade. They, in fact, have nothing to add to. the memorandum, which at the moment is still their case, and which is at the moment before the Minister. They see no reason why they should alter that original memorandum. That memorandum still stands. Now I ask the hon. Minister: What is he going to do about that memorandum? I challenge him to meet and face these men of influence and importance in the publishing world. They can promise him the courtesy he denied them.</p>

<p>So, Sir, we enter this year of 1963 with a new cloud of man-made smog engulfing us, stifling further those who wish to breathe free air in our country. Thank goodness. Sir, the voice of reason has not been stilled completely. Thank goodness there are still writers, and among them Afrikaans writers, who can protest. Let me conclude by quoting two more of them. The first is Professor Rob Antonnissen, professor of philosophy, professor of literature and professor in Afrikaans and Netherlands. He wrote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hierdie wet is myn insiens uiters gevaarlik bloot omdat dit deure oopmaak vir misbruike, erger misbruike as ongewenste lektuur. Om een voorbeeld te noem: Sal lede van die beplande sensuurraad altyd bevoeg wees om te besluit wat ongewens is en wat nie? Sal hulle altyd kan besluit wat kuns is en wat nie? Of kom kuns nie in aanmerking nie? Dit kom daarop neer dat die menings van enkele persone vir &#x2019;n hele volk as Heilige Evangelie voorgehou sal word. Is dit gesond?</block>

<p>I want to read the words of a prominent Afrikaans writer, Mr. Bill (W. A.) de Klerk. He is a Nationalist. This is what he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ons skep met hierdie Wet meer probleme as wat ons daarmee sal kan oplos. &#x2026; As &#x2019;n mens eers &#x2019;n volk se sedes met regulasies en wette wil beheer is daar iewers &#x2019;n skroef los. Soiets het buitendien net die teenoorgestelde uitwerking as wat gewoonlik beoog word&#x2026;. Dit is verder waar dat die volwassewording van enige gemeenskap die beste waarborg is teen enwels soos pornografle. Daar soiets egter kunsmatig te probeer bewerkstelling vertraag jy eerder die geestelike groei van &#x2019;n volk.</block>

<p>I conclude with one final quotation and I hope the House will forgive me for quoting a writer whose name is so closely associated with the fight for freedom of speech. He was a Calvinist and a Republican. But no speech on the defence of freedom can be complete without a few words from the Areopagitica&#x2014;John Milton. I should like to conclude with these words&#x2014;which have a special reference to the members of this proposed board of publication. John Milton wrote&#x2014;</p>

<heading>PERSONAL EXPLANATION</heading>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>With the indulgence of the House, I would like to rise on a matter of personal explanation. I only a few minutes ago received the Hansard copy of my speech of yesterday and I find that I have made a misstatement of fact in the heat of the debate by attributing certain actions to the hon. member of Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) which are not correct. My Hansard report reveals that Mr. B. Coetzee made the following interjection in the course of my speech&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Why did that organization not give evidence before the Select Committee?</block>

<p>To which I replied&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Because that hon. member voted against their being able to give evidence. When a motion was moved that booksellers should give their evidence before the Select Committee, the hon. member for Vereeniging was one of those who opposed it and voted against it.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, that is not a correct statement of the position. I have now had an opportunity of studying the resolutions in the Report of the Select Committee and I find this to be the position: &#x201C;I moved the motion that the Booksellers&#x2019; Association and the Central News Agency should be heard,&#x201D; to which the hon. member for Vereeniging moved an amendment &#x201C;at a later stage if it appears to be necessary &#x201D;. The amendment was put by the chairman of the Select Committee for which the hon. member for Vereeniging voted, whilst I voted against, and the motion as a whole was passed unanimously. I regret if I ascribed wrongly actions to the hon. member for Vereeniging, and I apologize.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>I accept what the hon. member says and I thank him for it. I will deal just now with the implications of the whole matter, but I quite accept now that he did not mean that I told an untruth to this House.</p>

<p><span class="col_447-448" refersTo="page_0238"/>Mr. Speaker, we have now had three speeches of the Opposition side and, Sir, not a single attempt has been made at an objective analysis of this Bill. We only had one political tirade after another, and their objections, same as the objections of those writers who were interviewed by <i>Dagbreek,</i> have got nothing to do with the merits of this Bill. They dream up certain unjustified deductions, they think of unjustified possibilities, and then they start fighting those deductions and fighting those possibilities. They are not fighting this Bill! As a matter of fact, Mr. Speaker, I have never been more puzzled in my life, because I cannot see how the United Party can oppose this Bill. Because this Bill is what they have always been asking for. When dealing with this type of legislation in regard to publications, they have certain principles and they made certain demands, and judging by those principles and by those demands, this Bill is far, far superior than the present position. This Bill complies with their demands far, far better than the existing legislation. I am going to attempt to prove, and I am quite satisfied that I am going to prove even to the satisfaction of the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) that this Bill is exactly what he wants, that this Bill is in accordance with the principles he lays down. I am going to ask him to remain in the House during the whole of my speech which won&#x2019;t be too long; it will be a punishment to him, because firstly, I am going to give him blazes, then I am going to give him a fartherly lecture on law, commonsense and his own principles.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if I could give this Bill an alternative title I would give it the following title: A Bill to provide for the rule of law in dealing with publications.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>But before I deal with that, I would like to come back to what the hon. member for Turffontein referred to. I won&#x2019;t pursue the whole matter now. He has now put the matter in the right perspective. But I want to remind him of this: That all that happened on 9 March, on 9 March we decided that we would now deal with Mr. Hattingh&#x2019;s evidence and with the suggestions he made and that then we would decide to call the booksellers if necessary, that is to say the booksellers and the big importers of publications, the newspapers, etc. If necessary we would allow them to come and give evidence before us. Now the hon. member tried to make out that these people did not get a chance to give evidence. The hon. member who has just sat down came with something that the booksellers sent to the Minister and he asked why those people did not come to give evidence before the Select Committee. On 9 March we decided that if necessary they could be called to give evidence. Neither the hon. member for Turffontein, nor the hon. member for Orange Grove, nor anybody else thought it necessary for those people to come and give evidence. Mr. Speaker, they had a new Bill before them.</p>

<p>The Booksellers&#x2019; Association had a new Bill before them and all those previous memoranda dealt with a completely different Bill. All the distributors, the Newspaper Press Union, everybody else had a new Bill before them, and on 9 March we decided that if necessary they could come and give evidence. Not one of the members of the Opposition on that Select Committee asked that anyone of those people should come and give evidence before us. Why not? Because this Bill excluded all the objectionable parts, objectionable in the eyes of those people in the previous Bill.</p>

Why did not the hon. member for Orange Grove move that the Booksellers&#x2019; Association should come and give evidence? And, Mr. Speaker, all these big associations, the importers, etc., had to do was to ask us to come and give evidence. In every case where that happened, either myself or the chairman would have given them the opportunity to come and give evidence.</p>

<p>No, not now. The hon. member for Turffontein did not think it was necessary. At the end of the work of that Select Committee that hon. member was fairly satisfied with the Bill. I will prove it. And I say: When all these big distributors, when the Booksellers&#x2019; Association, when the importers had the complete Bill in front of them, they saw no necessity to come and give evidence; they were satisfied with it.</p>

<p>If they were not satisfied, why did they not ask to come and give evidence?</p>

<p>As I will prove later on, it was under pressure that the hon. member for Turffontein changed his opinion about this Bill. Sir, the hon. member said in his speech&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Many views have been expressed in the Select Committee that the existing legislation was sufficient to control the situation.</block>

<p>Quite true. Those opinions were expressed. But he was not of that opinion. The hon. member thought that additional legislation was <span class="col_449-450" refersTo="page_0239"/>necessary. That has been quoted, but I will quote it to him again. The hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) moved in the Select Committee&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That in the opinion of the Select Committee legislation is desirable&#x2026;.</block>

<block name="quote">That in the opinion of the Committee legislation is desirable to prevent the dissemination or exhibition of undesirable publications, etc.</block>

<p>That motion was before the Select Committee saying that legislation was necessary. Why did not the hon. member for Turffontein at that stage move an amendment to this effect: &#x201C;In the opinion of the Committee the present legislation is sufficient &#x201D;? Did he think at that time that the existing legislation was sufficient? Why when there was a motion that we should now proceed with new legislation; why did he and the hon. member for Orange Grove vote for it?

What are the facts? The facts are that under the impact of the evidence we had before us, neither that hon. member nor the hon. member for Orange Grove, nor the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) would say that new legislation was not necessary. Under the impact of the evidence they were quite satisfied that new legislation was absolutely necessary. It was only after they had been brought under pressure from the English Press, from the Booksellers&#x2019; Association, from the big importers of this literature, it was only after they had been under pressure from those people that they changed their mind. They did not have the courage to stand by their decision that new legislation was necessary.</p>

<p>After listening to the hon. member for Turffontein and the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) and the hon. member for Orange Grove, I can only come to one conclusion and that is that they want no control at all. They now say that they are satisfied with present legislation. But I tell them that they are not satisfied with present legislation at all. Listen how the hon. member for Orange Grove this afternoon criticized present legislation. He criticized the banning of Earl Russell&#x2019;s book and many other books. But those books were banned not under this Bill, but under existing legislation.</p>

<p>I am not satisfied with that either.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member is not satisfied with that either, and yesterday the hon. member for Turffontein said: &#x201C;We are quite happy with the present legislation.&#x201D; That is my point. That is why I say that they want no control. Remember: They want no new legislation and they are not satisfied with present legislation. In other words they want to abolish control completely, As a diversion I would just like to remind the hon. member for Orange Grove that he criticizes the hon. Minister because certain books that he considers to be classical works have been banned. Might I remind him that under the United Party, a classic like &#x201C;Droll Stories&#x201D; of Balzac was banned, not by the present Minister, but by the late Mr. Clarkson. But that only by way of diversion. I say that they are equally dissatisfied with the present legislation as they are with the legislation now before us. But I accuse the United Party and their speakers so far that in their approach to this Bill they are irresponsible, they are mischievous and that they act without any regard for the interests of the good name of South Africa. They read things into this Bill which will only be read into it by somebody who wishes South Africa no good.</p>

<p>I come to the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South). He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This Bill will extend political censorship.</block>

<p>Then he goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It will raise higher the fence of political censorship around the freedom to express opinions and to criticize the consequences of the Government&#x2019;s actions.</block>

<p>He goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There should be sufficient scope for the subject to be critical of the Government.</block>

<p>He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An adequacy of criticism is necessary.</block>

<p>He goes on to say&#x2014;-</p>

<block name="quote">This is in fact an addition to existing political censorship.</block>

<p>Now I throw it into his face that every one of those statements are untrue. I challenge him, as I challenged him yesterday in the course of his speech to show us one bit of evidence in one single clause in this Bill which can remotely be interpreted as an attempt to suppress or stifle criticism of the Government. When I challenged him in the course of his speech he said: &#x201C;Give me a chance to develop my argument.&#x201D; He never developed that argument. He made the blatant statement merely <span class="col_451-452" refersTo="page_0240"/>that this is political censorship. I say in view of what happened, of which he had full knowledge, that this statement that this is political censorship, that this is suppression of political criticism of the Government&#x2014;I say that in view of what happened, and he had full knowledge of what happened, that that statement of his is a vicious, a hateful and an untruthful one.</p>

<p>What is the position? The written criticism of this Government comes to the extent of 99.99 per cent from the English language Press belonging to the National Press Union. There is hardly any other written criticism of the Government. All the criticism in this Parliament, all the criticism at political meetings will have no effect whatsoever if the English Press belonging to the National Press Union is not allowed freely to publish it. And, Mr. Speaker, the National Press Union, all those English language papers belonging to the Press Union, were explicitly excluded. How can the hon. member then say that this interferes with the right of freedom to criticize the Government? Mr. Speaker, this Government, this Minister, the Select Committee went out of their way to exclude any possible indication that there could be political censorship. They went out of their way and excluded all those papers which severely criticize this Government. But in the face of this, that hon. member tells the world that this Bill is Press censorship, this Bill interferes with the freedom of the Press, this Bill is an attempt to stifle criticism of the Government. I say it is impossible for a sane man to read this into this Bill. Only an enemy of this country with a distorted mind could read this into this Bill.</p>

<p>I withdraw. I say here that the Government went out of its way at the request of those papers and did so gladly, to exclude all of them from the operation of this Bill. Yet that hon. member has the audacity to come and say this is political censorship. Sir, it is often said that it is not what the Opposition says, but what the Government does that gives us a bad name overseas. But here is a classical example of how untrue that statement is. Here is a Bill which explicity prohibits interference with the Press that criticizes the Government. Note, this Bill explicitly prohibits any interference with the Press that criticizes this Government. But a leading member of the United Party, a previous Auditor-General tells the world that this Bill interferes with the freedom of that Press that criticizes this Government. The Bill excludes them. It is a classic example of how our bad name overseas is being initiated by the United Party in a most reckless way, hoping to make some miserable political capital out of it.</p>

<p>Then they say, as the hon. member for Orange Grove said what about the clause which says something to this effect &#x201C;to bring any section of the public into ridicule &#x201D;? They say: That clause means political interference, because (that was the argument of the hon. member) if you ridicule the National Party, that is an offence. Sir, it is not the National Party who ask for the inclusion of this clause, it was not the Dutch Reformed Church which asked for the inclusion of this clause. It was not the Broederbond who asked for its inclusion, it was the Jewish Board of Deputies who asked for this clause. Here I have a memorandum of the Jewish Board of Deputies. They say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As the representative organization of the South African Jewish Community, this board has for many years been concerned at the publication and dissemination from time to time of material, either originating in South Africa or imported from elsewhere, intended or calculated to incite ill-will or hatred against the Jewish community.</block>

<p>What is the type of thing the Jewish Board of Deputies want to prohibit by law? The writings of Johan Schoeman, the writings of Mr. Rudman of Natal&#x2014;they want all those prohibited by law. This is their memorandum asking us specifically to let the law read so that these things can be prohibited. And then they refer to a certain writer in Sweden, and then they say the importation of all that stuff must be prohibited. Now I want to ask the hon. member for Houghton: If there again should occur in this country an anti-Semetic campaign and all these unprincipled utterances should be made against the Jews, such as the Letters of the Elders of Zion and all that type of nonsense, is she in favour of that being prohibited by law?</p>

<p>To say that this Bill is designed against the political enemies of the Government is unbelievably irresponsible and blatant nonsense, bred in the diseased minds of people with an unreasonable hatred in their hearts. One should not really take any notice of it if the position were not that it does our country harm in the outside world.</p>

<p>I make a further statement. I challenge the Opposition with their criticism of this Bill. I say the criticism is intellectually dishonest because all their extravagant deductions, all the far-reaching possible dangers that they see can equally be read into the present legislation. This is what the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This Board can tell us what books you may read, the pictures you may look at, the plays you may attend, the films you may see.</block>

<p>But that is the position under the present law. The hon. member for Turffontein said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All creative works will be subject to the whims of this Board.</block>

<p>But that is the position under the present law. All art, all paintings can be prohibited and banned by the present Censor Board. He said that it was so terrible that all the books under 50c had to be passed by the Board. But does he not realize that the hon. Minister can exclude any book from overseas into this country? And then the hon. member says &#x201C;Any crank can complain to the Board&#x201D;, Of course any crank can complain to the Board. But any crank can complain to the Police. But neither the Police and neither the Board need take any notice of cranks.

<p>I withdraw.</p>

<p>I say that this Bill should be welcomed. It is a great improvement on the present position. It is an improvement not for those people who want stricter control, but it is an improvement for those people on the other side of the House. It is an improvement for those who want enlightened control, as the Opposition calls it. Take the example of the Book Trades Association in the <i>Cape Times</i> this morning. They say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It believes that in principle censorship undermines the supremacy of the rule of law.</block>

<p>That may be so, but this Bill for the first time introduces the rule of law in dealing with publications. Sir, 95 per cent of the books dealt with by the booktraders come from overseas, and all those books can be banned by this Minister if he wants to do so. There is no rule of law. There is no appeal from his decision. There is no appeal to the courts. Under this Bill there is only one body which can say finally which books should be banned, the courts of this country. For the first time the rule of law is introduced. No longer can the Minister say what must be banned.</p>

<p>I will prove to the satisfaction of these people that this Bill is really what that hon. member wants, what the <i>Cape Times</i> wants, and what the Booksellers&#x2019; Association wants. So far under the present legislation the control of reading matter has been divided in two classes: Imported reading matter and locally produced reading matter. I don&#x2019;t think I am wrong if I say that imported reading matter makes up 90 per cent of the consumption of reading matter in South Africa.</p>

<p>All right make it 80 per cent, or 81&#x00BD; per cent. How is the bulk of the reading matter of this country dealt with? It is dealt with by the Minister and the Minister alone.

<p>If the hon. member had listened, he would have heard that I said that reading matter in South Africa for control purposes is divided into two classes, imported reading matter and local reading matter, and I am now dealing with the one part. But I am not going to ask the hon. member any longer to try and understand what I am saying. It is quite clear that he is incapable of understanding a very simple matter. I say that 90 per cent of our reading matter is imported and under the present legislation, with which the hon. member there is quite satisfied, the Minister decides. It is imported subject to the whims of only one man. That is the position and I challenge the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) to say that that is not so. It is imported at the whim of the Minister. It has been so under United Party regime, and that is the position with which certain hon. members there say they are quite satisfied. Fortunately we have had good Ministers so far, but suppose. Sir, we were to get as a Minister Badenhorst Durrant&#x2014;what a terrible thought. So I say under the present position, with which those members are quite happy the bulk of the literature consumed in this country is imported at the whim of only one man, and no appeal can be made to the courts.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>And he listens to no advice?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>He listens to advice and therefore he is very sensible about it, but he need not listen to the advice. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) said that this thing can be abused. Of course it can be abused. The fact of the matter and the legal position is that the Minister listens to advice but need not listen to it. He can say I do not want your advice; I am banning the book, and there is nothing that anyone can do about it. That is the position in regard to the bulk of reading matter in this country. The position in regard to the locally produced literature is that only the courts can deal with it. The Minister cannot deal with it If you lay a complaint the courts can decide. I do not even think they can decide to ban the book; they can just decide to punish the writer or the publisher. Under this Bill a new classification is made. The old classification was imported reading matter on the one hand and locally produced reading matter on the other, and only locally produced literature, which forms a very small part of what we read in this country, has access to the courts, and the rest was at the whim of the Minister. Under this Bill a new classification is made, as follows. On the one side there are hard cover books, books over 50 cents free on board. For the sake of simplicity, I will call these the expensive books. In the other class are the soft cover books, under 50 cents, which I will call the cheap books. So under this Bill books are divided into two classes, cheap and expensive books. I hope the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) will continue laughing after he has listened further. The expensive books are absolutely free and nobody can finally interfere with them except the courts. Nobody can ban an expensive book, neither the Minister nor this new Board. The only body which can ban it will be the highest court of the land.</p>

<p>Now, what will happen in practice? In practice this new board will read these expensive books and if they come across something offensive they must advise the Attorney-General to institute a prosecution, but the latter need not institute a prosecution if he does not wish to do so. So the books which are considered by this board to be undesirable will now be considered by the courts if the Attorney-General agrees.</p>

<p>What will be the position in practice? In practice these castes will go to court, and the court will lay down the norm. In future when this Board deals with these books they will have to take that into consideration. So what will happen now is that the highest Court in the country will lay down the norm, the code. So what we will have in practice is that the rule of law will be our only censor.</p>

<p>Then there are the cheap publications. According to this Bill, there is a complete prohibition on the importation of these cheap publications. If any importer wants to import such books, he has to apply for a permit. If the permit is not granted, he has the right to go to court.</p>

<p>Now, why this new division into expensive and cheap publications? Because, firstly, the most undesirable literature in the country is being imported from overseas and is not locally produced. I want to refer to a memorandum which was received from Professor Cronje, which says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ek moet daarop wys dat Suid-Afrika se probleem van ongewensdheid vir die oorgrote gedeelte uit die buiteland afkomstig is en dat dit hoegenaamd geen sin is om voort te gaan met &#x2019;n stelsel waarkragtens publikasies titel vir titel gewys verbied word nie.</block>

<p>Now, all of the undesirable reading matter in South Africa, 90 per cent consists of these cheap editions. I would just like to refer to the evidence of Mr. Hattingh before the Select Committee, in which he says the following. I asked him: &#x201C;In the case of more expensive books, do you find the percentage to be much smaller?&#x201D;, and his reply was: &#x201C;In the list of banned books published in 1956 I think only 50 or 60 hard-covered and more expensive books are found in the list which contain something like 4,000 titles.&#x201D; So far less than 10 per cent&#x2014;about 1 per cent&#x2014;are hard covers, and the rest are these cheap editions which constitute the undesirable literature. What will happen now? These importers must now put these books before the Board of Control and cannot import them without a permit from the board. Firstly, it will be very easy to administer, and the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) is completely wrong when he says that this big organization had many objections but did not give evidence, because they knew that even on their own evidence it could easily be proved that this was easy to administer. Because, firstly, the importers will have to pay a fee to put a book before the board. So the importers of these books, the vast bulk of which are over-runs and returns, and which are dumped in this country to-day at a price of one or two cents&#x2014;the importers will firstly be their own censors and will exclude the bulk or a great deal of that type of literature. Secondly, they will put only those books which they think are not undesirable before the board, and the board has many ways of dealing with that. The board can, e.g. decide that all the books of Agatha Christie may come in and give a permit for it. There is a provision in this Bill for a blanket permit. What is the position now? For the first time in the history of our control of reading matter in this country the courts come into the picture. For the first time what the courts will decide over a period of years will become the norm. Therefore I am completely justified in saying that what the courts are going to decide eventually, the rule of law, will eventually be your censorship in South Africa. There is no censorship by this board for the higher-priced books; they may not touch those. They can touch the lower-priced books, and there is pre-publication censorship, but that again can be tested in the courts. After a year or two the courts will lay down a norm which will have to be followed by the Board of Control. Sir, to read into that an attempt to stifle any criticism and to stifle the free flow of books, to interfere with literature, is the biggest nonsense in the world. I want to say this. I want to congratulate the Minister on this Bill. It is an excellent Bill. If this Bill is analysed and all sorts of ghost stories are not dreamt up about it, you will see that this is a Bill which brings the rule of law into our dealings with publications.

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, apart from the vehemence with which he put his arguments, we got only a series of half-truths from the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee), and I want to expose immediately some of the half-truths to which we have been subjected this afternoon. I will start by mentioning the last one.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Vereeniging has given us the impression that the Bill we are considering to-day is a liberalizing Bill; it is a Bill to improve the existing position and to introduce the rule of law into the whole question of censorship in this country, and generally speaking it is a Bill which people who want more progressive measures should welcome. This is the same sort of thing that we got in the titles of other Bills which have been presented to this House, like the Abolition of Passes Bill and the Extension of University Education Bill, which removed non-Whites from the Universities, and the Promotion of Bantu Self-Development Bill, the titles of which would give the impression that the House is going in for liberalizing measures. But of course on a proper examination of the measures before the House we see that that is not the case.</p>

<p>The hon. member said that nobody had come forward to raise objections to the Bill we are discussing to-day, i.e. the interested parties who gave evidence before the Select Committee. But surely the evidence which was presented by those people was on the subject of Bill No. 5 of 1962. The Bill we are examining to-day is Bill No. 6 of 1963, and it is quite different from the Bill which was before the Select Committee and upon which these witnesses gave evidence. May I ask the hon. member at which stage could interested parties have given further evidence to the Select Committee which surely has been dissolved in the interim?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>They were all asked to submit their evidence.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>As far as I know, there was no Select Committee to which such interested parties could be asked to submit evidence, so I cannot see that that argument can hold any water whatever.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said that the accusation that there was any political censorship <span class="col_459-460" refersTo="page_0244"/>attached to this Bill is completely untrue for the reason that 99 per cent of the criticism of this Government, he says, comes from the English language newspapers which belong to the National Press Union, and they are specifically excluded from the operation of this Bill. Well, that is true; they are excluded, but I cannot get the same degree of comfort from that that the hon. member does, and for two very simple reasons. The first is that those newspapers are already under threat of banning under the Sabotage Act. The hon. member knows that there is a section in the Sabotage Act, the General Laws Amendment Act, which enables the Minister to ban any newspaper which he feels goes too far in criticizing this Government&#x2014;not this Minister but the Minister of Justice, but it is nevertheless Cabinet responsibility, and therefore he knows that that threat is there already. The other reason why I take very little comfort from the fact that the N.P.U. newspapers are excluded from this Bill is the fact that hanging over their heads constantly is any amendment which could be introduced in this Bill, they have accepted a voluntary code because of these inherent threats, because of the Sabotage Act of last year, and because of the inherent threat contained in the Bill which they knew would be introduced in this House. This present Bill. There is a motion on the Order Paper already bringing this threat even closer to the newspapers of the N.P.U. So I take cold comfort from it. Indeed, I was extremely distressed that the N.P.U. should have accepted a voluntary code, because by so doing they conceded the basic principle that some sort of censorship of newspapers was necessary.</p>

<p>They accepted that principle and undermined freedom of expression in this country by accepting that voluntary code. My only thought was that South Africa badly needs the men we had in this country 130 years ago, the Pringles and the Fairbairns, the men who established a great principle, freedom of the Press, in the old Cape Colony, and those men are sadly lacking in South Africa to-day.</p>

<p>The other half-truth the hon. member mentioned was this question of the evidence presented by the Jewish Board of Deputies to the Select Committee. Sir, he read out correctly from this memorandum which I have before me the fact that the Jewish Board of Deputies objected to the racial incitement which was taking place in the country through the publications of people such as Schoeman and other neo-Nazis, and they ask therefore that some restrictions should be placed on such people. But they were very careful to point out also that despite the fact that they wanted it, they were very worried at the wide definitions in this Bill, and this is the portion which the hon. member failed to read out. The memorandum first of all mentions the definition of what could be an undesirable publication and then goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whilst appreciating the sentiments underlying the above provisions, it is believed that they are too wide and too vague and that in practice difficulties might be encountered in their application. In particular the phrase, &#x201C;<i>a</i> section of the inhabitants of the Republic&#x201D;, appears to be too wide and is likely to create difficulties in application. It is accordingly suggested that the above portions of the definition of &#x201C;undesirable publication&#x201D; should be somewhat narrower, and along the following lines: &#x201C;Any publication or object should be regarded as undesirable if it, or any part thereof, is designed or calculated to incite hostility, hatred or ill will against any racial or religious group or section of the inhabitants of the Republic.&#x201D;</block>

<p>[Interjection.] I will come to what I think in a moment, but what I am doing now is to dispel the incorrect impression created by the hon. member for Vereeniging about the memo presented to the Select Committee. My views, in fact, do not coincide with those of the Jewish Board of Deputies. I have my own views on the subject, which I will give. In regard to my own views, I want to say right away that I find this Bill abhorrent because it is just another step in the direction along which this Government has been taking the entire country since it came into power 14 years ago. It is another step in the direction of restrictions of individual freedoms, in this case the freedom of expression, one of the most cherished freedoms in the democratic world. Therefore, as far as I am concerned, I find it abhorrent. I am tired of having this Government throwing out largesse to an individual in the form of permits, permits to do this or that. No paperbacks will be allowed into the country except under permit. What right has any democratic government to make these prohibitions and then to dish out permits as if they are largesse? I find that abhorrent and I think this is an objectionable Bill. I agree with hon. members on this side who have stated that the basis of this Bill is not the suppression of smut; it is the suppression of criticism of this Government. That is what lies at the back of this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. member says it is untrue, he must examine the definitions in this Bill, which go very much further than <span class="col_461-462" refersTo="page_0245"/>any definitions contained in any other Act in any other country that I have examined. I have looked at the Cronje Report and I have read several authoritative books on the subject, but I have yet to find a single Act in another country which in any way has the same kind of definitions which we have in this Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker) in his speech yesterday told the House that we were stupid to imagine that the entry of classical literature into this country would in any way be prohibited, and he used as proof of this statement that already in this country for many years, despite customs officials who act as a censorship board, most of the classics have been coming into the country, particularly the Shakespearian classics. Therefore, he said, why should anyone imagine that the powers the Government is now taking will be used to suppress any sort of classical literature or any form of criticism of the Government? Sir, I use his own example. An examination of the list of books that have been banned by this Government, by this very Customs Board, will disclose that it is not only smut or undesirable literature that has been banned, but there are hundreds of titles on that list of books which are not only considered as modern classics, but hundreds of titles of books that are simply political or sociological or books discussing African affairs. So why should we imagine that the new board which will be a creature of the Minister and which will consist entirely of members nominated by the Minister, will be any different from the officials who have been stopping imported literature from entering this country? We know full well that in the list of banned books which that board will publish there will be hundreds of books which will be completely inoffensive as far as morals are concerned and as far as obscenity is concerned, and whose sole sin will be that they dared indulge in criticism of this Government. I am quite sure that in a year&#x2019;s time, when we examine the list which this board will publish&#x2014;because no objections from this side of the House will make the slightest difference to the passage of this Bill&#x2014;there will be hundreds of titles of books which have nothing to do with obscenity or even with racial incitement, which the hon. member for Vereeniging was so excited about, and nothing to do with offending the religious sentiments of anyone in the country, but books that criticize the political actions of the Government.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I say that because the list of banned books, banned in terms of the Customs Act, contains such books, books on African affairs and political criticism of the Government and books dealing with trade unionism. I say exactly the same will obtain as obtains now. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Other hon. members have mentioned that we have other laws on our statute book which do have a strong flavour of political censorship. There are the various Acts like the Suppression of Communism Act and the Riotous Assemblies Act. But the point is that this Bill will bring political comment within the control of a board which is not subject to the restraint of law and precedent, and it is a board which is not bound to hear evidence, nor is it bound to get outside expert opinion, or even to conduct its proceedings in an open forum, and that is what makes it a very dangerous and formidable form of censorship that we can expect. It is quite true, as the hon. member for Vereeniging has pointed out, that the right of appeal has now been included in this Bill. More largesse. We must all be grateful because the Government has decided to allow the right of appeal. Well, I will follow the example of hon. members opposite and thank the Minister, but I must say that it is the sort of thing which any normal democratic country would simply include as a matter of course in any legislation. But coming from this Government it is largesse. [Interjections.] I challenge the hon. member for Fort Beaufort to show me one country &#x2026; [Interjections.] I want to point out that even this right of appeal is strictly limited, because the definition of &#x201C;offensive or undesirable&#x201D; is so wide and is couched in such vague phrases that even if the power to make the final decision is in fact in the hands of the courts, the problem of giving such definitions complete meaning, or of limiting their ambit, will in fact be very difficult indeed, and the role of the court as an arbitrator is in fact very restricted. I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister and to the hon. member for Vereeniging, who asked for suggestions to improve the Bill, that certain things may be done. I want to make certain suggestions. The only way to bring this Bill into line with the existing legislation on obscene literature in other civilized countries would be to curtail strictly the definition of the word &#x201C;undesirable&#x201D;, i.e. severe curtailment of Clause 5. As it stands, the definition will reduce reading in this country to the level of the nursery, and it will severely inhibit writers in this country. I want to quote a statement which was made by Virginia Woolf before the Obscenity Act of 1959 was introduced in Britain, which of course considerably liberalized the existing law in England. At that stage the decision was left to what she called &#x201C;the police magistrate&#x201D; to decide whether or not literature should be censored. She said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The police magistrate&#x2019;s opinion is so incalculable&#x2014;he let pass so much that seems noxious and pounces upon so much that seems innocent&#x2014;that even the writer whose record is hitherto umblemished is uncertain what may or may not be judged obscene and hesitates in fear and suspicion. What he is about to write may seem to him perfectly innocent&#x2014;it may be essential to his book, yet he has to ask himself what the police magistrate will say, and not only what will the police magistrate say, but <span class="col_463-464" refersTo="page_0246"/>what will the printer say and what will the publisher say? For both printer and publisher will be trying uneasily and anxiously to anticipate the verdict of the police magistrate and will naturally bring pressure to bear upon the writer to put them beyond reach of the law. He will be asked to weaken, to soften, to omit. Such hesitation and suspense are fatal to freedom of mind, and freedom of mind is essential to good literature.</block>

<p>That is what she said in regard to the old law in England and the present law we are considering here goes a great deal further than that old law. What will be the position of the writers in this country, knowing that these heavy penalties hang over their heads, and what will be the position of printers and publishers knowing that heavy penalties hang over their heads? So the definition has to be severely changed. Then I suggest that the next change which should be introduced should be to leave all tests of undesirability to the courts and not to the board. The hon. member for Vereeniging gave us the impression that that is the case. That is not how I read the Bill. Clause 20 does not give me that impression, but perhaps the hon. the Minister in his reply will clarify it. As I read it, the actual test of undesirability is only ultimately left to the courts if there is an appeal against the decision of the board. But the first test of undesirability, the actual banning of a book, the publication of its title on the banned list, is in the hands of the board. I hope the Minister will clear that up. All that the board should be empowered to do, if there is to be a board at all&#x2014;and I do not want it to be assumed that I am in favour of the board&#x2014;should be to recommend that a prosecution be instituted by the Attorney-General, but it should not have the power of publishing findings on undesirability.</p>

<p>I have made it clear that I do not think that there should be a board and I will tell the hon. Minister why. Other countries are presumably just as concerned as South Africa is with preserving the high moral and ethical standards of citizens and protecting the young against undesirable literature and seeing that horror comics and smut are not published. I have tried very hard to find other countries in which boards operate and I could find only two examples in the whole of the English-speaking world. I may have missed some and if other members here know of others, they can tell me. I have studied an authoritative book on the subject, one in fact which was quoted by the Cronje Commission and that is &#x201C;Obscenity and the Law&#x201D; by Norman St. John-Stevas, a book which is supposed to be one of the authoritative books on this subject. According to that authority there is only one country in the English-speaking world&#x2014;and there is also Queensland in Australia&#x2014;which has any sort of board at all. Ireland is the big exception. Every other country retains the condition that issues of liberty or freedom of expression should be decided in the courts of the land. I am not thinking about individual state laws &#x2014;I will come to that in a minute&#x2014;because the Cronje Report is very misleading in this regard. [Interjection.] The hon. member is quite wrong; there are no boards in these countries; they have laws but no boards. The position in Ireland is most interesting because it is fairly similar to the position in this country. This is what the author says about Ireland. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Board has succeeded in keeping out of Ireland a great mass of pornography of a filthy and corruptive kind, but this has only been achieved at the price of depriving Irish readers of some of the best works of contemporary literature. In a debate in the Senate on 14 November 1945 Senator Kings-mill Moore described the Board&#x2019;s list as &#x201C;Everyman&#x2019;s guide to the modern classics&#x201D; and added that the working of the censorship &#x201C;had affronted the general opinion of decent and responsible men; the effect often has been to impose the view of five persons as a kind of fetter upon the intellect and information of the nation &#x201D;.</block>

<p>The only distinction I can see between Ireland and this country is that it will be the opinion of nine men instead of five.</p>

<p>The original censoring will be done by nine men. Every other country in the English-speaking world anyway has retained the tradition that all issues of liberty of freedom of expression must be decided in the ordinary courts of the land. The right to appeal is a different issue altogether. What I am talking about is the initial decision as to what is good or is not good for a nation to read, and this should not be left in the hands of a board.</p>

<p>The Cronje Commission has several objections to leaving things in the hands of the courts and they mention such things as lack of expert knowledge on the part of the courts, lack of uniformity, undue publicity, etc., if the courts make the decisions about undesirability. Sir, everyday our courts are called upon to make decisions on matters on which they may not be experts. The board anyway has only got three experts who have to be nominated to it, but the main test of undesirability is a matter of taste and good judgment. You do not need experts for that, and the courts are accustomed to having to give decisions every day on matters on which they may not be experts, and I think they are the most suitable people to do this. As for lack of uniformity, the reasons for the decisions that are given, not the actual decisions, are surely the things that establish uniformity in everything. When the courts give their reasons for coming to certain decisions&#x2014;not simply the basic decisions&#x2014;that is what establishes uniformity. As far as publicity is concerned it would be a good thing to have <span class="col_465-466" refersTo="page_0247"/>publicity for the simple reason that publicity in cases of this kind would be the sort of thing that would make everybody aware of the major principles which are applied in administering the law and surely that is the important thing. This Bill, as far as I can see, makes no mention of intent; in other words, it is no defence to prove that there was no intention of spreading undesirable literature. In the United Kingdom both under the Obscene Publications Act of 1959 and the Children and Young Persons Harmful Publications Act of 1955, it is a defence for a person prosecuted to prove that he has not examined the article in respect of which he is charged and had no reasonable cause to suspect that it was one to which the Act applied, so here too I think the Bill could be greatly improved if provision was made for lack of intention as a defence.</p>

<p>A great deal has been said in this House about the question of licence, about the abuse of freedom and so on, and I think everyone concedes at once that of course there are limitations to the so-called freedoms. We all know that. The hon. member for Fort Beaufort mentioned one example and I am sure there is not a member in this House who does not accept such limitations. In other words freedom of speech does not mean that I can libel or slander my neighbour. Every reasonable person accepts that. Every reasonable person would accept that freedom of movement does not mean, for instance, that I can trespass on my neighbour&#x2019;s property. We all know that. So it is a silly argument to use. We all accept that there are certain natural restrictions on freedom, but of course, the real problem&#x2014; and here I quote the words of Judge Frankfurter of the United States&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; is the formulation of constitutionally allowable safeguards which society may take against evil without impinging on the necessary dependence of a free society upon the fullest scope of free expression.</block>

<p>That, of course, is the problem. In the United States and in Britain the whole tendency in regard to the censorship of books has been in a liberalizing direction. There is the famous judgment of Judge Brown in the United States on this whole question of &#x201C;Lady Chatterley&#x2019;s Lover&#x201D; which interested one of the members on the Cross-Benches. The whole tendency, certainly in the judgment given by Judge Brown, is in a liberalizing direction. As far as the United States is concerned, the Higher Courts have indeed a very special regard for freedom of thought and expression and are prepared to set very narrow limits as to what can be suppressed on the ground of obscenity. Both in the United States Congress and in the State Legislature, the members there are addressing themselves seriously to the problem of devising obscenity laws which will leave serious literature alone and will at the same time be effective against commercial pornography. I say that it is misleading on the part of the Cronje Commission to have given the impression that the revision of the so-called norm to determine obscenity in different countries has been in the direction of tight control. It has been in quite the opposite direction, in the U.K. since the passing of the 1959 Act and in the U.S.A, since the judgment quite recently on the unexpurgated edition of &#x201C;Lady Chatterley&#x2019;s Lover &#x201D;. The whole direction has been towards liberalizing censorship of books. This country, of course, is going exactly in the opposite direction. There is no similarity as the hon. member for Fort Beaufort tried to tell us yesterday between this Bill and the legislation existing in other countries. There are many English-speaking countries that do have laws against obscenity but they do not have laws against the expression of political opinion, and however unpopular those opinions are, it is an accepted thing in democratic countries that it is the very essence of democracy to have the right to express unpopular ideas.</p>

<p>No, but I very much fear that as these pieces of legislation are put on the Statute Book I will be worried and worried very much indeed. I wish to be able to go on expressing my opinion about this Government in as strong terms as I possibly can, short of using libellous language. It is also true, Sir, that some continental countries do have legal curbs on racial incitement. There are countries such as West Germany, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands which have laws which are aimed against racial hatred, and incidentally nearly all of them are countries which have experienced the immediate impact of Nazi or Fascist regimes, but none of these countries even goes as far as this Government does in this Bill in its definition of what is undesirable and what can be regarded as racial incitement. I say that we are engaged on a dangerous course here to-day. We are going even further along the road of inhibiting thought and freedom of expression under threats of punishment, and I want to conclude by quoting the words of Erskine in his defence of Stockdale in his famous address on freedom of speech. He said&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton used the same approach as the previous speaker on the United Party side. I am convinced that they cannot attack the Bill directly because she tried, just as they did, to keep as far away from the Bill as possible and to use long quotations and to talk in such a way that she did not break the rules of the House. The hon. member tried to raise a hare and told us that this measure was &#x201C;another restriction, another suppression of freedom of expression &#x201D;. She ought to know that that is not <span class="col_467-468" refersTo="page_0248"/>so but the fact remains that she wants no control; she does not want the true Rule of Law and therefore she tells us that she is opposed to the adoption of the Press Code. She even tried to tell us that she was not in agreement with the Jewish Board of Deputies. Well, that is her way and we accept it as such. She does not want order; she wants chaos in regard to these matters. I admit that it was pleasant for me to have the opportunity of serving on the Select Committee which dealt with these matters. It was pleasant for me to note the large amount of co-operation and unanimity which prevailed at the meetings of the Select Committee between members on both sides of the House. I was very pleased to see how unanimously the members accepted and voted for the principle that legislation should be introduced to combat these pornographic and undesirable things. We did differ here and there but my impression was that we differed more on minor matters than on the really important question of pornography. We got on so well that I remember the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) saying on one occasion that most of the clauses were very good. Even in the House yesterday afternoon he said that much of what was in this Bill was very good, but towards the end of our deliberations the United Party turned around and retained the right, which of course they have, to vote against the Bill. What happened then? I should have been able to guess because in the <i>Cape Argus</i> of 8 May 1962 I read: &#x201C;United Party may fight the new Bill &#x201D;. It appeared to me that we had the same old story here; that once again, as usual, they received their instructions from outside and that is why we find that the position to-day is that hon. members of the United Party are in the unenviable position of having to oppose a measure with which they agree to a large extent; that they have to oppose a Bill which they helped to frame. I want to emphasize the fact that the hon. members were really helpful on the Select Committee. Not one of them said that they did not want the Bill. They really contributed towards and helped in the framing of this Bill. They now find themselves in the position where they have to break down what they helped to build up, and it is because they do not know how actually to attack the Bill. It is for that reason that we find the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) devoting much of his time not to this measure but to the old Bill of 1960. It is for that reason that we find the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) also coming to light with long quotations on themes and laws which have very little to do with this Bill That hon member admitted that he agreed that legislation was necessary. He still admits to-day that he believes that legislation is necessary. But now we find that the hon. member for Turffontein, in spite of the fact that he also voted in favour of it, is trying to make out that legislation is no longer necessary. Precisely because no argument can be raised against the Bill itself, we hear from the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) that their political rights are now being interfered with, their right to criticize. The hon. member for Houghton also said that their right to criticize was now being affected. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) sees in this &#x201C;an encroachment on the civil liberty to criticize in public &#x201D;. Where on earth does that appear in the Bill? Just about the only argument that he could raise against this Bill&#x2014;and the hon. member for Orange Grove also complained about it&#x2014;was that the norm laid down in Clause 5 (2) was too wide and too vague. He contended that it would be impossible for the Attorney-General to take action. He forgets, however, that that norm is almost word for word the same as the norm in the old law and that it is the same norm which has always been used in the past. He forgets to tell us that there is a difference and that the difference lies in the fact that there is now an appeal to the courts, and that the courts have to decide and that we will now find that as a result of various judgments of the court a clear indication will gradually be given as to what is decent or indecent. In other words, a clear indication will be given and there will be a better idea of the norm. We are told now that control is suddenly not necessary; that there are more than enough existing laws to solve all our problems. I admit that there are a number of laws dealing with this subject under discussion, but the fact remains that it has become necessary for those various laws to be consolidated into one law. The old saying is still true, that everyone&#x2019;s work is nobody&#x2019;s work. I. believe that to a very large extent that is the reason why the hon. member for Turffontein alleged yesterday that very few undesirable publications have been discovered during the past 20 years. I believe that that was to a large extent due to the fact that everyone&#x2019;s work was nobody&#x2019;s work. There was a lack of efficiency because of it. In spite of all the laws we have, we find that pornography has continued to increase, according to the Cronje Report. We have heard many complaints in connection with the soft-cover publications. In the <i>Cape Argus</i> of May 1962 I read the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">About 70 per cent of literature imported into South Africa will be subject to precensorship and need a permit to be brought into the country if the new Publications and Entertainments Bill becomes law. Blanket powers are being sought to prevent the entry of pornography and &#x201C;undesirable&#x201D; material.</block>

<p>That is precisely the problem&#x2014;that the 70 per cent which comes into the country gives us 90 per cent of our trouble. It is this material which gives us so much trouble and hon. members of the United Party want this material to be allowed freely into the country and expect us to do nothing&#x2014;which is apparently what the hon. member for Houghton wants; that nothing should be done and that we should allow any smutty document to enter the country. The <i>Sunday Times</i> of 6 May 1962. writes as follows:</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_469-470" refersTo="page_0249"/>Mr. R. B. Durrant, M.P., who sat on the Select Committee on the Undesirable Publications Bill which the new Bill replaces, told me yesterday: No civilized country has pre-censorship. The Bill smuggles in this dangerous principle through the backdoor, and there is no appeal to the Courts if the Board refuses an import permit.</block>

<p>But that is not the true position. The importer has every right&#x2014;which is protected by the Court&#x2014;to go to Court for the protection of his rights. Therefore, the information in this newspaper in the name of the hon. member is not correct. This control over the soft-cover publication is an indication to me that the Government is aware of the fact that there are various stages of development in our country as far as the people are concerned. And that brings this point to the fore, that expensive books will circulate amongst the highly-developed people, amongst the richer people. This will mean that one will have to deal with people who are more adult, who are better able to form their own opinion concerning that literature. The fact remains that it is amongst the rich that one finds the more educated and more adult thinkers. The number of books of a particular nature which they have will also be smaller. But the same book, if sold more cheaply, will be read by a far larger number of people and unfortunately, by people who are perhaps less able to judge for themselves. I know that it has already been argued that a book can be banned in its softcover form, but that it can slip through if it is not sold in the soft-cover form. We have heard a great deal, Mr. Speaker, about the question of censorship. Hon. members opposite maintain that this board will be a censorship board while we are convinced that it will not be censorship but control which this board will exercise. In connection with censorship someone said:</p>

<block name="quote">Censorship is undemocratic. The individual has the right to say, read, write, portray in any form whatever he wishes &#x2026;</block>

<p>&#x2014;and then we have the"but"&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">provided only that he does not thereby harm another individual who is unable to protect himself by the exercise of mature judgment.</block>

<p>I think that this is where the crux of our problem in South Africa lies. People tell us from morning till night that the right thing is not to have control and to make laws but to educate the people; that we must so educate the people that the individual knows the difference between what is decent and indecent and between good and bad. However, I repeat that the crux of the problem lies in the fact that we must see this matter against the background of the composition of our population. We must realize that there are various national groups in South Africa with various stages of development. In this country we have persons who are very highly developed but we also have persons&#x2014;and I am not speaking sneeringly; I am merely mentioning a fact&#x2014;who are still very much underdeveloped. Large numbers of them can read but we must admit that many of them still have the mentality of children&#x2014;measured against White standards at any rate&#x2014;and we must consider this matter when we say so glibly that there must be no control, but merely education. This type of person of whom I am thinking is very easily influenced. I as a doctor ought to know that pornographic literature or pictures very often have the unnecessary affect of exciting people sexually, with the usual violent results. We must realize that this type of thing can create race hatred on the part of these people, race hatred which may be completely uncontrolled. We must realize that the young plant of our Christian faith which has been implanted in these people and which is still very tender, can very easily be completely uprooted. That is why I say that we must be very careful and must realize that we must do everything in our power to prevent the indoctrination of these people, no matter in what way, indoctrination which can lead them astray. We have to have education but education does not stop in the home or in the school. It is something which continues throughout one&#x2019;s life and my contention is that the artist and the writer must be prepared to continue doing educative work after the child has left school. The writer must help educate and build up and he must not break down. We have a tremendous field lying fallow in South Africa. None of us who mean well with our country and with our fellowmen can afford to adopt a negative attitude or stand aloof from this problem. Each one of us has a duty to act positively and to help in the work of construction. We cannot expect these people to know the difference between what is good and what is bad. If one places good food and a packet of sweets before a child it is obvious that he is going to eat himself sick on the sweets. To expect untrained, uneducated, immature persons to decide what is good, is absolutely impossible. It is natural that they will be attracted by the sensational book while the good book which is usually a little dry in comparison will be thrust aside. In speaking about education, I maintain that education is not only intended for the reader. It may be that some of our writers also need educating. We can certainly not classify all our writers as being of the best. If there are bad writers we must educate them too. We know that most people are fundamentally good but perhaps because they want to become rich quickly some of them fall by the wayside and steal from and do material harm to their fellow-man. We do not think that it is wrong to sentence such a person, to punish such a person, even to send him to an institution for corrective training. How much more necessary is it then, if someone does another person not material but spiritual harm, that we should try to stop him, try to help him, try to educate him, reprimand <span class="col_471-472" refersTo="page_0250"/>him and if necessary, even punish him? <b>A</b> writer who wishes to get rich quickly or who wants to become popular quickly and who by his action harms another person spiritually, deserves to be punished. What I say of the writer holds good to a much larger extent for the publisher. We do not always realize how a publisher who wants to become rich quickly really does these things of which we are being accused. Because he finds that he makes most money out of the most sensational and most pornographic material, in reality he actually deprives the writer of his right and freedom to write as he feels and as he thinks. The publisher says that he does not want what is fine and good; he wants what is sensational. He compels the writer to write sensational material so that he, the publisher, can line his own pockets. Mr. Speaker, I accept the fact that we must have education but in this board which will be set up by this legislation I see a board which will act as an educator. The board will continue that education after a person has left school. The board will lay down the standard; the board will give guidance, guidance to the reader as well as to the writer. The board will not act autocratically and will not consist of a number of old women. The board will represent public opinion. Public opinion will eventually be the determining factor. I am quite convinced that if the board acts too strictly, public opinion will immediately make itself felt. If the board is too lax it can rest assured that the public will not remain silent. Besides this and having regard to the circumstances of the country and public opinion, the Courts will decide&#x2014;and this is very important&#x2014;whether things fall within the realms of decency or not.</p>

<p>A great deal has been said to-day about freedom and that the freedom of the individual should not be interfered with. It appears strange to me, Mr. Speaker, that so much emphasis is placed upon the freedom of those who really have no respect for what is fine, good and beautiful. Why should they be free to do evil? Why should the freedom which is given to them not be given to the same extent to those who wish to do good? There is freedom to help and to protect the weak. This Bill is not intended to remove any rights. This Bill is not intended to curtail liberties. In this Bill I see rather a controlling measure of constructive and educational value. I believe that it will eventually bring freedom to the spiritually weak. I believe that eventually it will bring with it that true freedom which we want to see in our country. I want to conclude by saying that if I know that I have made a contribution which will assist in placing this legislation on the Statute Book, it will give me great pleasure even though my contribution be merely to vote for it.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>One of the things which most clearly distinguishes the free world from the unfree and the totalitarian is the freedom of speech and publication; in other words, the right by means of the spoken or written word to criticize the existing state of affairs and to attack it, and to change and reform the social order. This freedom is basic to democracy which, as we know, is the basis of our Western civilization. N. P. van Wyk Louw put it this way&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An unmistakable part of every system which wants to be called democratic is the circulation of ideas.</block>

<p>It is the free circulation of all ideas, including those which might be unpopular. It is therefore obvious that when a Government introduces legislation of a matter which affects this fundamental freedom of the people, one then has the right to ask: How satisfied can one be with a Government which introduces and has to implement such legislation? What is the nature and the scope of the limitations imposed by the Act? And how suitable is the machinery which the Government wants to create to assist it to implement the underlying object of the Act? I think that the hon. the Minister expects the Opposition to be honest and frank in its criticism, and I will try to be fair, but as frank as possible with the Minister.</p>

<p>It has already appeared from the report of the Select Committee on the subject of undesirable publications that the Opposition is not opposed to suitable steps to cope with the dissemination of pornography and filth. In fact, at the moment there exists a whole series of measures restricting extravagances of this nature, and I cannot remember any occasion where the Opposition opposed these measures as such, although there is of course a difference between legislation and the way in which that legislation is implemented. It is perhaps true, as hon. members opposite argued, that measures in some form or other also exist in most of the important countries of the world to deal with these extravagances if necessary. I take it that in the old cultural countries from which we stem there are also measures of one kind or another to restrict these extravagances. There is, however, a very great difference between our position and that in our countries of origin. The difference is this: In our old countries of origin they have developed, in the fullness of their culture, a sort of realism and tolerance in regard to man and his inherent weaknesses and the tensions which are the cause of his unnatural life. The result is that in these countries they are just as concerned as we are about their codes of good behaviour, but that in addition they have over the years developed the wisdom to know when and where to close their eyes somewhat and, within limits, to exercise a little tolerant patience and to allow for certain deviations. Unfortunately we did not bring with us to this country that sense or realism from the old countries from which we stem. On the contrary, we suffer from an appreciable measure of Chauvinism. And the opposition of the Opposition to this Bill and the machinery which it creates to control the circulation of ideas is really based on a deep feeling of lack of confidence in the general approach of the Government which has to implement <span class="col_473-474" refersTo="page_0251"/>this legislation. I am sorry to say it, but I think that the Government has itself to blame for that; that it is the Government&#x2019;s own fault that in this respect people are sceptical of it. Experience has taught us that the Government has a very wide conception of what is &#x201C;obnoxious&#x201D;, and has developed a great measure of intolerance of individualism in the arts, just as it is openly inimical towards individualism in the personal relationships between people. I do not think we ever had a Government which so easily allows itself to be upset by the pressure of prudish people who see in everything that is new, a danger to the people and its morals, like the present Government. I think the hon. the Minister will understand what I mean. I just want to remind him of one incident, the case of the Kottler statue in Pretoria. A letter appeared in the <i>Transvaler,</i> followed by one or two more. If we had a Government which was strong in any way it would immediately have pointed out the puerility of their attitude to the objectors, and the whole thing would have died down within a few days. But the Government is so sensitive to the sentiments of this type of person who is always ready to take the mote out of another man&#x2019;s eye that it made itself guilty of the foolish vandalism which now forms part of the whole long history of bans issued in South Africa. I mention this one incident as an example of the type of action which has given the Government a reputation which is far from flattering and which makes the public at large, Afrikaans-as well as English-speaking, genuinely afraid of the practical results of legislation of so comprehensive a nature as in the Bill we now have before us.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister will, I am sure, argue that matters will be in the hands of the Board of Control over Publications, a Board which will act independently of him. Theoretically that is so, but in practice it will not work out that way. The Minister will appoint the members of the Board, and he alone. They will owe their posts, their tenure of office and their reappointment to the favour of the Minister and the Minister alone. Quite apart from that, it is obvious that the majority of the members of this new board, if not all of them, will be people who will be well disposed towards the politics or the general outlook and spiritual attitude of the Government. From the very nature of the matter it cannot be otherwise. The attitude revealed by a Government necessarily reflects the spirit of the officials and the public bodies it appoints and which are under its control. That which gives it pleasure, that which arouses its anger, that which is the desire of the Government, becomes the yardstick of these bodies appointed by the Government. Therefore I have no doubt that the Board of Control over Publications constituted by the Minister will also be a reflection of the wishes and the spirit of the Government. And for that reason the Opposition will now already have no confidence in the objectivity of that body and in this legislation which is before us, unless the Minister can find a way to constitute this Board, if it then has to be appointed, in such a way that it stands above all political suspicion and consists of eminent South Africans who are above all the petty prejudices of the ordinary man, and who have the reputation of having a broad human outlook.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Various Governments appoint various types of boards! In the present circumstances it would be best if this control board could rather be composed of people nominated by high-standing public bodies which have no axe to grind and who are independent of the political wishes of the Government of this country. Unless the Minister adopts such a method, I do not think he will be able to create confidence in this board. There is one alternative I wish to suggest to the Minister, and that is that the proposed board of control should be placed under the supervision of Parliament just like other control boards, so that they will have to account for their actions to a special Committee of this House every year, I should like to see this suggestion receiving serious consideration. I can see no sound reason why a board like this cannot account for its actions to a special Committee of this House, so that the Committee can question it, as happens in the case of other control boards. If other control boards in the country can be subjected to the supervision of this House, why not this one? The only alternative which will give a measure of satisfaction if the Minister persists in wanting to appoint the board himself is if he takes steps to place the activities of this board under the supervision of this House.</p>

<p>The provision in Clause 14 of the Bill which gives people the right to appeal to the courts against a decision of the board of control is of course a welcome one. But court cases of this nature are very expensive, and it takes a long time before a decision is arrived at. I just cannot see how in a case like this, where the banning of an entertainment show or of a single book is concerned, it will be worth while for the publisher or for the promoter of the show who feels aggrieved, and whose profits from the very nature of the matter are only slight, to go to the Supreme Court. I wonder whether that is not perhaps the reason why the film people did not insist on the right of appeal to the courts. I think it is essential to have it in the Bill, but I doubt whether it will have much practical value, because here one is dealing with a single book or with an entertainment which surely cannot wait six months for a decision.</p>

<p>It may still be a protracted case. Necessary as it is that <span class="col_475-476" refersTo="page_0252"/>the right of appeal to the courts should be granted, it will not amount to very much in practice. The best practical brake against extravagant action by the Control Board will be if that board can be held responsible by a Standing Committee of this House. And unless the Minister is prepared to adopt such a way out, he cannot expect the broad public to have any confidence in his board of control. We already have experience of the existing Board of Censors, which is also appointed by the Minister, and that board inspires everything but confidence. The Board is responsible to nobody but the Minister. There is no means by which even Parliament can judge properly as to whether this Board does its work well or whether it exceeds its duties. What have we found in regard to this Board? I think we will have precisely the same experience in regard to this new board of control which the Minister is going to appoint. Since July, 1956, when a consolidated list of &#x201C;obnoxious literature&#x201D; was published in the <i>Government Gazette,</i> altogether 87 supplementary lists of banned books have been published. According to that, up to to-day altogether 7, 497 titles have, been banned. The numbers are really much higher, because in many cases all future editions of a particular publication were banned. I. have carefully considered this list over the years and I have discovered two clear tendencies. The first is a totally unnecessary. prudishness in respect of works which are read in all civilized countries of the Western world, even works which in a sense become classics in their own particular category. I am not referring to the so-called &#x201C;penny horribles There is cheap literature, the titles of which are already so suspicious that it does not Require any particular exercise of judgment on the part of the Censor Board to ban it. In-the list of banned books I see titles like, e.g&#x201E; Careless Caresses&#x201D;, &#x201C;The Hard-boiled Virgin&#x201D;, &#x201C;The Sexual Life of Robinson Crusoe&#x201D;, &#x201C;Sabrina and the Senator&#x201D;, &#x201C;The Girl with the Golden Yo-Yo&#x201D;, and &#x201C;All the Girls were Willing I mention only a few of those which, by their very titles commend themselves for banning. Nobody objects to that. But what one objects to is that more serious works are banned, that there are bannings which are positively ridiculous. We remember the case of classics such as &#x201C;The Cossacks&#x201D; of Leo Tolstoy and &#x201C;The Insulted and Humiliated&#x201D; by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, &#x201C;Mumu&#x201D; by Turgenev&#x2014;all well known classics which were banned. The joke is that within a month the ban was lifted again. The Minister who was in control then is the present Minister of Finance. My impression is that he blindly signed the list submitted to him by the Censor Board, until his attention was drawn to the matter and the ban was lifted. Precisely the same thing happened in regard to &#x201C;Bonjour Tristesse&#x201D; by Francoise Sagan. It was banned in September, 1958, but exactly two months later the ban was withdrawn again. Well, a book cannot be indecent and obnoxious one day and just a month later it is no longer indecent or obnoxious. I can give many examples of this. We had the case of the Pelican issue of &#x201C;Homosexuality&#x201D; by Dr. D. J. West, which was also banned. In that regard the S.A. Medical Journal wrote the following in a leading article, as reported in the <i>Burger</i> of 16th December, 1961&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To our professional embarrassment and to our scientific consternation, we have to point out that a well known standard work on homosexuality which was written and published by a British psychologist in 1955 has recently been banned in South Africa.</block>

<p>We have had the banning of the political biography of Stalin by Isaac Deutscher; This work was not a communistic piece-of propaganda but a standard work which as used in the political science section of our universities as a scientific handbook. It was banned in August, 1961, and seven months later the ban was withdrawn. This is the sort of thing of which I can give many more examples, this sort of prudishness, childishness and the injudicious actions of the Government&#x2019;s Censor Board which led to the <i>Cape Times</i> referring to &#x201C;a committee of burgesses who presumably will reject anything unsuitable for a 14-year-old schoolgirl &#x201D;. If one -has regard to the names of authors of standing whose books have all been banned, one cannot but have a lack of confidence in the type of board of control appointed by-the Government. One gains the impression that the reading privileges of the country must fit in with what is good enough to be prescribed as a school book. When it comes to political works one justifiably gains the impression that the Censor Board is of the opinion that if a Native may not read a book in this apartheid country of ours, then the Prime Minister and the White people may not read it either. In fact, apart from pornography and communist propaganda, it seems to me that the whole standpoint of the Censor Board to-day rests on this, that if the Native may not read a book, according to his judgment, everybody must be deprived of it. The Censor Board itself is responsible for the fact that the public has gained that impression.</p>

<p>That brings me to the second dangerous tendency I discern on the part of the Censor Board. I again want to point out that this is a board which enjoys the confidence of the Minister and which reflects the mentality of the Government&#x2014;a situation which will be repeated in the new Board of Control. In recent years the Government has developed a peculiar sensitivity towards criticism, particularly in regard to its policy of apartheid. In its mind the term &#x201C;undesirable&#x201D; has now been given the meaning of a standpoint which is unpopular in terms of its policy, and the more sensitive the Government has become of criticism, the more sensitive the Censor Board has become. The result is that a second dangerous tendency has become discernible on the part of the Censor Board, namely that just recently increasingly more well known works have been banned for one reason only, namely because the Government does not like <span class="col_477-478" refersTo="page_0253"/>the person or the politics of the author, or because it is critical of the racial politics of the Government. There was the well-known case of Nadine Gordimer&#x2019;s &#x201C;World of Strangers&#x201D;, the coft-cover issue of which was banned. When protest was voiced against that, the Government Press frankly admitted that this book was &#x201C;a danger to the racial policy of the Government &#x201D;. The <i>Burger</i> of 5th March, 1962, reported the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The official standpoint is that the book can undermine the traditional racial policy in the Republic. That is the reason for the prohibition on the dissemination of this cheap issue.</block>

<p>I wonder whether there can be a more dangerous standpoint against the Government&#x2019;s racial policy than that contained in the New Testament! That is the position we have reached, and the position is evidently that as soon as criticism of the Government&#x2019;s racial policy becomes too convincing, as soon as the author is a man of such standing that his criticism becomes too, dangerous for the Government, the book must be banned, One of the most disconcerting aspects of this banning is the fact that books are, now banned on a large scale which have been standing on the shelves of book collectors for years already. I want to give, the Minister a few practical examples of books I had on my own shelves for years and which have recently suddenly been banned. There is &#x201C;Independence for Africa &#x2019;&#x2019; by Gwendolyn M. Carter. It is a factual book dealing with developments in Africa written by a clever authoress with a particularly perceptive mind.</p>

<p>Yes. I have read this book. It stood on my bookshelf before it was banned. After having re-read it objectively, I can find no other reason for the book being banned than that in the section dealing with South Africa it was critical of the Government&#x2019;s racial policy and the incidents at Sharpeville. Surely we cannot continually shut our eyes to the way in which other people see us? There is another book, Dr. Nkrumah&#x2019;s autobiography, entitled &#x201C;Ghana&#x201D;. This book was published in 1957 and has been circulating in South Africa ever since that time, but 41 years later, in December 1961, it was suddenly banned. That is also a book I read. One asks oneself, whether one likes Dr. Nkrumah or not, how on earth we as an African state can understand developments in Africa if we may not even read the history of the development of Ghana and of Dr. Nkrumah.</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P</person>:</from>

<p>I was just going to put a question to the Minister in that regard. One of the most remarkable cases was that of Hans de Boer, the author of a German book &#x201C;Unterwegs Notiert &#x201D;. I know him personally. He was in South West Africa for some time as the business partner of a man who at that time was a Senator of the National Party. Thereafter he became a travelling secretary of the Y.M.C.A., and then he wrote this book about his world travels and expressed a little criticism in regard to the practice of racial discrimination in South Africa. The point, however, is that this book was published in 1956, in German. Consequently it could only have had a very small circulation here and I doubt whether one would still have been able to find it in any bookshop in South Africa. It had evidently disappeared from the scene long ago, but suddenly in 1962 this book was banned. In 1957 I bought it and five years later it was suddenly banned. So I can also mention &#x201C;African Profiles&#x201D; by Ronald Segal, a documentary work; &#x201C;Passive Resistance in South Africa&#x201D; by Professor Leo Kuper, also a documentary work dealing with a very interesting portion of our political history. I think any student of politics would be interested in this history and the driving force behind the passive resistance movement in South Africa. This is the type of book, which has been banned on a large scale. And in respect of those which I have read, I could find no reason for the banning other than that the Government does not like the author or the criticism of its policy. For no other reason! We have reached the stage where everything which hurts the Government party politically is being banned to an increasing extent, and I am afraid that at the moment a small imposition is going back on all the steps of the past to sniff out books which have been in the possession of people for years already. I should like to ask the Minister this. What does he expect a collector of political works to do with books which he bought legally years ago but which have now suddenly become obnoxious? I shall be glad if the Minister will give us a frank reply to that question. If I throw them away, other people who do not know that they have been banned may perhaps pick them up and unknowingly make themselves guilty of a contravention. As it is, I come across very few private libraries in the country which do not unknowingly contain banned books. Booklovers simply cannot keep pace with all the books that are banned, usually not books which are pornographic, but political works which are of interest to any student of politics, but which have been banned because they contain criticism of the Government. I want to ask the Minister frankly whether he wants us to go back to the Middle Ages and every once in a while, on the instructions of the authority, as it were, organize a book-burning? Is that what we are to do? Are we to burn our books? I expect an honest reply from the Minister, because as a book-lover I am concerned to see to what an increasing <span class="col_479-480" refersTo="page_0254"/>extent in recent years political works which have been standing on people&#x2019;s bookshelves for years are being banned.</p>

<p>To sum up, our objection to this Bill amounts to this. In the first place there is no reason for believing that the new Control Board will differ much in its composition from the existing Censor Board. If the Minister holds out the prospect of a change, let him tell us. For example, on the present Censor Board a political author has been appointed who in my opinion is a racist who in his time was openly an anti-Semite and one who has connections with all kinds of neo-fascist organizations in the Southern States of America. The hon. the Minister will know who I am referring to. I feel convinced that this type of element on the Censor Board has much to do with the flood of bans of political books we have had recently, and it is disconcerting to think that such people should be allowed to decide arbitrarily what I may read or may not read. I do not blame the Minister for everything. No Minister can read all the books himself which are contained on the list submitted to him for banning by the Censor Board. In regard to certain books, I do in fact blame him, seeing that he could easily have used his own judgment, but nobody expects him to do the impossible. But it is in fact this type of control the Government has instituted which is responsible for this state of affairs, and now he is again going to appoint a board which will still be of the same nature and in addition will also have power over domestic publications. In the first place, therefore, we are opposed to the Bill because, on the basis of our experience of the existing Central Board, we already have no confidence in the board which the Minister will appoint as a politician. We are against the Bill because we have no reason for believing that the new Control Board will not reflect the Government&#x2019;s political feuds to the same extent as the existing Central Board. Furthermore, as matters stand now, we are opposed to the idea of domestic censorship. The Minister says it is not censorship but control, but surely it is control with the power to censor. It is therefore the same thing. In the circumstances in which we are being governed to-day, we cannot lightly accept the principle of domestic censorship. Nor do I believe that matters have already developed to such an extent that we should apply domestic censorship. When once the machinery has been created and the road has been opened for domestic control and censorship, we will have a flood of complaints from those small groups of unsavoury busybodies one finds in every society in the world. In every community one finds people who claim every freedom to announce their own ideas but who do not want other people to have the same freedom.</p>

<p>I may have my faults, but one fault I do not have is that I do not become impatient when another man wants to put his standpoint. Never. I would be the last to deny somebody else the right to say something undesirable and to criticize matters. Why should we be so sensitive when somebody says something which is alleged to be obnoxious? What is the actual meaning of obnoxiousness? The great satirists of the world, great authors like Voltaire and Oscar Wilde, are often instruments who assist people and nations to maintain their balance. A man is either ridiculous or he is not. In politics the one side is continually busy trying to ridicule the other. Is there now to be legislation to prevent it? There is sufficient machinery to combat the importation and distribution of pornography and communist propaganda, and nobody has any objection to that, and internal censorship is not necessary for that. We further object to the fact that, where a board of control is now going to be appointed, provision is not even made in the Bill for parliamentary supervision over the activities of this board.</p>

<p>Furthermore, this Bill, as it reads, attaches a meaning to the concept &#x201C;obnoxious&#x201D;, which is in fact obnoxious to anyone who believes in democracy. In my opinion, this Bill opens the door wide for interference in the matters of political parties, which particularly in election times can lead to abuse. But it would perhaps be better for us to deal with these aspects in the Committee Stage, so that I will not go into it further now.</p>

<p>Finally, what the Censor Board and the hon. the Minister do not realize either is that the type of censorship be applies, and which will now increase in scope by the application of domestic censorship, often has just the opposite effect from what they desire, and that will time and again harm South Africa&#x2019;s good name in the outside world.

<p>One regrets that on the part of the Opposition one finds a frame of mind of chronic fear and suspicion in regard to any legislation introduced by this Government. This chronic fear and suspicion with which the Opposition is obsessed has the effect that they cannot or will not judge of matters soberly in this House. Therefore one is sorry that in regard to this legislation the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) and the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson) also tried beforehand to sow suspicion against this board and the integrity of the board. This Bill particularly aims at freeing the board from political influences, the political influence which the Minister has in respect of the board, and to place control of the board in the hands of the courts of the land. But in spite of that, hon. members opposite still accused the Government of wishing to make misuse of the board for political purposes. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout has also done so now. One can differ on the matter, but in view of the fact that an attempt is being made here to appoint a board of a high standard, as provided for in the Bill, and as in the second place an appeal to the courts is provided for, instead of <span class="col_481-482" refersTo="page_0255"/>to the Minister who is a political figure, that proves that this is an attempt to raise the level on which these things will be judged.</p>

<p>To compare this with the present Censor Board and its actions is quite wrong. It is true that this Censor Board made mistakes, as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout has stated. I expect the Censor Board of the future will also make mistakes. But I want to add that if one compares the number of books those people had to handle with the number of books in regard to which mistakes were made, it is a very small percentage. It is human to err, but where we now under the new system place a prohibition on a large series of books I think that is an attempt to facilitate the work of the board and to enable it to handle its work better, and in addition to give it the opportunity to judge matters beforehand. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout referred to books standing on the shelves for six years, but that is just what one wants to prevent, and I hope that in future it will be avoided.</p>

<p>I want to go further. The hon. member who has just resumed his seat does not want to acknowledge the power the courts will have, and I think that is a very important new course which is being adopted in this Bill, namely that we are depriving the board of any political influence. It will in fact be a board appointed by the Minister, but in terms of this Bill it will be a board which can be appointed on a higher level than the existing one.</p>

<p>I also want to point out that particularly in the past 20 years we have been faced with the problem of soft cover books entering the country in large numbers, and that is the problem with which we have to cope to-day. Therefore in terms of this Bill, books of a higher standard, of a higher price, will be allowed to enter the country and there is no control over them. I want to point out that we are really just making an attempt to keep out the cheap literature.</p>

<p>I want to say immediately that I do not doubt the right of the Opposition to plead for the preservation of personal liberty in this country. They have the right to plead for personal liberties in this country in season and out of it. But I also want to assure hon. members opposite that we do not intend curtailing the personal freedom of people in this country either, except in so far as they constitute a threat to freedom itself. Mr. Speaker, freedom is never an unbridled, uncontrolled thing without limits. Uncontrolled freedom carries within it the germ of its own doom. We on both sides of the House are descendants of people who love freedom and fought for it. We ourselves fought for years for our freedom on various levels, personal freedom, political freedom, constitutional freedom and freedom of personal dignity. We would be untrue to the traditions and the national character of this country if we were to allow personal freedom to be curtailed more than it is in any country, namely to the extent of even freedom itself becoming threatened.</p>

<p>There is no country where there are no limitations. I challenge the Opposition to mention any country to me, from the greatest democracy to the greatest dictatorship, where certain limits are not set to freedom. Freedom without those limits must eventually lead to anarchy and chaos and to the doom of freedom itself. We cannot allow people to make use of the freedom in our country for the very purpose of undermining that freedom. Nor can we give people the right to use freedom to destroy democracy, and we cannot give people the right to undermine the social and spiritual foundations of the nation so that eventually we will no longer be able to maintain and to defend our freedom and we become so weak-kneed that we can no longer safeguard our own freedom. Therefore we want to be enabled to preserve and to defend our own freedom, and for that reason we want to protect our freedom by applying certain limitations. I repeat that I challenge the Opposition to mention a single country in the world where there are not certain limitations on freedom.</p>

<p>The Opposition agrees with us in regard to the principle of this Bill, but they have all kinds of reservations. In the Select Committee the Opposition voted for the principle of this Bill, but when we now come to the provisions of the Bill they say the Bill goes too far. The question therefore is really whether this Bill goes too far in the limits it applies. In connection with this matter I tried to ascertain what the position was in other countries, and in my search I came across a very interesting book which. I think, will carry weight with the Opposition because it is a study made under the protection of UNESCO in regard to the limits placed on freedom in the various countries of the world, and in this UNESCO report it is admitted that limits are placed on freedom in many countries and they even summarize the mistakes which the printing press may make. They point out that no legal system in any country has given a comprehensive definition of all the mistakes of the Press, and then they themselves try to summarize the mistakes the Press can make. This book also deals with radio and films, and then they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">These three kinds of press activity can thus involve three categories of offences; and these three categories cover all Press offences.</block>

<block name="quote">In the first category, that of offences connected with information, we place: The disclosure of secrets of national defence or other official secrets; information calculated to impede the course of justice; attacks on the national credit; publication of matter injurious to the family; childhood or public health; and false news.</block>

<block name="quote">The second category of subversive opinions will comprise: Incitement to treason, espionage, disorder, rioting and civil war; the stirring up of hatred or contempt for the government or the regime; incitement to mutiny, crime or other law-breaking; propaganda for, and defence of, sedition; blasphemy and offences against religion; obscenity <span class="col_483-484" refersTo="page_0256"/>and offences against good morals.</block>

<block name="quote">In the third category, that of injury to third persons, will fall: Insults, flagrant insult, abuse, libel and slander levelled against heads of states whether national or foreign, diplomatic representatives, public men or private individuals; slanderous attacks; blackmail; and wrong done to the memory of the dead.</block>

<p>Here is a comprehensive list which goes very much further than what is provided for in this Bill and UNESCO gives that as examples of the misconduct and mistakes of the Press. Then various categories of this misconduct are dealt with further and I hope hon. members will bear with me if I refer to various aspects of this misconduct. Under the heading &#x201C;Injury to Good Morals&#x201D; the report says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In all countries, the law punishes offences against good morals and obscenity by whatever means committed.</block>

<block name="quote">In most, it further prescribes special rules governing the Press or at least the various means of publication (speeches, songs, posters, books and journals, drawings, pictures or photographs). Such rules punish both news and opinions prejudicial to good morals.</block>

<p>And then they mention the countries: &#x201C;Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden, the United States (Federal laws, state laws)&#x201D;, and then they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In some countries, however, the law goes further, prohibiting the publication of news held to be immoral, even if such news is not strictly an offence against good morals.</block>

<p>That is what they say in connection with &#x201C;Injury to Good Morals &#x201D;. But I want to come to what they say about &#x201C;Injury to Family Life&#x201D;, and there they say the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In every country, the law protects the family by forbidding slander and libel, i.e., the making of statements, whether true or false, damaging to the honour or reputation of private individuals.</block>

<block name="quote">Many laws, therefore, prohibit the publication of certain forms of information injurious to family life. In such cases, the judge need not enquire whether the information published constitutes a libel or not. He punishes the journalist for publishing prohibited information.</block>

<p>Then they again mention the countries&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Press law in France prohibits the reporting of libel or slander actions, paternity suits and divorce or judicial separation cases. Identical rules exist in the Lebanon, and in Uruguay. Mexican law goes even further; it prohibits the publication of any material relating to proceedings dealing with adultery, indecent behaviour, rape, attacks on private life, divorce, paternity or maternity, or annulment of marriage; nor does it allow publication of the names of the victims in cases of indecent behaviour.</block>

<p>That goes much further than this Bill does. If people say that we now have a police state here, my reply is that I think we have much more personal liberty than there is in certain of the countries mentioned. Then we get to the next heading, &#x201C;Defence of Anarchy, Crime and Felony &#x201D;. The question is asked&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Can the journalist publish anti-social opinions? We have seen that he is generally free to say what he thinks about political regime of his own or other countries, provided he does not indulge in basically unfair, malicious or dishonest criticism; and that freedom in this respect is generally more complete in regard to other countries than in regard to his own. But this freedom in the field of political or international affairs does not give him the right to undermine the foundations of social life. All peoples, whatever be the nature of their governments, always obey certain unwritten principles&#x2014;respect for life and property, the conception of the state and obedience to the authorities. Not to do so would amount to anarchy; and against that malady the nations fight, since it is perhaps even more serious for them than war or civil war.</block>

<p>We have, for example, blasphemy and offences against religion. There they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">English law, for example, punishes blasphemous libels, i.e. blasphemous writings that attack religion and show premeditation to corrupt, offend or mislead other persons by means of licentious or abusive attacks upon sacred objects, or by the repetition of false arguments, or by wilful distortion of the truth. This prescription makes it illegal, for instance, to criticize in the Press the Old or New Testament or the Book of Common Prayer of the Church of England.</block>

<p>One is surprised at what is done in other countries and not done here, and that nobody there says a word against what is done there. Then we have the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Publication of matter liable to pervert children and young persons: However devoted one may be to the freedom of the Press, one is compelled to lay down a limit where children are concerned. The Press influences opinion; this is undeniable and it is indeed one of its greatest qualities. But while its influence is rarely harmful to those whose minds are sufficiently mature to be capable, as a general rule, of distinguishing between good and bad, this is not necessarily true of children and young persons whose critical judgment is still undeveloped. Education at home, and school education, are intended to lead children to grow up into men and women capable of understanding and judging. The effects of <span class="col_485-486" refersTo="page_0257"/>education must not be prejudiced and even destroyed by the pernicious influence of a certain kind of Press. It is true that in every country the law punishes offences against morality and forbids immoral publications; and it thereby protects children in the same degree as it protects the public in general. But many countries, especially since the last war, have judged it necessary to enact special protection for the young.</block>

<p>I mention these facts taken from the report of UNESCO in order to prove that it is not only in our country that we are concerned about the undermining of our spiritual and moral life by pornographic literature, but that this is the case in almost all countries of the world.</p>

<p>I further want to point, in connection with the accusation hon. members opposite make in regard to the reason why we place this prohibition on cheap literature entering the country if it costs less than 50 cents, to what they call &#x201C;special rules governing foreign countries&#x201D;, They say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Under certain regimes they may only be exercised, in normal times, for the protection of public morals. In Belgium, e.g., the law of 11 April 1936 empowers the King by an order in Council to prohibit the import into Belgium of obscene foreign publications. Similar provisions were enacted in Luxembourg by a law of 29 December 1937. In some countries wider powers are granted to prohibit foreign publications. Article 14 of the Danish Press Law authorizes the suspension of all publications printed abroad the contents of which are found to be of a criminal nature. In Switzerland, by Article 9 of the Law of the Canton Vaud of 14 December 1937, as amended by the law of 19 November 1940, the Cantonal Council may prohibit the introduction and circulation in the Canton of foreign publications whose contents are of a nature to cause grave injury to public order or public credit. Prohibited publications may be seized by order of the Cantonal Council.</block>

<p>So it goes on, and they point to what happens in America&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Many states therefore enact special laws to prevent such circulation. In the United States, for example, federal law prohibits the importation of obscene matter, or the passage of obscene films from one state to another.</block>

<p>I have mentioned this because the hon. member for Houghton said that we go much further. But here we find that many countries go much further than we envisage in this Bill. I say that one comes to the conclusion that other countries are just as concerned as we are about the role the printing Press plays in the various forms of publication, and whilst I am on this subject I want to express my thanks in the first place to the Government for having seen fit to exclude the newspapers belonging to the Press Union and giving them the opportunity of putting their own house in order. The onus now rest on those newspapers to do so, hut whilst I am on the point I also want to mention that even in England they have now already had the second Press Commission. [Interjection.] The last one was the so-called Shawcross Commission, and it is interesting to see that one of the recommendations of that commission was the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We recommend that the constituent bodies should reconstitute the General Council of the Press, so as to comply with the recommendation of the 1949 Commission that there should be a lay chairman and a substantial lay membership.</block>

<block name="quote">We recommend that the Government should specify a time limit after which legislation would be introduced for the establishment of such a Press council if in the meantime it had not been set up voluntarily.</block>

<p>Hon. members opposite accuse this Government of all kinds of things, but I have shown that even in the biggest democracies people are also concerned about what happens in regard to the Press. Therefore I say that whilst we have now given the Press the opportunity to bring its own house in order I am glad that they have been excluded from the provisions of this Bill.</p>

<p>Now I want to say something about soft cover books. The provisions of this Bill are only an attempt to create workable machinery, because if these thousands of books have once been allowed to enter the country one can apply no censorship. When once that stream of soft cover books reaches the shelves of the bookshops and the caf&#x00E9;s, no control can be exercised Over it, and because we want to take action against 90 per cent of these books the best thing is to prohibit them. If hon. members can suggest any other workable method, I shall be glad. But whilst we will allow good books to enter the country freely, this is an attempt to keep out the thousands of cheap books which are dumped in this country by people who have no regard for the morals of our nation and do so merely for profit. Therefore I say that this is only an attempt to create workable machinery to control the inflow of those books.</p>

<p>Now I want to say something about the vagueness of the norm. In this report of UNESCO they also refer to the vagueness of the norm and point out that it is deliberately vague so that the courts can operate more efficiently. They say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As regards the definition of the offence against immorality, the law in many countries has recourse to vague terms, such as those quoted above in reference to Anglo-Saxon law. In still more it attempts no definition at all. Views on the subject change with the times and a host of authors whose <span class="col_487-488" refersTo="page_0258"/>work later came to be regarded as literary masterpieces were prosecuted and convicted in their day for offences against morality. It must therefore be left to judge and jury to decide whether an incriminated work does or does not constitute such an offence according to the public opinion of the day.</block>

<p>In other words, even this book which gives a summary of the practice in the various countries comes to the conclusion that it is better to leave the definition of the norm vague and to give the courts greater freedom to lay down what the norm should be. Therefore I say it is a pity that hon. members regard everything that this Government does with suspicion and fear. I believe it is our duty to protect our people against this new development in the world of literature, these soft cover books, the widespread dissemination of cheap reading matter. I think we would be doing our country a service if we could even to some extent succeed in coping with the evil presented by these books.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it seems to me that it is indeed a Gilbertian situation when I rise here to make a plea, as I intend to do, to the Minister of Education, Arts and Science for the freedom of the arts, for the freedom of self-expression of the artist, the writer, the poet, the sculptor, the film-maker, and for freedom of thought and expression for all. I think it is a Gilbertian situation, because it is he, and not I, who should be making that plea. After all, there sits the Minister of Education, Arts and Science&#x2014;and if he has one function, leaving out the question of education or science, it is to maintain the position of the arts in the life of our community, and to advance the position of the arts; and he can only do so if he continues to advocate and in fact to fight like a tiger for the freedom of the arts and the artist. But, you see, Sir, the rather peculiar position that arises through the combination or portfolios. The Minister finds himself in the well-known position of Pooh-Bah in &#x201C;The Mikado&#x201D;, where he combines all those important functions in his one person. He is the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Lord Chief Justice and everything that matters. I must concede that the Minister is in a very peculiar position because it seems to me that at some stage he must have had a conference between the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Education, Arts and Science.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>It happens very often.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>The point I am trying to make&#x2014;and the hon. the Minister has already conceded the point&#x2014;is that he, as a member of this House and as an individual, has two completely different functions to exercise in those two capacities of Minister of the Interior and Minister of Education, Arts and Science, and although he is to-day piloting this Bill through the House as Minister of the Interior, I want to appeal to him as Minister of Education, Arts and Science; In doing so, I know the Minister has already been fair enough to concede that there is this conflict, and I can only hope that he will give some reasonable consideration to what has been said from this side of the House and to what I propose to say.</p>

<p>The Minister had a great deal to say about the Press Code which, he said in effect, showed how this particular Bill was in fact a measure designed to provide a certain stability in a certain field of our communal life, and had no implications whatever in regard to what he called censorship. He said that there was this Press Code &#x201C;for the observance of the highest duty of newspapers to observe in the presentation of news, etc., and that there should be no deliberate distortion by suppression summarization&#x201D;, etc. etc. and then he said that in 1962 the <i>Cape Times</i> accepted the Press Code. Now I am not here to hold a brief for the <i>Cape Times</i> or any other newspaper, but I put it to the Minister with deference that he need not be surprised that the <i>Cape Times</i> supported the Press Code, because it was a voluntary undertaking by the <i>Cape Times</i> and the other newspapers to observe a certain code of honour, if I may call it that, and not the imposition by the State of any law which would make the conduct of the affairs of any newspaper extremely difficult and susceptible to the penalties of the law. It is a very different situation and I think, with respect, that the Minister should not pursue that analogy too far, even if the <i>Cape Times,</i> which enjoyed his favour in 1962 by supporting the Press Code, fell foul of him yesterday by referring to the proposed Board of Control as a &#x201C;collection of old women of both sexes &#x201D;. He should try to be a little more objective than that.</p>

<p>The other point that struck me particularly about the Minister&#x2019;s introductory speech was the stress he placed on the opinion of Mr. Justice Marais. He referred to &#x201C;Standpunte&#x201D;, in which a certain article by Mr. Justice Marais appeared. I think he referred to it no fewer than four times, and it would seem to me that this Bill, if it becomes an Act, could well be known as the Marais Act, and that it is the result entirely of the thinking of Mr. Justice Marais. If I have gained that impression without justification, the Minister has himself to blame for it. But what Mr. Justice Marais said in &#x201C;Standpunte&#x201D; should also be compared with what he said on another occasion, and although several hon. members referred, as did the Minister, to the interviews given by certain people to <i>Dagbreek,</i> which were published in the last issue, and in fact the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker) read part of it, they all seemed to shy away from one of the statements which Mr. Justice Marais made in the same interview. Incidentally, I do not know whether this will impress the Minister, because he dismissed all these people who were reported in <i>Dagbreek</i> as &#x201C;daardie slim mense&#x201D;, and by implication <span class="col_489-490" refersTo="page_0259"/>although Mr. Justice Marais of &#x201C;Standpunte&#x201D;, is a learned judge and an authority on the arts according to the Minister, the same Mr. Justice Marais of <i>Dagbreek</i> is only one of those &#x201C;slim mense &#x201D;. That is what he said about all these people. This gentleman said, amongst other things: &#x201C;Ons het net een tekort-koming in die wetsontwerp gesien.&#x201D; In other words, there is one defect, and it is not the perfection the hon. the Minister held out as a result of the opinions of Mr. Justice Marais as expressed to him or as written in &#x201C;Standpunte&#x201D;, &#x201C;dat daar geen verwysing na die artistiese aspek van die omstrede publikasie is nie &#x201D;. There is no reference to the artistic aspect of a publication which is in dispute or in debate. Surely that is a very important matter for the Minister of Education, Arts and Science. How can he, in that capacity, accept a piece of legislation, however well meant by his colleague the Minister of the Interior, which immediately, according to his best authority so far, Mr. Justice Marais, inhibits the artistic aspect of the creative arts of this country? I have not always had very satisfactory answers from the hon. the Minister. I realize I am only a back-bencher, but I hope that on this occasion the Minister will at least put me on the right road in regard to this peculiar conflict of opinion between the learned Judge as reported in one publication, and then as reported in another publication.</p>

<p>Another aspect of the matter which the Minister laid great stress on, was that this was not a censorship Bill. He emphasized that with all the strength at his command. I would like to draw to the Minister&#x2019;s attention just what censorship means because, with respect, I doubt whether he has any real knowledge of the meaning of the word &#x201C;censorship &#x201D;. It is a very serious matter to say that this is not censorship without knowing what censorship is. Here I have a book. It is not &#x201C;Standpunte&#x201D;, but it is an authoritative work called &#x201C;The Freedom to Read&#x201D;, which was produced in the United States by the National Book Committee under a grant from the Fund for the Republic, and which was compiled by a commission of three distinguished scholars, some of whom I think will be known to the hon. the Minister: Richard McKeon, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Chicago, Robert K. Merton, Professor of Sociology at Columbia University, and Walter Gell-horn, Professor of Law at Columbia Law School. This is generally accepted as an authoritative book on the subject, and this is what is said about censorship&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The term &#x201C;censorship&#x201D; has generally been used in two closely related senses. In its original and strict sense censorship is the prohibition and prevention of statement, expression and communication. &#x201C;Censors&#x201D; originally prepared the &#x201C;census&#x201D;, and both terms are derived from &#x201C;censere&#x201D;, to value or to tax. The censors of ancient Rome were magistrates who not only took a register of the number and property of citizens, but also exercised the office of inspectors of morals and conduct. In modem times the title has been applied to officials empowered to examine written or printed matter&#x2014;manuscripts of book and plays, news despatches, foreign newspapers or magazines, and other forms of expression and communication &#x2026;</block>

<p>I am merely trying to assist the hon. the Minister to realize what is meant by &#x201C;censorship&#x201D;, before he comes to the House and so emphatically asserts that he will have nothing to do with censorship, because in terms of his own Bill he intends to set up a controlling board which under any other name is in fact a censorship board, whether the Minister likes it or not. I will leave the matter there for the time being.</p>

<p>This Board, according to the Minister, will take the place of the existing board of Censors as far as the film industry is concerned, and I would very much like to deal with the film industry in the time at my disposal, but I propose to leave that aspect of the matter until later. The Minister then went on to say, after referring to Mr. Justice Marais and his point of view, that all those people who had been interviewed by <i>Dagbreek</i> were very &#x201C;ignorant&#x201D; people, but apparently he did not then know that Mr. Justice Marais was one of them. The fact of the matter is that those persons who were interviewed by this newspaper were obviously motivated by only one consideration, and that was the desire to maintain, particularly for the Afrikaans writers, author and poet, that freedom of expression which had allowed the Afrikaans language and art to develop to the stage that has been reached to-day. I wonder whether Afrikaans would have been the living language that it is to-day if this same form of control that the Minister now seeks to exercise through this Bill, had been applied in the earlier stages of the development of the language. It is a matter for historical research and one could easily prove what would have happened if that control had been applied in those formative years.</p>

<p>I want to deal with the statement the Minister made on the aspect of the regulation of the thinking and writing and the reading of the people of this country in regard to books particularly, when he said that there was nothing wrong with this control. He said a controlled man was a free man, and that an uncontrolled man was a barbarian. The Minister should know that the country where there is the maximum control of the individual is Soviet Russia. From the cradle to the grave he is a controlled man&#x2014;yet, said the Minister in effect, every Russian is a civilized man, the most civilized man there can be, but we who still have a certain amount of liberty here are barbarians. Sir, we have seen the examples of the &#x201C;freedom&#x201D; of the &#x201C;controlled man&#x201D; of Soviet Russia and of Nazi Germany, and I do not think the Minister is on very good grounds in advancing the argument that the regulation of thought, of expression, and the control of the individual is in itself the hall-mark of civilization, as he said <span class="col_491-492" refersTo="page_0260"/>yesterday. If, in fact, the Minister can change his mind, as he has done this evening in regard to what he said the day before, I can only hope that he will continue to have that flexibility of mind in regard to one or two other matters in this Bill also. One of these is his statement that it would have been a simple matter for him to appoint a board of censors&#x2014; because he is still trying to draw a distinction between censors and controllers&#x2014;and they would then simply strike out or ban whatever they thought was undesirable. Well, it seems to me that here the Minister is doing no more than making a virtue of necessity. He does not seriously try to suggest to this House that it was in his mind to appoint a board of censors to examine every single book that entered the country, but that is the inference he asked us to draw. If he did so, he must surely be unaware of the fact that in the English language alone, and in two countries only, there is a total of 50,000 new titles published every year &#x2014;30,000 in the United Kingdom and 20,000 in the U.S.A. Why does the Minister suggest that this is a virtue&#x2014;his control board as compared with a board of censors which he said would have been simple to create&#x2014;when, according to his own theses, in order to make sure that the morals of the people were not subverted or contaminated, they would have had to read in one year possibly 50,000 books to make absolutely sure that nothing came into the country which would subvert the morals of the people? It is at best a specious argument, and at the worst, it is a fatuous argument.</p>

<p>Business suspended at 6.30 p.m. and resumed at 8.5 p.m.</p>

<p><i>Evening Sitting</i></p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>When business was suspended for dinner, I was drawing the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the fact that he had made a virtue out of necessity by saying that he would not appoint a board of censorship. I pointed out that from every practical point of view, it was quite impossible to establish a board of censorship which could cope with the volume of literature published in the English language, for instance, in overseas countries.</p>

<p>The Minister himself, as I recall, pointed to the other and very real difficulty which the board&#x2014;whether he calls it a board of control, a publications control board or board of censors&#x2014;would have to face in determining reasonably, though not necessarily accurately, what was or was not objectionable. The Minister said, and I want to thank him for saying it&#x2014;in dealing with what he called the yardstick or the norm&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The yardstick or the norm by which publications will be judged will to a large extent be subjective.</block>

<p>He was fair enough to say that. In other words, it will differ from one person to another and it is a relative concept. That is an accurate summing up of the crux of the difficulty which any regulating or controlling body or board of censors will have to face. And, Sir, in the aftermath of time, it is very easy to prove how correct the statement of the hon. the Minister is and will continue to be, for the simple reason that, apart from the list of books already banned here and touched upon earlier to-day by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, there is a long historical list of works which had been banned for one reason or another&#x2014;banned in the sense that their publication, dissemination or their reading was prohibited by authority.</p>

<p>I have here a very interesting book which I, with deference to the hon. the Minister, should like to offer to him to read. It is not a lengthy look and is called simply &#x201C;Banned Books &#x201D;. It has been written by a person who is regarded as being some authority on the subject. As a matter of fact, this writer has made a careful historical survey of the banning of books, which some people seem to think is a modern device and a latter-day event. It is, of course, nothing of the sort.</p>

<p>Who is the writer?</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>The name of the writer is &#x201C;Haight &#x201D;&#x2014;not the other kind of &#x201C;heid&#x201D; about which we hear from time to time, i.e. &#x201C;apartheid &#x201D;. I cannot, of course, read all the titles (with the brief descriptions of what happened to them), of all the banned books enumerated by this writer, but I want to quote some examples. In the case of Homer, for instance (c. 850 b.c.) Plato suggested in 387 b.c. that The Odyssey be expurgated for immature readers, whereas in a.d. 35, in Rome, Caligula tried to suppress this work because &#x201C;it expressed Greek ideals of freedom which were regarded as dangerous in autocratic Rome&#x201D;. Confucius was treated similarly. Works of Aristophanes were treated in the same way, as for example &#x201C;Clouds&#x201D; and &#x201C;Lysistrata &#x201D;. In 423 b.c., in Greece and Athens, &#x201C;Clouds&#x201D; was regarded as a play in which Socrates was pilloried as a typical representative of impious and destructive speculations. This is what this writer states. Now, can you believe it, Mr. Speaker? It happened to Socrates&#x2014;not Gorshel, but Socrates! The writer goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">380 b.c., after a life of teaching and writing, Aristophanes was put to death as an atheist and corrupter of youth.</block>

<p>Aristophanes, Mr. Speaker, and not the hon. member for Vereeniging!</p>

<block name="quote">66 a.d. His comedies were considered obscene by Plutarch.</block>

<block name="quote">1930 United States: Customs ban lifted on &#x201C;Lysistrata &#x201D;. During that period of prohibition the book was published and sold for as little as 35 cents ...</block>

<p>Ovid was banned, and there is a long list of bannings of the Bible. Can you believe that, Mr. Speaker? For example&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_493-494" refersTo="page_0261"/>1525-6. The New Testament, partially translated by William Tyndale, was printed at Cologne, as it was violently opposed by the clergy in England. The long arm of the Church forced him to flee to Worms where he continued to publish clandestinely. The sheets of 6,000 copies of the Testament were smuggled into England, where they were publicly burned by the dignitaries of the Church, thus becoming the first printed book to be banned in England.</block>

<p>What a credit, what an honour, for a book, in this case the Bible, to be banned! I can quote further. For example&#x2014;-</p>

<block name="quote">1624. Germany: The Bible, translated by Martin Luther in 1534, which had been the most widely read book in the country, was condemned to the flames by Papal authority.</block>

<p>What is your point?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>I wish I could identify the hon. member who asked that question, Sir, only to be able to meet him privately and have a chat with him. However, I hope he will, in any case, see what my point is as I go along. The &#x201C;Koran&#x201D; was banned in the 15th century; works of Boccaccio were banned; so were works of Savonarola, Erasmus &#x2014;not the gentleman who is now representing us in Rome, Sir, but one Desiderius Erasmus. He was banned all over the place&#x2014;in England, in Switzerland, in France, in Scotland, etc. Take Machiavelli&#x2014;his works were banned at times. Now I come to the oddest banning of all&#x2014;I cite this particularly as a warning to the hon. the Minister and the hon. member sitting next to him (Dr. Jonker) because I know how interested he is in the establishment of this Publications Control Board! This is a very remarkable case&#x2014;the one and only Michelangelo! Here we come to works of art, about the banning of which the hon. the Minister knows something! This is what the writer of this book reports about the work &#x201C;The Last Judgement &#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">1933 United States: Plate 40 is a copy of The Last Judgement, made by Venusti from the original fresco in the Sistine Chapel &#x2026;</block>

<p>I have had the privilege of seeing it, as has, I think, the hon. the Minister&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; before the addition of clothing to the nude figures by Daniele Volterra, by order of Pope Paul IV, and with the permission of Michelangelo. This book was ordered from Europe by the Weyhe Gallery and Book Shop. They received the following official letter from an assistant collector of customs who, apparently, had never heard of the great painter &#x2026;</block>

<p>This happened in 1933 in the United States and is typical of what can happen and what will certainly happen in South Africa&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sir: There is being detained &#x2026; two packages addressed to you, containing obscene photo books &#x201C;Ceiling Sistine Chapel&#x201D;, Filles-Michelangelo, the importation of which is held to be prohibited under the provisions of the Tariff Act. The packages will therefore be seized and disposed of in due course as provided by law. You may, however, avail yourself of the privilege of applying to the Secretary of the Treasury</block>

<p>In our case it will be the Publication Board&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; for mitigation of the penalty of forfeiture with permission to export, or please execute the Assent to Forfeiture below, returning same &#x2026; Respectfully, H. C. Stuart, Asst. Collector.</block>

<p>The writer reports further on this matter&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">After being ridiculed by the newspapers, the Treasury Department realized the ignorant mistake and relinquished the book.</block>

<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, why should we all be so keen&#x2014;as some of the hon. members on the other side appear to be&#x2014;to generalise about this subject by prating endlessly about the need&#x2014;and their desire&#x2014;to defend the morals of the people of this country, and to suggest by inference that we, on this side of the House, are just an immoral bunch of people who do not want to defend the morals of the people of the country? Why should they be so keen to do that when history is studded with countless examples of what happens when officialdom tries to protect the morals of the people? Let me tell you without hesitation that there was hardly a writer, hardly a famous painter or sculptor in the history of the world since before Christ, whose works were not at some time or other banned in countries which are to-day considered civilized. But we in this country, in this 20th century, go back to 354 b.c., and start banning!</p>

<p>Is that logical, Mr. Speaker? Where is the sense in it? I hope the hon. the Minister will tell us that. I do not want to read any further from this list which the writer gives. Michelangelo, I think, has proved my point.</p>

<p>Very well, Mr. Speaker. In regard to the analysis, which I quoted from earlier, by the commissioners appointed by the National Book Council and published in this book &#x201C;The Freedom to Read&#x201D;, there is an <span class="col_495-496" refersTo="page_0262"/>analysis of the arguments for and against censorship from which I should like to read only one salient paragraph. It must be recognized that, as is the case in this House, and as has been argued by hon. members opposite, there are different concepts of freedom &#x2014;for example, the freedom which is described as being completely loose, irresponsible; and the freedom to do the right thing under the control of the State. This is recognized by the people who drew up this report for the National Book Council in America. On page 8, they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have tried to show, by analysing the philosophical arguments for censorship and freedom, that positions concerning censorship are not determined uniquely by conceptions of freedom. We are convinced that the reasons against censorship derived from both conceptions of freedom are sound. The arguments for censorship, on the contrary, endanger both varieties of freedom.</block>

<p>Perhaps the hon. the Minister will remember that.</p>

<block name="quote">Censorship of the Hobbesian variety, based on the concept of freedom to do as you please, places censorship in the hands of those who happen to be in power; it extends their power to the determination of what is right and wrong, just and unjust, good and bad. Censorship of the Platonic variety, based on the concept of freedom to do as one should, places censorship in the hands of the wise and the good, if they happen also to have secured power. But since the possession of power is in either case essential, there is no practical way to distinguish the considered judgment of officials who are wise and good from the arbitrary judgment of officials who are unwise and bad. Power tends to corrupt, in censorship as in other modes of its exercise.</block>

<p>How true, Mr. Speaker! And what does the Minister think will happen to his board, or whatever he calls it, except that the power which it will exercise over the written word and over the work of art will in the nature of things corrupt that board&#x2014;in the sense that it will no longer be able to exercise even a subjective, let alone an objective, judgment.</p>

<p>Are you satisfied with the present system?</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Fort Beaufort was at pains yesterday to say that he had written a certain letter in 1959 urging the appointment of a board of not more than seven or eight members as compared with the present board. Obviously, he is not in favour of the present system because he has sedulously advocated a new system for a reason which may become clearer in the near future! I can only hope that we will not have a vacancy here as a side-effect to the appointment of the Chairman of Publications Control Board!</p>

<p>As far as I am concerned, I do not hold for a moment&#x2014;and this in answer to the hon. member&#x2019;s question&#x2014;that the present position is good. What I do say, however, and without any hesitation, is that it is certainly preferable, i.e. the present means for the control of what is obscene and objectionable, to the method which the hon. member for Fort Beaufort seems to advocate so strenuously.</p>

<p>I now want to quote one example of what an official, whether he is called the chairman of a board of publications, or whether he is a customs official, can do when he is charged with the task of condemning, in the sense that he can ban a book. I have here a book. I do not know whether it is banned or not. I will not mention its title because, as you know, the moment you ban a book, up goes its sale. On the 7th March, last year, the <i>Burger</i> wrote in an editorial under the heading &#x201C;Sensuurbesluite&#x201D;, the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Aan die ander kant van die rekening staan nou &#x2019;n veel wyer Suid-Afrikaanse leserskring vir die ou uitgawe, &#x2019;n verhoogde afset in die buiteland vir die nuwe uitgawe (&#x201E;die boek wat Suid-Afrikaners nie mag lees nie &#x201D;)&#x2026;</block>

<p>And so, I am not going to give this book a gratuitous advertisement. But in it, on page 87, the word about which the famous case in England&#x2014;Rex v. Penguin Books&#x2014;turned, is mentioned three times in one line, and four times in one line on page 88. Shall I read it Mr. Speaker? [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Then I think I want to tell you, Mr. Speaker, that although this book would be condemned here as a paperback, it is still sold in a paperback edition in the United States for 95c. But what is more, it was originally published at a price of $5 95c. i.e. the equivalent of R4.50. It was a bestseller. Millions of copies were sold. And yet in terms of what we are trying to set up in the Bill which is now before us, this book would be banned here. I have no personal objection to this book being banned.</p>

<p>But the hon. the Minister said so; it is no use hon. members saying &#x201C;nonsense". For this reason, as well as for others, it does seem to me that as Minister of Education, Arts and Science, the hon. gentleman should, even at this late stage, exercise his influence in the interests of the people of South Africa, in the interests certainly of the artists&#x2014;writers and poets, sculptors and painters of South Africa&#x2014;and certainly in the interests of the good name of South Africa, and either withdraw this Bill, or take the advice which the Opposition has tried to tender to him in this debate, i.e. to amend the Bill in such a way as to make it much more workable than it appears to be to-day.</p>

<p>Finally, Sir, I should like to give the hon. the Minister an example of what will happen in Cape Town, for instance, when the mail boat arrives on a Thursday with, say, 300 new titles for a particular bookseller who supplies bookshops as well as libraries throughout the country. This man has a business to run, and he has an obligation to his clients, let alone to the reading public. But there he sits with a shipment of 300 titles which has arrived on the Thursday afternoon; he has unpacked them and wants to start selling them although he has not the faintest idea of what those books contain. So, what does the hon. the Minister and his Publications Control Board expect this particular bookseller to do? Is he to read every one of the 300 titles, or is he to go to court, first of all, about every one of them&#x2014;and if he loses, appeal and wait another year? Or is he to, what is called, &#x201C;take a chance&#x201D; on infringing a law, which will not only cost him money but will bring him into serious disrepute with the State and with the public?</p>

<p>A typical case such as this should also be considered in the interest of the general public. I sincerely hope, therefore, that for all these considerations&#x2014;and there is a mass of evidence to show that these are valid considerations&#x2014;the hon. the Minister, in his capacity of Minister of Education, Arts and Science, will think again about what he believes to be the merits of this Bill.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. F. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, after having listened to the speeches which have been made thus far by hon. members of the Opposition, I am more than ever convinced that this is an excellent Bill and that the only trouble is that it was not introduced by the United Party but by the National Party Government! Apparently it is an excellent Bill.</p>

<p>Another thing which also struck me during the debate was that neither the hon. member for Turffontein nor the hon. member for Orange Grove, that is to say, the two main speakers on the Opposition side, was present at the meetings of the Select Committee when the clauses of the Bill were discussed. When the clauses were discussed the United Party was represented by only two members, namely, the hon. member for Springs and the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South). The others were not there. The hon. member for Turffontein who was the chief speaker on the Opposition side in this debate, did not participate in the discussion on those clauses. That was the interest that the United Party showed in this Bill! I have the report of the Select Committee here before me. The last discussion took place on the 18th of April. All the clauses of the Bill were then discussed. The only members of the United Party present at that meeting were Messrs. Tucker and Plewman. None of the other United Party members was there. Later, on 16th May, 1962, without his having taken any part in the discussion on the clauses of the Bill, the hon. member for Turffontein made a statement to the <i>Sunday Times.</i> The hon. member looks most surprised to hear this; apparently he does not even know that he issued that statement! But there was another thing which struck me in connection with the Select Committee, namely, the attacks which were made here against the proposed Board, a Board, as has already been said, which is similar to a Board which has been in existence since 1931, in other words, for about 32 years, during 15 of which the United Party was in power and that Party did not find it necessary to change that Board. They never had any objection to that Board.</p>

<p>Clauses 2, 3, and 4 of this Bill deal with the composition of the Board. What happened when these clauses were put on the Select Committee? According to a report of the Committee the Chairman put clauses 2 to 4 which were agreed to, and these clauses deal with the composition and functions of the Board!</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>Did the hon. member for Turffontein vote against them?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#nel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. F. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>He was not there! They cannot say that this took place in the recess and that because of that fact they could not hold a caucus meeting. This meeting was held on a Wednesday during the Session, that is to say, the day after their caucus. They must surely have decided to vote against the establishment of the Board. But what happened? On the Wednesday they voted for it!</p>

<p>But the hon. member for Bezuidenhout went further and even cast reflections upon the composition of the Board. He said that it would be a Board appointed by the Minister and that it would therefore only carry out the duties entrusted to it by the Minister. The hon. member forgets, however, that a Mr. Kincaid, amongst others, was also Chairman of this Board in the past. I am sure that he was not a Nationalist, but nevertheless he was Chairman of the Board which was set up in 1931, some years after the National Party had come into power. The hon. member went further and suggested that a committee of the House <span class="col_499-500" refersTo="page_0264"/>of Assembly should be appointed because, as he said, the matter should not go to the courts of law. Court procedure was too cumbersome and too expensive! In one breath therefore, they say that these things should be decided upon by a court of law, and in the next breath they say that they do not want a court.</p>

<p>I want to deal now with the clauses to which particular objection was taken by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) and here I want to mention Clause 5 (2) particularly. Why did he not object to the first part dealing with &#x201C;indecency &#x201D;? He objected to all the others and said that the provisions were too vague and too wide. But what about &#x201C;obscene &#x201D;? Is it not too vague also and is its meaning also not too wide? It was in precisely this connection that the following opinion was expressed in America in this regard&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Clearly several types of attacks may be made on this type of regulation depending upon the exact wording and also the means to enforce it. In the first place, the lack of precise definition of the word &#x201C;obscene&#x201D; invites the argument that criminal statute directed against obscene publications is vague and indefinite and there is a denial of the due process of law.</block>

<p>Why does the hon. member only object to the other provisions, namely, those dealing with blasphemy or which bring any other section of the population into ridicule or contempt, or which have a detrimental effect upon relationships between the national groups and so forth? The reason for their attitude is that they are trying to make some political capital out of this. There is no other reason for their objection to these particular provisions.</p>

<p>They object therefore to the provisions dealing with blasphemy and religious convictions but the same wording appears in the 1931 Act namely&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Scenes calculated to affect the religious convictions or feelings of any section of the public.</block>

<p>That is absolutely the same wording as that incorporated in the present Bill. As I say, they also object to the provisions in regard to literature which is harmful to relationships between any sections of the inhabitants of the Republic or which brings them into ridicule or contempt. But in the 1931 Act we had the same provision, namely&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Scenes calculated to bring any section of the public into ridicule or contempt.</block>

<p>That is the same wording as that incorporated in the present Bill. The hon. member also objected to paragraph (f). In the Select Committee they agreed to (a) but objected to (b) to (f). What is the position in regard to (f)? The very same wording which appears in that paragraph also appears in the British Act which has existed since 1926. I want you to look at the Judicial Proceedings (Regulation of Reports) Act, 1926, and there you will see that the provisions of paragraph (a) of Section 1 (1) are the same as those of (f) (i) of our Bill, namely&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) in relation to any judicial proceedings any indecent matter or indecent medical, surgical or physiological details being matter or details the publication of which would be calculated to injure public morals.</li>

</ol>

<p>That Act goes even further and provides&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(b) in relation to any judicial proceedings for dissolution of marriage, for nullity of marriage, or for judicial separation, or for restitution of conjugal rights, any particulars other than the following, that is to say&#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(i) the names, addresses and occupations of the parties and witnesses;</li>

<li>(ii) a concise statement of the charges, defences and countercharges in support of which evidence has been given;</li>

<li>(iii) submissions on any point of law arising in the course of the proceedings &#x2026;</li>

<li>(iv) the summing-up of the judge &#x2026;</li>

</ol></li>

</ol>

<p>This is absolutely the same wording as that found in paragraph (f) of our Bill, but nevertheless the Opposition object to it.</p>

<p>I want to come now to Clause 5 (5) to which objection was also taken. This sub-section empowers the Minister to give certain books to certain persons or institutions, in other words, to grant them exemption. Nevertheless, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout contended that universities, for example, would not be able to obtain books of a certain standard. But, this sub-section states quite clearly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The board may on such conditions as it may deem fit in writing exempt any person or institution &#x2026;</block>

<p>that is to say, universities as well. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) went on to say that this provision was &#x201C;alarming&#x201D;, because the Minister was giving the board the right to allow universities to obtain certain books! I would like to know from the hon. member what he finds so alarming in this provision? Let him mention one reason why he holds this view. He is silent.</p>

<p>The hon. member also objected to Clause 6 and said &#x201C;it makes a nullity of <i>mens rea &#x201D;;</i> in other words, he maintains that the element of this Bill does not make any difference; it should have been written into the Bill. But there are many laws in terms of which the state need not prove intent. In this connection <span class="col_501-502" refersTo="page_0265"/>I want to thank the hon. member for Innesdale for a quotation which he made available to me in connection with this question of intent. This quotation appears in the issue of <i>Newsweek</i> of 28 January 1963 and reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Distributors of paperbacks offer their wares with the disinterested zeal of a super market vending rival brands of frozen succotash. (&#x201C; Read the books?&#x201D; a distributor once said to me. &#x201C;Hell, no! It&#x2019;s always a defence in an obscenity case if you haven&#x2019;t read the books.&#x201D;)</block>

<p>That is what hon. members here want. In the second instance he also said: &#x201C;It leaves the court to establish a case instead of the prosecution.&#x201D; But that is not true; that is not the correct interpretation. When an appeal is lodged against anything which is done under this law, the State will place certain evidence before the Judge. The defence will place certain evidence before the Judge and it is on that evidence that the court will decide. This is not a case where the court is going to make the law or give a verdict without any evidence having been led. The hon. member strongly attacked Clause 6. I want to draw his attention to the wording of Clause 6 (1) (a). These are not merely words which have been inserted by the Department&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If in any legal proceedings under this Act the question arises whether any matter is indecent or obscene or is offensive or harmful to public morals, that matter shall be deemed to be: (a) indecent or obscene if, in the opinion of the court, &#x2026;</block>

<p>He objected to the words &#x201C;if, in the opinion of the court&#x201D; because he said that the court would have to make out a case&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; indecent or obscene if, in the opinion of the court, it has a tendency to deprave or to corrupt the minds of persons who are likely to be exposed to the effect or influence thereof.</block>

<p>Those are words taken from British law. words which have appeared for nearly 100 years in British law. In 1868 they appeared for the first time in a judgment by Mr. Chief Justice Lord Cockburn in the case of The Queen v. Hicklin&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I think the test of &#x201C;obscene&#x201D; is this: Whether the tendency of the matter is to deprave or to corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall.</block>

<p>In 1954 Lord Goddard said the following in the famous case of Rex v. Reiter: &#x201C;That the law is still the same as it was in 1868 &#x201D;. He gave his&gt; decision on that point. He said that certain things had changed since the days of Queen Victoria but he went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But it is one thing to discuss a subject and quite another to discuss it and write about it in a way in which these books deal with it.</block>

<p>The penalties laid down in this Bill are very limited in comparison with the penalty imposed by Lord Goddard. There were various persons before that court. Two persons were accused and were given six months&#x2019; imprisonment for the first offence. This Bill provides for a minimum of six months after the third offence. They went further; there were also three companies which printed the books and published them. Each one of those companies was fined &#x00A3;2,000&#x2014;not R2,000 as in this Bill.</p>

<p>A support was forthcoming here yesterday for the paperback editions. Everyone said that it was wrong that paperbacks should be banned because the Homers and the Miltons and all the rest of them are published in paperbacks. The Cronje Report has been criticized here to-day. Many of the things stated in the Cronje Report are possibly open to criticism but they collected facts which were irrefutable, facts which the Opposition side of the House did not criticize. On page 8 the Cronje Report states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The next question which calls for an answer is: What is the character of the reading matter offered in paperbacks? In 1951 &#x2026;</block>

<p>That was 12 years ago but the proportion is probably still about the same&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In 1951 the classification was as follows: &#x201C;Mysteries&#x201D; 26.8 per cent; &#x201C;Westerns " 15.2 per cent; "novels&#x201D; 46.6 per cent; &#x201C;non-fiction&#x201D; 3 per cent and &#x201C;miscellaneous&#x201D; 7.5 per cent.</block>

<p>I say that this report may be wrong but none of the hon. members here criticized any of the facts submitted to the Cronje Commission. The Cronje Report went further. They inquired into the question of paperbacks, which at the time were banned by the Minister. This was their finding&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The commission examined a large number of these books which had been banned by the Minister of the Interior, and it would be an unenviable task indeed to find anything that could be said in their defence.</block>

<p>I do not want to read out long quotations but they also inquired into the position in America. According to a study which was made by the New York State Joint Legislative Committee to Study Publications of Comics in 1955, the following was stated: &#x201C;it is a disgrace to the American people.&#x201D; This is the type of book that the Opposition want to defend. Those books do not stay in America; they are off-loaded here in South Africa. The hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) went further and said that control would hamper the literary development of this country. <span class="col_503-504" refersTo="page_0266"/>He suddenly developed a very soft spot for South African literature. He said that South African literature was going to be the first victim of this control. I wonder how many Afrikaans books the hon. member for Turffontein has read over the past ten years. While I am on this point, Mr. Speaker, I find it interesting that the Book Trade Association of South Africa wrote a letter to the <i>Cape Times.</i> They did not send one to Members of Parliament; they did not send this letter to any of us. No, they sent a letter to the <i>Cape Times.</i> They used the same argument as the hon. member for Turffontein when they said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A point to be kept in mind in this connection is that Afrikaans literature is particularly vulnerable.</block>

<p>They suddenly hit upon the argument that Afrikaans literature was vulnerable in this respect. The hon. member for Turffontein took evasive action just now when I asked him how many books he had read. He is now asking the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mrs. Weiss) to help him; she has to tell him how many books he has read, but that will not help him.</p>

<p>The commission tried to determine whether this would hamper the sound development of our literature. One-third of the witnesses said that there were certain dangers in this connection but the majority, that is to say two-thirds, said that the development of our literature would not be affected. The witnesses were then asked what the effect upon our literature would be if this undesirable literature were allowed to enter the country. They all replied that it would have an undesirable effect upon the healthy growth of our literature here. It is very easy to ask about the position in England and the position in America. In speaking of those countries I am told by hon. members of the Opposition: &#x201C;No, that is wrong; talk about South Africa &#x201D;. Let me tell them what the position is in South Africa. We must always remember that South Africa does not have a homogeneous population. We have to deal with various races here, races at various stages of development. We have the Natives here and they get hold of these things. In point of fact that was one aspect which the Cronje Commission investigated and it found that these pictures and books and the other things had a very bad influence on the Bantu. They investigated certain residential areas near Pretoria&#x2014; Vlakfontein amongst others. In each four groups of 50 houses a total of 69 illustrations, including photographs of White women, were found; the number per 50 houses fluctuated from 15 to 19. Vlakfontein, the latest residential area, produced the smallest number, namely 15. In the three old areas there was practically no fluctuation in the figures, namely 17, 18 and 19. The number of places where these things appeared was exactly 50, or an incidence of 25 per cent in cases of families. Of the 69 illustrations, 39 were undesirable and 30 passable. In 30 homes undesirable illustrations of White women were found, or a percentage incidence of 15. You will find this information on page 62 of the report. [Interjections.] The hon. member has apparently not read the Cronje Report. I do not want to read all the information on pages 61, 62 and 63. What is apparent from the Cronje Report is that the Bantu keep the photographs of White women and not non-White women. In one house they found a photograph of a non-White woman. The rest were all of White women and, as I have indicated, most of them were undesirable. I say that for that reason alone this Bill is necessary.</p>

<p>Reference was also made here to the criticism of certain writers. Now suddenly they rely on people like Rob Antonissen, F. A. Venter, an Ettienne le Roux and Andre Brink. When it suits them they quote Guy Butler but in this connection they do not quote Guy Butler. I have great respect for Antonissen. He is not a writer of romances of any kind. He is a literary critic and a literary writer. F. A. Venter&#x2019;s books are of such a high standard that nobody would be silly enough to interfere with his books. Etienne le Roux is a young writer. His father was Minister of Agriculture in the Cabinet. His latest book &#x201C;Sewe Dae by die Silbesteins&#x201D; is a fine book; nobody would ban that book. Andre Brink&#x2019;s latest book is &#x201C;Lobola vir die Lewe&#x201D;, a book which has been described as very daring, although a book written by a person like W. E. G. Louw is described as a new direction in Afrikaans literature. It is not for me to pass judgment in this regard. Hon. members say: &#x201C;This is an unsatisfactory Bill&#x201D;, while all these things already exist either in our laws or in laws abroad.</p>

<p>I want to return to this Book Trade Association of Southern Africa. They wrote a letter to the <i>Cape Times.</i> In the first place, who are they? I do not know who they are. They do not say from whom they receive their instructions; we do not know whether they held a meeting and received instructions to write a letter of this nature to the <i>Cape Times.</i> I wonder whether the members of that Association know that this letter was sent to the <i>Cape Times?</i> As I indicated just now, it is a strange thing to my mind that the <i>Cape Times,</i> of all newspapers, was selected to publish that letter during this debate. Why was the letter not sent to one of our members of Parliament? Why did the hon. member for Turffontein not receive that letter? Perhaps they no longer have any confidence in him.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) referred to the Jewish Board of Deputies, which has now become confused in their statements. It submitted a memorandum to the Select Committee in which it objected to Clauses 5 (2) (c), (d) and (f), dealing with blasphemy and the bringing of a section of the inhabitants in the Republic into ridicule or contempt. In January 1963 Professor Bein-art sent in a copy at the request of the Civil Rights League of Cape Town, and there he accepted the whole of this position as it now stands in the Bill. I do not think that the hon. member <span class="col_505-506" refersTo="page_0267"/>for Vereeniging saw it. Whereas first they condemned it they are now quite prepared to accept (a) and (b) just as they stand. What is the position of the Minister? In May 1962 the Board of Deputies said one thing; in January 1963 they say something else. In May 1962 the representatives of the United Party on the Select Committee said one thing; those same people come along in January 1963 and say something else in this House. Must the hon. Minister, with all the talk of those hon. members, accept their recommendations and incorporate them in a law or not? It would be an impossible task for any Minister of any Government to make provision for all this cross-talk. The hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) said this evening, unless I am mistaken, that he accepted this board. But the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson) did not accept the board. We must also understand the position of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. He always does the opposite to the other members of his party. Already we have the first signs of his starting to do so. The United Party accepts one thing but the hon. member for Bezuidenhout accepts another thing.</p>

<p>No matter what the position is, there has been so much talk by members of the United Party that they no longer have any idea themselves of what they want. To tell the truth I do not think that they have any idea of what they want. But when the <i>Cape Times</i> and the <i>Sunday Times</i> came forward with their articles, the United Party had to react. They reacted in such a way that even the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) took certain sentences and certain words from the article in the <i>Sunday Times.</i> He spoke about the word &#x201C;undesirable&#x201D; and he said: &#x201C;It is an ominous word &#x201D;. That same word was used by the <i>Sunday Times:</i> &#x201C;The Bill introduces an ominous new word &#x201D;. The hon. member for Post Elizabeth (South) used exactly the same words as the <i>Sunday Times.</i> All that I want to prove is that hon. members opposite were unready to oppose this legislation but when the <i>Sunday Times</i> came forward with its opposition, they made use not only of its ideas but even its words and sentences. One of the clauses states that any person may complain, and they objected to this provision. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) used the word &#x201C;snoopers &#x201D;. He said that snoopers could operate.</p>

<block name="quote">This is an open invitation to South Africans to become a nation of snoopers.</block>

<p>Those very words were used by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South). Hon. members opposite do not have their own ideas; they do not have any thoughts of their own and therefore I think, Mr. Speaker, that they ought actually to vote for this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#weiss">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WEISS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in listening to the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) (Mr. J. A. F. Nel) quoting from these newspapers, I noticed that when he referred to the article in this morning&#x2019;s <i>Cape Times</i> he refrained from quoting from that. That is the letter from the Book Trade Association of Southern Africa. According to this article the Book Trade Association said in their memorandum&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any new Bill should be confined to the form of a consolidating measure dealing solely with obscene and indecent publications and publications that are harmful to young persons. It should not deal with any of the other matters embodied in the definition of &#x201C;undesirability&#x201D; in the present Bill, as these matters are adequately covered by existing legislation.</block>

<p>In listening to the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) and many hon. members opposite giving unreserved support to this Bill, it is indeed sad to me to see the descendants of the freedom-loving Voortrekkers subscribing to these most drastic regulations which are restrictions on their freedom of thought and their rights, freedom and rights which their forefathers relentlessly fought for&#x2014;the Huguenots and the good Calvinists in their countries of origin. Yet what do we see to-day, Sir?</p>

<p>In supporting the amendment put forward by the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) I wish to say that I do not wish to repeat all the general principles that have been most ably represented on this side of the House by my colleagues but in omitting these I wish to demonstrate to the hon. the Minister in a concrete manner the absurdity of Clause 8 of this Bill and the difficulties which will be experienced in certain other of these clauses. I should like to say at this point that I cannot share the hon. Minister&#x2019;s optimism about the establishment of the Publications Control Board. If the hon. the Minister will turn to Clause 2 (4) he will notice that it says that &#x201C;the period and conditions of office, remuneration and allowances of the members of the board shall be as prescribed&#x201D;, I should like to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the fact that no term of office whatsoever is laid down in this Bill. It merely says it will be prescribed by regulation and in the regulations which we find on page 14 of this Bill no period of office is laid down for these board members at all. The hon. the Minister will recollect that in the National Education Advisory Council Act of last year an actual term of office of five years was laid down with powers of re-appointment. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister how <span class="col_507-508" refersTo="page_0268"/>it is that this has not been laid down in this Bill under this clause? If similar provisions are not laid down here I feel that, while I do not advocate in any way that the Minister should be so tied up by provisions that discretion means absolutely nothing at all, there is an essential need for it, in this clause to provide that when probably excellent members consider serving on this board they should feel that they are taking up a position that will give them a certain number of years of service on this board. Will they be expected to jettison their present positions and possible pensions rights to serve on this board when they do not know how many years&#x2019; service they will get? That, I think, would apply to those who are not in the full-time service of the State. Surely some measure of continuity must be laid down in the construction of a board. There is also the other point of view, Mr. Speaker. In order to obviate the continuance of a lot of &#x201C;dead wood&#x201D; on this board an exact period of office must be laid down, otherwise it may preclude good members from serving on it. I would therefore like to ask the hon. the Minister concerning this clause whether he is going to regulate the number of years of service with the right of re-appointment. This criticism also applies to page 14 where the regulations are set down. I shall be very interested to hear what the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s views are on this when he replies.</p>

<p>There is a second point regarding the composition of this board. The hon. the Minister will recollect that last year on 16 June in this House he said&#x2014;I quote from Hansard Vol. 4 1962&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It should be borne in mind that the English-speaking White national group comprises approximately only 43 per cent of the total White population.</block>

<p>Following upon the Minister&#x2019;s analysis of the population figures I feel therefore that logically the Minister should appoint 43 per cent English-speaking members and 53 per cent Afrikaans-speaking members. May I say that this could very easily be done because we have the required number of well qualified persons who are very able to serve on any such board from both the language groups.</p>

<p>Turning to Clause 8 of this Bill that we are analysing&#x2014;this has already been raised by the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) and the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman)&#x2014;I find that the wording is ambiguous as it now stands. As it now stands it may encroach on the freedom of the individual. It may mean that &#x201C;at the request of any person&#x201D; the board should have the power &#x201C;to examine any object or publication and to state whether that publication or object is in the opinion of the board undesirable&#x201D;, The definition of &#x201C;object&#x201D; and &#x201C;publication&#x201D; on page 1 of this Bill is very wide. &#x201C;Object&#x201D; or &#x201C;publication&#x201D; may be the private possession of any citizen in South Africa. It may be a painting or a print or a statue in a private home. This clause as it is now worded gives any busy-body the right to ask the board, on the payment of a fee, to investigate such object in a private person&#x2019;s home and thereby try to cause annoyance, frustration and interference with a citizen&#x2019;s rights and the right of life in their homes. People of malicious nature, as we know very well, could by simply paying the fee oblige the board to investigate any publication or object. This might be in the possession not only of private people but in the possession of a library, a university; it might be in a collection. For example, Sir, we might say that the library left by Cecil Rhodes in Groote Schuur for the use of the Prime Ministers of South Africa may, for all we know, contain certain documents or papers or books that are offensive to this present Government. Under this clause as it is now worded the power is there for &#x201C;any person&#x201D; to ask the board to investigate that object or publication and it could be banned. If this clause goes through in its present form what is going to happen? Are we going to have Hitler types of bonfires of banned books and objects of art? Surely, Sir, the absurdity of this Clause 8 clearly demonstrates that the hon. the Minister cannot have intended this clause for the purposes for which in its present form it could be used. I submit with due respect, Mr. Speaker that the wording of this clause is unnecessarily wide. As it stands in the Bill it could be misused. Therefore I would like to ask the hon. the Minister to consider the implications of this Clause 8 very seriously and very carefully. I would like to ask him whether he would not find it possible to tie it down more specifically. Because obviously it should refer only to objects and publications which are to be imported or sold in South Africa and not to those already in the private possession of libraries or collections or universities or private people. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister concerning this clause whether it is the Minister&#x2019;s intention for the clause to mean exactly what it means when it is read? Or will the hon. the Minister explain to this House exactly what the meaning of this clause is? Will the hon. the Minister give us his views on tying down this clause so that it may not infringe on the rights of individuals, on people in their homes? I trust that that is not what the hon. the Minister intended. I feel that the present Bill is a further demonstration of the conflict that has arisen between the right of society and the state to protect itself against subversion and also between the perversity of departmental bureaucracy, finding satisfaction in pushing forward its powers in restrictive measures like this. In this conflict as presented to us by this present Bill we see the strength of religious belief and the moral strength and the good solid common sense of the citizens ignored. The Government assumes that it is only they and their ideas and regulations as embodied in the Bill before us that can help the morality and also the political loyalty of the citizens. By this very faulty assumption of the Government, they are led into the maze of regulations and restrictions that we find in many of the <span class="col_509-510" refersTo="page_0269"/>clauses of this Bill. The result is a further step in circumscribing the freedom of the individual. Mr. Speaker, all these restrictions are proof that the Government does not trust its own citizens, and that it underestimates their intelligence, the intelligence and the strength and the moral force, not only of its own supporters, but also of its opponents. I feel that we on this side of the House cannot share the hon. Minister&#x2019;s lack of confidence in the moral integrity of the Afrikaans and the English-speaking peoples of South Africa as set out in this Bill. I shall be very interested to hear from the hon. the Minister after the representations put forward from this side of the House, as to what he intends to do with this Bill and with the restrictive clauses that are in it.</p>

<speech by="#von_moltke">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VON MOLTKE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) said this evening: &#x201C;The Minister finds himself in a very peculiar position.&#x201D; May I tell the hon. member that his party finds itself in that position, and their peculiar position is due to the fact that they find themselves on the horns of a dilemma and do not know how to extricate themselves. I will do so for them but then I fear that they will fall to the political wastepaper basket, which is the proper place for such a party.</p>

<p>Let us investigate the matter. The hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) who moved the Opposition&#x2019;s amendment, said here in the presence of all of us that he was satisfied with the existing legislation. His seconder, the hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan) said on the other hand that he was not satisfied with the existing legislation. The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mrs. Weiss) said during the course of her speech that she supported the amendment moved by the hon. member for Turffontein, namely, that they did not want this Bill to be considered in the House this year. In the same breath the hon. member asked the hon. the Minister to accept certain amendments to the clauses. Then we had another case where the organization representing South African Jewry appeared before the Select Committee and asked first for one thing and later for something else, but we will confine ourselves to the last request. They asked that certain things which are prohibited in this Bill be forbidden and now the Jewish members of the United Party not only raise their voices against it but they are all going to vote against it. They are indeed in a peculiar position!</p>

<p>When we speak about the existing legislation I want to say for the sake of the record that the existing legislation which is used to combat pornographic or indecent literature in the four provinces of the Republic and South West Africa is embodied in no less than 33 laws and ordinances. These laws date from 1873 to 1946, and of the 33 laws not one of them was placed on the Statute Book by a National Party Government alone. I want to mention them. Firstly, let us take the Cape Provincial Council. Here are the ordinances of the Cape Province which are of application: Ordinance 9 of 1926, Act 18 of 1873, Act 27 of 1882, Act 9 of 1889, Act 31 of 1892, Act 21 of 1894, Act 36 of 1902. South West Africa: Statute Ordinance 5 of 1926. We come to the Transvaal: Ordinance 1 of 1920, Act 13 of 1880, Act 38 of 1909. In Natal we have Ordinance 21 of 1942. Do you know what the joke is in this regard? In Section 191 of that Ordinance Natal gives municipal councils the power to control indecent literature, letters and so forth. The Central Government is not allowed to exercise control but in Natal the Provincial Council gives the municipalities that right. We also have Act No. 40 of 1894 and Act 22 of 1898 in Natal. We come to the Orange Free State: Ordinance 21 of 1902, Ordinance 3 of 1916, Ordinance 17 of 1922, Ordinance 19 of 1928, Ordinance 4 of 1931, Ordinance 15 of 1935. We come to the laws of the Union: Act 10 of 1911, Act 19 of 1911, Act 13 of 1912, Act 27 of 1914, Act 22 of 1916, Act 26 of 1917, Act 31 of 1917, Act 36 of 1919, Act 20 of 1926, Act 38 of 1931, Act 31 of 1937, Act 35 of 1944 and Act 46 of 1946. Under all 33 of these laws the police have to know precisely when they have to act and how they have to act. Many of the laws play into the hands of &#x201C;snoopers &#x201D;. Hon. members speak about snoopers. The hon. member for Turffontein says that he is satisfied with that legislation and that it is adequate, notwithstanding the fact that some of the laws which I have mentioned play into the hands of snoopers. Many of these laws, with which the hon. member for Turffontein is satisfied, are obsolete. Do you know that 30 years ago a man was found guilty by a magistrate here in Cape Town and fined because he was apparently indecently dressed on Woodstock beach? What was he wearing? He had on an ordinary pair of shorts but his upper body and his legs were bare! That law is still on the Statute Book but nobody would dream of applying that obsolete law where we have bikinis and briefs on our beaches nowadays. But the hon. member says that he is satisfied. To illustrate the stupidity of his argument further, let us cross for a moment to that exemplary province, Natal. There they have Act 22 of 1898 which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any person Who lewdly uses indecent language or gestures towards or in the presence or hearing of any woman, or who lewdly gives or sends any indecent letter or other writing or drawing or the like to any woman, and any person who writes or draws, or in any other way exhibits an indecent or lewd writing or drawing or the like as to be likely to give offence to women, shall be guilty of the crime of indecency &#x2026;</block>

<p>Do they regard that law as being the &#x201C;Natal Stand &#x201D;? Has the time not come for us to have a law which is consolidated so that we can deal more effectively with these matters? In the Cape Province one has this difficulty with existing legislation that one cannot take action&#x2014; the fact is that the offence must take place in public. For the purpose which we have in <span class="col_511-512" refersTo="page_0270"/>mind, therefore this fact renders useless the laws which we have to-day.</p>

<p>Ten years ago I was one of the three members who asked for an investigation into this sort of undesirable and indecent literature. I still remember that the three members were the then member of Groblersdal, the hon. member for Vredefort and myself. A commission was appointed the next year. But what was the standpoint of the United Party in 1953, 10 years ago? I have the Hansard report before me. I will not weary the House with quotations. Their standpoint was that we should leave the whole matter because it was far too involved. What is their standpoint to-day, 10 years later? to-day they say that a law of this nature is much too dangerous. They have suddenly become most interested in our young Afrikaans literature. They are afraid that this dangerous Bill may lead to the destruction of future Afrikaans Shakespeares, Chaucers or Bernard Shaws before they have a chance to write. But have hon. members thought of the other aspect of the matter? I am sorry that the hon. member for Hospital is not here, because he and the hon. member for Bezuidenhout are apparently supporters of those who say: &#x201C;Art for arts sake One can sign or write any dirty, vile, indecent thing and have it published if there are people like themselves who describe it as art. Do they want us to have a Gautier in South Africa? Do they know who he was? He was one of the French leaders of the movement to introduce realism into literature. to-day they have already gone as far as naturalism. He was one of the great leaders and when he was free to go as far as he wanted to, what did Gautier suggest? I want to ask hon. members what we should do with this type of person whom we find in our midst in South Africa to-day. Gautier suggested that a prize should be awarded to the person who succeeded in discovering one more cardinal form of indecency! I say that Gautier of France has his supporters here and hon. members who oppose this Bill and who sat on the Select Committee must realize that that is so because of the evidence adduced before the Committee. (Quorum) I repeat: Do hon. members want a Gautier and people of his calibre in South Africa? If they do not, they must say so. If like the hon. member for Orange Grove, they are not satisfied, with existing legislation they must say which of those 33 ordinances and laws they want repealed or amended. The evidence has shown that this sort of literature is increasing in South Africa and it is very profitable for dealers in this rubbish in South Africa. Do you know that one of their editors on the Rand earned R6,000 per annum 10 years ago? Do you know that one of those periodicals paid &#x00A3;3,000 for the exclusive rights to one article by a man who had committed a foul murder, who was sentenced to life imprisonment and who was later released to tell his story? Do you know what their new tactics are? They come along with a sandwich. They start and finish the article with a moral lecture but in between the moral lectures they pack the most sensational and vile things that one could imagine and these fall into the hands of our children. Mr. Speaker, the same people who talk about the control of our Press, or rather the censorship or our Press, should listen for a moment to what I want to quote from the &#x201C;British Press&#x201D; by H. A. Taylor, because it fits our Press so well&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No one in Britain who reads a daily newspaper can be under the impression that because the Press here is free, it may publish what it pleases without thought of consequences. At least the reports of actions against newspapers for libel and, less frequently, heavy fines for contempt of court, make readers aware that a free Press is subject to some restraints.</block>

<block name="quote">Among the laws that affect particularly the operations of the Press are those relating to libel, contempt of court, incitement to mutiny, breach of official secrets, publications of evidence in divorce suits, publication of details of lotteries, and of certain particulars of cases in juvenile courts and domestic cases. The legal pitfalls that beset the journalist, the editor and the publisher are so numerous that national newspapers generally find it necessary to have a member of the Bar attached to the editorial staff to read proofs and to advise on doubtful matter.</block>

<p>Not one of the laws exercising that control is amongst those 33 laws and ordinances which I mentioned. Hon. members opposite say that we must throw in the towel because the whole thing is too involved and too dangerous. To whom must we surrender? To people who do not care a scrap how much mental poison they pump into our people as long as they can make money out of it, unscrupulous people who care nothing for the moral feelings or moral standards of the people of South Africa? Then hon. members want to allow these people free rein to spread filth and pornography and blasphemy and offensiveness or, if you prefer it, to spread communist or subversive propaganda. That is what they are suggesting. We must surrender to that type of person. We must simply shrug off the responsibility which rests upon us as it does upon any civilized nation and we must say that this thing is too involved and too dangerous for us. I want to admit that realism or art, pornography and all these things are relative ideas, and if one places a law on the Statute Book, it is quite possible that in 20, 30 or 40 years that law will have become completely obsolete. It is then for that generation to say that the legislation no longer serves its purpose and is no longer necessary. In the days in which are living, however, this Bill is certainly necessary.</p>

<p>They say that this matter is very dangerous and involved, but what is more dangerous than poison in the hands of a person who does not know how to use poison? He only knows that he can use it to kill an animal or a person. One has the intricate medical course followed by our doctors. One has dentists, veterinary <span class="col_513-514" refersTo="page_0271"/>surgeons, chemists&#x2014;all people who work with a large variety of poisons which they use to good purpose and in the correct quantities in order to alleviate pain or to save the lives of human beings or animals. If we find it necessary to control the giving of poison to an animal or person by legislation in our country, and to control it so strictly that on each phial of pills or medicine dispensed, the type of poison it contains and its quantity has to be indicated, are we going to be so weak-kneed that we are not going to pass legislation in South Africa to prevent the spiritual life, the moral life of our nation&#x2014;the norm of what is decent and what is indecent&#x2014;from being exposed, without redress, to the steadily increasing doses of that poison of the soul? That was the evidence adduced before the Select Committee. It was precisely in the light of that evidence that the Government decided to introduce this Bill. I say that if we take the speeches of members of the official Opposition as they have been recorded in Hansard, we will find that I was correct when I said at the start of my speech that they are not only in a peculiar position but that they find themselves on the horns of a dilemma and they do not know how to extricate themselves from the dilemma because they know that if we get them out of their difficulties they will find themselves in the political wastepaper basket which is the proper place for them.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Listening to the hon. member for Karas (Mr. von Moltke), one immediately gets the impression that he has in a somewhat hysterical manner tried to follow an unfortunate theme which the hon. the Minister laid down in his opening words in this debate. I think some of us were somewhat taken aback when the hon. the Minister suggested that unless a nation or a people were properly controlled, they either would tend to deteriorate to barbarism or they would in fact be merely a nation of barbarians. I wonder why the hon. the Minister found it necessary to make this peculiar allusion to the state of the people of South Africa in laying the theme of the justification for the introduction of this Bill to the House. I think it was a very unfortunate reference because somehow it seemed to bear no relation at all to the facts of the situation. The hon. Minister knows as well as most people, certainly as well as any member of this House, that there is a great deal of legislation dealing with many aspects of censorship and the control of publications, printed matter and the spoken word. He also knows that for some years the Government has been endeavouring to provide some Bill which will take the place of that various legislation, and at the same time to provide a form of control which they feel will prove satisfactory not only from the point of view of the security of the morals of the nation but also, one is somehow left to think, from the point of view of the security of the Government&#x2019;s own policy and the policy of the party which it represents. This particular type of thinking has been almost consistent in the whole of the Government&#x2019;s approach to many of the problems in this country. In fact when one looks back in perspective at some of the legislation and more particularly at the utterances of members of the Government, one is somehow led to crystallize one's thinking that the Government approaches every problem of the nation&#x2019;s future with a sense of fear. The hon. member for Karas for instance used as one of his examples the fact that Communistic literature could be disseminated in this country and we, the members of the Opposition, were sufficiently disinterested in the life of the nation as not to agree to support the Minister in a Bill which would save the country from the effects of the dissemination of this type of literature. Of course he forgets to note that in the Suppression of Communism Act, Section 6 says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the Governor-General is satisfied that any periodical or other publication professes, by its name or otherwise, to be a publication for propagating the principles or promoting the spread of Communism, or is published or disseminated by or under the direction or guidance of an organization which has been declared an unlawful organization &#x2026; he may, without notice to any person concerned, by proclamation in the <i>Gazette</i> prohibit the printing, publication or dissemination of such periodical publication, or the dissemination of such other publication &#x2026;</block>

<p>In other words, there was legislation which protected our people from the harmful effects of the dissemination of literature of this character. One must therefore assume that the efforts of the Government over the last seven or eight years to bring a Bill of this nature before the House was to consolidate the existing legislation (which is contained not only in statutory legislation but also in ordinances of various provinces) so that there should be some consistency in the approach to this particular problem, which, as has been rightly pointed out, has exercised the minds and the attention and in fact the Statute Book of the other nations of the world. It is quite true that the hon. the Minister is not doing anything new; he is not doing anything original, in bringing that state of affairs about, because most civilized countries have some form of protection for the public with regard to the type of literature that is disseminated, especially these days when the printed word is so profusely distributed through so many forms of publication. But it would be interesting to note that this side of the House did move ten amendments in the Select Committee to the proposed Bill that was suggested by the majority of the Select Committee, and that all of these amendments were turned down. So it is no surprise to the hon. the Minister or members on his side of the House that this side of the House must take objection to this Bill in its present form.</p>

<p>Your people agreed to the principle.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>It is accepted that both sides of the House find it desirable to have legislation which will avoid the dissemination of this type of literature, particularly in these days when we know there has been a loosening of some of the more conservative forms of thinking throughout the world, when there has been a straining of some of the bonds which have bound certain of our thinking over the years in the field of morality, in the field of family life. We realize as a nation which prizes the traditions of family life that it is important to protect our young people, our adolescents, and quite often our adults, against the type of literature which has been thrown onto the market in order to find a ready form of sale and so some form of income for almost any person who can put his pen to paper. Nevertheless we must approach this from an objective point of view and we must do so in the interests of the nation and not in the interests of any section of political thinking or in the interests of any section of the community. So whilst there is no doubt that both sides of the House want legislation either in a consolidated form to replace what is presently in the Statute. Book, or in any event desire that legislation should be maintained, that does not necessarily mean that this side of the House accepts the Bill as the Minister has placed it before us, and in fact we ask that this Bill be taken back because this is not what was asked for.</p>

<p>Let me just reiterate one or two facets about this Bill which we do not like. For instance the definition of the term &#x201C;undesirable&#x201D; is, as the hon. the Minister himself stated in his address, sufficiently vague to warrant the criticism of quite a wide field of interested persons', and I think his address in a sense almost apologized for that fact, but he felt that there was nothing vague about it at all. He said it was necessary to broaden the field so that the utmost protection could be provided. But Parliament always jealously watches the ambits of any form of bureaucratic control, which in a sense is contained in this Bill because there is not a right of appeal in respect of every aspect. For instance there is no right of appeal in regard to the cinematograph industry. There may be reasons for that. If the particular industry is satisfied that it can be left to the Minister himself, we will not quarrel with that. But nevertheless the fact remains that there is some form of bureaucratic control, and any form of bureaucratic control must be watched very jealously by Parliament in the interests of the nation. As that definition is vague, I think it is desirable, and it will appear from many of the memoranda which were lodged with the Select Committee, that there was some concern about the vagueness of that definition. The hon. member who spoke previously, and I think also the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) referred to the fact that a particular organization indicated its satisfaction with this legislation and accepted it. But if one looks at the Report of the Select Committee, one finds in fact that a considerable number of bodies, numbering in all 30, submitted letters and memoranda to the Select Committee. It seems clear from the debate that it was not found necessary to summon any of these bodies to give evidence. I am somewhat surprised therefore that stress is laid on one particular body, because I have no doubt that amongst the other memoranda objections of some nature were voiced. Various aspects of this Bill were canvassed and the Select Committee was fully aware that there was a complete cross-section of opinion, a great deal of which supported the fear of this Bill being wider than it should be in its implications or the control, or, as has been suggested, &#x201C;the censorship&#x201D; which it could command.</p>

<p>There is another aspect which I think is very important. The members of the Press Union have been excluded. But we must take into account that in 1950 a Press Commission was appointed. The whole Press of the country existed under a sword of Damocles, namely the Press Commission, with regard to its future and the control that might be exercised, or the incision that might be made into this jealously guarded industry. Some arrangement was come to between the Government and the Press Union in regard to some form of code whereby the Minister relied on the honour of the Press Union to honour the spirit of a certain code. But unless one is a member of that Press Union, one is not protected by that code and one therefore comes within the ambit of the Bill. Now, assuming that in the course of an election one were to issue propaganda which criticized the opposing party very severely, that pamphlet could be referred to the board because it does not come under the Press Union and it is a matter which under certain circumstances should be taken cognisance of as something which might promote or incite ill-feeling between certain sections of the community. There are other forms of political literature which are issued at election times or even between elections, and all these matters could be brought to the attention of the board. I do not think it can be seriously suggested, despite the approach of some of the Government members to the criticism of the Opposition, that our opposition to this Bill is to avoid some proper control over indecent or obscene literature. I think every South African accepts that it is necessary in die interests of the community, and I do not think there is the slightest doubt that there is any difference of opinion in that regard. I think some of the replies we have had from the Government side to-day have indicated a failure to appreciate what the purpose of the Opposition has been. Unfortunately that is the usual manner in which Government members approach any criticism from the Opposition. As South Africans, we all have one thing in common, and that is the protection of the interests of our country and its people, and we will always be at one with the Government when legislation is <span class="col_517-518" refersTo="page_0273"/>placed before the House, particularly after a Select Committee and after many years of effort on the part of the Minister to produce an acceptable Bill, if that Bill meets to some extent the wishes of the majority of the people.</p>

<p>Do not say that; prove it.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>You have had memoranda from 30 organizations; you have had criticism from the very people who import this literature into the country, and no one can deny that our country has been very well served by some of these publishing organizations in South Africa, which have, from mushroom organizations, grown into some of the biggest and important organizations in the Western world. They have rendered a great service to S.A., not only in the field of general literature, but particularly by their contributions to the educational life of our country. All of us remember our days at school when some of these publishing organizations were our only means of access to any form of printed books. They went to great expense. I do not want to mention names, but some of the publishing organizations of this country have made a definite contribution to the welfare of this country at the expense of investors and at the expense of well-meaning South Africans and pioneers who sank all their worldly possessions into establishing a printing and publishing industry and putting South Africa on the map in the field of printed matter. This side of the House is opposing the Bill because it believes that this Bill is not what is wanted by both sides of the Select Committee, and the hon. the Minister should explain to us why it has taken three efforts eventually to bring a Bill before this House. Why was the Bill withdrawn a year or two ago from the Select Committee, and two years ago it was also withdrawn? Why was the Minister compelled to bow to criticism from all sections of the country? He had to withdraw the Bill and send it to a Select Committee again. Surely that must indicate that it has not been the easiest thing in the world for him to bring something before this House which is acceptable to the people of S.A. I do not want to repeat what has appeared in <i>Dagbreek,</i> but there is no point in members of the Government side laughing off what appeared in <i>Dagbreek.</i> We had some of the most eminent South African writers who commented on the matter. It is a newspaper which, despite the fact that it supports the Government, nevertheless enjoys prestige and is read far and wide. I feel that is the organ which any Government must take note of, particularly if it is the voice of the Government itself. Admittedly the Minister may say that it shows the democracy of the Government&#x2019;s outlook that its own mouthpiece is prepared to be critical of it, but it cannot be dismissed like that; one has to take note of it.</p>

<p>The suggestion we make on this side of the House is that the Bill be read this day six months, which indicates our hope that the Bill will be withdrawn, and our conviction that the Minister still has not produced a Bill satisfactory to the House and that it falls into the category of the previous Bills which have been submitted. Finally, will the Minister go into greater detail and explain why he introduced the Bill on the note that unless there was control&#x2014;and I assume that when he talks of control of the people he also incorporated control of what the people read&#x2014;we would sink into a state of barbarism. If the Minister had spoken about a people being self-disciplined and exercising self-discipline in the face of serious problems, one could well understand that some philosophic thought might emanate from that expression of opinion, but to blatantly tell the House that unless there is control we will sink into a state of barbarism, thereby inferring that unless literature of all kinds is properly controlled in the manner suggested by the Minister, we would all deteriorate into a state of barbarism, I feel with all respect is a hysterical utterance which really cannot convince this side of the House or any critics of the legislation that the Minister really and sincerely has taken into account the viewpoint of all expressions of opinion in South Africa.</p>

<p>For those reasons I feel that the Minister owes a duty to the House to explain why he finds it necessary to place before us this broad picture and expect this side of the House to agree with him that this is the type of legislation that is necessary in the place of something which has already been in existence and which could merely have been consolidated and perhaps streamlined to a modern form acceptable to free Western nations.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Florida (Mr. Miller), who has just sat down, places one in an embarrassing position because one does not know whether one should congratulate him on his maiden speech. I think I would be nearer the mark if I congratulated him on his grass widower&#x2019;s speech. But I might add by way of consolation that I noticed that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson) listened to his speech attentively and sympathetically.</p>

<p>Having listened to this debate for nearly two days there is one conclusion to which one can come perhaps, and that is that the United Party in this debate has revealed itself as the champion of undesirable publications.</p>

<p>Members on the other side adopted different attitudes. There was the moreoutspoken attitude, the attitude adopted by the hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan), who not only condemns this legislation but also the existing legislation. He wants no censorship or restrictions whatsoever to be imposed by legislation. Then there was also the other attitude, <span class="col_519-520" refersTo="page_0274"/>the attitude adopted by the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mrs. Weiss), who accepts or is prepared to accept certain proposals, but I say that on the whole the impression that the public must gain&#x2014;and that is also the effect of their amendment&#x2014;is that they are against the restriction of undesirable publications. I think all the various arguments raised on the other side have been replied to effectively, and I do not propose in the ten minutes at my disposal to enlarge upon it, but there is one argument which the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) advanced on which I should like to say a few words. The hon. member for Turffontein stated that under the existing legislation only one book, or very few books at any rate, had been banned over a certain number of years, while an enormous number was being banned to-day. But that is the very crux of this matter. If ever it was necessary to place legislation of this kind on the Statute Book it is to-day. Formerly there was no such pressing need to do so. In analysing the situation one finds that from 1939 to 1956 more or less 2, 800 publications were banned, but in the four years from 1956 to 1960 alone, 3, 500 books were banned. To my mind that indicates the extent to which these undesirable publications have flooded this country and the world. This is not a phenomenon that we have in South Africa only; it is a world-wide phenomenon. When one asks oneself what the explanation is, whether the standard of our literature and of our art has suddenly declined, one finds that during the last 20 years there has been a sort of liberalizing process which has been designed to spread the dialectic materialism of Karl Marx in a very delicate and deliberate way. This change has taken place not only in politics, but it has also left its imprint on art. What is happening is that the noble arts that we knew are being broken down one after another. The main purpose in art and in literature is no longer the upliftment of the soul but the glorification of the body&#x2014;and we find that in every branch of our literature and art. To mention just a few examples, the music of Bach and Strauss and Chopin is being replaced to-day by jazz and cha-cha. H&#x00E4;ndel&#x2019;s &#x201C;Messiah&#x201D; is being pushed aside and instead of that we are getting &#x201C;Ag, Pleez Deddy&#x201D; and &#x201C;Die Bokke se Klok &#x201D;. In the sphere of singing, Benjamino Gigli and Enrico Caruso have been replaced by Elvis Presley.</p>

<p>In the sphere of fine arts we find that Leonardo da Vinci&#x2019;s art is being ignored and replaced by abstract art which one can hardly understand. A few years ago there was an exhibition of abstract art in Paris and the art critics of the world praised a particular work as the ideal, and it was only after it had hung there for seven days that they discovered that it was hanging upside down. Nobody understood it. That is the direction in which art is going to-day. As a further indication as to how this liberalizing process has been taking place, I want to point out that our sculpture has advanced in the direction of Bushmen drawings. In our literature particularly there has been so much retrogression that the works of Milton and Wordsworth and Tennyson and Keats, Jan F. Cilliers and Goethe are being removed from the shelves and replaced by books bearing titles such as &#x201C;Sex without Tears&#x201D;, &#x201C;The World of Suzy Wong&#x201D;, &#x201C;T.V. Scandals&#x201D;, &#x201C;Why I am not a Christian&#x201D;, and &#x201C;Lady Chatterley&#x2019;s Lover &#x201D;. This liberalizing process that we find in our publications to-day we also find in politics, but I do not want to enlarge upon this because you will not allow me to do so, Mr. Speaker. I say that we must put a stop to this brutalization of man, this derogation from the high standards demanded over the centuries in our literature and in our art, otherwise we shall find ourselves in the situation later on that we shall be sorry and reproach ourselves for not having put a stop to it much sooner.</p>

<p>Various hon. members on the other side have quoted the opinions of a few Afrikaans writers who have allegedly expressed their views with regard to this legislation. I want to say at once that I do not believe that a single one of them had this Bill before him when he expressed his opinion. In addition to that one must distinguish between the two types of artists, on the one hand the artist who does creative work&#x2014;I am thinking, for example, of a man like Frans Venter, a person whom I know very well, and his &#x201C;Man van Cyrene&#x201D;, a work of art that uplifts the soul&#x2014;and on the other hand the quack in the artists&#x2019; gallery who sees art as a form of materialism and a way of making money. These quacks produce works on a large scale for the masses and they seek to make use of the animal instincts in man to sell their so-called art. I want to say that if the day should ever come when we in South Africa allow the quacks to dictate to us then we can give up everything that we treasure. Artists of that kind&#x2014;and unfortunately we find them on a large scale to-day in our South African literature&#x2014;are also a danger to the true artists, because of the type of art that is produced for the masses by the quacks. People no longer buy books like &#x201C;Man van Cyrene&#x201D; and other works. No, they buy the paperbacks, which concentrate on the human and the animal aspects.</p>

<p>If there is one fault to be found with this legislation which is before us it is the fact that it does not go far enough. That is my summing up. There are a few clauses, however, which disturb me and which I should like to bring to the Minister&#x2019;s attention. In Clause 9 provision is made for the censoring of certain cinema films which may only be exhibited to certain classes. I accept that the intention here is that certain cinema films may only be shown to certain age-groups. The section in the old Act, which read the same, created the opportunity for abuses in two ways, one being that cinema-owners, as a result of this provision, would advertise, just to gain publicity for their films, that the film in question was only for persons over the age of 18 years, and people would then flock to the cinemas. I want to suggest to the Minister that where this is done by cinemas, stringent steps should be <span class="col_521-522" refersTo="page_0275"/>taken against them. Our experience has been that where such an age limit is imposed, persons below that age flock to the cinema without any action being taken against them. Here in the Cape I have seen films which have been advertised for the group over 18 years and I have seen children there whose age is nearer eight years than 18. I know of a cinema which advertised that a certain film could be shown only to those over 14 years; a child of 12 went to the owner and said that he was 12 but asked whether he could see it. The owner said that he would be welcome. I want to ask the Minister to give his attention to that type of evil.</p>

<p>In Clause 12 reference is made to entertainments, and here I have in mind the strip dancing which is taking place to-day and which is a great evil. However, that is where persons pay for their entertainment. But here in the Cape we have a certain place where one can have entertainment of the worst kind without paying for it. I am talking about the swimming in the nude at Graaff&#x2019;s Pool, where there is nothing but a wall of about 6 ft. in height opposite a street where there is a block of flats of eight or nine storeys and in which everybody who wants a little entertainment swims in the nude. On a hot day when the pool is full I have seen school-girls and servants standing with binoculars in the upper storeys of their flats pointing to and looking at what is taking place there. Mr. Speaker, that pool is not a hundred paces from these flats, and an ordinary pair of binoculars can bring an object fifty times nearer. In other words, at that distance it can bring an object to within something like two paces, in other words, so close that one can almost touch it. [Laughter.] One of the first bodies which should be called to account with regard to this form of entertainment is surely the Cape Town City Council.</p>

<p>I also want to refer to Clause 5 (4) (b), and particularly (iii). There it is provided that the provisions of that clause shall not apply with reference to the printing or publishing of any matter in a publication of a technical, scientific nature <i>bona fide</i> intended for the advancement of or for use in any particular profession or branch of arts, literature or science. I am prepared to accept that that is a very good provision but I think there is one hiatus. I want to ask the Minister, in the case of really important original research works (particularly since the idea behind this measure is that it will put a stop to undesirable communist literature which is being imported into South Africa on a large scale) to allow that type of material to come in to certain approved libraries. One feels that the works of Lenin, Marx and Vishinsky are in fact of no value for the purpose of ordinary communist propaganda, but to the student they are of immense value. In this respect there is a great hiatus because those books are not available. I have made an analysis of those we have in the Parliamentary Library. We have something like 200 of them, but only a few of them are really original sources. The others are all revised works of the original sources. I want to ask the Minister to offer the opportunity to such universities and approved libraries to obtain books of that kind so that students of politics can have that material at their disposal, because I think that that is the only way in which one can really combat Communism, that is to say, by making use of works written by authorities and not by quacks. Those written by the quacks constitute propaganda which is easily digestible and makes a great impression on the masses, but if one wants to emphasize the real disadvantages of Communism, then the best method is to make use of the works of Andrei Vishinsky and other authorities.</p>

<p>I must conclude. We have heard various standpoints in this debate. At this late hour the United Party is still adopting a very frivolous attitude with regard to this legislation, but I want to put it this way that in considering this measure we have a responsibility not only to ourselves but also a responsibility towards the youth of South Africa because, after all, it is in the interests of the youth, the future nation of South Africa, that we are taking steps so that one day when they have to take over the reins they will see things in the right perspective and so that their thoughts and vision and actions will not be contaminated by undesirable publications.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the short while that I have before the adjournment I want heartily to congratulate hon. members on my side on having left me a very easy task and I want to thank them for having succeeded in dealing most effectively with the poor debating points made by the Opposition. It is a long time since I have attended a debate in which sophistries have been dealt with as effectively as in this debate. Very little remains for me to reply to. It was pathetic to listen for two days and see the mutual differences which exist between hon. members opposite in respect of very important principles. It was pathetic to realize that they all belong to the same party when the one said he wanted a board but not our board and another said that the old board that we had was quite good enough and yet a third stated that the old board was just as bad as the board that we wanted to set up. There was not even joint action or a planned attack on the Bill. But for the fact that every hon. member, after he had spoken, was replied to by one of the Government members, I would have had to give a very long reply on each point. I have quite a lot to say, however, and I cannot do it in the short time left to us and so I wish to move&#x2014;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, after the few introductory remarks which I made last night, I thought that it would be a good thing to dispose of one matter immediately, a matter which the hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan) raised here. It dealt with the report which appeared yesterday on the front page of the <i>Cape Times</i> in connection with the Book Trade Association of Southern Africa, on which the hon. member for Orange Grove thought fit to brand my behaviour towards that Association as being discourteous and also compared my action with the courteous action of the hon. the Minister of Finance. I think that it is necessary to quote three letters which were exchanged between myself and the Association in this connection. The first was an acknowledgement of the receipt of the memorandum about which hon. members complained. On my instruction my private secretary informed them on 23 August that the Minister had had the opportunity of studying the memorandum and (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister desires to thank the Association for its interest in the matter and the proposals in the aforementioned memorandum to solve the vexed problem of finding an amendment which will satisfy all interested bodies&#x2026;. After studying the memorandum it appears to the hon. the Minister that instead of your Association interviewing him in regard to this involved matter, it will possibly be better if you submit any further points which your Association wishes to raise by way of a memorandum to the Minister. It will be appreciated if any such comments can be transmitted as soon as possible.</block>

<p>The Association replied to me as follows on 4 September (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We acknowledge with thanks the receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant in connection with the above matter. We note with thanks the fact that the hon. the Minister of the Interior has had an opportunity to study the memorandum drawn up by the Book Trade Association. We also want to express our thanks to the Minister for giving us the opportunity to submit further points to him by way of a memorandum.</block>

<p>What follows now is very important (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At this stage there are no further points to submit but we would like again to ask that because of the involved nature of the matter the Minister afford us the opportunity of explaining our memorandum through the medium of an interview. I have been instructed further to ascertain from the Minister whether it is his intention to introduce the proposed Publications and Entertainments Bill during the next session of Parliament in its present or in an amended form.</block>

<p>That makes no difference; the hon. member must listen to the reply. There is nothing wrong with the time factor. My private secretary&#x2019;s answer was as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am instructed by the Minister to acknowledge receipt of: your letter of 26 October in connection with the Publications and Entertainments Bill. Because of the pressure of work my Minister is not able to grant your Association an interview before he goes on leave on 1 December 1962. Minister de Klerk is also not sure whether he will be able to find the time to grant you an interview before the introduction of the Bill because it will in all probability be the first piece of legislation to be placed before Parliament</block>

<p>Next comes the sentence containing my invitation (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">My Minister is, however, prepared to consider written representations from your Association after the Bill has been introduced into Parliament. With this in mind, my Minister will introduce the Bill in Parliament as early as possible, most probably during the first few days of the Session&#x2026;.</block>

<p>and notice was given on the opening day&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Your Association should make its representations as early as possible during the week in which the no-confidence motion is dealt with.</block>

<p>The only reply I received to that letter was the last letter of 29 January in which they had this to say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the light of the aforementioned &#x2026;</block>

<p>namely, that they still had objections&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the Association knows of no reason why the memorandum which it submitted to you <span class="col_525-526" refersTo="page_0277"/>should not be released to the Press. This serves respectfully to inform you that the aforementioned memorandum was to-day made available to the Press for comment.</block>

<p>It is very clear that this is an entirely different picture from the one which the hon. member tried to paint&#x2014;as though I paid no attention whatever to these people. They had every opportunity to make their representations after notice of this legislation was given on Friday, 18 January. The legislation was available to them for a week [Interjection]. This is a very involved subject. I do not owe the hon. member an explanation, certainly not in regard to a matter of this nature, but I leave it to the House to decide whether I dealt discourteously with these people and gave them no opportunity to make their representations.</p>

<p>It became very clear to me during this debate that hon. members were quite ignorant of the present system by means of which we control undesirable literature or try to control it as well as the restrictive provisions of the proposed clauses which we have embodied in this Bill. In order therefore to eliminate the confusion which prevails on the other side and the possible confusion which they can create amongst members of the public, I think that it is necessary for me to explain how the systems are linked up&#x2014;both the present and the proposed systems&#x2014;so that at the Committee Stage we will not have a repetition of what we have had in this debate.</p>

<p>I want firstly to deal with our domestic literature, that is to say, literature which has its origin in the Republic. The existing legislation which controls this literature is chiefly provincial. No indecent literature, no matter of what nature, may be distributed in the Transvaal, and the penalty for an offence is a fine of R150 and/or 6 months&#x2019; imprisonment. This is provided for in Section 2 (7) of the Criminal Amendment Act, of 1909 (Transvaal).</p>

<p>The decision of the court.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, we are still dealing with the court; we are reintroducing the right of appeal to the court, a procedure from which the United Party departed in 1931. In the Orange Free State the distribution of profane, indecent or obscene literature is forbidden in all local government areas and on all diggings in the province. This is provided in Section 6 (19) of Ordinance 21 of 1902. The possible penalty for an offence in this regard is a fine of R4 or</p>

<p>30 days&#x2019; imprisonment as against R150 in the Transvaal. The Cape has two provisions. In the first place the distribution of indecent or obscene literature is forbidden and the penalty imposed is a fine of R20 or 3 months&#x2019; imprisonment for a first offence with a considerably higher penalty for organized trade and particularly too for second offences. This is laid down in Sections 2 and 4 of Act 31 of 1892. The other legal provision is Section 7 of Act</p>

<p>31 of 1802 which provides for a fine of R40 or 6 months&#x2019; imprisonment for sending indecent or obscene literature by mail. The most important provision in Natal is that every local authority throughout that province is authorized to forbid the sale of literature within its area&#x2014;that means all the thickly populated areas of Natal&#x2014;literature which it considers to be indecent, offensive, obscene or objectionable. In terms of Section 191 (4) of Ordinance 21 of 1942 the local authority can confiscate all copies which are so regarded and destroy them. I want to point out two aspects of the legislation in Natal: The City Council or the Town Council or whichever body is appointed has an absolute discretion to decide which literature is undesirable&#x2014;this is the present position&#x2014;and as long as it is honest, no court can intervene. The power given to its local authorities by the Natal Ordinance is a drastic one. But it has another characteristic and that is that this can only take place if all the local authorities in Natal&#x2014;and there may be a few dozen of them&#x2014;adopt the same resolution. The resolution cannot be taken by one authority on its own. If such local authority were to adopt such a rash resolution in regard to some literature or other, many other authorities would refuse to follow its example and accordingly one would have stalemate and nothing would be done. The shortcomings of a control system of this nature are obvious. The fact that the city fathers cannot be expected carefully to examine all the rubbish which can be purchased at every caf&#x00E9; is, of course, not their fault because this is naturally an impossible task. Over and above this area legislation a general prohibition is embodied in the Post Office Act. I refer to Section 94 (1) (c) of the Post Office Act of 1958. Indecent, obscene or blasphemous literature may not be sent through the post in the Republic or South West Africa, and the possible penalty is a fine of R100 or 6 months&#x2019; imprisonment. From this it is quite clear that the yardstick which is prescribed is reasonably uniform and that with the exception of Natal, all the prosecuting bodies are the police, that is to say, the Attorneys-General. But during 1931 the Entertainments (Censorship) Act was adopted which made provision for the censoring of films, public entertainment and pictures and in the Customs Act of 1955 as well, Section 21, taken over from Section 23 of Act 9 of 1913, we find provision for the censorship of undesirable literature etc., from abroad.</p>

<p>Now I want to compare the most important principles of the existing system with the proposed system in this Bill. The function of the courts is my first point of comparison. In the old system of the Transvaal, the Free State, Natal and the Cape, a fairly uniform yardstick was laid down. While prosecutions can take place in the Transvaal, the Free State and the Cape because it is a crime to offend against the norm, the decision in Natal on the question of undesirability is entirely at the discretion of the City Council, the town council etc. The second point in connection with the courts is that in the Entertainments (Censorship) Act of 1931 a yardstick is laid down for film and film advertisements and for public <span class="col_527-528" refersTo="page_0278"/>entertainments and pictures. The Board of Censors set up in terms of that Act make the decisions and there is only an appeal to the Minister of the Interior and not to the court. As regards the political capital which hon. members opposite try to make in connection with the so-called political censorship which is alleged to be a danger in this Bill, I cannot understand how they could be satisfied with a law for 32 years and never object to it; that when they were in power from 1931 to 1948 they did not try to do away with that appeal to a political figure, a Minister.</p>

<p>But I have a third point: In terms of the Customs Act of 1955, Section 21, the Minister of the Interior is the absolutely final judge in deciding whether goods about which doubt arises are indecent, obscene or offensive, without his being restricted in any way by definitions of these terms. There are no definitions of those terms. Can hon. members see how much scope the Minister has? There is nothing to hamper him. He has an absolute discretion under the Customs Act of 1955 to make a final decision without having any definition of the meaning of indecent or obscene or offensive.</p>

<p>That is the old law which pleases hon. members so much that they would like to see it continued with if there are to be any laws at all. It is not only the hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan) who wants no restrictions at all; he does not believe in that. There is a further point of comparison. In terms of this Bill norms are laid down to which I shall come back later. It is being provided that persons who offend against the norm can only be prosecuted on the instructions of the Attorney-General. The Minister cannot do so; no prosecutions can take place and when a person offends against the norm it is not a political figure who has him prosecuted; it is the Attorney-General who has to take legal action in all cases in which he receives complaints.</p>

<p>We will remember that when we come to the Committee Stage.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member can wait for the Committee Stage; I am trying to make his confusion a little less confounded! The second point is that any decision which the board may make regarding the undesirability of any publication or object submitted to it, is subject to appeal to the highest or the lowest. Previously there was only an appeal to the Minister. In this case persons can appeal to the highest courts. Hon. members will find this provision in Clause 14. No provision is made for an appeal to the court in terms of the present provisions of either the Entertainments (Censorship) Act of 1931 or the Customs Act of 1955. How can hon. members adopt the standpoint that they have adopted? During the term of office of the United Party Government from 1939 to 1948 these provisions were used without having regard to the rule of law, a point which the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) emphasized in a masterly fashion when he pointed out the mistakes of the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South). They were not at all concerned that the Rule of Law was being violated. This Government is now coming forward with this Bill; it is restoring the Rule of Law to its place of honour and it is now experiencing opposition from those people who always have a lot to say about the Rule of Law. The Rule of Law is being honourably restored because the accusation can perhaps rightly be made that a political figure may be partial and may keep certain publications out of the country and not allow domestic publications to see the light of day. The accusation can perhaps be made that he is doing so for political reasons. Hon. members opposite have continued to harp on the same string&#x2014;what the cruel Minister will do and how he will control matters&#x2014;and they have done so merely because he is going to appoint a board. But earlier when they had full control they were quite happy and satisfied that the law should operate in that way. As far as the board itself is concerned I want to point out that in the case of the Natal city fathers who have to undertake this censorship, no requirement of expert knowledge is made. In the case of the present Board of Censors which was appointed under the 1931 Act, no requirement of expert knowledge was made. It is a free appointment in the last case and it is a free election in the first case where expert knowledge is not a condition of appointment, although it would be very silly of any Minister to appoint ignorant people to this office. This Bill now lays down the qualifications of three of the members of the board. The Chairman of the Select Committee stated that he wished that he could lay down by legislation the qualifications of each of the nine members but in this case it was something of a compromise in that the qualifications of only three members were mentioned. Here we have a board of high standing and the law provides the degree of proficiency of the chairman, the vice-chairman and at least one other member. Previously, when it could have been any person, when the danger existed and perhaps also became reality, that political appointments could be made, nothing was said about it and the United Party were quite happy with it. The argument has been raised here that the board will be a tool in the hands of the Minister; that it will be appointed and will have to be reappointed and so the Minister will call the tune. I want to tell hon. members that that does not happen in practice. As one of the hon. members opposite had the fairness to put it, no one can expect the Minister of the Interior himself to read every book which comes into the country. He is dependent upon the opinion given to him by the members of his Board of Censors. A great deal has been said about this Board of Censors, but I want to say that the present members of the board have, by means of hard work and judicious action, done what in their opinion has been in the best interests of the country. Any censor board, no matter how many expert people it may consist of, can make a mistake just as any individual on that side or here on <span class="col_529-530" refersTo="page_0279"/>this side can make a mistake. Judgment in these cases is subjective to a large extent. Other people may consider that a subjective judgment is wrong&#x2014;that is so and it will remain so&#x2014;but the fact remains that I have only praise for what has been done under the present Act by the chairman and his members during the short time that I have been Minister.</p>

<p>The most important point is the question of the norm, the vagueness of the norm and the impossibility of fixing a norm. Most of the argument arose in this regard. As far as the board itself is concerned one does not know where one is with the United Party. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) (Mr. J. A.</p>

<p>F. Nel) made the point very effectively last night, that the United Party on the Select Committee voted for legislation through the medium of their members on that Committee; in the second place, when they divided on the clauses, they voted unanimously for Clauses 2 and 4 setting up the board. We have heard the most widespread arguments as to whether there should be a board; we heard that if there is a board it will only be a Ministerial board which will be under the control of the Minister. No amendments were moved on the Select Committee and I hope that the United Party will remain consistent. I have no objection to our differing on the question of norms, no matter how subjective it may be. When we reach the Committee Stage then, let us try to improve this Bill, but I want to say this: It is not necessary to adopt the principle at the Second Reading; the principle was supported by the United Party on the Select Committee.</p>

<p>As far as a yardstick is concerned, norms are laid down in the existing laws and in the Customs Act, norms which are fairly uniform although they do differ somewhat in their wording. The norms however boil down to this: That whatever is indecent, obscene or offensive is undesirable. That is the principle and it is not a new principle which this Government is putting into operation. This principle was in operation before Union; we needed it already at that stage. This principle was better defined and consolidated in 1931 and where it is again being modernized now in 1963 it is quite possible that it will again have to be examined and will quite probably have to be amended in 1983. I find nothing wrong with what has happened from time to time because time does not stand still and circumstances change, but as far as the principle is concerned this has been done since before Union and it has been done on the basis that what has been indecent, offensive and obscene, has been undesirable. I challenge any member opposite to say that we should not say such things; that we should say, as many United Party speakers said, that the greatest freedom lies in the fact that we must allow people to write and produce what they want to and if eventually one does not know what to call the thing that has been produced, one gives it the general name of &#x201C;art&#x201D; and then it is art. A norm has been laid down for films in the Entertainments (Censorship) Act of 1931. The board is forbidden to approve of a film which in the opinion of the board suggests something which is detremental to the security of the State or which tends to disturb law or order or to detrimentally affect public welfare or to harm morality. These provisions are in the Censorship Act of 1931. We were told that we have sufficient legislation to maintain law and order and a whole series of legislative measures were quoted in terms of which this could be done, according to the view of hon. members opposite. It is said that we have sufficient legislation, including emergency legislation, to ensure the safety of the State; we have sufficient other legislation to ensure the welfare of the public, so why this measure? I say that this Bill has been taken over from a law under which we have operated for 32 years.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>There have been many amendments to it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I will come to the amendments. The hon. member is unnecessarily concerned; he will hear everything. The board is also forbidden to approve of films which in the opinion of the board&#x2014;the opinion of the board alone and nobody else&#x2014;which depict a large variety of matters in an offensive manner. I want to refer particularly to two of these because they have already been referred to in this debate. I refer to section 5 (2) (1) and (m) of the 1931 Act. Let me quote (I);</p>

<block name="quote">Scenes calculated to affect the religious convictions or feelings of any section of the public;</block>

<p>In (m) we find that scenes are forbidden which tend to expose one or the other section of the public to ridicule or contempt. Hon. members who have followed this debate, and you, Mr. Speaker, will remember that these were two points which were most emphasized and which were even most ridiculed. We even had questions like the following from &#x201C;adults&#x201D; opposite: If one ridicules the Government slightly, will one find oneself in trouble? Things were said about the religious aspect which I do not want to repeat and those who said them came very close to being reprimanded by Mr. Speaker. These two principles under which we have operated have been written into the present Bill in the same way except that they have been modernized. There is this important difference that these two matters as well as the others which have been mentioned specifically above, and also the other matters which have been taken from the 1931 Act, have no longer to be so merely in the opinion of the board and without an appeal to the courts. There must be facts. It is no longer left to one&#x2019;s subjective judgement; the improvement in this Bill is that it must rest on fact. Is this not a restoration of the Rule of Law? Is it not true that anything that one wants to prove in court must be based on fact? They must be facts which can be tested in court without their being completely protected by the cloak of the <span class="col_531-532" refersTo="page_0280"/>absolute judgement of absolute board members whose proficiency is not even ensured by law. There is no assurance in the 1931 Act. Nowhere is the proficiency of these people assured. They are chosen and one would be silly to choose incompetent people. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) will never understand it; he must not try to understand it. These are the provisions in this Act which the United Party consider adequate and which they want to leave unchanged. They say: You must not introduce this Bill. Neither did they say: We must amend the old Act. They want nothing to do with it. They merely said: We want to effect no improvement because we want this Bill to be read a second time this day 6 months; in other words, it must not be read a second time at all.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>This Bill, yes. Using this Bill as their major premise, taking the points on which the Select Committee were in favour, hon. members could have indicated that they would accept this principle at the Committee Stage, but that they would move the necessary amendments in respect of certain matters. Then they would have moved a far more reasonable amendment. When I think of the old Censorship Act of 1931, it is a wonder to me that we still have a copy of Milton or Chaucer in the country from which to quote.</p>

<p>I want to point out further to hon. members that under the aforementioned provisions regarding religious feelings&#x2014;these were the provisions in the 1931 Act&#x2014;two books were forbidden, namely, &#x201C;Protocols, of the Elders of Zion&#x201D; and &#x201C;Maria Monk". I want to ask my Jewish friends now: If those two books had not been banned, one can imagine the hullabaloo that would have been raised in this country because the Government allowed such undesirable literature to enter the country. The hon. member for Florida (Mr. Miller) knows nothing about the books; we will give him copies so that he can read them.</p>

<p>In this connection I also want to refer to Clause 5 (4) (b) (iv) where it is laid down that this Bill shall not apply to any material in a publication of a <i>bona fide</i> religious nature. It was suggested here that religion could be interfered with. But no <i>bona fide</i> religious literature can be affected by this Bill. The norms laid down in Clauses 5, 6, 10 and 12, with the aforementioned important difference, have been taken over practically word for word in a modern form from the 1931 Act. The examples of undesirability given in Clause 6 will only apply&#x2014;there was much objection to Clause 6&#x2014;where it is undesirable in the opinion of the court, not even in the opinion of the board. It is only the opinion of the court that counts. They must determine whether such things tend to be harmful. It is not left to the absolute judgment of an absolute board or an absolute Minister, which is the position under the present legislation and which the United Party is satisfied to leave unchanged. In terms of the aforementioned provincial laws all persons and publications were subject to their provisions, but in terms of this Bill the board can eliminate the uncertainty of prosecution by declaring that a publication is not undesirable. The board can do so. The board can say in advance: &#x201C;We say that this publication is not undesirable.&#x201D; What is more, newspapers whose publishers are members of the South African Press Union will henceforward no longer be subject to this provision, only to their own code. They adopted it last year when the Select Committee was sitting&#x2014; the Government as such adopted it&#x2014;but we said that we also expected the newspapers to live up to that code of honour. In excluding newspapers we hope that they will succeed in subjecting themselves to that code of honour and that self-imposed task. Apart from what I have said here, the board can exempt any writer, any publisher, any printer, any distributor, any person who has anything to do with a publication, from the provisions of this Bill, and allow such person to continue his work without any legal restrictions in this connection. I want to refer hon. members to Clause 1 (2) and 5 (5) in terms of which some importers of a certain book can obtain full exemption from the board for the distribution of that book in the Republic. It has been suggested that these people sit there with thick red pencils. I have already stated in my introductory speech that writers and others will discover that a good name is far better than possession of all the gold and silver in this country. These people who are known to have good names will not be subject to these provisions; they will receive exemption from the board. I want to ask this question: In any of the so-called civilized countries which have been held up here as examples, is so much confidence placed in certain strata of the people that they are allowed to make such exemptions without the application of a number of provisions? The Opposition told us that they were ashamed to continue with this legislation because it created a lack of confidence, we are giving the impression that we have no confidence in the morals of our own people and that we have to impose all sorts of conditions to keep them in check. More freedom is given in this Bill than has ever been given in <span class="col_533-534" refersTo="page_0281"/>any existing law. This freedom of thought, of expression and distribution exists in few countries of the world, if it does exist. Can these provisions be regarded as a curtailment of rights except by people who do not know any better? Not. even the courts will be able to call these persons to account for their actions in connection with publications and other objects.</p>

<p>At this stage I want to direct the attention of hon, members&#x2014;particularly the hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel), who was so concerned about art&#x2014;to the provisions of Clause 5 (4) (b) (iii), where exemption from the provisions of the proposed Bill is given to any Material from a publication of a technical, scientific or professional nature which is <i>bona fide</i> intended for the advancement of or use in any particular profession or branch of arts, literature or science. The hon. member quoted from <i>Dagbreek</i> of 27 January to illustrate what Mr. Justice Marais was supposed to have said. You know, Mr. Speaker, if I did not have the article in front of me, I would probably have believed the hon. member for Hospital. I want to quote the first sentence. This is what he quoted [Translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We-saw only one defect in the Bill&#x2014;that there was no reference to the artistic aspect of a Contentious publication.</block>

<p>He stopped there. Mr. Justice Marais goes on to say [Translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On the contrary, the purpose of the maker is described as being irrelevant. If this is a shortcoming &#x2026;</block>

<p>He doubts it himself&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; it appears in practice to be of little importance because neither the board nor the court will ever be able to lose sight of the artistic value or worthlessness of any work in judging its likely effect.</block>

<p>The hon. member went so far as to quote Mr. Justice Marais as an authority to support his standpoint that we are neglecting the artistic and the beautiful, because he made an appeal to the Minister of Education, Arts and Science to ask the Minister of the Interior not to neglect the artistic. I want to say that Mr. Justice Marais most probably had an older and an earlier issue of this legislation&#x2026;.</p>

<p>&#x2026; not another Hansard; I said the original&#x2014; so that you yourself can decide who was right in this connection.</p>

<p>In this regard, in dealing with technical, professional and scientific matters, I just want to say that if any doubt arises about this matter, the courts can decide whether any such object, publication or whatever it may be, is what it professes to be and if it is something artistic, they can make the final decision. Because the provisions of this Bill aim at the combating of undesirable matter and contains a definition of what is undesirable, I can hardly see how art can be affected otherwise by the proposed provision. It is very difficult. Art cannot be defined. I challenge any person to define art. That is why, when a dispute arises as to whether something is artistic or not, the case can only be settled in the courts. I want to tell the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mrs. Weiss) and the hon. member for Hospital &#x2026; [Interjections.] The hon. member need not listen. In any event, he will not understand. Let him remain silent. The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) is a member who did perhaps contribute something to the debate last night in the last speech from the other side. She asked whether the provisions of the Bill could not be made of retrospective effect, particularly for the protection of collectors, persons and individuals who may have collections at their homes&#x2014;she even mentioned the home of Cecil Rhodes which might contain something which may be indecent or offensive &#x2014;so that these persons would be covered. My reply is: We cannot do that. One cannot make this type of law of retrospective effect. If the hon. member thinks about it herself, she will realize how difficult it would be to get hold of all publications which may have slipped through in the past. These provisions can only apply to future developments. Secondly, I want to tell the hon. member that a publication, and therefore a painting as well, and other objects may become undesirable after they have been found to be undesirable by this board which will be appointed and thereafter by a court&#x2014;or in the case of an offence, only by a court. That may happen. Thirdly, I want to tell the hon. member that if such a publication or object is not distributed or exhibited or shown or sold or offered or kept for sale by a person there is no danger of his being prosecuted. The Bill makes clear provision in this regard. Further protection cannot be offered now. I want to point out to the hon. member that before legal action can be taken the Attorney-General must decide whether such action may be taken. For the rest, the position is precisely the same as under the present law. There is no danger. The present legislation and this legislation which is before the House draw absolutely no distinction in this respect.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to conclude. I say without any fear of contradiction that this Bill will bring about freedom of publication in this country as we have never had it before, a freedom which exists in few countries. It will serve only to combat&#x2014;as is intended to do&#x2014;indecency, blasphemy and communistic propaganda which may be harmful to the people. I want to express the hope that with this explanation at their disposal&#x2014;and I hope hon. members will read it&#x2014;hon. members opposite who still honour and respect knowledge and reality will be able during the Committee Stage to make a positive contribution towards combating those things which corrupt the moral life of our people.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as this is a non-contentious and agreed measure, I hope that it will not be delayed very long by the House. I tabled a very comprehensive explanatory memorandum. Consequently I do not think it is necessary for me to deal with every clause in detail except Clauses 14 and 16 which deal with the prohibition of strikes and the setting up of amended conciliation machinery.</p>

<p>Clauses 1 and 24 are designed to place an annuitant in the same position as a member in regard to the exercising of the order of preference and secondly, placing an adopted child, who is still a minor at the time of his adopted father's death, in the same position as legitimate minor children.</p>

<p>Clause 2 amends the original Construction Act that was passed some years ago which made provision for the building of a railway line from Germiston and Elsburg to the terminus at Kwesine. The line was authorized by Parliament. The section of line south of Kwesine, will not be required for the next ten or 15 years, as we have been advised by the relevant municipalities, and to enable us to close off the accounts for the section of the line that has been completed, it is felt desirable to amend the original Act in this way.</p>

<p>Clause 3 is designed to allow more flexibility in regard to the fixing of interest rates by the Administration, that is the interest rate on housing loans.</p>

<p>Clause 4 is merely a consequential amendment.</p>

<p>Clause 5 is designed to clarify and confirm a longstanding practice and it also authorizes the sale of intoxicating liquor to Bantu passengers over the age of 18 years travelling on trains to which dining cars are attached.</p>

<p>Clause 6 makes it clear that the Administration is not required to pay any sum to the Treasury in respect of refreshment rooms and trading concessions leased to private persons. Private persons are required by law to obtain the necessary licences.</p>

<p>Clause 7 xx(bis) gives the definition of a &#x201C;staff association&#x201D;. Hon. members are probably aware that the Railway staff associations are registered as trade unions in terms of the Industrial Conciliation Act. I can also inform the House that the staff associations represent 80 to 90 per cent of the Railway servants.</p>

<p>I think this is a good opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to pay a tribute to the leadership of the staff organizations. I was Minister of Labour for six-and-a-half years, and during that time I came into very close contact with all the trade union leaders in South Africa, and <span class="col_539-540" refersTo="page_0284"/>I can assure the House that the leaders of the Railway staff associations are amongst the most competent and responsible leaders of trade unions in the whole of South Africa. They are men who are not only concerned with the welfare of their members, but they also take a lively interest in the welfare of the Railways and regard themselves as partners in this great undertaking. Over the years since I have been Minister I have received the loyalty and support of the leaders of these staff associations. As I say, xx(bis) gives the definition of &#x201C;staff associations&#x201D;, namely &#x201C;an organization, representatives of servants, which in terms of the regulations is officially recognized by the Administration as a staff organization.</p>

<p>(xxx)ter Gives a definition of strike. This has been taken over verbally from the Industrial Conciliation Act.</p>

<p>Clauses 8 to 12 are amendments to the disciplinary code. Among other matters these amendments bring various provisions into line with present practice, they seek to remove anomalies, they seek to simplify the application of the disciplinary procedure and certain new principles are introduced which are in the interest and to the benefit of the staff. A committee was appointed some time ago to enquire into the disciplinary procedure. This committee made quite a comprehensive investigation and made recommendations. These recommendations were submitted to the Federal Consultative Council of Staff Associations and the recommendations have been accepted by the Federal Council. In other words, these amendments have been agreed to by the staff, and, as I say, they are in the interest of the railway servants.</p>

<p>Clauses 11, 14, 18, 20 and 25 deal with the membership of certain statutory bodies, such as the Conciliation Board. Sick Fund Boards, Appeal Boards. Housing Boards, etc. Up to now the practice has been that the representatives of the staff on these Boards, were elected by the Railway servants. All the railway servants in a particular group had the right to vote for a representative on these Boards. Whether they were members of the staff association or not, everyone had the right to vote and any railway servant had the right to nominate another railway servant as a candidate for one of these Boards. These Boards of course consist of an equal number of representatives from the staff and from the Administrations. Representations have been made to me and to my predecessor over many years that instead of the members being elected, the staff associations should have the right to nominate representatives on these Boards. Representations were not accepted in the past, but now where the conciliation machinery is being revised, I thought it well and advisable to accede to this request. Thereby I will strengthen the position of the staff associations, and thereby the staff associations will be able to accept responsibility for decisions taken by their members on these Boards. So the position in future will be that instead of members of these Boards being elected by railway servants, they will be nominated by the staff associations.</p>

<p>Clause 12 is merely an extension of the provision in the principal Act, namely where servants are found under the influence of intoxicating liquor. That is now being extended to cover all servants working on locomotives and engines.</p>

<p>Now I come to Clauses 14 to 17 dealing with the prohibition of strikes and the creation of amended conciliation machinery. I first of all want to say very definitely that I am taking away no rights from the staff. I am merely clarifying the existing position so that there can be no doubt about the position in future. I repeat that I am taking away no rights.</p>

<p>My standpoint has always been that railway servants do not have the right, both legally and morally, to strike. The reasons why I say that are the following: In terms of the Service Act a railway employee must obey instructions, and when a servant either strikes or embarks on a go-slow strike, he disobeys instructions. The management is quite entitled to take steps against such a servant in terms of the disciplinary code, and that servant if found guilty can be either reprimanded, fined, reduced in grade or dismissed from the service. In other words, by striking, the railway servant disregards instructions and because he contravenes that provision of the Service Act, he can be charged and if found guilty be reprimanded, fined, reduced in grade or dismissed from the service. But in the past the management and the Administration have never availed themselves of this procedure. For a very good reason. When a railway servant is charged and punishment is imposed, he has the right of appeal. He can either appeal direct to the Disciplinary Appeal Board, or he can appeal to the head of his department, and if he is not satisfied with the decision he can appeal to the General Manager and thereafter to the Minister and the Railway Board. Now when you deal with individual railway servants that procedure works quite well, but when you have to deal with 10,000 or 12,000 railway servants and each one has to be charged individually, and each one has the right of appeal, either to the Appeal Board or to the Minister eventually, then hon. members will realize that it would probably take three or four years before the matter can be finalized. As a result of that the Administration has never availed itself of the procedure of the disciplinary code in the past when a strike of a large number of servants has taken place.</p>

<p>I also say that morally they do not have the right to strike. Section 46 of the Industrial Conciliation Act deals with workers in essential services and prohibits all workers in essential services from striking. They are subject to compulsory arbitration. &#x201C;Essential services&#x201D; are defined as work in regard to the provision of light and water, workers in passenger transport services, in regard to the distribution of food, in regard to the distribution of fuel. Those workers are prohibited from striking. This provision has been on the Statute Book for the past 40 years. It was accepted by the <span class="col_541-542" refersTo="page_0285"/>trade unions and was accepted by Parliament and by the country. I was Minister of Labour for 6&#x00BD; years and I never had one single request from any trade union that this particular provision should be repealed. As I say it was accepted by the trade unions and has been on the Statute Book for the past 40 years. Now I do not think that any hon. member will say that the bus services in Cape Town are more essential than the South African Railways. The whole economy of the country is dependent upon the smooth-working of the South African Railways. Now surely if the workers in the Cape Town bus service are prohibited from striking and are subject to compulsory arbitration, then the railway servants should also be subject to compulsory arbitration and prohibited from striking. I think that has been generally speaking accepted over the years. In spite of the fact that in 1922 we had a general strike of railway workers and over the years there have been one or two go-slow strikes (the 1951 go-slow strike was the last one. and disorganized road, rail and air services for a period of a month), it is generally accepted that railway servants should not strike. I say again that I cannot see how the bus workers in Johannesburg and Cape Town can be prohibited from striking because those bus services are regarded as essential services and that the railway servants can strike because the railway service is not regarded as an essential service.</p>

<p>I might say that we have been very fortunate in South Africa. Comparatively speaking there are few countries in the world which have had so few industrial troubles as South Africa has had over the years which is in a large measure due to responsible trade union leadership and excellent conciliation machinery. We need only look abroad. I think one of the reasons why Britain finds herself in economic difficulties is because the trade unions in Great Britain have got completely out of hand. They periodically hold the whole country up to ransom. I am speaking as a worker and a trade unionist with all the sympathies for the workers, but I say that when trade unions are in a position to hold a country up to ransom, some steps must be taken. That is what happened in Britain. Take the British Railways. They have an accumulated deficit of hundreds of millions of pounds. But what happens? The management of those railways are not even permitted to introduce economy measures; they are not permitted to introduce efficiency measures, because directly they do so, they are threatened with a strike. We have seen during this excessive cold spell they have had in Britain over the past month how certain workers in power stations, which is an essential service, decided to go slow&#x2014;in other words holding the country up to ransom because they wanted an increase in wages. That is the position in Britain. But we also find in Australia that the workers there, and especially the dockworkers are very strike prone. I want to give hon. members two examples. In one particular case the dock-workers had to load ice-cream on a ship for domestic use on that ship; they demanded a &#x201C;temptation&#x201D; allowance. On the threat of a strike, they were paid a temptation allowance. On another occasion they were off-loading toilet pedestals; they demanded an embarrassment allowance, and on the threat of a strike they obtained an embarrassment allowance. Fortunately we have not yet reached that stage in South Africa.</p>

<p>I think this will clarify the position, and now the railway workers will know that they are prohibited from striking. In regard to the strike provisions, I can inform the House that that has been taken over verbally from the Industrial Conciliation Act.</p>

<p>I might also inform hon. members that I had consultations with all the staff organizations in regard to this particular matter and that all the staff organizations accept this provision, namely, the prohibition of strikes. All the staff organizations, without any exception.</p>

<p>Now I want to deal with the new conciliation machinery. First of all, hon. members will see that the Conciliation Board has now been renamed &#x201C;The Conditions of Employment Advisory Board&#x201D;. That is done at the request of the staff organizations.</p>

<p>The conciliation machinery on the Railways at present consists of the following: We have a Conciliation Board consisting of an equal number of representatives of management and labour. Matters are referred to the Conciliation Board either by the Minister, at the request of staff organizations, or any grade of servants can circulate a petition and if that petition is signed by one-fifth of the members of that grade requesting that a matter be submitted to the Conciliation Board, it must be so submitted.</p>

<p>Then the staff associations have periodical meetings with the Management and they have periodical meetings with the Minister where all their claims are discussed and agreements are arrived at. There is a further provision in the Service Act, that if there is widespread dissatisfaction amongst a large number of the staff and it is felt that that might have serious repercussions and that it may lead, if it is not solved, to disorganization of the services, then the Minister must report the matter to the State President. The State President then appoints a commission of inquiry, the chairman of which must be a Judge or ex-Judge if he is obtainable, and certain other members. The State President can appoint the other members as he wishes; he is not bound by any provision that he must appoint (a) or (b) or representatives of this group or that group. This commission inquires into the matter and submits recommendations. The Minister must table the report and recommendations. But there is no provision that the recommendations must be implemented. In other words, that commission after an exhaustive inquiry can make certain recommendations and if the Minister so desires those recommendations can merely be shelved and never acted upon. That is the present position. Provision is also made that if the members of the staff circulate a petition and they ask for the appointment of a commission, the State President may appoint <span class="col_543-544" refersTo="page_0286"/>a commission. He is not under any compulsion to appoint such a commission. To sum up. A conciliation board, negotiations by the staff organizations with the management and the Minister, and eventually the appointment of a commission of inquiry by the State President if it is a very serious matter affecting a large number of the staff and if it might cause serious disorganization in the Railways. Then the recommendations can be accepted and implemented by the Minister or he can decide not to implement them and he can shelve them. That is the present position.</p>

<p>What I propose to do now is the following: First of all, if there is a dispute between a staff organization and the Minister and that dispute cannot be solved by the Conditions of Employment Advisory Board or otherwise then, unless the Minister is satisfied that it affects only a very small, insignificant number of the staff, the Minister must report to the State President. The State President will then appoint a commission of inquiry under the chairmanship of a Judge or an ex-Judge, and two other persons; one of these persons will be nominated by the staff organizations concerned, and one will be nominated by the Minister. In other words, I am ensuring that the staff will have a representative on this commission of inquiry; the Administration will appoint one, the staff organizations concerned will appoint one member, and the commission of three members will be under the chairmanship of a Judge or former Judge if practicable. This commission will then inquire into the matter, and will submit recommendations, and those recommendations must be accepted and implemented by the Minister. In other words, the Minister cannot shelve the recommendations. Once they have made recommendations and findings, the Minister must accept those recommendations and he must implement them.</p>

<p>Then in a case where the Minister decides not to recommend the appointment of a commission, where he finds that a small and insignificant number of the staff concerned is involved in the dispute, if the staff association concerned feels that the matter is so important that a commission should be appointed, they can circulate a petition among their members and if the majority of those members sign the petition asking for the appointment of a commission, such a commission must be appointed. This is a big improvement on the present position. The staff associations are ensured of representation on the commission and the Minister is compelled to accept the findings and recommendations and he must implement them. This is a <i>quid pro quo</i> for the strike provision clause. In other words, I am bringing the railway servants in line with servants in essential services outside the Railways, making them subject to compulsory arbitration. Those are Clauses 14 to 16, which, as I say, the staff organizations have accepted and are prepared to support. So I hope that hon. members will also support them.</p>

<p>Clause 21 is designed to benefit those members who normally retire at an earlier age than 60 years and who are prematurely retired as a result of ill-health. This is again to the benefit of the staff</p>

<p>Clauses 22, 23 and 26 merely bring into line servants who are forced to resign with servants who are dismissed from the service.</p>

<p>The last clause is Clause 27 which validates certain changes in conditions of employment as set out in the Schedule. As I have said the Bill is quite innocuous and non-contentious and I hope it will have the support of the House.</p>

<speech by="#russell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RUSSELL</person>:</from>

<p>I am always very suspicious, Mr. Speaker, when hon. the Ministers approach this House in a smiling and confident way with what they call &#x201C;non-contentious legislation &#x201D;. Let me, however, thank this Minister for the patient explanation of his plans and for the White Paper which gave us so much valuable information about the measure before us now.</p>

<p>This Bill, as the Minister has said, makes very many changes in existing laws and regulations and most of them are aimed at streamlining the working and the administration of the Railways in several important aspects, as well as meeting many of the inconveniences and easing many of the difficulties to which the staff, in one form or another, has been subjected. I gather moreover that most of the provisions which are being changed are supported by railwaymen through their staff associations. Many of the amendments do not involve great matters of principle and those can and will be dealt with in committee rather than at this stage of the Bill. We feel that is the proper time and will have what I hope will be valuable suggestions to make in connection with several clauses.</p>

<p>In my opinion the Bill can be divided into three main headings. First, it introduces necessary and, I think, reasonable changes in the disciplinary code applicable to railway servants. It clears up many ambiguities and brings the old Acts up to date. We agree with the Council of the Staff Associations that there have been improvements, and we find them acceptable. Second, it makes advantageous and necessary changes in relation to pensions, which we also approve. In the Committee Stage hon. members will probably have further suggestions to make which I am sure will be interesting to this House. We note that the actuaries are satisfied with the changes which have been made and assure us that no ill-effects will result to the finances of the Superannuation Fund. May I add that I like the idea of placing housing loans on a five-year, average-interest basis. That has been approved by the staff and I think it is a very sensible way of administering interest collections on housing loans. It seems to me that most of this Bill is good and that very little, but a significant little part of it, calls for comment. The basic change I wish to deal with now is the most important object of this Bill, namely to remove the strike weapon from the hands of railwaymen.</p>

<p><span class="col_545-546" refersTo="page_0287"/>Now the Minister asserts that railwaymen never had the right to strike. The Artisan Staff certainly have always been under the impression that they did have it. What is more, over the years they have indulged in various forms of strike without the legality of that action being questioned. They have threatened this very Minister with strike action and on the strength of the threat have won for themselves wage increases. So that they clearly believe they have the right. In the interviews they have given to the Press, following their discussions with the Minister, it is quite clear from their statements that they feel they have given up a powerful weapon which they not only thought they possessed, but which had been acknowledged by practice. The Railway artisans valued their right to strike very much. It is quite clear that they consider that the Minister, as he is very capable of doing, has driven a very hard bargain.</p>

<speech by="#russell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RUSSELL</person>:</from>

<p>No. I will not say that. Although I know he is capable of using the big stick, I do not know enough to say that he used it in these negotiations. It was almost with regret that the trade unions had to admit that they had agreed to the Ministers propositions. They protested that they were losing a valuable right. It is quite clear that they only reluctantly agreed to give up this weapon which they thought they had in their possession. In the White Paper the Minister deals with the strike weapon in deceptively modest words. It says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The term &#x201C;strike&#x201D; is being defined in view of the introduction of Section 28<i>bis</i> (which is Clause 16 of this Bill). The definition is based on that contained in the Industrial Conciliation Act of 1956.</block>

<p>As the Minister has pointed out. the key clauses are Clauses 7, and 14 to 16, which, read in conjunction, raise important matters of principle. When the Minister says that this legislation is a non-contentious measure and that all the staff associations have agreed to it, I wonder whether in fact all the alternative possibilities for settlement, including one which I will presently suggest were put clearly and concisely to the Associations, or not. I know that if it were claimed in this House that the Chambers of Commerce or Industry had been consulted on any matter, commercial men and industrialists would deny that such consultation was adequate unless that consultation was complete and thorough. The practice of consultation with these organizations presupposes that they have had the whole Bill placed before them in draft form. They expect to have time to examine it minutely, often together with the public servants who would be in charge of any alterations that might flow from the negotiations. The examination is a patient one and all alternative propositions are canvassed and discussed. I know this because I have served on many of these committees myself over a period of 15 years. Now, was this type of consultation carried out with the staff associations? Did the Minister negotiate with them in this way? The only information I personally have to go on is my talks with certain members of the Staff Association and from Press reports I have seen. From these sources it seems to me that the Minister had planned to remove the right to strike from the artisans whether they liked it or not. The Minister threatened to take away the right to strike this time last year in this House. What I want to know is this. Did he just go to them and say: &#x201C;I am going to remove this right, but I will give you this and that in its place; I will give you improved negotiating machinery but only on condition that the right to strike is prohibited? Was that the type of &#x201C;negotiation&#x201D; indulged in? Or was there really patient consultation in an atmosphere of give and take between both sides? Mr. Speaker, to me the right to strike is a very important one indeed. I think it is one of the most potent and necessary rights that the working man possesses. When the Minister in his definition of a strike makes it so wide that all forms of withdrawal of labour are included we should examine the clause very carefully. According to the wording, the railwaymen are not allowed to refuse to resume work, to refuse to comply with the terms and conditions of their employment, to retard the progress of work, to obstruct work or to break their contract, if the objective is any of the following things: first to force the Administration to agree to their demands concerning terms and conditions of employment; second, to refrain from giving effect to changed conditions of employment; third, to restore the terms and conditions which existed before the change was made &#x2026;</p>

<p>The Minister knows, and the whole history of its existence shows that the artisan staff has been unique in this that they alone had machinery registered in their approved constitution by which they could determine whether or not they should strike. He knows that they have had this power and that they have used it. They had a &#x201C;go slow&#x201D; strike in 1945 and won their point in a dispute with the United Party many years ago. They forced the appointment of a judicial commission. under Mr. Justice Grindley-Ferris. The strike weapon was the way they got their way. The Nationalist Party did not then say it was an illegal strike. The United Party did not say that they would take away the workers right to strike in revenge. We did not believe that it was necessary to do so, because the workers had always used that right in a responsible way &#x2026;</p>

<p>They threatened to strike under the Nationalist Party last year, unless they got increased wages, and would have done so if the Minister had not yielded. This is what I want to put to the Minister. He remembers the debates we had last year on the workers demand for a wage increase. He refused it adamantly. He was determined that he would not grant increases. We on this side urged that the men had earned them by their long and arduous service. They had transferred a deficit into a surplus. They had not asked for any extra benefits for overtime. They did the best they could as loyal servants to mend the condition of the Railways and make it more healthy financially and more efficient from the running point of view. The Minister refused to grant their claims, and they threatened to strike: 75 per cent of them voted in favour of strike action. Some of them used rather desperate language. One worker said, &#x201C;Even if the Minister says we have no right to strike, we have that right and we will strike and he cannot put 17,000 people in gaol&#x201D;. Would the Minister have given in to them if they did not have that right to strike?</p>

<p>I did not give in to them.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RUSSELL</person>:</from>

<p>Well, they got their way. They got their rise in wages. I suppose he will say that is the way a man gets married; he does not give in but she gets her way. I am convinced that what forced the Minister to give in was the thought that the artisan staff had the right to strike. Or at least the Minister was not certain that they did not have it. They have claimed it since 1925. and the machinery by which they could bring about a strike was recognized and legally registered. I think the Minister should remember that although we regard this new machinery as excellent and as an improvement, and although we think this idea of a compulsory investigation is a great step forward, we still feel that the artisans have been forced to give up very valuable rights. We are certain that this new machinery is bound to result in a quicker settlement of disputes, because of the very fact that an investigation must take place. Previously the Minister has refused to have such investigations even when the workers wanted them. Regardless of the seriousness of a dispute, he has had the right to say &#x201C;no dispute exists &#x201D;. If in his opinion it is not a serious enough matter, he need not, in the past, advised the Governor-General to appoint a Commission. Now he is forced to do so and that is a great improvement. He has increased the number of members of each association from 20 per cent to 50 per cent, who have to petition for a commission. I think that is fair; and I am sure the men agreed to it. The fact, however, remains that an important concession was won by the men, the compulsory investigation. But is it enough? I am just wondering whether the Minister put this proposition to them. Did he, in the case of the artisan staff, suggest to them that this compulsory investigation. plus the retention by them of the right to strike (as they had always had before) would not be an even more effective weapon? Need he have taken this other step of prohibiting strikes? Did he ever discuss that proposition with the artisan staff? Did he ever make that suggestion to them, or did they make it to him?</p>

<p>Then he pointed out that in terms of existing staff regulations it was an offence not to carry out an order. &#x201C;The Minister told the delegation that the Railways were an essential service and that a strike by the railway staff would cause chaos in the country &#x201D;&#x2026; &#x201C;After Mr. Schoeman&#x2019;s explanation, the * Spoorbond &#x2019; delegation gave its support to the proposed legislation.&#x201D; But they clearly had doubts.

<p>That is precisely my point, and I am glad that the Minister has made it for me. They did not want the right to strike removed. I think myself that he made up his mind last year, particularly in connection with the Artisan Staff Association, to remove the right to strike. That is the right which gives a trade union teeth in its collective bargaining. He has extracted those teeth. I do not say that he has given them false teeth in exchange. He has given them something they can use and it is for this House to decide whether by taking away the right they had to strike and substituting for it compulsory arbitration, he has in fact given them an adequate <i>quid pro quo.</i> The Executive of the A.S.A. believe they have a good substitute, according to the Minister. We have not yet heard the men putting their point of view. They may well think that their Executive made the best of a bad bargain.</p>

<p>At this stage I want to ask the Minister something else. This legislation comes before us to-day. The Minister knows that in March the Artisan Staff Association are having their annual congress and Mr. Liebenberg has indicated that this removal of the right to strike and the substitution therefor of compulsory arbitration will then be discussed by the Artisan Staff. Now that would be an occasion on which Parliament and the public could hear public debate of the whole question and learn all the facts; we could hear the men&#x2019;s point of view, as we have now heard the Minister&#x2019;s point of view. We have only had the other side put to us by hearsay. We would have it in actual fact. After hearing the public discussions between the railwaymen I think we could judge more clearly between the two sides. The staff may have other suggestions to make. I do not know. I do not pretend to be an expert on this matter. I regard Parliament in this instance, as being almost in the position of judging between two contestants. The Artisan Staff Association claims they have the right to strike. The Minister says they have not, and he will fix it. They threaten to strike and the Minister says, &#x201C;I will fix you&#x201D;, and here he tries to. I ask the Minister, in order to be able to judge fairly, should we not have all the facts from both sides so that we can judge what the different sides want in this dispute? It may be that they will come up with exactly this same sort of machinery. I do not know, but will it not hinder us to delay and have this Bill read in two months&#x2019; time? No strike is threatened. All the railwaymen have just had an increase in wages. They are well on the way to a big surplus and everything is rosy in the garden. Why is this hurried through now?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Do you regard the passenger bus service in Cape Town as a more essential service than the Railways?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#russell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RUSSELL</person>:</from>

<p>That is quite irrelevant to what I was saying but I will reply. No, but there are several differences. It is very difficult <span class="col_551-552" refersTo="page_0290"/>to tell exactly what sections of public transport are actually essential. Some differ from others. For instance, the ex-Minister of Transport, Mr. Sauer, actually said that the railway catering services were not essential services and he was right. So there is a part of the Railways which is not considered essential. I concede that the running staff is essential and that anything which would immediately incommode the transport of goods or persons or foodstuffs is serious and as such it is an essential service. But there are certain aspects of the railway service that would not do so. There would be time to have a dispute and time to negotiate and cool off while going through the ordinary conciliation machinery and come to a settlement before vital communications were effected. And do not forget this, that even if the artisans did strike and the public were inconvenienced there would be an immediate public reaction against them if they were in the wrong. If a clothing factory strikes, nobody thinks they will go naked and the public do not take a serious view of it. But in a transport strike the public would be immediately incommoded and the rights or wrongs of the dispute would be immediately brought to the attention of the public. No body of public servants would dare to worsen their case if it were bad, in the eyes of the general public in that way. I am conscious of the fact that the railway service is in a special category. Railway servants have great protections. They are not like the ordinary workers. Their conditions of service are guaranteed. They cannot be dispensed with just at any moment if it suits the employer to cut staff. But the Minister should remember this: if you take away a worker&#x2019;s right to strike, you must substitute something for it that is equally potent. Has the Minister done that? That is the point. Nobody, whether he works in an essential service or not, should ever be placed in the position where he can be victimized by the employer. In the same way no worker in an essential industry should ever be able to hold the public or the State up to ransom. But we in this House have to try to hold the balance equally between these two contesting interests and we have to approach the matter as objectively as we can. Finally I ask the Minister to answer, honestly, this one question: Is he certain, and are the men certain, that this right to strike&#x2014;which rightly or wrongly they thought they possessed &#x2014;has been replaced by an equally good weapon? Is the <i>quid pro quo</i> which the Minister has given to them equally powerful? Does it ensure that the workers cannot be victimized; that in future they can put forward their just claims for improvements and increases in wages with the same force and potency that they could before? If I can get an answer, both from the men and the Minister, that this is so I will be satisfied with this legislation. I hope the Minister will think the matter over seriously. That is the main comment I have to make on this Bill. The other amendments we all welcome. We will try to improve what is already good in the Committee Stage. I hope that the Minister in his reply will satisfy me by giving a more convincing picture than he did in his introductory remarks of the consultations that have gone on between himself and the staff associations before getting their agreement to this legislation, in its present form. I hope he will be able to say with complete candour that in every respect and in all aspects the railwaymen have not only been adequately consulted but that they have entirely agreed with the Bill presently before us, and especially whether or not they willingly surrendered the right to strike.</p>

<p>During the past ten years I have seen how the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell) acts in this House, but I have never known him to be in greater difficulty than this afternoon. I have never known him to find it as difficult to state a case as he did this afternoon, and I think he will be the first to admit that.</p>

<p>It was interesting to see how the hon. member for Wynberg tried to find a reason why the staff associations had come to a stage where they had accepted and admitted the fact that they should not be allowed to strike on the Railways. At one stage&#x2014;and this is saying a great deal for the hon. member for Wynberg&#x2014; he was prepared to admit that the reason for that was to be found in the personal ability of the Minister to handle the staff effectively. The hon. member was in a difficult position, but I just want to say this to him, that I think the simple fact of the matter is, and he will have to admit it, that the staff associations have agreed and that they approve of this measure.</p>

<p>As far as I am concerned this Bill has three characteristics. In the first place the object of this measure is to state clearly what the position is in respect of a number of matters in regard to which there was or may be uncertainty. As example I can refer to the provisions of the Disciplinary Code. The object is to clarify those provisions which lend themselves to misunderstanding or misinterpretation and to eliminate irregularities and thus simplify the Disciplinary Code. Thus Clause 8 (b), which amends Section 18 (5) on the principal Act, does not deal at all with the principles contained in the provision dealing with departmental contraventions and criminal prosecutions, but it only tries to eliminate the confusion which existed in this connection. Secondly greater concessions are conferred upon the staff in this Bill. Clause 8 (b) adds a new subsection to Section 18 of the principal Act which will enable the Railway Administration to give an employee, when disciplinary or criminal action is pending against him, the choice of taking a job in a lower grade at less remuneration instead of being suspended. In other words, whereas the position to-day is that an employee may be suspended as an employee, he will in future only be suspended in his grade and in the meantime he will be allowed to work in a lower paid grade until the disciplinary or criminal case against him <span class="col_553-554" refersTo="page_0291"/>has been finalized. That will, therefore, prevent an employee and his family from suffering want while a case is pending against him. That is to be welcomed. I also think the fact that for the first time since 1925, except for a few amendments in 1960, there has been a general smartening up of the Disciplinary Code, will be welcomed in all quarters. That was a matter in regard to which it was felt for some time that certain shortcomings had developed and that it was necessary to remedy those. As the hon. the Minister explained the matter was referred to a committee; this committee submitted a report and the Federal Consultative Board of the Staff Associations of the S.A. Railways accepted its recommendations. Because the matter had been thoroughly considered and because there had been negotiations I think the House as a whole will not only welcome these amendments but will also support them, as the hon. member for Wynberg rightly said. A third characteristic of this amending measure is that this Bill contains very few new principles. One new principle is this that in future the representatives of the staff serving on departmental boards and committees will no longer be elected by the staff but will be nominated to them by the staff associations. I honestly have to admit that I personally am not very happy about this amendment. To me it savours of a departure from the recognized and sound democratic principle that the voice of the people is supreme. On the other hand a very strong case could probably be made out for it that they should be staff members of the staff associations so as to ensure that in this way that they will at least have a say, even though it is only an indirect say, in the nomination of members to these boards and committees. Another consideration which we, of course, cannot lose sight of, is the fact that out of a total of 107, 398 White employees who can join the staff associations, 78, 469 are already members of the staff associations of the Railways. Those staff members who can belong to the staff associations, therefore, constitute a definite and overwhelming majority. I take it that the staff associations insisted on this amendment and that they were probably to a very large extent justified in doing so, particularly where experience has shown, as is evident from the explanatory memorandum, that the majority of candidates who are supported by the staff associations are usually elected and elected unopposed in most cases. For these reasons and also because it will eliminate the great amount of work and expense connected with these elections, I am prepared to accept the position although I did not feel too happy about it at the beginning.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg doubted whether the S.A. Railways should be regarded as an essential service in comparison with those services which are regarded as such in terms of the Industrial Conciliation Act.</p>

<p>Yes. This Bill states it clearly and places it beyond any doubt that the staff of the Railway service is not allowed to strike. The Minister rightly pointed out that it was always his attitude that railwaymen did not have the right to strike because Section 46 of the Industrial Conciliation Act laid down that all workers in essential services were prohibited from striking. If the transport services of a local authority, of a municipality or of a private concern are regarded as essential services I think it is logical and obvious that the largest transport undertaking in the country, namely the Railways, cannot be regarded as anything else but an essential service. Any transport service which is limited to a local area can cause disruption in the event of the transportation staff striking but they can only cause disruption in that very limited area, such a small limited area that it practically need not cause any economic disruption. But if a strike on the part of the Railway staff brings the trains to a halt and paralyses the transport system of the Railways, it is not only the passenger service which is paralysed, but it can disrupt the whole economy of the country because of the fact that goods and products cannot be conveyed. When we think of the great service which the S.A. Railways renders to trade, to industry and to agriculture, we realize what disastrous effects it can have on our industrial and economic development if the trains are brought to a halt by a strike on the part of the Railway staff. I think, therefore, that the hon. the Minister is correct in adopting the attitude that the Railways perform one of the most essential services in the country. When we go into the history of the S.A. Railways we find that strikes are really something foreign in our entire Railway system. Since the inception of the S.A. Railways to date there have only been 18 strikes, nine strikes amongst the White staff and nine strikes amongst the non-White staff. All those strikes were, however, limited to a negligible percentage of the staff, and in most cases they were limited to certain areas only. Except for the strikes amongst the White staff in 1922, 1950 and 1962, the strikes of 1914, 1919, 1920, 1934, 1947 and 1951 were all limited to the mechanical workshops, while the strikes of 1919 and 1934 were confined to the workshops at Pretoria alone. The strike of 1922 by the White staff was in sympathy with the workers who went on strike in the coal and gold mines; the 1950 strike was limited to Danskraal only and the 1962 strike was limited to the artisan staff of the Airways. All the strikes amongst the non-White staff were in the main amongst the dock-workers at Port Elizabeth, Durban and East London. I think, therefore, that I am very justified in saying that strikes are something foreign to amongst the Railway staff and that they have indeed very seldom resorted to this weapon. It proves further that there exist sufficient and effective means and avenues in the Railway service, means and avenues which have been created from time to time, whereby disputes can be settled by means of negotiation. There is no necessity therefore, for the Railway staff to resort to the strike weapon. As a matter of fact, at the <span class="col_555-556" refersTo="page_0292"/>present moment our system of reconciliation in South Africa has developed to such an extent, has been planned so thoroughly, and has so effectively been embodied in legislation, that the strike weapon has to a very great extent completely lost its value. Further more there are such effective legal weapons and such excellent opportunities for negotiation in the Railway service for the staff that the necessity of the strike weapon has disappeared completely. As the Minister has pointed out, in this very Bill provision is made for even greater arbitration rights and better weapons are even placed in the hands of the Railway staff. Here I refer to Clause 15 of the Bill. As the Minister has pointed out, provision is made here that in the event of representations by any staff group via their staff association fail, the majority of the staff group which is concerned in the dispute can request the State President to appoint a commission to investigate the cause of the dispute and to make recommendations. The present position is, of course&#x2014;and it is in this regard that this Bill brings about such a very important change&#x2014;that any staff group has the right to ask for such a commission but to-day it can be refused and if such a request were acceded to and a commission appointed and it made certain recommendations the Minister could ignore those recommendations. But provision is now made in this Bill&#x2014; and this is the important difference&#x2014;that if the appointment of such a commission is requested the request must be acceded to and the commission&#x2019;s recommendations must be carried out. This amendment, therefore, provides the staff with yet another and very effective additional weapon, a weapon which they do not have at the present moment. If they have a case which they can justify and it is properly investigated by such a commission, they can in this way get the Minister and the Administration to change their views and force them to make concessions. I am pleased to see that the hon. member for Wynberg has returned. I should like to have his attention for a moment. I am somewhat surprised at the attitude which the hon. member for Wynberg adopted this afternoon towards strikes. He adopted the attitude that the Railway staff should not be deprived of the strike weapon.</p>

<p>I have already indicated the great concession which the hon. the Minister is giving in Clause 15 and that when a staff group has a justifiable case, they can force the Minister to make certain concessions. I maintain that the hon. member for Wynberg has all along adopted the attitude that the railway staff may not strike. When did the hon. member change his attitude? He has had a great deal to say lately about conflicting statements on the part of Government members. I want to say to him that if you live in a glass house you must not throw stones. Can the hon. member tell us when he changed his attitude? Since when has he adopted the attitude that the right to strike is indeed a right which the railway staff have? I want to refer the hon. member to an interjection which he made last year. When the hon. the Minister of Transport spoke about strikes in this House last year he said the following, <i>inter alia&#x2014;</i></p>

<block name="quote">I maintain that railwaymen have no right to strike whether it be a go-slow strike or any other kind of strike.</block>

<p>No, there is no better example. If there is any doubt as to whether Section 46 of the Industrial Conciliation Act does indeed apply to the Railway staff, in so far as it concerns essential services, surely there can be no doubt as to the force and the power of Staff Service Regulation No. 13 of which sub-section (4) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A servant must be obedient to all persons placed in authority over him. A servant must not disobey or disregard any lawful order given to him by competent authority, or be negligent or indolent in the execution of his duty.</block>

<p>How can a railway official take part in a strike in view of these staff regulations which apply to every member of the Railways? Surely it is as clear as daylight and it should be clear to the hon. member. I want to say clearly that I think the hon. member for Wynberg found it difficult to-day to make out a case for the strike weapon. As the Minister said. I think we must accept that the staff associations on their own accord accepted that the staff of the <span class="col_557-558" refersTo="page_0293"/>S.A. Railways could not be allowed to possess the strike weapon and I think that if we accept there ought to be no further discussion on or opposition to this amending measure.</p>

<p>I agree with a great deal of what the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) (Mr. van Rensburg) has said, particularly when he paid tribute to the Administration for Clauses 14 and 15 of this Bill which creates improved reconciliation machinery in the interests of the Administration as such. But I am sorry that he did not adopt an equally definite attitude in regard to Clause 16. I am particularly sorry that he was critical of my hon. friend, the member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell) at the beginning of his speech, not because the hon. member for Wynberg had attacked the Minister but because he had concentrated on eliciting further information from the Minister.</p>

<p>My hon. friend&#x2019;s choice of words does not alter my objection to his attitude, namely that he does not want to realize that where the hon. member for Wynberg spoke on behalf of the official Opposition, he was acting in a very responsible manner; that he accepted the <i>bona fides</i> of the Minister but only asked for certain assurances in the interests of the railway employees. I want to say at once that the Opposition supports practically everything in this Bill, except for the fact that we are concerned about Clause 16 which deprives the railway employees of the right to strike. We know that the Minister does not agree with us in that regard. I say Clause 16 takes that right away; the Minister contends that that right never existed. I submit to the Minister that it is a recognized fact that the right to strike does indeed exist. Whatever the strict legal interpretation may be, it is a fact that the artisans staff association in particular had that right. The procedure to be followed to call out a strike and how they should set about it to get 75 per cent of their members to vote in favour of a strike, is laid down in the constitution of that staff association and that constitution is registered with the Industrial Registrar and it was registered in 1925 when the Nationalist Party under General Hertzog was in power and the action of the Industrial Registrar in 1925 has never yet been questioned. As the hon. member for Wynberg has said, the artisan staff association has on more than one occasion exercised that right which is embodied in their constitution or threatened to exercise it, or bared their teeth as any trade union is entitled to do as long as it has the right to strike. The hon. member for Wynberg rightly pointed out that there was a strike in 1945 against the administration of the late Mr. Sturrock. The artisans won that strike. They insisted upon the appointment of a judicial commission; it was appointed under Judge Grindley Ferris; the Judge said that the artisans were in the right and the Administration accepted it. In view of those precedents, can the Minister really still base his policy on the allegation that the personnel of the Railways have not had the right to strike up to the present? I do not think he can do it. I wish to express my personal regret for the fact that this hon. Minister has yielded to the temptation which has become irresistible to most of his colleagues, and that is that whenever legislation is introduced into this House, there must be something or other in that legislation which curtails the rights of South Africans. Once before when the hon. the Minister was Minister of Labour he introduced a very important piece of legislation into this House. It dealt with the settlement of disputes in which the Native employees in our industries were concerned and I still remember with gratitude how responsibly the Minister acted at the time and how he set an example to his fellow members in the Cabinet.</p>

<p>Our attitude on that occasion was very clear and the Minister is now splitting hairs. We have always said that we did not believe that Natives, most of whom were still tribal Natives and had no knowledge or experience of industrial conciliation or industrial negotiations and of the machinery for the settlement of industrial disputes, should have the right to strike. It is ridiculous for the Minister to make the comparison. The two are completely incomparable. How can the Minister compare the right of primitive Natives to strike with the right to strike of the artisans in the Railway service? [Interjections.] I take it that the Minister is not serious. He thought he had raised a clever little debating point. I think he is sorry that he made that interjection. [Interjections.] I wish the hon. the Minister would approach this matter in the spirit in which we approach it. The Minister did not prohibit Natives in that legislation from forming trade unions. That was not his object. His object was to disarm the Native trade unions but he did not prohibit them. He undertook a positive task and he created other machinery for the settlement of disputes in which Natives were concerned&#x2014;good machinery&#x2014;and we supported him. Our attitude was this: Let the two systems work against each other and if the machinery of the Minister is the better the Native trade unions will automatically be disarmed. Why does the Minister refuse to adopt the same attitude in this case? It is understandable that he wishes to avoid strikes <span class="col_559-560" refersTo="page_0294"/>on the SA. Railways. That is a commendable motive, but he creates infinitely better reconciliation machinery in Clauses 14 and 15. I agree with the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) that in view of that machinery strikes will be very improbable. I personally do not see&#x2014;with one qualification which I shall mention in a moment&#x2014;how, once the machinery in Clauses 14 and 15 has been set in motion and an impartial judgment has been given in the matter concerned in the dispute, any trade union can still hope, firstly, as in the case of the artisan staff association of Iscor, to get 75 per cent of its members to support a strike action and secondly, how any trade union, although it may get it, can expect any sympathy from the public or from this Parliament. Only if the board appointed by the State President acts irresponsibly and immorally will it be possible for a trade union to justify a strike against the findings of that board. The only qualification which I want to state immediately is this: I notice that two of the members of such a board to be appointed by the State President will be appointed on the recommendation of the Cabinet and only one on the recommendation of the railway workers. I hope the Minister will revise that and that he will accept a clause similar to the one contained in Section 45 (4), I think, of the Industrial Conciliation Act, where the referee, the chairman, must be appointed by a majority of the workers and employers. I think both sides must feel that confidence reposes in the person appointed as chairman, the referee, and that he was appointed with the approval of and according to the wishes of the two parties concerned. I think that will be a great improvement to this Bill. However, I have confidence in the machinery which is created in Clauses 14 and 15 and the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) has confidence in it. Why does the Minister want to introduce a measure to do away with the right to strike if there is a good chance, an absolute chance, that we will never again have strikes as long as the staff associations on the S.A. Railways are responsible?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>The United Party was in power for many years and the United Party experienced difficulties with the staff associations but they never found it necessary to come forward with legislation to take away that right to strike from the employees. It had to be a brilliant Nationalist Party administration to find that necessary. Do not tell me that the hon. the Minister is so sure of it that he is going to come to a fall within the next year that he is already introducing precautionary measures to prevent the next United Party Government from having trouble on the Railways, because that is the argument of the hon. member for Pretoria (District). I think he too is sorry for having said such a stupid thing.</p>

<p>There is one other matter which I want to bring to the notice of the Minister and that is that we should not argue that because the Railways are a State undertaking the workers may not strike. I wish to suggest that because the Railways are a State undertaking we should be even more careful when it comes to curtailing the right of the railway workers to strike than we would be in the case of private undertakings. The Railways cannot be compared with the Civil Service. It can be compared with the Post Office Service to some extent. We know that a strong feeling exists in the Post office to-day to strike although it will be illegal. I hope that does not happen. The South Africa Act which controls the Railways lays down that the S.A. Railways should not be conducted as part of the Civil Service, but that it should be conducted as a business undertaking. But it is a business undertaking which is in this peculiar position that its head is also a member of the Cabinet, that its head also has the authority of the Government, the Cabinet, in his attitude towards his employees. The danger always exists that when the State runs a business it wants to refuse the employees in that business undertaking the rights which are given to employees in private undertakings. The inclination is there to regard any action which the employees may take in the business undertaking against their employers as action against the State and therefore as an act of disloyalty. That is why the first thing which any communist party does when it takes over the government of a State, is to abolish the right to strike completely, no matter how euphemistically it is worded. In practice that right disappears because any strike in a community in which all the means of production belong to the State is not only action against the employer but action against the State&#x2014;disloyalty. You find the same tendency in a socialistic state, but South Africa is not as yet a socialistic state. Nor do we want to create the impression that ours is a socialistic state. The Minister has extraordinary powers. He has greater powers over his employees than any other employer has over his employees. He also has the power which vests in him as a member of the Cabinet of the Government of the country. That is why he should be particularly jealous in guarding the rights of his employees and not curtail them. I wish to pay tribute to the Minister; it is not easy for me to do so. I wish to pay tribute to the Minister for the contents of Clauses 14 and 15. I think this is something which will bring about a revolution in the lives of the railway employees. We know that under Section 45 of the Industrial Conciliation Act we have had peace in South Africa since 1924 when General Smuts introduced that Act or shall I rather say since October 1924 when the Act was promulgated; incomparable peace. There are many other countries which do not have such legislation. Clauses 14 and 15 of this Bill are similar to Section 45 of the Industrial Conciliation Act, with this one difference that the Administration is obliged to accept the findings of the conciliation <span class="col_561-562" refersTo="page_0295"/>board. I do not think that is necessary. I think that the decision of such a board appointed by the State President will command such persuasive authority that it is unnecessary either to place that obligation on the Administration or to deprive the employees of their right to strike. It will work because you are dealing with responsible people. Please, Mr. Speaker, do not let us once again do something to-day which will give the impression that all we do in this Parliament of South Africa is to curtail the rights of citizens; all that we can do in this Parliament of South Africa is to act in a negative and reactionary manner. Let us show, Mr. Speaker, as the Minister has already shown in his handling of Native Affairs, that we can create constructive machinery in the interests of our citizens, machinery which makes such things as strikes unnecessary and which also makes it unnecessary for us to curtail the rights of our citizens.</p>

<p>I am glad that the Opposition is accepting practically all the clauses of this Bill. We now hear from the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell) that the strike clause is the one about which the Opposition is most concerned. The hon. member for Wynberg tries to make us believe that the present Minister of Railways understands the knack of persuading the servants of the Railways to do something which he wants them to do. That was how I understood him. I just want to say to the hon. member for Wynberg that that was not at all what happened in this case. The Railway workers of the S.A. Railways have confidence in the present Minister. They know that he does not only look after the interests of the Railway Administration but that he has shown that he is really interested in the personnel of the Railways. That is why they trust him. I can assure the hon. member for Wynberg this afternoon that the president of the artisans union, Mr. Liebenberg, is not somebody whom you can easily persuade to do something simply because you want him to do it. We know that from experience. We know that he is a competent person; we know that he fights for the interests of his staff. Mr. Liebenberg agreed that they would abide by the decision of the Minister. I should like the hon. member for Wynberg to listen to this. I want to quote from the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> of 25 January where Mr. Liebenberg himself said that they were satisfied. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The President of the Artisan Staff Association, Mr. J. H. Liebenberg, said yesterday:&#x201C; In any case, now that provision is being made for compulsory arbitration and negotiation in disputes between the staff and the Administration and there is no possibility of a deadlock the need for strike action falls away.</block>

<p>He says that himself and why does he say that? Because it was not a case of something having been forced on to them; the negotiations were conducted on a mutual basis between the Minister and the staff association. Do not think for a moment, Sir, that it was only the staff association which had to make concessions. What about the important concessions which the Minister had to make? He had to agree to it that an impartial commission would be appointed by the State President when a deadlock was reached in connection with a matter where the Minister and the staff association could not come to an agreement. The Minister of Railways must then accept the findings of that commission; he has to give in. In other words he has to concede 50 per cent and the staff must concede 50 per cent as well. If that commission finds in favour of the Railway staff, although it is against the wishes of the Minister and the Administration, the Minister must make the concession. I take it that the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) is an advocate! I take it that if the Minister has to yield anything against his will it is obvious that on occasions the staff will also have to yield and that they should not in that event resort to the strike weapon thus disrupting the entire railway system.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg said something very peculiar; something important which I thought he, as a responsible person, should not really have said so easily. He says the right to strike is a right which every trade union must and may possess, if I understood him correctly. It is practically a right of which he cannot be deprived. In this instance the hon. member for Wynberg feels that the Minister is unfair towards the railway workers in taking the right to strike away from them.</p>

<p>That was what Mr. Liebenberg said according to this report. I think the hon. member for Wynberg said another irresponsible thing. If the United Party should ever come into power I think the hon. member for Wynberg will be the next Minister of Railways. He now makes this final plea. He tells the Minister that he will be quite satisfied on condition that the Minister withdraws this Bill and re-introduces it after the congress of the artisans staff association has been held in two months&#x2019; time. I ask you, Mr. Speaker! The president of the artisans staff association may be a very responsible person; the management of that association consist of responsible men, but some of the members of that trade union are perhaps not all such responsible people, people who may perhaps in the intervening period between now and the congress exert great pressure on the management of the trade union&#x2014;particularly encouraged and prodded by the Opposition&#x2014;that they should insist on the right to strike. If there is <span class="col_563-564" refersTo="page_0296"/>anything which is irresponsible and which causes disruption in any country in the world it is a strike. It is a pity that differences cannot be settled peacefully between employers and employees particularly on the Railways. You need only think about the serious disruption which the strikes are causing in England. The Minister has pointed out that during a period when they are experiencing abnormal climatic conditions the railway officials are striking in England. Does the hon. member for Wynberg wish that to happen in South Africa, that the country should be disrupted? I honestly think that if the Opposition has the ability to grasp anything they ought to accept what the Minister has said namely that the staff association has accepted this Clause and that they will realize that the necessity to strike no longer exists. The Minister also pointed out that according to the staff regulations, regulation No. 13/4 a railway servant may not strike. In terms of this regulation a railway servant must be (a) obedient to all persons placed in authority over him and (b) must not disobey or disregard a lawful order given to him by competent authority or be negligent or indolent in the execution of his duty. The hon. member now says that these service regulations were drafted in 1925 at a time when the National Party was in power. But these staff regulations were revised in July, 1937. They were published in the <i>Government Gazette</i> No. 951 of 1937 and the new regulations came into force in August, 1937. This clause which deals with servants who may not refuse work has been taken over word for word from those regulations. If the hon. member for Wynberg feels that a servant should have the right to refuse work why did the United Party not rectify the position during their regime? But I leave it at that. I am convinced that the Opposition will also have to yield in this matter because they will become convinced that the railway officials are quite satisfied and that there is no difficulty as far as they are concerned.</p>

<p>I want to thank the Minister this afternoon especially for the changes in regard to the service regulations of the Railways. I specially want to express my gratitude in connection with Clause 1 (a) and (b); particularly (b). The change is to this effect that in cases where a railway employee has an adopted child, has legally adopted the child, the Department will in future regard that child as one of his own children and in future that child will share the rights of the other children equally with them. The position was very unfair in the past. I have had cases in my own constituency where railway employees had adopted such children, where they had regarded those children as their own children yet the position was that after the death of the railway employee those children did not enjoy the same privileges as the other minor children.</p>

<p>I also wish to point out that during the years that the hon. the Minister has been in charge of the Railways he has in every respect, fulfilled all his promises to the railway workers. When he took over he said very clearly that he regarded the railwaymen as his partners. That is the secret why he gets the very good service from them which he does get to-day. He also promised them that when, with their assistance and with good administration, the Railways showed a profit, they would share in those profits. We saw it not long ago that the Minister handed over R21,000,000 of the profits of the Railways to the railway employees.</p>

<p>They did not threaten to strike. The hon. member for Wynberg also said that the hon. the Minister has refused to listen to the artisans staff association. What the Minister in actual fact did say was that he refused to give an increase to one group of railway employees. If an increase had to be given he would give it to all the various groups on the Railways. And that is what the Minister has done. I think the railway employees are very grateful, because now for the first time their salaries have been properly adjusted according to the value of every grade on the Railways.</p>

<p>I can assure the hon. member for Wynberg that the railway employees are as loyal to the Minister as they are because they know that he looks after their interests, that even though they should have the right to strike they will never exercise that right but that on the contrary they will support their Minister 100 per cent.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I listened very attentively to the plea made by the hon. member for Bethlehem (Mr. Knobel). I do not want to deal with the case which he put to the House but I think he made one point which we cannot allow to pass unnoticed. I refer to the kind of rhetorical question which he put to the House implying that this side of the House wanted disruption in South Africa because we had aired a few thoughts favourable to the principle of strikes. As a good South African, I think the hon. member ought to know that this side of the House are as anxious as any hon. member on his side that the country should not be disrupted. I say this with the greatest respect, Mr. Speaker, but I do not think it behoves the hon. member to put that kind of question to this House.</p>

<p>I wish to say a few words in connection with the amendments to the so-called disciplinary code. I am pleased about one amendment in particular and that is that where people are suspended from service it will no longer be necessary for them to lose their salary and to sit at home, but that they will be able to continue to work, even though it is for a smaller salary. I am pleased about that because I know of railwaymen who have suffered greatly as a result of this. We are pleased that this matter has now been put right. A great number of amendments are of course being effected. Time will show us whether all these <span class="col_565-566" refersTo="page_0297"/>changes are improvements, but at a cursory glance it seems as if most of them ought to improve the position considerably.</p>

<p>As far as the question of strikes is concerned, I agree that it is a far-reaching change. I ask myself the question why should the hon. the Minister so suddenly come forward with this question of strikes, except for his remarks last year. You naturally look for reasons, Sir. The railwayman certainly did not ask for it. The hon. the Minister admitted this afternoon that they agreed that the right to strike should be taken away, but that they wanted to retain it. That was what the hon. the Minister told us. It cannot be, therefore, that they asked for its removal. There may be other reasons. Can we perhaps allege that the railwayman has used the strike weapon recklessly in the past? I do not think we can say that. Nor do I think we can say that they have used it injudiciously and that the interests of the country have suffered as a result. Why is it taken away then? We heard all these eulogies this afternoon about the railwayman, particularly as regards his sense of responsibility towards South Africa. I am pleased to be able to say that it is a sense of responsibility which practically every worker in the country possesses, particularly when we look at the history of our country as far as strikes are concerned. I think we ought to be proud of the sense of responsibility of our workers. I can think of no other reason than that the hon. the Minister simply wished to give shape to his own ideas in this connection. We remember what he said last year: Look, those people do not have the right to strike. The Minister has now converted that idea of his into legal language and he says: Thus far and no further. On what does he base his case this afternoon? In the first instance he said that the people did not have the right to strike, either morally or legally. Let us leave the moral aspect aside for a moment. Nor do I wish to argue the legal aspect. The fact remains, however, as the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) has said, that facts have already proved that they had that right. They have already used it in the past and they were not forbidden to do so. The hon. the Minister made a further point. He says we are dealing with essential services and as is the case in the industrial world, these people should not have the right either to call out a strike, because, says he, the industrial worker who performs an essential service and who may not strike, is in exactly the same position as the railwayman because the Railways also perform an essential service. I do not want to argue the question as to whether it is an essential service or not. But I want to take up the point raised by the hon. member for Yeoville. I want to say this: In my humble opinion there is nevertheless a real difference between the railwayman and the industrial worker. I say that because I myself was and still am a worker. I know how those people regard this matter. You have the worker on the one hand and his employer on the other hand. Suddenly a dispute arises which has to be settled and no settlement can be arrived at. The Industrial Conciliation Act creates the machinery. But while the employer and the employee negotiate, perhaps they find a solution and perhaps not, a third figure appears on the scene, a figure which acts as referee namely the state. I want to say this to you, Mr. Speaker, that the worker has confidence in this referee. They have confidence in him because throughout the years he has provided them with a measure of safety and security and because the referee, the state, is there to see to it that the employer and the employee become reconciled and if they do not, the employee will at least not be in the position where the employer will be able to exploit him. I want to say at once that that is certainly not the position of the railwayman. In theory his position may be the same but in reality it is different. You have the railwayman on the one hand and his employer, the Railway Administration, on the other hand. Where is the referee if something has to be settled? The referee is supposed to be the state. But surely we know that in practice, the employer, in the case of the railwayman, has tremendous influence with the state, the referee. That makes a big difference, Mr. Speaker. I do not have the hon. the Minister in mind as he is sitting over there, but I am outlining the position as I have come across it in practice. I have in mind the fact that the Minister of Railways is in the Cabinet and that all the decisions made by the Cabinet go to the State President. The decisions which are taken there are conveyed to the worker. I ask myself this question: If the Minister of Railways do not want anything done, will he really be persuaded by his Cabinet to do it? I cannot accept that, Mr. Speaker. That is why I say that in practice the position to me seems to be that as far as the Railways are concerned, the idea of a referee is absent, whereas that idea is very real in the case of the industrial worker. I think, therefore, in all humility that the hon. the Minister is wrong when he says that the right to strike should be taken away from the railwayman because it has been taken away from the industrial worker. I do not think that is right.</p>

<p>The conclusion to which I come is that the railway worker and the industrial worker should be placed in two separate categories and although the industrial workers who perform essential services have been deprived of the right to strike, I do not think it is wise at this particular stage to deprive the railwayman of that particular right. I think the conciliation machinery which is created in this Bill which is before us is very good and that it is definitely an improvement on what we had in the past. I consequently ask myself the question whether the hon. the Minister will not perhaps agree to it that, with the exception of the provision that the decision of the commission must be accepted, we first give the new machinery a chance. In other words, what I plead for is that the new conciliation machinery which is created, should indeed contain the element that it is compulsory <span class="col_567-568" refersTo="page_0298"/>to investigate those differences which crop up, but leave it just at that and let us see what the result will be. As I have already said, the railwayman has shown us in the past that he is exceedingly responsible and I believe that if a commission is appointed to investigate a matter and to make the facts known to the public, the railwayman will think twice before taking a step which he knows will incite public opinion as a whole against him. He will not do it. I want to put it this way: the word &#x201C;strike&#x201D; leaves a bad taste in the mouths of us who are sitting in this House, separated from reality outside. We always see the extreme side of a strike, its worst side. But as far as the worker is concerned, the worker who finds himself in a position where he does not know where to turn to, where his employer simply refuses to listen to him, where nothing is done for him, the fact that he can strike as an ultimate step, is to my mind exceptionally good. I am also pleased to be able to say that, thanks to our excellent conciliation legislation, the worker of South Africa will probably never find himself in that position, but do not let us destroy that important principle at this stage already. You have changed the machinery of reconciliation, changed it drastically. I think particularly good improvements have been effected. We are now asking you this: Put that machinery in action and see whether it works. I am sure it will work and only when it appears that it does not work, or if it appears in future that the railwayman acts irresponsibly, which I do not believe will happen, the Minister can once again come here and he may then&#x2014;and I say this in all humility&#x2014; have a better case for taking away the right to strike than he perhaps has to-day.</p>

<p>We have been listening to the comments of hon. members opposite on this legislation and they all amount to this that the workers are being deprived of the right to strike. The hon. the Minister has explained that other machinery is being created which is naturally much better than the strike machinery. Recently there have not been many strikes under this Government, but the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) told us about the difficult times which they experienced and that they never went so far as to the deprive the workers of the right to strike. I want to ask the hon. member of what value that right was which the workers had during the days under the United Party government? I do not ask that deliberately, but I am asking it with reference to the statement made by the hon. member for Yeoville. It is not a fact that the worker could strike but when he did, force, armed force, was simply used to drive him back to his work and in many instances he was locked up and in many instances thousands of them were dismissed. I want to know from the hon. member for Yeoville whether that was the privilege to which he referred as the privilege which the workers had under the policy of the United Party? You cannot deny that the right which he had to strike was of no value to him. He could strike, it is true, but then he had to take the consequences.</p>

<p>The workers have won very few struggles. The Minister is now creating other machinery. It is generally admitted in the country by the workers and the public that the Railways are to-day the greatest and the most efficient undertaking in the country. What is more, it is the best service which any person can enter. Then again those same trade unions can easily fall into very dangerous hands and the right to strike can be misused and the country can be paralysed, as happened in the past. In future that will be prevented. The hon. member for Maitland (Mr. Hickman) said he was pleased about one particular provision in the Bill only and that was the provision which provided that when employees were suspended the Administration could allow them to remain on in a lower grade. I think we are all very grateful for that concession because we found in the past that when an employee was suspended&#x2014;he probably has a family to support &#x2014;he had to look for temporary work outside, something which is, of course, very difficult to find, with the result that he did not work at all and that his family suffered as a result. That means that innocent people suffer. This is an improvement, therefore, that will mean a great deal to the workers. Another very important concession is the one in connection with leave, namely that when a worker is suspended he can take that period as his leave. That is a very great advantage. That means that while he is suspended he still receives his salary to live on. That is a privilege which they did not have in the past. It depends, of course, on how much leave he is entitled to. but he has that privilege in any case. Another very important concession is the Minister&#x2019;s decision that where an apprentice has completed his apprenticeship and where something was perhaps entered in his record during his apprenticeship due to one or other irregularity, that entry is to be deleted from his record on the completion of his apprenticeship so that when he applies, together with people from outside, he will have the same chance as they have because he has a clean record. That shows us once again, Sir, to what extent the Minister has the interests of the workers at heart. The Minister and the Administration ought to be congratulated on this step. We know that young men sometimes do something which they do not regard as serious at the time, but it nevertheless gets entered on their record.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Minister to explain one point in connection with Clause 26 which amends Section 58 of Act No. 39 of 1960. Where a person has purchased a house under the house ownership scheme and he still owes a certain amount on the house, that amount can be recovered from his pension. <span class="col_569-570" refersTo="page_0299"/>Suppose, however, that his pension is not sufficient to cover that debt what is the position then? Will that person be given the opportunity to raise a loan outside to meet the shortfall? The position is not clear to me from this clause.</p>

<p>A year or two ago, three years ago, the hon. the Minister staked his reputation that he would make a success of the Railways. It is clear to-day that he has made a success of it and that he is continually making further improvements. I want to assure the Minister that the railwayman is very grateful to the Minister and the Administration for these improvements and that they are greatly appreciated. I am also confident that there will be far fewer resignations from the railway service than in the past. People very often did not realize in the past for what an important and good undertaking they were working and what privileges they were enjoying. But hardly had they resigned when many of them came back and asked to be assisted to re-enter the railway service. Only then do they realize what mistake they had made when they left the good employment which they had had. I am convinced that with all these improvements there will be far fewer resignations from the railway service.</p>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Langlaagte (Mr. P. J. Coetzee) has completely missed the cardinal point in this debate, because he asserted immediately that what the hon. the Minister was introducing in his Bill was new and better machinery to assist the railway servant, machinery which was better and more advanced than the strike machinery, a right which the railwayman presently enjoys. But actually the Minister did not say that. What the Minister did say was that he did not believe that legally or morally the railway servants enjoy this right to strike. Mr. Speaker, it is acknowledged on both sides of the House that this in many respects is an excellent Bill, and I think I will agree with previous speakers that it is to the credit of the hon. the Minister and his Department that the various changes are made which will remove quite a number of anomalies and difficulties which have existed and in respect of which representations have been made to the Minister by the various staff associations. I am sure that all of us appreciate the interest which is shown in the lot of this very vast service of the state in which such a considerable number of our citizens are employed. There are quite a number of us here in this House who find the problems of these employees constantly brought to one&#x2019;s notice, and we are very sensitive in regard to the improvements which are brought about from time to time, particularly in response to representations made by these associations who, as the Minister rightly said, have shown not only a sense of responsibility, but have also shown a considerable interest in management. I think that is something which one can well underline. It is to the credit of this vast undertaking that the railway employee has shown a great interest in management and has himself contributed towards the improvement and efficiency of the service by the suggestions which he himself has brought forward to the Minister and his Department.</p>

<p>For that reason the hon. member for Wynberg very rightly said that it is very much appreciated that this Bill brings about such important improvements and that it removes a number of anomalies in the service conditions of the Railway employees. I think it is common cause that the railway employee deserves the approval and the praise of the people of South Africa. I think our country must be unique in the vastness of the service and the contributions which the workers have made to the advance of this service, both economically and as a service to the community. They have always distinguished themselves by the very fact that this particular weapon, the strike weapon, which has always been part and parcel of its conditions of employment, has been used possibly less than in most parts of the world, particularly in those parts of the world where the trade union movement has developed so fast and extensively. The reference that was made to Great Britain could be repeated in respect of other big countries where the transport services play such an important part, and, by comparison again, South Africa has an enviable record in this respect.</p>

<p>It is for those reasons that this side of the House feels that with all these improvements it is not necessary to remove what is part and parcel of the whole conception of trade unionism. Perhaps no one knows that better than the hon. Minister himself. A strike is not the easiest thing to be undertaken by a trade union, particularly in a service in which the whole of the public is so intimately concerned, and the very value of public opinion is its greatest deterrent. But here the hon. the Minister has now provided machinery which, as has been pointed out, does more than anything else hitherto to act as perhaps the greatest deterrent to any thought of entering upon a strike. After this commission has reported, after this conciliatory investigation&#x2014;and that will have taken place after at least 50 per cent of the association has petitioned for a commission of inquiry&#x2014;it then will be necessary for an additional ballot to take place whereby 75 per cent will have to vote in favour of this very serious step. I say that with all these safeguards, with this responsible form of legislation to protect the public, but at the same time giving the employee every freedom in putting forward his point of view and to advance as far as possible in his interest, it is not necessary for the hon. the Minister to entrench by legislation what is his opinion at the moment with regard to the right of the railway worker to strike if he wishes to do so in any trade dispute that may arise. Our view is that this very acceptable Bill could well have omitted this particular denial of the right to strike, mainly because it is one of the fundamentals of the trade union principle and the <span class="col_571-572" refersTo="page_0300"/>strength of the trade union movement both here and in other parts of the world. I think one should always jealously guard the rights particularly of those over whom you exercise so much control, because in the case of the railway worker his conditions of employment are laid down by Parliament, by the highest authority in the land; we as the rulers of a country in Parliament should therefore perhaps even more extensively than the average employer jealously guard and protect the privileges of the workers. In this case the railway workers. Therefore we believe that it was not necessary to remove this particular right. The hon. the Minister himself has admitted that representations were made to him, for instance last year, for an improvement in salary scales and the conditions of work, and he resisted it at the time, possibly, from his point of view, for very good reasons. One knows the Minister takes a great deal of interest in what is placed before him. One has never known the Minister to particularly avoid being fair to his employees, but nevertheless for reasons best known to himself he resisted those particular representations. But in the course of time with the employees pursuing their rights in terms of their conditions of employment, the Minister eventually agreed to that increase. We remember the time when we pressed on this side of the House that the hon. the Minister should as soon as possible consolidate the cost-of-living allowances with the basic salaries. It also took a few years before that was eventually agreed to. But the point is that by negotiation these things are brought about. But despite the earnestness of the appeal of the railway workers, we did not have an ultimatum firmly presented by him that a strike would take place at a particular date. There was this remedy in the hands of the railway worker to resort to if his demands were not met. But he did not at that time for instance retard the progress of the work, he did not diminish his sense of responsibility; the whole matter was handled on a very high standard of responsibility on the part of the railway worker and on the part of the Department. If there is confidence on both sides, a very much higher standard of responsibility is maintained than when people are in a position of complete frustration and when they feel that there is no remedy and that the whip-hand lies entirely with the employer, particularly when the employer is the state. I don&#x2019;t know that the hon. the Minister is achieving such a great deal by entrenching in the legislation what is a point of view that he states he has himself for some time held.</p>

<p>I would like to say that in a Bill of this nature where nothing but goodwill could result from the steps that are being taken, where quite clearly the associations have found that the Administration is endeavouring to improve their lot. particularly where an association feels that there is appreciation of the great services that it is rendering to the community, we should not have such a provision which amounts to a diminution of their rights. I do not think there need be any apprehension on the part of members of the Government who speak in support of this Bill, any apprehension of the dire results and consequences of a strike, simply because in this particular industry of all industries the example that has been set over the many years should give the whole House complete confidence in the responsible attitude of the worker.</p>

<p>We would not like to hold up a measure of this nature, but we do think that in principle it is our duty to jealously guard the rights of those employed by the State. We feel that that is due to them and that it is the Opposition's duty to plead this particular matter on behalf of the railway workers, and I personally have every confidence that the hon. the Minister will take into consideration the plea that has been made on this side of the House; I hope that my confidence is justified and that by the removal of this particular clause the faith and confidence of the Minister and his Department in the railway workers will once again be firmly asserted.</p>

<speech by="#kotze">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. KOTZE</person>:</from>

<p>The Opposition goes on telling us that they accept this Bill broadly but they nevertheless go on talking. The prompter of the Opposition, the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell) said in such a roundabout way that the Opposition supported the principles of this Bill, with a qualification in respect of the strike provisions, that it subsequently cost the hon. member for Yeoville a speech in order to explain what the hon. member for Wynberg really intended. I listened very attentively to the whole argument of the hon. member for Wynberg and the only real objection which the hon. member has against the whole Bill, or rather the only doubt which he has, is the suspicion which he has at the back of his mind that the Minister had exerted pressure on the staff associations in order to obtain their approval of these changes; that the hon. the Minister had twisted the arm of the staff associations in order to get them to agree to this Bill. That is his only objection. He would have been quite satisfied with this measure had it not been for this provision and they raise that objection in spite of the fact that the Minister said that the leaders of the staff associations, on behalf of the workers, had accepted this Bill. But the hon. member for Wynberg is more inclined to listen to a few ordinary members of the Staff Association who approached him and told him another story. He is more inclined to believe them than the responsible officials of the associations who negotiated with the Minister. He bases his whole suspicion on the discussions which he had around the corner with a few members of the local staff associations and on a few newspaper reports which he had read.</p>

<p>The Opposition is really busy fighting for the alleged rights of the railwaymen, rights which they legally never had. Our contention is that the railwaymen never had the right to strike. The Minister explained that. There were strikes in the past, but they were allowed because the machinery whereby action could <span class="col_573-574" refersTo="page_0301"/>be taken against illegal strikes was so ineffective that it would have taken years to bring the offenders to book. They had to be charged individually and that was the only reason why they could strike in the past; but that was not a right which they had in the past. Section 28 of the Service Act, Act 22 of 1960, which lays down the procedure whereby disputes between the Administration and its employees must be settled makes no provision for strikes. Nowhere in the Service Act is there any reference to the right of a railwayman to strike. How can hon. members say that this is a right which they had in the past and that we now want to disarm them? They have never had that weapon.</p>

<p>Furthermore, when you read Section 46 of the Industrial Conciliation Act, which deals with disputes which are subject to compulsory arbitration, you cannot construe the wording to mean that the Railways are excluded. It says that any employer, except a local authority which provides light and power and passenger transport within a local authority area &#x2026; If hon. members want to put a strict legal interpretation on that, they can say that the Railways are excluded, because it says within the area of a local authority. They can argue that way if they want to, but in that case I can equally well contend that the Railways also convey passengers within a local area. They do not only convey them there but they probably convey more of them than any other public transport system. I contend therefore that under the Service Act and the Industrial Conciliation Act the railwayman has never had the right to strike.</p>

<p>Where this prohibition of strikes is introduced under Clause 16, this Bill also contains far-reaching provisions in respect of the settlement of disputes between the Administration and its employees. In terms of Clauses 14 and 15 it is compulsory in certain circumstances that a commission be appointed. That was not compulsory in the past. It is also compulsory that the recommendations of that commission be carried out. Here the railwayman is given an opportunity which he never had in the past. I thought the Opposition would welcome this but now they moan about the alleged privilege which the railwaymen supposedly had to strike. Mr. Speaker, strikes in a national transport system are catastrophic. We have examples of that in other countries, and the fact that other railway systems in the world are stricken by strikes whereas ours is not, makes all the difference, because the S.A. Railway system is one of the few systems in the world which shows a profit to-day. Most of the systems in the world are conducted at a tremendous loss and the reason for that is mainly the strikes with which they are stricken.</p>

<p>We are apparently all heartily agreed as far as the changes in the disciplinary code are concerned but I cannot resume my seat without drawing attention to a few particular concessions which are being made to the railwayman. Not only does this new disciplinary code state the position in regard to disciplinary inquiries much more clearly but the tendency is also to limit the duration of those disciplinary inquiries and to make them go off as quickly and as smoothly as possible so that it will not be necessary for servants to wait for months on end for the results of such disciplinary investigations. Nor can I omit to join hon. members in expressing my gratitude for this very great concession which is made namely that where a servant is suspended on account of a disciplinary offence, and who often had to sit at home for months in the past without a penny compensation, now has the choice to work in a lower grade so that he can maintain his family. The loss of salary on suspension was a cruel punishment in the past. Some families often suffered very severely in the past as a result of that, and provision is now being made for a person to maintain his family while he is suspended and is really not entitled to any remuneration. It is true that the old Act provided that such a person could go and work elsewhere while he was suspended, but who will employ anybody who, when you ask him where he has worked, tells you he works on the Railways but he has been suspended because they say he has stolen? They could not find employment. Provision is, however, now made for them to work.</p>

<p>Clause 8 (c) provides for a further concession to them namely that although a person is found guilty by such a disciplinary inquiry his compensation is refunded to him for the period he was suspended. In the past he could only get part of it back. The Administration is now empowered to refund him all his money for that period. A further concession is also granted to him. If he had worked in a low-paid grade when he was suspended and if he had received a lower wage during his suspension, the Administration decides, after the conclusion of the disciplinary inquiry, whether it had won its case or not, that it will not pay him the difference in salary for that period, that person will in future have the right to appeal against that decision and to try to get that remuneration. This concession means a tremendous lot to the railwayman and it will save a great deal of suffering in future.</p>

<p>In conclusion I wish to draw attention to a number of other big improvements in the legislation, such as the one in Clause 10, which lays down that in future the punishment imposed for disciplinary offences committed by apprentices in the past, should no longer remain on their records as in the past. It means a great deal to an artisan if he can start his service with a clean record. In the past when these people committed offences, those offences were noted on their records and they had to compete for promotion with men whom the Railways had taken on from outside, men with clean records because the offences which they had committed when they served their apprenticeship are not known. In future they will all be placed on an equal footing.</p>

<p>In Clause 21 provision is made for much better compensation to those many railway servants Who have to retire before they reach the retiring age on account of ill health or <span class="col_575-576" refersTo="page_0302"/>disability. Very often such a person has rendered excellent service, but he may suffer a thrombosis attack and be unable to carry on with his work and he has to be paid off as disabled. Often his period of service was so short and his compensation consequently so small that he found it comparatively difficult to live. A great improvement is being brought about here. Unlike the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) (Mr. van Rensburg) I think that it is a good thing that people should be nominated by the staff associations to serve on boards instead of being elected by the members. Ordinary railway workers are very indifferent as far as their trade unions are concerned, their attitude is one of <i>laissez faire,</i> and the time is long overdue that something be done to stimulate their interest in their trade unions. They are not sufficiently interested. They are only interested when they do not approve of the agreements which the boards of their trade unions have come to with the authorities. Then they say the board is bad and that it should be kicked out. But when the ordinary work of the trade union has to be done and they have to elect members to the board, they are not interested at all. That is why I am pleased that the associations are given more responsibility and that the representatives will be nominated.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>On the whole this Bill has received very little opposition from this side of the House, except for that sting in its tail, the strike prohibition clause. The hon. member for Parow (Mr. S. F. Kotz&#x00E9;) said he listened to the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell) and the impression he got was that the Minister of Railways had twisted the arm of the staff associations in order to get them to agree to the elimination of the right to strike. The Minister admitted that he offered a <i>quid pro quo,</i> and I can assure him that he did not offer it very lightly. Now, talking about strikes, the Minister told us that the definition of &#x201C;strike&#x201D; in the new Bill was taken from the Industrial Conciliation Act. That is correct, but it is a very wide definition, and those of us who have read it realize its effect. But the word &#x201C;strike&#x201D; goes very much deeper than that. To strike is not only the right of a trade union, but the right of everybody from the cradle to the grave. It is a natural protest which is inborn in all of us. You see it in children and grown-ups, and you actually see it in Ministers of this House when they attend UN and when at loggerheads, and in order to lodge their protest at what is going on they boycott UN and stay away. What would have happened if the regulations of UN said that you cannot stay away? The whole principle of a strike is inborn; just as it is the right of the working man to sell his labour in the best market.</p>

<p>The Minister has told us that the Railways are an essential service and he has compared it with municipal departments and local authorities. I think we on this side agree that they are an essential service, but not completely. One would not say that the production section of the Railways is an essential service, otherwise you would have to include all those manufacturers who are producing for the Railways at present. One can define the running side and maintenance as an essential service, but that is about all. [Interjection.] It is suggested here that the Railway Board is an essential service, but I do not agree with that. I would not object if they went on strike. The peculiar thing is that when the Minister introduced the Bill he went to great lengths to tell us that the executives of these associations were responsible people, and he referred to their great loyalty. I agree with him. They are responsible people who do not take strike action lightly. The constitution of the Artisan Staff Association provides that before they take strike action they have to get the support of 75 per cent of their members. What is the position if this right is taken away from them? The definition in the Bill, and in the Industrial Conciliation Act, is so wide that it will act as a form of intimidation against the workers. Strikes or talk of striking for better conditions start at a very low level. They start from the worker to the shop steward and then it goes to the executive and then you get the basis of collective bargaining with the employer. But if this clause remains in the Bill, it will have the effect that any worker in the Railways who suggests quite inadvertently&#x2014;which might quite easily happen&#x2014;that they should go on strike is committing an offence and can be dealt with severely. You get a form of intimidation, and what is going to happen? You will kill the initiative of the whole of these staff associations and the whole basis of collective bargaining between the employer and the employee. Although the employer in this case is a State concern, we must look upon it as just an ordinary commercial concern. I want to ask the Minister to give very serious consideration to dropping this particular clause which prohibits strikes. It will do considerable harm. I am personally surprised at this suggestion in the Bill coming from the Minister. He has been a leader of labour in his time and he has been Minister of Labour, and a good one. I cannot understand his attitude. Is it because last year when the Railway Staff wanted better conditions they stated that if they did not succeed they might take a strike ballot? Is that the reason why he told the House that they have no right to strike? But they have the right to strike. You cannot stop any person from refusing to work. If this Bill goes through, the machinery for collective bargaining will lose its effect. The trade union movement in the Railways will lose its effect and the Minister will be dealing with people who, through intimidation as the result of this Bill, will be less determined to put their viewpoint. Notwithstanding the fact that they had a rise in wages recently, conditions are changing from day to day, and it may be that in the near future these same workers will require their conditions to be improved. They approach the Minister for improvements in their conditions, and he refuses. What is the position then? He tells us that he has offered them a <i>quid pro quo,</i> but that <i>quid pro quo</i> means <span class="col_577-578" refersTo="page_0303"/>nothing. The position is this, that if a group of men through their association protest for improved conditions, he has the right to ignore them. He may say there are not enough people asking for it and it will not upset the working of the Railways. These same people will have to go back and organize a petition to the State President for arbitration. But these workers, in order to organize that petition, are actually breaking the law because they are doing what they are not supposed to do; they are not allowed to organize for better conditions under this Bill. That is intimidation. I would ask him to consider dropping this clause where he prohibits strikes.</p>

<p>Yes. Then Clause 3 deals with housing loans. In the White Paper the Minister gave us the background why he changed the whole set-up. I would like to ask him whether he can give the assurance to the House now that he will have the power to fix the rate, that the rate he will fix will not be to write off the losses incurred in the past. It says in the White Paper that over the years, through not being able to fix the rate to the nearest portion per cent, losses have occurred. I would like him to give the assurance that in fixing the rate for the new housing loans he will not include these losses in calculating what is to be paid by the new house-owners on their loans.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before I deal with the clause prohibiting strikes, there are one or two points I would like to put to the Minister in relation to the other clauses of the Bill, and the first is in connection with the nomination of members of the Superannuation Fund Board. The Minister has provided in this Bill for the nomination to the Board of an equal number of representatives of the staff associations and from the Administration. The suggestion I wish to put to the Minister is that he should make provision in this Bill for the nomination by the staff associations for an annuitant member to serve on the Board. [Interjection.] I am asking for that because of the many letters I receive from pensioners asking for financial relief to be extended to them. The point I make here is that the representatives of the staff associations represent the staff in the service and not the pensioner members. From the figures I have been able to obtain, it would appear that when the last actuarial report was submitted in 1959, the pensioner members totalled some 12, 289 and the total number of members of the Fund, the contributors, as at 31 March 1959 was 102.304. The question I put to the Minister is this: Who puts forward claims for improvements on behalf of the pensioner members of the Superannuation Fund at the board meetings? It is quite clear that these pensioner members are the forgotten section of ex-servants of the Railways. The suggestion I put to the Minister, and which is worthy of consideration to improve this Bill, is to provide in the Bill a provision for pensioner members to serve on the Superannuation Fund Board. I can see no difficulty at all because there are amongst the pensioners many who have served on that board over the years and are familiar with the procedure. I see no reason why they should not be given representation on the board so that their interests will be kept in mind whenever discussions take place in relation to any changes which might be proposed in future by the Board or the Administration.</p>

<p>The next suggestion is in connection with the Appeal Board machinery which has been set up and which is now put before us in an improved form. I wish to put this point to the Minister, and it is one which I will not be permitted to discuss in the Committee Stage because it will not be part and parcel of any one clause. It is the present method of dealing with cases that fall under the provisions of this Bill, but are not provided for in one clause of the Bill. I am referring to the machinery set up by way of regulation to control the manner in which charges will be set out against those servants who have fallen foul of the regulations.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>When the House adjourned, I was busy dealing with two aspects of this Bill and had asked the hon. the Minister to consider allowing an annuitant&#x2014;an ex servant &#x2014;to be nominated for appointment to the Joint Superannuation Fund Board.</p>

<p>I also touched upon Clauses 8-12 of the Bill dealing with the disciplinary code. I am now going to ask the Minister whether he is prepared to accept an amendment or to include in the regulations a provision which will prevent the type of thing which I am now going to talk about, happening in future. I can best illustrate this by dealing with a specific case, i.e. of a servant who had been charged on two counts. After a board of inquiry had considered his case, its findings were that the charges could not be established. Now follows the important point, namely: Those findings were submitted to the staff officer who accepted one of the findings but not the other. Accordingly, he found the servant concerned guilty on the one charge despite the fact that the board of inquiry found that the charge could not be established. The servant concerned lost his appeal, the unanimous finding of the appeal board being that the conviction should stand. The Minister is aware of the fact that in terms of these and the existing provisions, there is no further right of appeal either to the General Manager, the Minister or the Railway Board.</p>

<p>Now I should like to ask the Minister to consider allowing, where a board of inquiry has found that charges could not be established. a further appeal from the servant concerned to go finally through to the Railway <span class="col_579-580" refersTo="page_0304"/>Board. At present the position is that if the finding of the appeal board was not unanimous, the servant concerned may go right through to the Railway Board before a finality is reached. I do feel that where an inquiry has taken place and where the investigating officer has found, after considering all the evidence, that a charge cannot be sustained, then that servant should have the right to submit his case right up to the Railway Board. I put this to the Minister and should like him to comment upon it when he replies to the debate. Why I think it is important that such a servant should be allowed to go right up to the Railway Board, is because of what I found in the General Manager&#x2019;s Report for the year ending December 1962. I find that of 737 appeals considered by the Board 102 were upheld, and it does indicate that despite the existing machinery, there can still be a miscarriage of justice. I therefore should like the Minister to consider this point very carefully.</p>

<p>I now come to what I regard as the most difficult part of the Bill, namely that part providing for compulsory arbitration, i.e. in Clause 15 and the prohibition of strikes in Clause 16. When the Minister outlined his case for the acceptance of these two clauses, he was at pains to give all the reasons as to why, in his opinion, the strike weapon should be outlawed and replaced by compulsory arbitration. He did not, however, outline why it was that the present machinery had failed in its objective to prevent serious disputes in the service. If we take the existing Act and we look at the provisions which the hon. the Minister now seeks to amend, we find the following wording in Section 28&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whenever a dispute arises between the Administration and &#x2026;</block>

<p>These are the words I should like to underline &#x2026;</p>

<block name="quote">a considerable number of its servants as to any conditions of employment and the dispute cannot be amicably settled through the conciliation board or otherwise and is causing</block>

<p>and now I should like to emphasize these words &#x2026;</p>

<block name="quote">or likely to cause serious disorganization in the working of the Railways, ports and harbours, the Administration shall report the matter to the Governor-General. On the receipt of the report referred to the Governor-General shall unless the dispute be otherwise previously settled, appoint a commission of impartial persons &#x2026;</block>

<p>The point I should like to make is that the trouble which there was with the Artisan Staff Association last year, arose out of the fact that the Minister did not give effect to these particular provisions of the Act. I say this because this Bill which is before the House now, is to prevent serious disorganization in the working of the railways, ports and harbours and the Minister must have realized that his refusal to appoint a commission or to report the matter to the State President would bring about a state of further uncertainty and a threat of strike by the workers because, in their opinion, they had a very strong case.</p>

<p>The point I should like to make is that the present Act failed because the Minister failed. The Minister refused to appoint a commission of investigation or inquiry. That is the position. When the last commission of inquiry was appointed&#x2014;the Grindley-Ferris commission&#x2014;we had the same problem, only it had gone a step further. The men had actually organized a go-slow strike and when this created a serious disorganization of the railways, ports and harbours, the then Minister appointed the commission referred to. This commission found favourably for the men. I say that the present hon. Minister, in not agreeing to the appointment of such a commission, could have precipitated serious difficulties last year.</p>

<p>But what happened last year? Within a very short while and before any action was taken by the men, the Minister agreed to go into the matter again with the result that the entire staff did receive a considerable improvement in their wage conditions. What happened between the time that the Artisan Staff Association had pleaded for a commission of inquiry and the time when the Minister agreed to the wage improvements? Nothing had happened in the meantime to the facts of the case of the Artisan Staff Association! And thus I say that the Minister, through his failure to appoint a commission of enquiry, precipitated the difficulties which subsequently resulted.</p>

<p>The next avenue the staff association had open to it, was the presentation of a petition signed by 20 per cent of its members. This petition was presented but the State President, acting on the advice of the Cabinet, refused to appoint a commission. We thus have these two illustrations of how the Minister, or the Cabinet, was able to block an investigation into the conditions which the staff association considered were not in their favour. Therefore I say that had the Minister met the provisions of the present Act, there would have been no need for the strike weapon to be removed at all.</p>

<p>I want to stand still here for a moment and remind the House that it has only been through the threat of using and the use of the strike weapon that all railwaymen had been able to obtain benefits in the past. The strike weapon which the Minister now seeks to abolish, has been used with great care and on very few occasions. When the Minister made out his case on the basis that the railways is an essential service, he equated it with the transportation service here in Cape Town. I do not think such a comparison can be made and for the following reason. Let us consider what is spent by the Railways in the year ending December, 1962. We find that stores to the value of R30,000,000 odd were imported and contracts were entered into and <span class="col_581-582" refersTo="page_0305"/>orders placed in South Africa for the local supply or importation of stores and equipment to the approximate value of R64, 176, 871. (See p. 102 of Report). Now, what are these supplies which were not manufactured in the railway workshops but brought in? These, namely, electric locomotives, wagons, steel (S.A.R./Iscor agreement), permanent-way material, wheels, axles and tyres, plant and machinery, motor vehicles, pneumatic tools, rations, cranes and spares, oil, grease and petrol, paint, varnish, etc., clothing and electric cable and wire.</p>

<p>If the Minister&#x2019;s case is logical, then all the industries manufacturing these goods should be declared essential services because if these goods were not supplied to the Railways, serious disorganization could result. Where is this thing going to end? If the Railways are going to be considered as being an essential service and all these goods which are being supplied to the Railways is, if the Minister is logical, declared to be essential services, then we will only have compulsory arbitration in the Republic and there will be no strike weapon left for any of the trade unions. That is why we attach so much importance to what the Minister is doing here.</p>

<p>There is, however, another important issue. The Minister in introducing this Bill this afternoon, paid a well deserved tribute to the staff negotiators&#x2014;in other words, the trade union leaders. In doing so, he intimated that the Administration had considerable confidence in these leaders. But this Bill is a Bill of no confidence in those leaders. This Bill is not necessary, particularly the compulsory arbitration clause and the strike clause, because, if what the Minister claims is correct, namely that he has every confidence in these leaders and that all these leaders had agreed to the provisions of this Bill, surely the best way in which to have handled this matter would have been to leave it to the trade unions concerned to apply to the industrial registrar for an amendment to their constitution outlawing the strike as a weapon.</p>

<p>The importance of what is being done now is this, namely that Parliament is being asked to do what the trade unions, according to the Minister, have agreed to do. Why should Parliament now come and interfere in this issue? Why should the Artisan Staff Association not do what the Minister says it has agreed to do, namely to abide by this Bill, and to leave it to them to amend their own constitution, leaving Parliament out of the picture altogether? Is it right that Parliament should now do something which will present the staff associations with a <i>fait accompli</i> when meeting for its next conference? Surely our function as Parliament is not to impose these conditions on the association but rather to get the consent of the association and leave it to them to take the necessary steps to bring about what the Minister wants. It is quite clear to me that Clause 15 (6) imposes compulsory arbitration on the staff association. Similarly, it is quite illogical to suggest that we can retain the strike action and at the same time retain Clause 15 (6). In other words, if we have compulsory arbitration, then the strike clause has to be removed from the constitutions of the railway staff associations.</p>

<p>It is quite clear to me therefore that the Minister in his negotiations with the staff association has made it his main point that in his opinion the railway service is an essential service and as such be treated in exactly the same way as those services included in the Industrial Conciliation Act as essential services&#x2014;in other words, they can only control their future conditions of service by way of compulsory arbitration. The new provisions provide that if there is compulsory arbitration, the finding of a commission of inquiry, will be binding upon both sides. That is the basis of compulsory arbitration. The Minister, knows and I know that there has only been one staff association over the years that has really fought against refusals by the Administration to improve conditions of pay and other things. If we are now going to have compulsory arbitration, and one of the staff associations which seeks improvements in the wages of its members is successful, is the Minister quite satisfied that, as a result of compulsory arbitration, he has to give effect as soon as possible to the recommendations of such a commission? The Minister knows that if one staff association succeeds in getting improvements in wages, the others will follow suit and ask for improvements as well? The position appears to me to be more difficult under these provisions than under the existing provisions. Under the present provisions the Minister is in a position to say to staff associations collectively &#x201C;Look, I have R20,000,000 to allocate. Put proposals before me which will meet the needs of all sections of the staff. But under the provisions of this Bill that will no longer be the position. He will not be able to instruct the arbitration board that he can only spend so much and that, therefore, he must not be involved in any additional expenditure. That will be the position. And so I say that although the machinery which is being created by this Bill appears on the surface to be in order, there are going to be snags in its application. In regard to the existing machinery, I have already indicated that it has not been given a fair trial because this Minister as well as previous Ministers were not prepared to agree to a committee of investigation. Instead of an investigation, the Minister is now coming forward with a proposal for compulsory arbitration under certain conditions. Let us now have a look at these conditions. They do not vary much from the existing conditions. If the Minister is of the opinion that there is likely to be a considerable number of staff involved in a dispute and is likely to lead to disorganization, he can report the matter to the State President, who shall then appoint a commission of inquiry. If the Minister is, on the other hand, not satisfied, he will not make such a report and the staff concerned has then to get 50 per cent of their number to agree to present a petition to the State President. If they can <span class="col_583-584" refersTo="page_0306"/>do that, the State President will be compelled to appoint an arbitration board.</p>

<p>I do not know whether many members in this House have had any experience of what is involved in getting signatures for petitions. I can say that it is a very difficult and lengthy process. I think the Minister is aware of that. That is why he has increased the percentage from 20 to 50 per cent. It is not an easy thing. Despite that, however, the staff associations themselves have, in their constitutions a provision that no strike action can take place unless 75 per cent of their membership agree to it. This, I say, is the real test as to whether there is irresponsible use of the strike weapon or not. I can see no problem here. If the Minister were to incorporate in the existing provisions a clause which would enable or compel a commission of inquiry to be appointed if 50 per cent of the members of a staff association sign the petition, he would not have had the trouble last year, nor the trouble of 1945, because I am convinced that any commission of inquiry consisting of impartial persons will prevent any trade union from ever being able to get 75 per cent of its members to support a strike action if the facts disclosed by such a commission of inquiry show that that trade union has no case. That, Mr. Speaker, is surely what we want here. We want to know what the facts are and we want to be in a position to judge. We want to know whether the men have a case or not. Therefore, my plea to the Minister is not to be too hasty with this legislation. Let the staff associations, if they, as the Minister intimated, accepted the principle of compulsory arbitration, put their own house in order. The Minister will then have no need to come to Parliament.</p>

<p>So far as I, therefore, am concerned, I say that this Bill is not a Bill which indicates to us that the Minister has complete trust in the trade union leaders of the railway servants. I say this because I know these men; I know them very well. I have not had any consultation with them about this Bill, but I accept what the Minister told us to-day to be the position, namely that they have accepted this Bill&#x2014;whether or not with misgivings I do not know. However, he gave me the impression when he spoke this afternoon, that some of the trade unions were quite happy while others were not so happy and that he drove a hard bargain. I do know this, however, that if the staff associations gave the Minister an undertaking that they would accept the provisions of this Bill, I am quite sure that they will take the first possible opportunity to bring their constitutions into line with those provisions without Parliament having to impose the conditions upon them. They would have done it of their own free will. And, surely, that is what we want in this country. We want trade unions to give their rights away themselves rather than that Parliament should take them from them. Surely that is a principle which we should accept; and surely that is a principle which an ex-Minister of Labour would appreciate&#x2014;if he is able to persuade trade unions to give up their rights, it is far better than to come to Parliament and ask Parliament to remove such rights. Therefore I think we have to be most careful here. I have already indicated that it is my opinion that once this Bill goes through and the Minister has decreed that the Railways constitute an essential service, there is going to be requests from all types of industries outside for the same declaration in respect of trade unions controlling collective bargaining in those industries because it is so much easier to have compulsory arbitration machinery than negotiating machinery.</p>

<p>There is another point which I should like to put to the Minister and to the House, and that is that in all outside industrial council agreements, the principle of voluntary arbitration or negotiation in wage rate determinations, is not as difficult as it is in the Railway service. That is so because most agreements arrived at in outside industries are for a fixed period&#x2014; one, two or three years&#x2014;at the end of which there will be a review and the whole process of negotiations will start afresh. The Minister knows that in the Railways, on the other hand, improvements in wages are not for a specified period but there has to be further negotiations when the staff associations are convinced that there should an adjustment in their salaries. On these grounds, the machinery which we lay down for the Railways should be superior to that applying outside. As I see the position here, the Minister holds the trump card&#x2014;he is taking away their strike weapon and puts in its place compulsory arbitration knowing of the difficulties facing trade unions in getting the necessary signatures to a petition in order to get a commission appointed.</p>

<p>I can only hope that the Minister will listen to what we have told him and that he will accept the proposition which we have put to him, namely that if he were to remove subsection (6) of Clause 15 and delete Clause 16, the Bill will improve the existing machinery to such an extent as to render the need for the use of the strike weapon most unlikely. We should also like the Minister in his reply to tell us more fully exactly what did happen when the proposals we are dealing with now were put to the staff associations and whether counter proposals from them went as far as this Bill does in removing the strike weapon and replacing it by compulsory arbitration.</p>

<p>I think that hon. members arrived at the conclusion, as I did, that the hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton) had very little enthusiasm for the plea which he made this evening for the retention of the right to strike. He reminded me of the man who had an old horse of which he was very fond. The old horse fell ill and the man was very worried. He tried to make the old horse well but he noticed that the horse was very close to death. He then simply poured the medicine over the horse; he did not give it to him in the usual way. That is the impression which the hon. member gave me. It is my fervent wish that if we do perhaps have <span class="col_585-586" refersTo="page_0307"/>trade union leaders in South Africa who still toyed with the idea of retaining the right to strike, they could have been here this afternoon and to-night. They would then have agreed with me that if this is the best argument that can be advanced for the retention of the right to strike, then the sooner that right is removed the better.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the right to strike is a relic of the days when there were Governments which were disinterested in disputes between employers and employees; when there were employers who acted in a bullying way and when there was no other solution but to call a strike. I do not take it amiss of hon. members opposite that they adopted the attitude they did adopt. Take for example the argument which the hon. member himself used, namely, that we already have trade unions which have provided in their constitutions that unless they receive support from 75 per cent of their members, there can be no strike. Here we have proof that the trade unions themselves are taking constitutional steps to abolish the right to strike completely. Is there a better argument for the abolition of this right than the fact that the trade union leaders and others who are responsible for the constitutions of such trade unions, are themselves indicating that the right to strike is something entirely of the past?</p>

<p>May I point out to hon. members that a strike is something which is not only unpopular with the workers but with the public as a whole. If a strike is called, the authority against whom the strike is aimed, is not affected. Other innocent bodies are affected by it, bodies which have nothing to do with the dispute. Take the case of any industry in the country, such as the dairy industry, or hospitals or any public service. If a strike is called, the authorities are not affected, but those innocent bodies which have nothing to do with the dispute are affected. For this reason the strike as a weapon has fallen more and more into disfavour with employees and the general public. Is my hon. friend opposite simply unable to appreciate or understand that fact?</p>

<p>Strikes are still a relic of the days when the strongest man governed and when there were no courts to which a man could appeal for the redress of his grievances. Can you imagine what the repercussions would be if employees had to resort to strikes to compel their employers to accede to their demands? In the past, however, there was no way to inform their employer of their grievances. But to-day that is no longer the case. The position is that a weak man no longer has to stand up to a strong man if he is attacked by the strong man. After all, there is a law which ensures that the rights of the weak are protected. Thus in these civilized times in which we are living, we have developed a set of industrial laws, one of which the hon. the Minister mentioned this afternoon and which forms part of the pattern, laws by means of which one can settle such disputes in the same way as they are settled when they exist between two persons. This system has worked so effectively and satisfactorily in respect of organized labour in the country that they do what my hon. friend has already mentioned and that is to lay down in their constitution provisions which make it practically impossible for any group of workers to strike provided they have such a constitution. Can my hon. friends not understand that that is something entirely of the past? Can they not understand that they are advocating something which is dangerous? Where in the past strikes were merely means which were used to settle a dispute between employer and employee, to-day they have assumed completely different proportions. The strike as a weapon to-day is a two-edged sword. to-day it is no longer a means which can only be used to air the rightful grievances of the workers. This is not the case in England or in America. No, it has become a very dangerous weapon. Hon. members ask why we are removing that dangerous two-edged sword. We are removing it because it is no longer used, although it is still available; it is a danger. One would not allow a two-edged sword to lie around in the House amongst people who are always arguing, because if one person becomes annoyed he may grasp it and hurt somebody else with it. In the same way the strike weapon to-day has become a weapon in the international sphere. Trade unions very easily become the prey of international organizations and this may lead to international hostility, which may also develop into political hostility. You may for example have political organizations which are too weak to send members such as those on this side and those on the other side, to Parliament, and the only way in which they can embarrass the Government is by creating disturbances. I think most hon. members in this House will agree with me that a very large number of the strikes over the past 30 years have to a large extent been political instruments. We must realize that we also have to deal here with the Bantu people whom we as guardians have to protect. Those people may easily become the victims of political organizations &#x2026;</p>

<p>The hon. member knows that the truth hurts. If I continue much longer I may hurt him even more. Is this not the time to issue a warning against that weapon because there are still hon. members opposite who want to retain that weapon? Hon. members must admit that the machinery which is at present available to employees and their organizations by this specific legislation is far better than that dangerous weapon which they had in the past, namely, the right to strike. I cannot remember one occasion on which the right to strike was applied in such a way that the workers could rightly say that because it was a successful instrument they wanted to retain it. If you have a weapon which is only dangerous and is ineffective in the settlement of disputes between employers and employees, then the time has come for us to remove that weapon. I want to appeal to the hon. gentlemen on that side to agree with me that the machinery which has been established for the workers is so efficient that no injustice can be done to them, unless the dispute is not brought to the attention of a properly instituted body which is able to say, &#x201C;You are right and you are wrong.&#x201D; Let us create such machinery so that we can eliminate every possible sign of trouble in our industrial and public life. We must not be so disinterested as to say that although it is not being used we must still retain it. We do not know whether the various trade unions will always be controlled by sensible people. The election of those people is not in our hands. The leadership of the various trade unions might very easily fall into the hands of careless people. When we, as the persons who are called upon to look after the interests of the country as a whole, appreciate that danger, we must not shrink from removing that danger.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is said that a country deserves the Opposition that it has but I do not think that South Africa deserves this Opposition. They remind me of a man who has lost his way in the forest; he keeps on walking in circles and he does not know how to get out. They are so lost in their own eloquence that they are unable to advance sound and strong arguments. I have attended many debates in this House over the years but I have never heard so many stupid utterances and so many hopeless arguments and seen so much confusion in their ranks as I have heard and seen to-day. Let me mention a few examples. I just want to say that as far as this provision in connection with strikes is concerned, they have advanced no argument as to why it should not be included and why it should not be retained. They talked about it and said that they were against it but not one of them advanced a counter-argument to refute my arguments as to why this provision should be inserted. However, this debate has produced one thing that is remarkable and which I cannot allow to pass without again drawing the attention of the House to it. I hope too that the newspapers, particularly the English-language newspapers which support the Opposition, will also take notice of this. I refer to the remarkable statement that we had to-day from the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn). We know that he is the main Opposition speaker on labour matters. He is also the first lieutenant of the Leader of the Opposition. We must assume therefore that when he speaks and makes a statement he does so on behalf of his party. What is remarkable is what he said this afternoon in connection with strikes. He wants to know how I can expect primitive and raw Native workers to have the right to strike. And yet they are the people who under their race federation plan propose to give those same raw and primitive Natives the right to be represented in this Parliament. It is significant that he made that statement to-day. I almost thought that the hon. member was preparing the way so that he could cross over to this side, because I do not think that we on this side have ever put it so strongly. As a matter of fact, I did not even use such an expression when I introduced the Natives (Settlement of Disputes) Act in 1953. I hope that he will adhere to it in future.</p>

<p>We have heard a good deal from them in the past few years in connection with the so-called labour policy. If I remember correctly the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell) said on various occasions that Native trade unions must be recognized and that Native employees must be recognized under the Industrial Conciliation Act. Yes, he did say it. But to-day the hon. member says that that Act which was passed by this Parliament ten years ago is an excellent measure and that it has worked excellently all these years. He says that that Act discouraged the Native trade unions. In other words, he is quite satisfied with that excellent Act&#x2014;and there I agree with him&#x2014;which has maintained industrial peace amongst the Native workers for ten years. He says it is an excellent Act, that it has worked well and is still working well to-day, that amongst other things it discourages Native trade unions, but in the past few years they have said repeatedly that they want Native trade unions to be recognized. How do they reconcile the two statements? I say therefore that they are like a man who has lost his way in the forest; they are going around in circles. One day they say one thing and the next day they say a different thing. I say that we have it on record that to-day their policy is as follows: In the first place Native workers must not have the right to strike. They adhere to that &#x2026;</p>

<p>Is it not pathetic that he now has to hedge and try to escape from what he said an hour or two ago? All Native employees are forbidden to strike. How can he expect primitive, raw Natives to have the right to strike? He made no exceptions. We must remember this new declaration of policy: Native employees may not go on strike. He stands by it; he speaks on behalf of his party. Secondly, they no longer want Native trade unions to be recognized because they say that the present machinery is working excellently; it is the right machinery. Incidentally, in 1953 they supported it. They say that this machinery is working excellently; Native trade unions must be discouraged; they must not be recognized, and Native employees must not be recognized either under the Industrial Conciliation Act, That is the statement of policy that we have had here this afternoon. We have it on record now. Does the hon. member for Wynberg agree with that? Mr. Speaker, is it not a pathetic phenomenon?</p>

<speech by="#russell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RUSSELL</person>:</from>

<p>I do not agree with your interpretation of what he said.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Now they come along again with talk about &#x201C;interpretations &#x201D;. I am convinced that an entirely different interpretation will be placed tomorrow of what the hon. member said. I think there will probably be a statement from the hon. member for Wynberg to explain what the hon. member for Yeoville really said and what he meant. This is the Opposition that South Africa earned! I do not think this country deserves it.</p>

<p>What is also peculiar is this: These hon. members now say to the trade unions in the railway service: &#x201C;We know what you ought to have; you are not man enough to say what you want; we are going to say what you should have; we are going to tell you what you should ask for; we know better.&#x201D; None of the speakers over there, except the hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton), has any experience of the trade union movement. None of them was ever a member of a trade union. None of them ever served on a trade union executive committee. They know nothing about it. But these are the people who say to the trade unions this afternoon: &#x201C;We say that that is what you ought to have; we say that that is in your best interests.&#x201D; The hon. member for Wynberg says that he cannot really accept that these trade unions quite voluntarily abandoned the so-called right which they had to strike. I say again that they have no right to strike. What happened in connection with these negotiations? A few years ago I told the staff associations who had asked for improvements to the conciliation machinery that they could submit proposals to me. Three of them submitted proposals to me. I then incorporated my own proposals in a draft bill, which is not quite the same as the one which is now before the House. I then sent this draft bill together with the proposals which I had received from the other few trade unions to all the trade unions, and I said to them: &#x201C;You can study it first.&#x201D; I gave them sufficient time; I gave them a month or two. I said to them: &#x201C;When you have studied it we will have discussions and then deal with this matter.&#x201D; I subsequently met all the staff associations&#x2014;not only the leaders, not the chairman or the president or the secretary but the whole executive committee which consists of 20 to 30 members. I met every staff association individually. And we then discussed the whole matter. I considered all their objections and the proposals put forward by them and accepted some of these proposals. The executive committee of every individual staff association fully discussed this matter with me. After I had discussed it with all seven staff associations I met the Federal Council to finalize this matter. The Federal Council consists of representatives of all the staff associations. At that Federal Council meeting I ended by saying that if there were perhaps any misgivings with regard to the wording of any particular provision, they had the right to discuss it with the Law Adviser, Mr. Conradie. The position is that of the seven staff associations, six supported the strike provisions of this Bill; they gave their full support to it. The seventh, the Artisans&#x2019; Staff Association, said that they accepted it for this reason that they realized that the railway service was an essential service. This is the only staff association which has a strike clause in its constitution. They said that they accepted it because they realized that the railway service was an essential service. Hon. members opposite now come along and say that they do not agree with that; that the railway service is not an essential service. The hon. member for Wynberg says that certain branches do constitute an essential service but not all of them. He mentioned one&#x2014;the catering service &#x2014;which is allegedly not an essential service. That is an argument which I cannot understand. I cannot understand how it can be accepted that the passenger bus service from Cape Town is an essential service and that it should fall under the provisions of Section 46 of the Industrial Conciliation Act but that the S.A. Railways Service, on which the entire economy of this country is dependent&#x2014;because if the Railways come to a standstill, South Africa comes to a standstill&#x2014;is not an essential service. Do you know what the trouble is, Sir? These hon. members are not concerned about the interests of South Africa. They are under the impression by opposing this clause, this strike provision, they can derive a little benefit for their party. That is the only reason. The hon. member for Wynberg has never been as uncomfortable as he was this afternoon when he had to defend his Party&#x2019;s case. He reminded me of an advocate who has to defend a murderer knowing that he is guilty.</p>

<p>Yes, then it was a just cause&#x2014;if he ever did so, which I doubt. He has never been so uncomfortable. If the railway service is an essential service then this provision is perfectly justified. If hon. members are able to prove that the railway service is not an essential service I am prepared to withdraw this provision. I challenge them to prove that the S.A. Railways do not constitute an essential service, but to say that they accept that the bus service from Cape Town is an essential service. Have you ever heard such stupidity, Mr. Speaker? I cannot understand how any sensible person who must have some degree of intelligence can advance such ridiculous arguments. Let me accept his argument that there are certain branches which do not perform essential services. The Artisans&#x2019; Staff Association was the only staff association whose constitution provided for strikes. Does the hon. member want to tell me that the work done by the artisans is not an essential service? He lacks the courage to reply. All he need say is &#x201C;yes&#x201D; or &#x201C;no &#x201D;. Does the hon. member contend that the work done by the artisans, in other words, the maintenance of all the rolling stock, the maintenance of aircraft, the manufacture of spare parts, is not an essential service? What is his reply?</p>

<p>But the hon. member&#x2019;s whole argument is based on the fact that it is a good thing to place a prohibition on strikes in the case of people who perform an essential service outside the Railways, but that such a prohibition should not be placed on the Railways. Why not? It is not an essential service!</p>

If they accept that the Railways do constitute an essential service &#x2014;and the same people who &#x201C;brag&#x201D; so much about the Industrial Conciliation Act which General Smuts&#x2019; Government allegedly passed in 1924 &#x2026;</p>

<p>Very well, let me correct it then.

Section 46 of that Act provides that employees in essential services may not strike. To this day they still accept and subscribe to that principle. If they admit that the Railways constitute an essential service what right and what justification have they for opposing this Bill?</p>

<p>What protection do they want? Against what do they want protection? What victimization can there be? Strikes are forbidden now; they are not allowed to strike. Is it the hon. member&#x2019;s wish that there should be protection for people who strike unlawfully? [Interjections.] I am putting my questions at this stage. The hon. member will have an opportunity again to reply because Mr. Speaker will not allow him to reply now. In the meantime he can write down these questions, and he can answer during the third reading debate. My question is this: What protection do they want? Do they want protection for people who strike unlawfully? What other protection is there? In terms of these provisions there is an excellent conciliation machinery which can be used. No protection is necessary. I say again that they can only argue against these provisions if they can prove that the Railways do not constitute an essential service. If they cannot prove that, however, then there is no substance in their argument. Six of the staff associations which represent the vast majority of the staff have never had a strike provision in their constitutions, but no notice is taken of that fact. There is only one staff association which has such a clause in its constitution and they are quite prepared to accept this Bill as it stands. The hon. member now asks me to postpone this Bill until the Artisans&#x2019; Staff Association has held its conference in March. Do you know what that means? It means that these hon. members have no confidence at all in the executive committees of those associations, because they are practically suggesting that they are not prepared to accept that those executive committees speak on behalf of their members. They want a congress to be held so that the members can say whether or not they agree with their executive committees. I hope the staff associations will take notice of the fact that the Opposition has no confidence in the executive committees of the staff associations. They do not believe them. They say, &#x201C;we do not believe that you speak on behalf of your members if you say that you are prepared to accept this legislation; we do not believe you; we have no confidence in you.&#x201D; I hope the staff associations will remember that. This Bill has been accepted by the staff associations; six of them support it enthusiastically. Only yesterday I received another telegram from one of the staff associations to assure me once again of their full support for this legislation. The seventh accepts it because they recognize and accept that the Railways constitute an essential service and that railway workers must be treated in the same way as workers outside the railways service who do perform an essential service. In exchange for this prohibition they are getting an improved conciliation machinery which is in their interests as well as in the interests of the Administration.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umhlatuzana completely choked in his own arguments. In the end I was unable to follow him. He said one thing which is really so ridiculous that I feel that I must bring it to the notice of the House again. He said, well, I say that the Railways constitute an essential service, but he says the difference between the Railways and the passenger bus service from Cape Town is this: A large quantity of rolling stock is manufactured for the Railways by private industries and if the Railways constitute an essential service, then all those industries are also essential services. Have you ever heard such a ridiculous argument? In other words, the manufacturers of the buses used in the bus service from Cape Town, which has all its buses manufactured by private industries and which has fallen under the provisions of Section 46 all these years, must also be regarded as providing essential services. How can one argue when people come forward with such ridiculous statements? For the rest, as I have said, he choked in his own arguments.</p>

<p>So much with regard to strikes. I think, Mr. Speaker, that the staff associations will be more grateful to the Opposition if they will leave matters of this kind, which intimately affect the staff associations, in their own hands. Leaders of the staff associations are capable men who at all times look after the interests of their members. If they had not been prepared to accept this provision, they would have said so. They would not have been afraid to do so. They are quite capable of looking after the interests of their members. If they are prepared to accept these provisions, then I think they are going to hold it very much against the Opposition that they adopted this attitude here to-day.</p>

<p>No, I did do my best at any rate to speak in English, to speak in such a way that the hon. member could understand me. I stated clearly that I had negotiated with all the staff associations and that they had expressed their agreement. More than that I could not say. I have merely been repeating what I said this afternoon. I am sorry that I did not go into this matter in greater detail this afternoon, otherwise I might have had their support perhaps. Because what must I infer from the interjection made by the hon. member for Wynberg? That if I had said all these things this afternoon they would not have put up this ridiculous opposition. I am expected to apologize now because I did not enlarge upon this matter in greater detail this afternoon!</p>

<p>Then there are just a few other matters which hon. members touched upon. The hon. member for Langlaagte (Mr. P. J. Coetzee) raised a matter which has nothing to do with this Bill, and that is in connection with the payment of the balance owing on a house purchased under the house ownership scheme. If the hon. member raises this matter again during the Budget debate, I can reply to it in detail.</p>

<p>The matter raised by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana in regard to representation of annuitants on the Superannuation Fund Board, is also a matter that has nothing to do with this Bill. If the hon. member raises that matter during the Budget debate, I will be quite prepared to reply to it. I do not think it is feasible and I do not think it will be acceptable to the staff, but if he raises the matter again, I will reply in more detail.</p>

<p>The hon. member also wanted an amendment to the Appeal Board regulations. That again is a matter that has nothing to do with this Bill. I know that he has one particular case in mind where the Board of Inquiry could not establish the charges, but where the officer concerned had found the servant guilty in regard to one charge. But that of course is an exception. There again, if the hon. member raises it during the Budget debate, I will be able to reply more in detail.</p>

<p>I believe I have dealt with all the points raised by hon. members, and I trust that after my explanation hon. members opposite will be prepared to support the Bill.</p>

<heading>AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE EXPORT AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<p>Fourth Order read: Second reading, &#x2014;Agricultural Produce Export Amendment Bill.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_agricultural_economics_and_marketing">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the object of this amendment is to facilitate the procedure in regard to the noting of appeal by an exporter against the decision of an inspector, and also to remove any doubt which might exist in regard to the legality of the present procedure. The Agricultural Produce Export Act, 1959 consolidates the legal provisions in regard to the prohibition of or regulation of the export of certain articles like, for example, potatoes, onions, eggs, cheese, butter, etc., and also makes further provision for the inspection and grading of agricultural products to be exported from the Republic.</p>

<p>Section 12 (1) of the aforementioned Act provides that&#x2014;-</p>

<block name="quote">If any person is aggrieved by any decision of or action taken by an inspector under this Act, the inspector shall, if required by such person, state in writing the reasons for his decision or action and the matter shall thereupon be referred to a board to be appointed by the Minister, subject to the deposit at his office by that person of such an amount as in the opinion of the Minister will be sufficient to defray the expenses which will necessarily be incurred by the board.</block>

<p>In the regulations providing for the grading of products intended for export the manner in which an appeal in terms of Section 12 (1) is to be noted is prescribed, the amount to be deposited in connection with such appeal, and other matters in regard to such appeal. Now, however, doubt exists as to whether the amount to be deposited in terms of Section 12 (1) may be prescribed by regulation. As Section 12 (I) reads at present, it would appear that in respect of every appeal the Minister <span class="col_597-598" refersTo="page_0313"/>must beforehand fix an amount which in his opinion will be sufficient to cover the costs. Such a procedure is very cumbersome and leads to delays, particularly in cases where appeals are noted in respect of perishable products which have already reached the ports, ready for shipping.</p>

<p>In the case of products which are inspected in terms of the Marketing Act of 1937 and the Fruit Export Act of 1957, the Acts concerned provide only that an appeal against the decision of the inspector may be noted in the way prescribed by regulation. This procedure works satisfactorily in practice, and it has therefore been decided to amend the Agricultural Produce Export Act of 1959 accordingly.</p>

<p>The provision in Section 12 (1) with reference to &#x201C;a board to be appointed by the Minister&#x201D; also results in practical problems and does not agree with the provisions of the Marketing Act, which provides only that the person or persons by whom an appeal is decided is prescribed by regulation.</p>

<p>Clause 1 of the Bill provides that the State President may issue regulations in regard to the time and the manner in which an appeal is to be noted, the way in which it should be dealt with, the person or persons who have to decide on such an appeal, the deposit which has to be made in regard to such an appeal, the circumstances under which the said deposit or portion of it may be refunded and any other matter concerning such an appeal. By prescribing these particulars by way of regulation, exporters are made <i>au fait</i> beforehand with the requirements for an appeal against the decision of an inspector, and such appeal can be instituted without delay.</p>

<p>Clause 2 of the Bill amends Section 12 of the principal Act to provide that the procedure in regard to an appeal may be prescribed by regulation.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the amendments contained in this Bill will bring the procedure in regard to noting an appeal against the decision of an inspector into line with the procedure applicable to the Marketing Act and the Fruit Export Act and will remove all doubt which may exist in regard to the existing procedure.</p>

<heading>NATURAL OIL AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<p>Fifth Order read: Second reading, &#x2014;Natural Oil Amendment Bill.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_mines">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<p>That the Bill be now read a second time. Briefly, this Bill aims at deleting two provisions contained in the Natural Oil Act, 1942, in so far as they are applicable to future prospecting leases for natural oil, namely&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) The obligation that portion of the prospecting rental paid to the State is to be paid over to the holder of the mineral oil rights; and</li>

<li>(b) the provision that such prospecting lease should be registered and noted on the deed of transfer and other deeds concerned.</li>

</ol>

<p>The proposed amendment emanates from certain developments which have taken place in the sphere of oil development. There are certain factors we have to take into consideration. Formerly the presence of oil was ascertained by boring. That was practically the only method. So we find, e.g., that in Australia 600 holes were bored before oil was discovered and could be developed on a commercial basis. In Canada 3,000 holes were sunk before oil was discovered which could be developed on an economic basis. We are aware of the fact that in the late &#x2019;thirties there was also prospecting for oil in the Republic. In the Karoo area an appreciable number of holes were bored unsuccessfully. to-day, however, prospecting for oil is quite a different proposition and it is tackled on a different basis. to-day the first step is not to bore but we ascertain by geophysical methods what the strata are in which oil may possibly occur; the seismograph and other various instruments are used to ascertain the possibilities, and only after that has been ascertained are boreholes sunk. Usually aircraft are used, with the result that to-day there is prospecting for oil without any physical investigation of the soil itself. It is done from the air, and only when it is ascertained that there may possibly be oil is physical occupation taken of the land and boreholes sunk.</p>

<p>There is another factor we should take into consideration, and that is that the cost of prospecting for oil is tremendously high. So we find that in Australia recently five holes were bored at a cost of &#x00A3;A2, 250,000. That is apart from the subsidy of &#x00A3;A500,000 paid by the Australian Government. This only confirms the further statement that to prospect for oil involves high costs.</p>

<p>I also mentioned that Australia subsidizes it, and that is done in many other countries also. Therefore, to prospect for oil involves a very great risk. It also takes a long time. Oil was recently discovered in Angola, but it took ten years from the time they started prospecting until an economic discovery was made. We must take these facts into account, therefore, viz. that it involves great costs and takes a long time and that there are many failures. In general, the opinion of the geologists is that in the Republic of South Africa the chances of discovering oil are not very great. I therefore say that the risk and the cost attached to it are very high, and it is <span class="col_599-600" refersTo="page_0314"/>because of that that these amendments are being introduced.</p>

<p>The first clause of this Bill provides for the abolition of the provision that in the case of prospecting leases granted in terms of Act 46 of 1942 a quarter of the rental paid to the State must be refunded to the holder of the mineral rights on that land. This may be the owner of the land, but in case he transferred his rights to another person in terms of some agreement, the latter is the holder of those rights. In view of certain geological and technical developments I have already mentioned, and as the result of the methods and the policy adopted in other countries, the approach to-day is to grant rights to prospect for natural oil over relatively extensive areas, and it is considered particularly advisable in a country like South Africa, where the discovery of natural oil will be of the greatest importance, that during the prospecting stage the emphasis should not be on the creation of sources of revenue for the State or for the owner of the oil rights, but rather to encourage as many people as possible to prospect for oil, <i>inter alia,</i> by levying a reasonable rental when application is made for a prospecting lease.</p>

<p>The result is that a relatively low rental is fixed for a large area which has the result that the division of the rental on a <i>pro rata</i> area basis is usually made between such a large number of persons that it is of little financial importance to the individual. In addition, it is impossible to remain <i>au fait</i> in regard to the names and addresses of the numerous holders of natural oil rights in respect of the various large and small pieces of land constituting such a large leased area and to whom these small amounts must be paid out periodically.</p>

<p>So, for example, the granting of a prospecting lease was approved of in principle some time ago over an area of approximately 5,000 square miles, at a rental which initially will amount to 10 cents per annum per square mile. The holder of the mineral rights in respect of a piece of land of one square mile inside this area will therefore receive only 2&#x00BD;c per annum as his share of the rental. Other areas in respect of which the granting of prospecting leases have also been approved in principle are even greater than that. There are, however, many pieces of land situated in the proposed prospecting areas which are much smaller than one square mile, and in respect of which a <i>pro rata</i> division of the rental will therefore result in an even greater absurdity.</p>

<p>Nor are there sound reasons why the holder of the ore rights should, during the prospecting stage, be compensated by receiving portion of the rental. If no oil is found and removed, he suffers no damage. If oil is in fact found and developed, he will be compensated as provided for in Section 7 of the Act, namely by the payment to him of one-quarter of the amount received by the State as its share of the profits or royalties, and which will in fact be a much larger amount than the prospecting rental. It is therefore to the advantage of the owner if the prospecting leads to the discovery of oil.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that the payment of one-quarter of the rental during the prospecting stage bears no relation to surface damage or surface use by the prospector, and that separate provision is made for the payment of damages and of rental or other compensation in that regard in Section 4 (3) (f) of the principal Act, and in Section 12 (g) of Act No. 39 of 1942 as applied to natural oil by Section 9 (1) of the principal Act. If there is physical occupation compensation will be paid.</p>

<p>This amendment will not affect prospecting leases which have already formally been entered into. At the moment there is only one such lease in force over a small area, and it would not be fair now to stop payment to the holders of the rights to the natural oil of one-quarter of the rental already being received.</p>

<p>In regard to Clause 2 of the Bill, the position is briefly that in terms of Section 15 of the Base Minerals Amendment Act, No. 39 of 1942, as applied by Section 9 of the principal Act to natural oil, prospecting and mining leases, and also certain other rights granted in connection with natural oil, must be registered by the Registrar of Mining Titles, and that the granting of such rights must also be noted by the Registrars of Deeds concerned on the deeds of transfer or other deeds.</p>

<p>The Registrar of Mining Titles must inform the Registrars of Deeds of the registration, and instruct the holder of the transfer deeds or other deeds to transmit these documents to him for submission to the Registrar of Deeds concerned.</p>

<p>Also in this respect we are faced with the difficulty that literally thousands of pieces of land, which must be regarded as separate entities, are included in the large prospecting areas envisaged, and that it is therefore an impossible task to comply with these legal requirements. In addition, the prospecting leases are of a strictly temporary nature and a prospector may abandon large portions of his prospecting area shortly after having been granted the lease, for example, where preliminary geophysical surveys indicate that those areas hold no promise.</p>

<p>Registration of a prospecting lease for natural oil against the title deeds&#x2014;or the absence of such registration&#x2014;are also not of much use as an indication that the land is hypothecated or not. On the one hand the position is that with the geophysic and other prospecting methods applied, it may happen that the surface of many of these pieces of land constituting the prospecting area is not interfered with physically, i.e. by boreholes or excavations. On the other hand again, the absence of a notation on a person&#x2019;s title deed is no indication or guarantee at any given time that a prospecting lease for natural oil has not been granted over his land at that <span class="col_601-602" refersTo="page_0315"/>moment. The right to grant prospecting leases for natural oil rests exclusively with the State, and hon. members will realize that it is not practically possible individually to approach the thousands of interested parties whose land is included in a large prospecting area in regard to the matter.</p>

<p>Other, also important, prospecting leases granted in respect of some of our other minerals are not registered against the title deeds of the particular bit of land concerned, and in view of the fact that in the case of natural oil that does not appear to be necessary either &#x2014;but particularly because it is not possible to do so in respect of the thousands of pieces of land concerned&#x2014;this requirement is now deleted.</p>

<p>Mining leases for natural oil. as contrasted with prospecting leases, which from the very nature of the matter will be granted over much smaller pieces of land will, however, still have to be registered and the registration noted on the title deeds. This is, briefly, the effect of the proposed amendments and I now move that this Bill be read a second time.</p>

<speech by="#taurog">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAUROG</person>:</from>

<p>On a casual survey of this Bill now before us, one gains the impression that owners of ground throughout the country are going to suffer a deprivation of rights, and are going to be deprived of certain rentals which in the ordinary course of events would accrue to them. But, Sir, on a closer investigation of the matter and after listening to the hon. the Minister. I find that there is justification for the introduction of this Bill. I say that, because in dealing with prospecting for natural oil, we must see the problem in a different light to that of prospecting for practically every other mineral as has been done in this country.</p>

<p>The main fundamental difference is this, Sir, that as far as natural oil is concerned, the right to prospect and mine for natural oil is vested in the State, and in the State only. That is the difference between prospecting for oil and for other minerals such as gold, copper, uranium, aluminium, diamonds, and so on. The suggestion now before us, as contained in this Bill, gives encouragement to prospectors in this country to investigate the possibility of natural oil in this country. In recent years we have heard of requests from mining houses for encouragement from the Government to carry out prospecting, not only for natural oil, but for all other minerals. I think that the step now being taken by the Government in this Bill is one step on that road to encourage further prospecting and development.</p>

<p>The important factor that must be realized is that this Bill only affects the question or rentals during prospecting operations. When one realizes that, according to recent reports, an area of approximately 125,000 sq. miles is to be investigated by certain companies, and that the rentals for that area would be approximately 1c per sq. mile per year as stated by the Minister, then of the total rental accruing to the State of only approximately R 1, 250 per year, one-quarter would accrue to the owners of the ground namely R318&#x00B1;. That spread over possibly tens of thousands or more owners of land, would be an infinitesimal amount that would accrue to each owner. The cost that would be involved to the State in corresponding with these people, making personal contact with them, and eventually getting any conditions registered against their titles, would certainly not be justified in view of these figures that I have quoted.</p>

<p>As will be realized, it is impossible to comply with the present legal provisions. It is too costly and too cumbersome, and the revenue that would accrue is certainly not justified as against the expense that would be involved.</p>

<p>The owners of ground who may suffer some deprivation of rentals under this Bill, can rest assured that they will be adequately protected by the conditions provided in the original Bill, and which were laid down in 1942 under a very vigilant and a very good Government! Should mining activities eventually take place on any part of the area prospected, that would boil down to a very much smaller area than the area that was originally prospected on. The owners of that smaller area will then receive the benefit of royalties, or share of profits, or any other considerations that accrues to the Government, in the proportion of one-quarter of that amount accruing to the Government.</p>

<p>In order to enable early prospecting to take place, it is a fair request to make to landowners, that they should sacrifice this very small, infinitesimal share of the rentals, in order to share in the possibility of mining for oil on their property.</p>

<p>There is one suggestion I would like to put to the Minister in this regard. Whatever the saving in rentals that is going to accrue to the State by the introduction of this Bill, that saving should accrue to the owners of the ground on which mining activities may eventually take place. Therefore my suggestion to the hon. Deputy Minister is that he should give consideration to his point of view; or alternatively, if that is going to be administratively too difficult, that the money that the State will now be saving in respect of these rentals, should be given in the form of a bursary to some member of the Fuel Research Board in order to carry out further investigations in this field.</p>

<p>Sir, when one realizes that the area to be covered under the prospecting lease as stated by the Minister, could stretch from Cape Town in the south, to Prieska in the north, and practically to Durban in the east, then one realizes what tremendous possibilities there are afoot for this country. And I am one of those who believe that there is a distinct possibility of finding oil in certain areas of this country.</p>

<p>I would like it to be a promise, but I cannot take it at his stage any further than that. In view, however, of the advance <span class="col_603-604" refersTo="page_0316"/>in modern methods of geophysical and aerial survey that is now available to us in prospecting for oil, I think that this measure is one that is well justified, and under the circumstances, it will receive the support of this side of the House.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>I am very grateful to the hon. member for supporting this amending Bill. I think we should welcome this Bill. The search for natural oil is of great strategic value to us, oil is a great asset, and in the two clauses of the Bill before us there is nothing detrimental to the owners of the land. It contains no provisions for expropriation, there is no talk of confiscation, existing rights are fully recognized, and provision is made, as in the 1942 Act, for thorough investigation. No plundering of or injudicious damage to the agricultural value of the land will take place, and seeing that the State will exercise control it will see to it that no irresponsible persons prospect there. In other words, we can be sure that thorough prospecting will take place under State supervision, and that it will be done by experts. We therefore support this Bill and we think it is a good one. The same principles contained in the 1942 Act apply and they are not being changed in any way. It is simply an improvement on the 1942 Act.</p>

<speech by="#ross">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>There are two points that I should like to raise with the hon. Deputy Minister. If I understood him correctly, if a land-owner is one of the lucky ones and oil is found, then he is going to be compensated amongst other things for any damage to his land on the surface, but I did not gather whether the man whose land is bored on with no success will receive compensation for any damage suffered by him to his surface installations or crops. I am mentioning this, because in years gone by on the Reef, we know of certain instances where bulldozers went into standing crops of mealies just to start a goldmine. It might well be that in prospecting over hundreds of thousands of miles, a man might suffer damage if oil is not found. I would just like the Minister&#x2019;s assurance that that man too will receive compensation. The second point is vastly more important. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he has the authority to grant prospecting leases for oil in a Bantustan, such as the Transkei, and if so, to whom the oil deposits, if any, will belong.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_mines">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Springs (Mr. Taurog) expressed the thought that portion of the revenue collected by the State from prospecting leases should be devoted to granting bursaries to promote oil research. I can only say that any fees charged or funds collected in this way will be relatively small because it is regarded as being practically just a further obligation on that person to do something; apart from the provisions of the prospecting contract in terms of which it is his duty to do prospecting, this really compels him to do so. There are costs connected with the matter, and if he does nothing there is in fact an expenditure and, a duty resting upon him. But this money goes to the State, to the fiscus. It is not paid to the Department of Mines, and there is ample provision for research, fuel research, metallurgical research, and also for bursaries. There is ample provision for research and I think it would be wrong in principle to say that portion of this revenue must be used for a specific purpose. Right throughout the policy is that any revenue derived in this way goes directly to the Treasury.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Ross) raised the question in regard to the question of compensation. I think I have stated clearly that when there is physical occupation the owner is compensated for any damage done or for any physical occupation. If buildings are erected, the owner is entitled to rental. In the mining contracts provision is also made for that, and conditions are set to protect forestry activities, game reserves, the surface of the soil, streams, crops, etc. Therefore there are conditions which fully protect the owner if there is physical occupation of the land. The hon. member also asked what the position was in the Transkei.</p>

<p>Clause 2 of this Bill provides that the State has the right to prospect for and to develop oil in the Republic. The State has the sole right to do so. At this stage that is still the position, and I do not think it is necessary to answer any hypothetical questions in that regard.</p>

<p>This is a nice little Bill. Before the war it was decided to fill up a large portion of Table Bay and to create a new part of Cape Town. It was always agreed that this new part of Cape Town would become part of the Municipality of Cape Town, although it belonged to the Government. In the course of time various functions in this new area were handed over to the Municipality of Cape Town, functions such as the control of traffic and various other similar functions. Then the Cape Town Municipality came along and said that, that being the case, they must be allowed to levy rates. We said that that was fine, they could levy rates. Then the Divisional Council came along and said they were allowed to levy rates on all municipal properties.</p>

<p>Yes, perhaps it is a shame, but they do it; but I am surprised at the hon. member saying it is a shame seeing that he was a member of the Divisional Council for a long time. But according to the original Act the Divisional Council was not allowed to levy rates on the Foreshore. Well, that was obviously unfair, so now under this Bill we give the Divisional Council of the Cape the right to levy rates on the Foreshore area which has been incorporated in the Municipality of Cape Town. They can levy rates on any property from 1964 that has been transferred to a private owner on the Foreshore, and in certain other areas which are let on lease. There is only one area, in fact, which has been let on 75 years&#x2019; lease. On that they will also be able to levy rates as from a date to be fixed by me. In this case it is a garage which has been built there and we only want them to levy rates from such time as that garage is built, but anyone taking transfer of the ground&#x2014;then the rates will be levied as from 1964. The garage will probably only be completed subsequent to 1964, and I think it is only fair that the rates should be levied on that from the time the garage is completed. That is all that is contained in this Bill and I would like the House to accept it.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is also a simple little Bill which I can recommend. The principal Act provides that we can give local authorities the right to make regulations over those portions of the beach adjoining their area of jurisdiction, whether the beach belongs to them or not. That means that if a local authority, a municipality or town council or health committee own a beach they can make regulations covering that area. If they do not own it. we can grant them the right to make regulations for that portion of the beach also, so as to see that everything there is properly regulated. In the case where the beach belongs to the local authority, it can make the same regulations which are applicable to the beach applicable also to the adjoining area which belongs to it; i.e., if a beach belongs to a local authority it can frame regulations for that beach and make them applicable also to any adjoining land which belongs to that authority. There are only a few cities and towns in South Africa which own the beaches, like Cape Town, Durban and I think also Port Elizabeth, and they can make the regulations applying to the beach applicable also to the adjoining land, and it is very necessary that they should do so. People go to swim and camp there and it is necessary to apply the regulations also to the adjoining land. But if the beach does not belong to them, but to the State, and we give them the right to make regulations for that beach then, in terms of the old Act they do not have the right to make those regulations applicable <i>mutatis mutandis</i> also to the adjoining land which does not belong to them.</p>

<p>Now Scottburgh in Natal approached us and asked us to transfer the beach to them. We said it was not desirable that the State should transfer beaches to local authorities. But they wanted us to transfer it to them so that they could apply the regulations applicable to the beach also to the land adjoining it, something which they could not do in terms of the existing Act. Now all we ask here is that in this case we should be able to give the same right to a local authority, subject to the approval of the Administrator, where the beach does not belong to them, to frame regulations for that beach and to make the same regulations applicable to their own adjoining areas. It is very simple and very desirable and necessary that they should have the right to make those regulations, and I recommend it.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>However, I am not going to break the even flow of agreement and we will support the Government in regard to this Bill. In regard to Clause 1, I heartily agree that the powers of the local authority should be vested in a body such as the National Parks Board of Trustees. The Minister did not say a word about that, but I am sure he will not mind me replying to his thoughts. The position here, I take it, is associated with the Tsitsikama coastal reserve, where the local authority has certain powers, and it is quite clear that in this Bill we are giving those same powers to the National Parks Board of Trustees, and I think that is how it should be.</p>

<p>With regard to the second clause, in regard to Scottburgh, that is in my own constituency and it is true that great difficulty did arise because the area of recreation at the beach is not merely the area below high-water mark, the area in respect of which the Minister can make regulations; but the area of recreation is above high-water mark and there is no means of seeing precisely where the high-water mark is along that area of recreation. So when a certain amount of horseplay and roughness developed from time to time, and there have <span class="col_607-608" refersTo="page_0318"/>been minor infringements of the by-laws which called for some little action, and the civic authorities attempted to deal with this matter by means of warnings, because they did not really want to get people into trouble they found themselves in the difficulty that the people concerned very often said: What has it got to do with you? We are on the beach. Then the thing went a stage further and the municipality felt that they would have to take action and make an example of some of these people, but when they tried to bring a case to court, they found themselves caught on that precise point from the legal point of view, because the first thing the prosecutor wanted to know was where this misdemeanour took place; was it in the area on the foreshore governed by the Minister&#x2019;s regulations or above the high-water mark in the area of jurisdiction of the local authority? To get evidence on a point of that kind is virtually impossible. After trying to institute prosecutions three or four times, they decided rather to drop the whole thing and representations were then made to the Department of Lands. I think the Scottburgh case probably triggered this provision in the Bill, but as the Minister has said, there are other local authorities which are more or less in the same position, and this provision will settle that position once and for all. I think this is a very good way out of the difficulty.</p>
